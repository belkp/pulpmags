preconceived notions about what they can do take salesmanship for instance to the vast majority a salesman has to be born to his task nothing could be further from the truth it is a vicious fallacy that has kept thousands of men from enjoying the good things enumerated in the panel above possibly you too think that selling is a gift you cannot be blamed for what you think-- but you are utterly

literary editor editorial and general offices   park place new york n y extravagant fiction today ------- cold fact tomorrow impossible facts by  hugo gernsback often while reading one of our modern scien- tifiction tales we are wont to explode at some highly impossible plot concocted by some ingenious author and often we receive a let- ter from some reader who vents his opinion in no uncertain terms that such and such a thing cannot be within the realms of possibility as we mentioned several times it is difficult to ascertain today just what is possible and what impossible for the most impossible things have become commonplaces before condemning anything as impossible therefore we should be most careful and a lot more tolerant than we are some of the most recently improbable things are now facts for instance if some one should come along and tell you a wild tale about ice boiling hot you would probably laugh at him nevertheless professor p w bridgman of the carnegie institute in washington while subjecting water to a pressure of  pounds to the square inch found that under such tremendous pressure water first becomes solid turning into ice although it is nearly boiling hot not only is this impossibility a fact but we all know and have been taught that water can not be com- pressed very much just the same dr bridgman has com- pressed water to  per cent of its original volume when you stand in the hot sun you are pretty sure that our luminary is sending down a goodly quantity of heat which makes it so uncomfortable for you on a hot summer day tell the man on the street that the sun sends abso- lutely no heat to the earth and he will be ready to entrust you to an alienist nevertheless the impossible fact re- mains that the earth receives no heat whatsoever from the sun because the earth and sun are both immersed in a vacuum if you have ever seen a vacuum bottle you know that no heat can be transmitted through a vaccum if you do not believe this statement go to the top of a snow-capped mountain where you are nearer the sun than at sea level and you will find that instead of the air being much hotter there it is much cooler that is so because the sun sends us not heat rays but light rays which light rays are trans- formed into heat when they strike a physical body such as our atmosphere which then retains the heat but five miles above the surface of the earth on the hottest summer day the temperature is below freezing it is impossible for a living being to live for any length of time without food how long can a living being go without food four years impossible you say never- theless a number of bugs can live nearly four years without taking any food whatsoever--an impossible fact but true even a snake can live two years without food which brings us to an inquiry from one of our authors who wishes to know if it is possible for life to go on without atmosphere our answer to that question is yes just because a human being or any other living creature on earth can not live without air--that is without oxygen diluted with nitro- gen--it does not mean that life on some other planet or even on our earth is impossible without air we know that nature has the peculiar trick of adapting living organisms to practically any conditions it is possible to freeze fish and keep them frozen for months after which they can be thawed out and revived it would seem to us therefore that some form of life is certainly possible without air what this form of life would be we have no way of knowing such a creature would in all probability have neither flesh nor blood but that does not preclude the possibility of its existence most insects have no flesh or blood for that mat- ter but they manage to get along very well indeed recent observations on our satellite the moon have given indications that although it is devoid of practically all atmosphere signs of life have appeared here and there if there is life on the moon and i for one really believe there is then whatever life there is must go on with prac- tically no air furthermore to aggravate the case that particular form of life must pass through a rather uncomfortable cycle every few weeks in the first cycle the moon is subject to a gen- erous amount of heat wherever the sun's rays strike the surface of the moon--only to be plunged into the most ter- rific cold imaginable when the sun sinks below the horizon because the moon has no atmosphere the little heat which is absorbed by the rocks or the ground vanishes almost im- mediately after the sun stops shining and the cold of inter- stellar space sets in we do not know what form of life can survive such a terrific and sudden change of climate but it is quite likely that there are creatures evolved for such an existence also if there are such beings the possibility of any circulatory system in their bodies is remote be- cause such liquids surging through their bodies would of necessity be frozen during the cold period but perhaps we are wrong here too maybe there are such liquids and such a circulatory system if the creature freezes during one cycle perhaps it is thawed out in the hot period and life goes on the same as it does on earth if it is possible for living creatures to live at the bottom of the ocean under a tremendous pressure of as high as  pounds to the square inch then it is very likely possible for life to exist under worse circumstances mr hugo gemsback speaks every monday at  p m from wrny on various scientific and radio subjects  a columbus of space by  garrett p serviss author of the moon metal the second deluge etc we watched the meteors out of the windows while edmund kept guard at the peep-hole we must have come almost within striking distance of a thousand in the course of an hour but edmund decided not to diminish his speed  a columbus of space  chapter i a marvelous invention edmund stonewall was the most ingenious man that ever lived in my private opinion he was the greatest human being that has ever appeared on this earth i say this de- spite the fact that against my will and without my knowledge at the start he took me and two of our friends in common on the wildest craziest most impossible and incredible adventure that ever imagination conceived i ought to hate edmund stonewall for what he did to me and to my friends but in fact i rever- ence his memory let me tell you the story and then you will see the reason that underlies my feeling toward him in the first place he made the most wonderful invention that ever the world heard of in fact until now the world never has heard all about it and i shudder yet when i think of it it was of course based on electricity for every- body knows now that electricity is at the bottom of everything it came out of that discovery which made so much excitement at the beginning of the twentieth century--radioactivity what is radioactivity heaven only knows but it came near being the death of me it has robbed me of my dearest friends and i don't know but that if stonewall had kept on it might have put a finish to this old earth of ours stonewall was always bothering himself about power and energy and what not he knew machinery and engines as a boy knows craps and marbles but he was dissatisfied with everything men are fools he said they might be like gods they ought to run the globe and steer it where they like you remember the old keeley motor well edmund believed in it but said keeley had got hold of the wrong end and would never make it go that way all the while he was ex- perimenting himself he had money from a rich uncle i guess and he built himself a laboratory and once in a while he would invite jack ashton henry darton will church and me to come and watch some of his experiments it was all greek to us but it never failed to make us stare we saw some wonderful things there that people knew nothing about edmund took up tesla too with his communication with mars idea but after a while he dropped that and then came radioactivity radium and thorium and atomic energy when the discovery of radium in uranium ore and other things came out the rest of us would never have known anything about it but for this story is a classic by the well-known scientist and writer professor serviss it is one of the first real scientific space-flying stories ever written and remains one of the best the story was originally published in  and caused a small sensation at that time about that time radium and atomic energy theories came into public vogue and this gave a great impetus to the imagination even today seventeen years after the story was first published it remains a scientific masterpiece it being unnecessary to make any corrections whatsoever to bring it up to date with true prophetic vision professor serviss has penned a masterpiece that will remain so for generations to come there is not a paragraph which is not packed full of in- terest this story will keep you in constant suspense edmund we used to skip that part in the papers and i can't say that his explanation made it much clearer but anyhow he made the thing very in- spiring to our imagination listen to this boys he said to us here's professor thomson declaring that a single grain of hydrogen contains in its padlocked atoms enough energy to lift a million tons three hundred yards high but professor thomson doesn't know how to get at the energy and neither does professor rutherford nor lord kelvin but somebody has got to get at it and i guess it will have to be me but what would you do with it if you got it edmund asked jack in his good-natured drawling manner edmund's eyes shone strangely but he replied only i would do what archimedes dreamed of none of us knew anything about the dreams of archimedes and we dropped the subject but edmund stonewall did not drop it he simply went to work at it he used to be at our club every evening but after he got this new idea we would not see him for weeks on end and when we did see him he was as mum as an oyster but what a look he had in those deep eyes somehow with all his eccentricity we never connected the idea of craziness with stonewall he was different from other human beings that was all one evening after a long absence edmund sud- denly turned up at the club and mighty glad we were to see him we couldn't understand his talk half the time but it charmed us just the same we never laughed at his extraordinary ideas there was a depth in him that awed us this time he showed an animation that we had never noticed before well boys he said shaking hands all round i've got it got what drawled jack the interatomic ener- gy under control i've ar- rived where a certain professor duncan dreamed of being when he wrote that when man knows that every breath of air he draws has contained within itself power enough to drive the work- shops of the world he will find out some day some- how some way of tapping that energy i've tapped it indeed said jack well as i asked you once before what are you going to do with it i have just been telling you that we never thought of making fun of any of stonewall's ideas but there was something so extravagant in his words and manner that we all fell into jack's half-bantering mood and united in demanding yes edmund tell us what you are going to do with it  unintentionally we nettled him and without knowing it we probably laid the foundation for the astounding thing that happened to as he did not  amazing stories reply for a moment while his eyes flashed and his face darkened then he said slowly if you will come over to the laboratory i'll show you what i am going to do with it a talk at the club nothing could have suited us better ever since edmund had shut himself away we had been curious to know what he was up to we all got our hats and walked over to the laboratory he led us directly into the back yard which we were surprised to find walled and roofed so as to form a huge shanty edmund opened the door and ushered us inside i tell you we were startled by what we saw in the center of the place was the queerest-looking thing you can imagine it was not anything that i can well describe i will call it a car for that is what it most resembled it was about eighteen feet long and ten feet high and broad round like a boiler with bulging ends it seemed to be made of polished steel edmund opened a door in the end step in he said and unhesitatingly we obeyed him all except church who was always a skeptical fellow and who for some reason remained outside edmund turned on an electric light and we found ourselves in an oblong chamber beautifully fitted up with fancy wood and with leather-cushioned seats all round the sides the walls shone with polished knobs and handles sit down said edmund and i'll tell you what i've got here then missing church he called out to him to come in but there was no answer we concluded that church thinking the thing would be too deep to be interesting had gone back to the club ed- mund presently resumed as i told you a little while ago i've solved the mystery of the atoms i've power illimitable at my command if i chose to build the right sort of apparatus i could drive this old planet of ours against the moon and wreck it but i'm not going to damage anybody or anything i'm simply going to try a little experiment excuse me a moment thereat he stepped outside and we looked at one another wondering but still having too much con- fidence in edmund to really set him down in our minds as unbalanced we rather thought that he was going to show us some wonderful thing as he used to do in the laboratory something we couldn't understand but that would be interesting to look at we were not prepared for what followed we heard edmund outside in the shanty making a noise that sounded like the opening of a barn door then he reappeared entered the car and closed its door we watched him with growing curiosity there was an odd smile on his face as he reached at and touched a polished knob instantly we felt that the car was rising it rocked a little like a boat in wavy water we were startled but not frightened a visit to edmund stonewall's laboratory well edmund what kind of a balloon is this jack asked in his careless way it's considerable more than a balloon was the short reply we saw him touch another knob and felt that the car had come to rest though it still rocked gently then edmund unlocked a shutter at one side and disclosed a many-paned window of thick glass we all sprang to our feet and looked out below us were roofs and the tops of trees we're about two hundred feet up said edmund what do you think of it wonderful wonderful we all exclaimed but persisted jack what are you going to do with it again edmund's eyes flashed and he said you'll see the scene out of the window was beautiful the city lights were nearly all below our level and away off over the new jersey horizon i noticed the planet venus near to setting and as brilliant as a diamond i am something of a star-gazer and i called ed- mund's attention to the planet as he happened to be standing beside me fine isn't she he said finest world in the solar system and schiaparelli says she's got two sides to her one side always daylight and the other always night i was surprised at his exhibition of astronomic lore for i had never known that he had given any attention to the subject but a moment later all this was forgotten for edmund suddenly pushed us back from the window and closed the shutter going down again so soon asked jack a little banteringly as before edmund smiled going he said simply and put his hand on one of the knobs pressing it gently we felt ourselves moving very slowly that's right edmund jack put in again let us down easy i don't like bumps annihilating gravity we all expected at every instant to feel the car touch the cradle from which it had started but we were mistaken what really did happen can better be described in the words of will church who you will remember had been left outside in the shanty i got the account from him long after- ward he had written it out and put it in a safe as a sort of historic document here is church's narrative omitting the intro- duction which read like a lawyer's brief when we went over from the club to stone- wall's laboratory i dropped behind the others because the four of them took up the full width of the sidewalk stonewall was talking to them and my attention was attracted by some- thing uncommon in his manner i can't de- scribe it very well but there was an indefinable carriage of the head which suggested to me the thought that everything was not exactly as it should be i don't mean that i thought him crazy or anything of that kind but i was convinced that he had some scheme in his mind to fool us i bitterly repented when things turned out as they did that i had not whispered a word in the ears of the others but that would have been difficult and besides i didn't think that the a columbus of space  matter was anything serious nevertheless i determined to stay out of it so that the laugh should not be on me at any rate accordingly when the others entered the car i kept away and when stonewall called me i did not answer as he closed the door of the car for the first time the impression came to me that it might be something serious but it was then too late to interfere i was greatly astonished when with- out the slightest apparent reason the car began to rise in the air i hadn't taken it for anything in the nature of a balloon and this wasn't the kind of practical joke i was looking for though if i had not been so stupid i might have guessed it when i saw stonewall open the roof of the shanty it was with much trepidation that i saw the thing which really looked diabolical with its polished sides glinting in the electric light rise silently through the roof and float mysteriously upward i felt relieved when it stopped at a height of a couple of hundred feet and i said to myself that they would soon drop down again and perhaps after all they would turn the laugh against me for being afraid a narrative of one of the participators but in a little while the car began to move again slowly rising and shining like some mail-clad monster in the light of the arc- lamps below an indefinable terror commenced to creep over me and i shivered as i watched the thing it moved very deliberately and in five min- utes had not risen more than five hundred feet suddenly it made a dart and seemed to shoot skyward then it circled like a strange bird taking its bearings and rushed off westward until i lost sight of it behind some tall build- ings i ran out into the street but could not catch sight of it again they were gone i almost sank upon the pavement in my helpless excitement a police- man was passing officer officer i said have you seen it seen what asked the bluecoat twirling his club the car--the balloon i stammered i ain't seen no balloon i guess yer drunk ye'd better git along home there was no use trying to explain matters to him so i entered the shanty again and sat down on the supports on which the car had rested i remained a long time staring up through the opening in the roof and hoping against hope to see them come back it must have been midnight before i finally went home sorely puzzled in mind bitterly blaming myself for having kept my suspicions unuttered i got to sleep but i had horrible dreams the next day i was up early looking through all the papers in the hope of finding something about the mysterious car but there was not a word i watched for several days with the same result i cannot describe my feelings my friends seemed to have been snatched away by some mystic agency and the horror of the thing almost drove me crazy then members of their families--luckily none of them were married-- began to come to me with inquiries what could i say still believing that they would come back i invented a story that they had gone off on a hunting expedition but when a week had passed and then two weeks without any news i was in despair i had to give them up remembering how near we were to the coast i concluded that they had drifted over the ocean and gone down it was hard for me after the lie i had told to let the truth out at last the authorities took the matter up and ran- sacked stonewall's laboratory and the shanty without finding anything to throw light on the mystery after a while the sensation died out the papers ceased to talk about it and i was left to my loneliness and my regrets a year has now passed with no news i write this on the anniversary of their departure my friends i know are dead--somewhere what an experience it has been when your friends die and you see them buried it is hard enough but when they disappear in a flash and leave no token behind it is almost beyond endurance chapter ii a trip of terror i take up the story from the point where i dropped it as minute after minute elapsed and we con- tinued to move we changed our minds and con- cluded that the inventor was going to give us a longer ride than we had anticipated we weren't alarmed for the car traveled so easily that it gave one a feeling of confidence but we were a little indignant to think that edmund should treat us like a lot of boys without minds or wills of our own see here said jack at length i'd be obliged if you'd tell us just what you're about i've no objection to making a little trip in your car which is certainly mighty comfortable but i'd at least like to be asked whether i want to go or not edmund made no reply but busied himself with his knobs first he pressed one and then another suddenly we were all jerked off our feet as if we had been in a trolley with a green motorman at the handle we felt ourselves spinning through space at a fearful rate still edmund said not a word but while we staggered to our feet and steadied our- selves with hands and knees on the leather-cushioned benches like so many drunken men he clung to his knobs and pushed and twisted the car slowed down then and the motion became more regular the beginning of a lecture excuse me said edmund quite in his nat- ural manner the thing is a little new yet and i've got to learn the stops by experience but there's no occasion for alarm maybe there isn't replied jack but will you  amazing stories be kind enough to answer my question and tell us what you're about and where we're going i'd rather like to know henry and i felt our indignation rising and henry broke out see here i've had enough of this if you can't tell us what it all means just go down and let me out i decidedly object to being carried off in this manner against my will and knowledge by this time edmund seemed to have got things in the shape he wanted and he turned to face us he always had a magnetism that was inexplicable and we felt it then as never before his features were perfectly calm but there was a light in his eyes that seemed electric it was my first intention he said to make this expedition alone in case i couldn't persuade you to go along but you provoked me a while ago and i made up my mind that i'd take you anyway i'm not going to do you any harm and you'll thank me for it before we're through but where do you propose to take us asked jack who had rather more self-command than the rest of us i'll show you replied edmund and that for the time being was all that we could get out of him there was manifestly no use in making a fuss we knew nothing about the management of the car and couldn't even understand what the power was that moved it edmund's talk about interatomic energy was to us like calculus to schoolboys we were in his hands and depended absolutely upon him he could do what he liked with us if we had overpowered him what should we have done next i saw that the only possible thing was to humor him besides knowing him as we did i couldn't feel that he meant to bring us to any harm as i have told you we never thought him crazy and we didn't think so then he evidently knew exactly what he was about and we had to trust to him whether we wished to or not as i turned the thing over in my mind i became calmer i thought that we could get something out of edmund by quietly showing some interest and questioning him about the machine what are all these knobs edmund i asked they control the driving power he replied in perfect good humor but like a schoolmaster ad- dressing pupils who he knows cannot entirely fol- low him i push or turn one way and we go i i push or turn another way and we stop or go back so i concentrate the atomic power just as i choose it makes us go or it holds us motion- less or it carries us back to earth according to the way i apply it the earth is what i kick against and what i hold fast by any other body in space would serve the same purpose as to the machinery you'd need an education in such things to understand it you'd have to study the whole subject from the bottom up and go over the experiments that i have made i confess that there are some things the fundamental reason for which i don't know the real reason for myself but i know that i have this power in control and if i had professor thomson and professor rutherford here i'd make them open their eyes i sure wish i had been able to kidnap them so you admit that you've kidnaped us said jack but he said it i was glad to see with a smile if you want to put it that way--yes edmund responded also smiling well boys said jack turning to henry and me we may as well make the best of it so far as i can see edmund has got us in his aerial craft and we'll have to complete the voyage what- ever it may be perhaps you'll treat us to a trip to paris edmund i'd like that immensely better than that said edmund paris is small potatoes compared with what you are going to see and so indeed it turned out a comfortable beginning of the trip finally we all got our pipes and tobacco and began to make ourselves at home we dropped the subject that had been uppermost in our minds and talked of other things jack always full of reminiscences entertained us with stories so hours glided by till most of us began to feel sleepy i'll have to keep the first watch said ed- mund and all the others too this night so then we're not going to land to-night asked henry no not to-night edmund replied you may as well turn in you see i've prepared good bunks he lifted the tops of some of the benches along the walls and turning them outward showed us beds already made up i believe i've not forgotten anything that can make us comfortable he added arms instru- ments clothing furs and-lots of good things to eat we looked at one another in surprise but nobody spoke though the same thought probably occurred to each--that this promised to be a pretty long trip judging from the preparations arms edmund had said what in the world should we need of arms was he going to take us off to the rocky mountains for a bear hunt and clothing and furs but we were really sleepy perhaps the motion had something to do with that although now it had become almost imperceptible at any rate it was not long before all three of us had taken edmund at his word and leaving him to manipulate his knobs as he saw fit we turned in he considerately drew a shade over the electric light and then noise- lessly opened the shutter covering the window when i saw him doing that i was strongly tempted to rise and look out but i didn't do it instead i fell asleep the earth spread out like a map when i woke windows were open on both sides of the car and sunlight was streaming in through one of them henry was still asleep jack was yawning in his bunk just preparing to rise and edmund stood at one of the windows staring out i quickly made my toilet and then went to edmund's side good morning he said taking my hand look a columbus of space  out here and tell me what you think of the prospect i put my face close to the glass and my heart jumped into my mouth where are we i cried out jack hearing my agitated exclamation jumped up and ran to my side it was truly enough to take away one's breath we seemed to be at an infinite height and the sky was as black as ink and ablaze with stars although the sunlight was streaming into the window behind us i could see nothing of the earth evidently we were too high for that it must lie away down under our feet i thought so that even the horizon had sunk out of sight i had that queer uncon- trollable qualm that comes to every one who stands on the verge of an abyss straight before us so i presently became aware was a most singular appearance in the sky i thought at first glance that it was a round cloud curiously mottled but it was strangely changeless for a cloud and it had moreover a certain solidity of aspect that could not consist with vapor good heaven cried jack catching sight of it what's that that's the earth it was edmund who had spoken and now he looked at us with a quizzical smile breakfast on board far up above the eastern hemisphere a thrill shot through me my mind went into a whirl i saw that it was the truth he had told for as sure as i sit here at the moment that edmund spoke the great cloud rounded out before my eyes the deception vanished and i recognized the outlines of asia and the pacific ocean as clearly as ever i saw them on a school-globe in another minute i had become too weak to stand and i sank trembling upon a seat jack whose eyes had not accommodated themselves to the gigantic perspective as rapidly as mine remained at the window declaring fiddlesticks what are you trying to give us the earth is down below i reckon but in a little while he too saw the thing as it really was and then his excitement equaled mine in the meantime henry awakened by the noise had run to the window and had gone through the same experience our astonishment and dismay were too great to recover from but after some minutes we gained a little self-control in heaven's name edmund jack at last ex- claimed what have you been doing nothing very extraordinary edmund replied coolly at least nothing that ought to seem ex- traordinary if men had not been fools for so many ages they might have done this long ago they've been wasting their time with steam and coal and a hundred other petty sources of power when all the while they had the limitless energy of the atoms under their thumbs and didn't know it it's the interatomic energy that has brought us out here and that is going to carry us a good deal farther before we are through we simply listened in silence for what could we say there was not the shadow of a doubt about it we were out in the middle of space and there was the earth hanging on nothing like a summer cloud heaven knows how far away it might have been a million miles for all we could tell a speed of  miles a second we've made a pretty good run during the night said edmund finding that we were speechless you must be hungry by this time for you've slept late let's have breakfast so saying he opened a locker took out a folding table covered it with a white cloth turned on a little electric range and in a few minutes had ready as appetizing a breakfast of eggs and as good a cup of coffee as i ever tasted it is one of the compensations of human nature that it is able to adjust itself to the most unheard-of conditions pro- vided that the inner man does not find itself neg- lected the smell of breakfast would almost recon- cile a man to purgatory anyhow it reconciled us for the moment to our situation and we ate and drank and fell into as cheerful good comradeship as a fishing-party after a big morning's catch when the breakfast things had been cleared away we began to smoke and chat frequently inter- rupting the talk however to take a turn at the window staring at the spectacle of the world we were leaving behind us edmund got out some binoculars and with them we could recognize many geographical features we could see japan and the philippines spots near the shore of the pacific we recognized the crinkling line of the snowy himalaya mountains and a great white smudge over the ocean showed where a storm was raging and where good ships were no doubt battling with the waves beneath i noticed that edmund was continually going from one window to the other as if watching for some- thing and there was at times a look almost of ap- prehension in his eyes he had a peep-hole in the forward end of the car covered with thick glass and he frequently visited it even while we were at breakfast i had observed that he was not easy but kept jumping up and running to look out at last i asked him what are you looking for edmund  meteors he replied shortly meteors out here of course you're something of an astronomer don't you know that they hang round all the planets they didn't let me sleep last night they kept me on tenter-hooks all the time i was half inclined to get one of you up to help me we passed some pretty ugly looking fellows during the night you know this is an unknown sea that we are navigat- ing and i don't want to run on a rock and wreck the ship but we seem to be pretty far from the earth now i said and there ought not to be much danger it's not so dangerous as it was but there may be some round yet i'll feel easier when i've put a few more million miles behind us millions of miles when we had imagined that the earth looked as though it might be a million miles away it was merely a passing thought which didn't impress us with its real immensity but now when we heard  amazing stories edmund say that we actually had traveled such a distance the idea struck us with overwhelming force meteors on all sides in heaven's name edmund jack called out at what rate are we traveling then just at present edmund replied glancing at an indicator on the wall we're making twenty miles a second twenty miles a second why i exclaimed that's faster than the earth goes in its orbit yes just a trifle faster edmund replied smil- ing but i'll probably have to work her up to a little better speed in order to get where i want to go before our goal begins to run away from us ah that's it put in jack that's what i want- ed to know what is our goal edmund where are we going before edmund could reply we all sprang to our feet affrighted a loud grating noise had broken upon our ears at the same instant the car gave a lurch and a blaze like a flash of the most vicious lightning streamed through one of the windows blank the things shouted edmund springing to the window and then darting at one of the knobs and beginning to twist it with all his force in a second we were sprawling on the floor ex- cept edmund who kept his hold our course had been changed with amazing quickness and our startled eyes beheld huge misshapen objects dart- ing past the window here comes another cried edmund seizing the knob again i had managed to get my face at the window and i certainly thought that we were lost only a few rods away rushing straight at us was a vast black mass shaped something like a dumb-bell with ends as big as houses tumbling over and over itself and threatening us as it came with annihilation if it hit us as it seemed sure to do i knew that we should never return to the earth unles it might be in the form of pulverized cinders chapter iii the planetary limited but edmund had seen the meteor and quicker than thought with a turn of the knob he swerved the car and threw us all off our feet again but we would have been thankful to him even if he had broken our heads for he had saved us from instant destruction the danger was not yet gone however scarcely had the huge dumb-bell which edmund assured us afterward must have been composed of solid iron from its effect on his magnetic needles passed be- fore there came from outside a blaze of lightning so fierce and penetrating that it closed our eyes as if the lids had been slapped shut a collision exclaimed edmund the thing has struck another big meteor and they are ex- changing red-hot compliments he threw himself flat on the floor and stared out of the forward peep-hole then immediately he jumped to his feet and gave us another tumble he had changed the course once more they're all about us he said we're like a boat in a raging spring freshet with rocks tree- trunks and tossing cakes of ice threatening it on every hand but we'll get out of it the car obeys its helm as if charmed why i got away from that last fellow by setting up an atomic reaction against it as a boatman pushes his pole against an ice-floe a trip to venus in the midst of our terror we could not but admire our leader his resources seemed boundless and our confi- dence grew with every escape we watched the meteors out of the windows while edmund kept guard at the peep-hole we must have come almost within striking distance of a thousand in the course of an hour but edmund decided not to diminish his speed for he said that he found he could control the car quicker when it was under full headway so on we rushed dodging the things like a crow in a flock of pestering jays and after a while we began to enjoy the excitement it was better sport than shooting rapids in an open skiff and we got so confident at last in the powers of our car and its commander that we were rather sorry when the last meteor was passed and we found our- selves once more in clear open space after that the time passed quietly we ate our meals and slept as regularly as if we had been at home there was no night for us because the sun shone in at one window or the other all the time yet as i have said the sky was jet black and the stars glittered everywhere round us when we wanted to sleep we put up the shutters keeping watch only through the peep-hole which as it did not face the sun admitted little light we kept count of the days by the aid of a calendar clock there seemed to be nothing that edmund had for- gotten once the idea suddenly came to me that it was a wonderful thing that we had not all been smoth- ered with bad air breathing the atmosphere of the car over and over again as we were doing and i asked edmund about it he laughed that's the easiest problem of all he said look here and he threw open a little grating in the side of the car in there he explained there's an apparatus which absorbs the carbonic acid and renews the air it is good to work for at least a month which will be more time than we need for this expedi- tion there you are again broke in jack i was asking you about that when we ran into those pesky meteors what is this expedition where are we going taking rifles to venus well since you have become pretty good shipmates replied edmund i don't see any objection to telling you we are going to venus a columbus of space  going to venus we all cried in a breath to be sure why not we've got the proper sort of a conveyance haven't we there was no denying that as we knew that we had left the earth far behind and had already traveled some millions of miles it didn't after all seem to be a very crazy idea that we might actually go to venus but how far is it asked jack when we quit the earth edmund replied venus was rapidly approaching inferior conjunc- tion you know what that is albert addressing me it's when venus comes between the sun and the earth the distance between the two is not always the same at such a conjunction but i figured out that on this occasion allowing for the circuit that we should have to make there would be just twenty-seven million miles to travel at the average speed of twenty miles a second we could do that distance in fifteen days fourteen and one-half hours but of course i had to lose some time going slow through the earth's atmosphere for other- wise the car would have caught fire by friction like a meteor and i shall have to slow up again when we enter venus's atmosphere so that i don't count on landing on venus in less than sixteen days from the time of our departure we've already been out five days so eleven re- main before i hope to introduce you to the in- habitants of another world the inhabitants of another world this idea took us all aback do you believe there are any such inhabitants asked henry i know there are said edmund otherwise i wouldn't have taken the trouble to come of course said jack stretching out his legs and pulling at his pipe who'd go twenty-seven million miles if he didn't expect to see somebody then that's what you put the arms aboard for i remarked yes but i hope we shall not have to use them strikes me this is a sort of a pirate ship said jack but what kind of arms have you got for answer edmund threw open a locker and showed us an array of automatic guns pistols and some cutlases getting close to venus decidedly piratical cried jack but see here edmund with all this inter- atomic energy that you've got under control why in the world didn't you construct something new-- something that would just knock the venustians silly and blow their old planet up if it became necessary it seems to me that automatic arms though pretty good at home are rather small pump- kins for invading a foreign world with i didn't prepare anything else said edmund in the first place because i hadn't time and in the second place because i didn't really anticipate any fighting i hope that we can get along without that you mean to try moral suasion i suppose drawled jack well anyhow i hope they'll be glad to see us and since it's venus we're going to visit i expect that the ladies will be perfect houris for beauty i'm glad you made it venus instead of mars edmund for from all i've heard about mars with its fourteen-foot giants i don't think i should care to go there we all laughed at jack's fancies but there was something thrilling in the idea too for here we were unless we were dreaming actually on the way to venus i tried every way i could think of to test whether it was a dream or no but do what i would i came always to the conclusion that i had never been more wideawake in my life both jack and i were sufficiently romantic to find a great charm in the thought of visiting another world but henry was different he always looked at the money in a thing edmund he said i think you have made a fool of yourself what good will it do you or us to go to venus here you have got an invention that will revolutionize mechanics you might if you had exploited it as you ought have made the greatest millionaire look like the smallest kind of an atom but instead of developing the thing in a businesslike way you rush off into space on harebrained adventure that depends upon the point of view and the mental make-up edmund replied calmly to me venus is infinitely more interesting than all the wealth that you could pile up between the north pole and the equator am i not the columbus of space--and you my lieutenants he added smil- ing besides just wait until we return to the earth i don't promise to give my attention to money-getting then but i may revolutionize a good deal more than mechanics yes if we ever do return said jack a little lugubriously poor jack none of us knew then what was in store the time ran on and we watched the day hand on the calendar clock soon it had marked a week then ten days then a fortnight we were getting pretty close but up to this time we had not yet seen venus edmund had seen it he said but to do so he had been obliged to alter the course because the planet was almost in the eye of the sun and the light of the latter streaming into the peep-hole blinded him a mysterious display of flames in consequence of the change of course he told us we were now approaching venus from the east--flanking her in fact--and she appeared in the form of an enormous shining crescent i shall never forget my first view of her we had got within half a million miles and edmund was very nervous about meteors again he said they were probably thicker round venus than around the earth because the former is nearer to the sun and everything crowds up as you approach the center of the solar system con- sequently he would only allow us each a brief peep at the planet because he wanted to be all the time at the lookout the peep that i got was sufficient that vast gleaming sickle hanging in the black  amazing stories sky was the most tremendous thing i ever looked upon soon afterward edmund changed the course again we had not come upon the expected mete- ors in any great numbers and edmund said he felt safe now in running into the planet's shadow and making a landing on her night hemisphere you see venus as schiaparelli had found out doesn't turn on her axis once every twenty-four hours like the earth but keeps always the same face to the sun the consequence is that she has perpetual day on that side and perpetual night on the other i asked why we didn't land on the daylight side but edmund said his plan was safer we could easily go from one hemisphere to the other he declared but it didn't turn out to be as easy as he thought i hardly expect to find any inhabitants on the dark hemisphere he said it must be fearfully cold there--too cold for life to exist perhaps but one can never tell anyhow i am going to find out we'll just stop for a look at things and then the car will carry us round to the other side we can thus approach the inhabitants who i am sure exist on that side from behind as it were and that will give us a chance to reconnoiter them a little and plan our arrival safely if venus is rightly named said jack i'm for getting where the inhabitants are as soon as pos- sible when we swung round into the shadow of the planet we got her between the sun and us then she completely hid the sun and appeared like an immense black circle blacker than the sky itself but all round this black circle appeared a most beautiful ring of light that's her atmosphere said edmund lighted up by the sun from behind but for the life of me i can't tell what those great flames mean descending into the cavern of venus he referred to a vast circle of many-colored flames that blazed and flickered with all the hues of the rainbow at the inner edge of the ring of light it was the most awful and at the same time beautiful sight that i ever gazed at that's something altogether outside my calcu- lations edmund averred i can't account for it at all perhaps they are already celebrating our ar- rival with fireworks said jack always ready to take the humorous view of everything that's not fire edmund responded what it is i cannot say but we'll find out i haven't come all this distance to be scared off our approach was so rapid that the immense black circle grew hour after hour with portentous swiftness soon it was so large that we could no longer see its boundaries through the peep-hole we're within a thousand miles said edmund finally we must be close to the upper limits of the atmosphere the atmosphere of venus is denser and more extensive than that of the earth and if we rush into it we shall be burnt up by the effects of friction i'll have to slow down he slowed down a little more rapidly than was comfortable it was jerk after jerk as he dropped off the power but at last we got down to the speed of an ordinary express-train being out of the sunshine now we had to use the electric-lamp to illuminate the car at length we got so close that the surface of the planet became dimly visible we were settling very slowly by this time and as we drew gradually nearer we began to notice singular shafts of light that seemed to issue from the ground beneath us as if it had been covered with so many iron foundries by jove cried edmund i believe there are inhabitants on this side after all i certainly don't believe that those lights come from vol- canoes i'm going to make for the nearest one and will soon know what they are accordingly he steered the car for one of the gleaming shafts it grew brighter as we ap- proached and threw a faint illumination upon the ground around it everything seemed to be very flat and level as if we were dropping down upon a prairie but no features could be clearly made out in the gloom edmund boldly approached within a hundred feet of the light and with the slightest perceptible bump we touched the soil of venus it's probably frightfully cold outside said edmund and we'll put on these things by way of precaution he dragged out of one of his innumerable re- ceptacles a lot of thick fur garments and gloves as if we were going among the eskimos and made us put them on while he dressed himself in similar fashion then he handed to each of us a pair of big automatic pistols telling us to put them in our side-pockets these preparations having been made he cautiously opened the door after having as he said electrically anchored the car to the ground the air that rushed into the car as the door was opened almost hardened us into icicles it was colder than ten thousand icebergs it won't hurt you edmund exclaimed it can't be down to absolute zero on account of the atmosphere i've kept it so warm inside the car that you've become pot-boiled you'll soon be used to this come on and he led the way out after glancing round us for a moment we cau- tiously approached the shaft of light it issued from an irregular round hole as we drew near the edge we saw that there were rough steps at one side of the pit leading downward in another instant we were frozen stiff not with cold but with amazement my heart for a moment stopped beating standing on the steps watching us with eyes as big and luminous as moons was a creature shaped like a man but more savage-looking than a gorilla a columbus of space  chapter iv the caverns of venus--an inhabitant for two or three minutes the creature con- tinued to stare at us motionless and we to stare at him it was so dramatic that it makes my nerves tingle now when i think of it his eyes alone were enough to scare a man out of his senses as i have said they looked like full moons they were so big so round and so lumin- ously yellow it was the phosphorescent yellow shot with green that you sometimes see in the eyes of a cat or a wild beast its great hairy head was black but its short stocky body was as white as that of a polar bear its arms were long like an ape's and it had a look of immense strength and activity edmund was the first to recover from the sur- prise and then he did a thing that seems absurd when i recall it well hallo you he called out in a voice that made us jump as if it had been a thunder-clap in that heavy atmosphere the sounds struck the eardrums like trip-hammers the effect on the creature was electric a film shot across his big eyes he made a sudden move- ment uttered a queer squeak that seemed ridicu- lous coming from an animal of such size and in an instant more he had disappeared stumbling and tumbling down the steps hurrah shouted edmund we've conquered a hemisphere in fact the evident terror of the creature im- mediately heartened us all our fear vanished and following edmund we rushed for the hole and began a hurried chase down the steps we noticed that the air was decidedly warmer round the mouth of the pit and as we descended the temperature rose after a while we pulled off our arctic togs and left them on a shelf of rock but we didn't leave the automatic pistols then we proceeded downward it was an awful hole for depth the steps rudely cut wound round and round the sides like those in a cathedral tower except that the shape of the pit was not regular it looked like a natural formation perhaps i thought the throat of an extinct volcano though there being no mountain that didn't seem prob- able either but the steps were certainly of arti- ficial origin the awful tenants of the cave when we had descended several hundred feet we emerged suddenly into a broad cavern the temperature had been rising all the time and here it was as warm as in an ordinary room the cavern was i should say about twenty yards broad and eight or ten feet in height with a flat roof over in a corner i saw a hole down which the steps continued there was not a living thing visible but there was light coming from what looked like a heap of coal burning with great brilliance in the center of the floor a strange but not unpleasant odor filled the place and as we paused to consult we all spoke of the curious exhilaration which we had experi- enced almost from the moment of setting foot on the planet edmund said it was due to the dense atmosphere which undoubtedly was heavy with oxygen it certainly had a good deal to do with our rising courage and our insensibility to fatigue notwithstanding the precipitancy of our long de- scent we did not draw an extra breath as we looked about us seeing no one edmund declared that it was necessary to go on we can't give it up he said we've got to find the inhabitants and now that we have seen one of them we know pretty well what to expect come along he led the way down the steps in the corner they wound round just like the others and again we descended a long distance perhaps as much as three hundred feet then we reached a second cavern larger and loftier than the first and there we found them there never was such a sight it made our blood run cold again notwithstanding our initial triumph which had been so cheaply won ranged along the farther side of the cavern vis- ible by the light of another heap of bright coal were twenty or thirty of those creatures standing shoul- der to shoulder with their great eyes glaring like bull's-eye lanterns but the most frightful of all were their motions the venustians terrified by one pistol shot you have read how a huge cobra rearing on his coils sways his terrible head from side to side before striking well all those black heads before us with their lantern eyes were swaying in unison only the motion was circular three times by the right and then three times by the left those heads circled in rhythmic cadence while the lumi- nous eyes made phosphorescent rings in the air intersecting one another in consequence of the rapid movement it was such a spectacle as no man ever beheld in the wildest dream it was baleful it was the charm of the serpent paralyzing its terrified prey we felt it in an instant and our brains began to whirl i found myself staggering in spite of all my efforts to stand firm and a kind of paralysis ran through my limbs presently all moving to- gether and uttering a hissing whistling sound they began slowly to approach us keeping in line each shaggy leg lifted high at the same moment like so many soldiers on parade while the heads con- tinued to swing and the glowing eyes to cut linked circles in the air but for edmund we should have been lost he spoke to us over his shoulder in a whisper boys take your pistols and kill as many as you can but don't shoot unless they make a rush i'll knock over the leader in the center and i think that'll be enough so saying he raised his pistol but as for the rest of us we could no more have stirred our arms than if we had been marble statues as the creatures approached another step ed- mund blazed away the report was like an earth- quake it shocked us into our senses and almost out of them again the weight of the atmosphere  amazing stories and the confinement of the cavern magnified and concentrated the sound until it was awful the fel- low in the center that edmund had aimed at was hurled to the ground as if shot from a catapult the others fell as flat as he and all lay groveling the big eyes filming and swaying wildly but no longer in unison the charm was broken and as we saw our ene- mies prostrate our courage and nerve returned i thought so said edmund coolly it's the sound that they can't stand i'm sorry i killed that fellow for the report alone would have been suffi- cient this atmosphere acts like a microphone you have heard the voices of these creatures which are hardly louder than whispers their ears are evidently not made for sounds of any magnitude i shouldn't wonder if i had burst every ear-drum in the lot after all he continued after a moment's thought it is perhaps as well that i took one life probably it would have had to come eventually and now we have them thoroughly cowed if they had ever reached us they would have torn us asunder in a moment with those muscular arms the food of the natives and their cooking as he spoke edmund boldly approached the grov- eling row and pushed with his foot the huge white furry body of the one he had shot the bullet had gone through his head at edmund's approach the creatures sank even lower on the rocky floor and those nearest to him turned up their moon eyes with an expression of submissive terror and sup- plication that was grotesque though unmistakable he motioned us to approach and imitating him we began to pat and soothe the shrinking bodies until understanding that we would not harm them they gradually acquired some confidence in us in short after a while a relation like that of masters with the most submissive slaves was established in the meantime the crowd in the cavern in- creased others of the creatures attracted perhaps by the noise coming in continually through side passages those who had been present at our ar- rival explained the situation to the newcomers as we could see and it was evident that our prestige was thoroughly established as we became better acquainted with these crea- tures we found that they were not as savage as they looked their heads and the larger part of their faces were covered with black hair but on their bodies was a white silky fur why the dif- ference of color existed i could never imagine the reason for the great size of their eyes appeared evident it was the prevailing darkness of the side of the planet on which they dwelt with those eyes they could see in the gloom like cats they were surprisingly intelligent too in their way their construction of the hundreds of steps leading down into the caverns and their employment of a kind of coal for heat and light showed that but this was not all we found that in some of the caverns which were connected with one another by winding passages they cultivated their food which consisted entirely of vegetables of various sorts all unlike any that i had ever met with on the earth water dripped from the roofs of these caverns but there was no light except that derived from the burning coal yet the vegetation though almost colorless seemed to thrive astonishingly a necessary killing they had many ways of cooking their food and although there yet remained a good sup- ply of stores in the car edmund thought it advisable for us to accustom ourselves to the diet of the in- habitants we found it decidedly agreeable and without ill effects of any kind the only brute animals of any size that we could discover in the caverns were some dog-like creatures about as large as terriers but very furry the burial-ground of the community we discov- ered when they came to dispose of the fellow that edmund had shot it was a large lone cavern sit- uated at a long distance from the one which we had first entered we thought we saw indications of some kind of religious ceremony when they put their slain comrade in the ground and then for the first time we recognized the women we were astonished by the evidence of a monogamous rela- tion among the sexes which was furnished by the fact that one of these women manifested by her sorrow a special grief which we thought could only be accounted for upon the supposition that she was the wife of the dead person she held two or three little ones by the hands and we were fairly moved to tears by the spectacle edmund being particularly affected i almost wish i had never come here he said bitterly since the first thing i have done is to kill an inoffensive intelligent creature not so inoffensive either put in jack if you hadn't killed him where should we be now but it wasn't necessary edmund insisted the noise alone would have sufficed don't borrow trouble said jack sympathetical- ly you did the best you knew and heaven knows what we should have done without you but i noticed that edmund was afterwards very gentle with the poor creatures who seemed to bear us no ill-will feeling probably that we were supe- rior beings who could do as we liked i have spoken of them as a community and i may say here that we afterward discovered that all this part of venus was sprinkled over with simi- lar communities somewhat resembling separate tribes each tribe occupied a group of caverns by itself and there seemed to be but little intercourse among them they seldom went out of the caverns except to perform a very remarkable ceremony which led us into a danger that put streaks of silver on my head where no gray hair was due for many years yet but of that later the most surprising discovery that we made in the cavern was a big smithy it was really noth- ing else edmund had foretold us that we should find something of that kind he based his prophecy on the fact that there were rude tools and utensils of metal in the caverns he examined the metal and pronounced it iron all the planets are largely composed of iron he said these people here primitive as they seem in many ways have found out how to smelt and a columbus of space  make various articles of it they must have a blacksmith shop and i'm going to find it it wasn't long--perhaps two days time after our arrival--when we came upon the place it was in one of the side caverns and we actually found several of the savage smiths at work with furs fastened over their ears to ward off the sound they were turning out long sharp-pointed tools the purpose of which edmund divined in a moment they're to dig coal with he said and he was right the strata of rock were filled with seams of a very hard coal and these people dug it out to keep their fires going it was the best coal that i have ever seen infinitely better even than anthracite but where did they get their fire to begin with asked jack perhaps by friction like our savages on the earth edmund replied perhaps they got it down below i added what do you mean by that asked jack i know what he means interposed edmund better than he does himself perhaps venus there is reason to believe is not as old a planet as the earth consequently its crust is not as thick it may be that the internal fires do not lie so deep i shouldn't be surprised if that accounts in part for the comfortable temperature down here when the surface above us is so terribly cold owing to the absence of the sun our discovery of the smithy seemed to have set edmund to thinking after musing a while he said this is a most fortunate thing for us we'll have occasion to employ the skill of these fellows and to teach them something new for our own benefit how's that i asked the strange sledge trip proposed it's this way i want to take some of these fellows along when we start for the daylight ride of the planet i can find my way well enough with the aid of the stars but these creatures may be useful to us in other ways but we can't take them in the car which is full enough already luckily the power of the car is practically un- limited and it could draw a whole train if neces- sary now i'm going to carry them along in sleds dragged after the car and i'll make the sleds of iron since there's no wood to be had it's another lucky thing that this part of venus is almost a dead level a sort of rolling prairie as you have observed covered with a kind of icy shingle which is just suited for runners trees can't grow here and if there were ever any rivers they became frozen solid ages ago but why not make the fellows walk asked jack they've got good legs walk said edmund why man we've got at least five thousand miles to go before we reach the edge of the sunlit hemisphere and i don't pro- pose to spend several months on the way with the sleds drawn after the car we can make the journey at the rate of a hundred miles an hour all right said jack the sooner you start the better as far as i'm concerned i want to find the good-looking people of venus these don't suit my taste henry after his manner said nothing but as i saw him looking about i got the impression that he was calculating the millions that might be made out of these iron-mines on venus edmund never reached a decision without starting immediately to put it into practise he now began his prepara- tions for the journey to the other side but they were quickly interrupted in a most dramatic fashion while we were occupied in the smithy as i call it showing the native smiths how to fashion the runners and upper parts of the proposed sleds we were interrupted by some one coming in and call- ing our assistants away from us they all ran out and we after them on arriving in the prin- cipal cavern we found a singular scene the earth seen from venus two natives whom we did not recognize as having made their appearance before were evidently in charge of some kind of ceremony they wore tall conical caps of polished metal cov- ered with curious hieroglyphics and had staves of iron in their hands they marshaled all the others numbering several hundreds into a long column and then began a slow solemn march up the steps the two leaders produced a squeaking music by blowing into the ends of their staves women were mingled with men and even the children were not excluded we followed at the tail of the procession our curiosity at the highest pitch at the rate we went it must have taken nearly an hour to mount the steps as we emerged into the open air the cold struck to our marrow the natives covered with fur didn't seem to mind it but we ran back to the shelf where he had left our arctic outfits and put them on then we ascended again and emerged into the night finding the crowd assembled not far from the entrance to the cavern the frosty sky was ablaze with stars and directly overhead shone a huge brilliant planet of amazing beauty and close beside it a smaller one the earth said edmund pointing upward and the moon it was indeed our planet and her satellite i can't describe the feeling that came over me at the sight but in a moment edmund interrupted my meditation a ceremonious procession of the venustians look at that he said the natives had formed themselves in a great circle under the starlight with the two lead- ers standing in the center all the others dropped on their knees and the leaders raised their long arms toward the sky and gazed up at the zenith at the same time uttering a kind of chant in their queer subdued voices by jove they're worshiping the earth ex- claimed edmund indeed she looked worth worshiping never have i seen so amazingly splendid an object she  amazing stories was twenty times as brilliant as the brightest planet that any terrestrial astronomer ever beheld and the moon glowing beside her like a great at- tendant star redoubled the beauty of the sight it's just the time of the conjunction said edmund this is their religion those fellows are their priests the earth is their goddess i understand it all now i wouldn't have missed this for a world suddenly the two priests began to pirouette as they whirled more and more rapidly their huge glowing eyes made phosphorescent circles in the gloom like those that had alarmed and fascinated us when we first met the creatures in the cavern they gyrated round the ring of worshipers with astonishing speed and all those creatures fell un- der the fascination and drooped to the ground with eyes fixed in evident helplessness upon the two performers an impending sacrifice of one of the travelers from the earth now for the first time i caught sight of a square object that seemed to be a stone rising a couple of feet above the ground in the center of the circle at this instant the spinning priests having drawn close to the ring of fascinated worshipers made a dive and each caught a native in his arms and ran with him toward the square object that i have described it's a sacrificial stone cried edmund they're going to kill them as an offering to the earth and the moon the truth flashed into my mind and froze me with horror but just as the second priest reached the altar where the other had already pinned his victim with a stroke of the sharp point of his staff his captive suddenly recovering his senses and terrified by the awful fate that confronted him uttered a cry wrenched himself loose and run- ning like the wind leaped over the circle and dis- appeared in the darkness the fugitive passed close to us and jack shouted as he darted by good boy the enraged priest was after him like lightning as he came near us his awful eyes seemed to emit actual flames but the runner had already van- ished without an instant's hesitation the priest shot out his long arm and caught me by the throat in another second i felt myself carried in a bound as if a tiger had seized me over the drooping heads of the worshipers and toward the horrible altar chapter v off for the sunlands dreadful as the moment was i didn't lose my senses on the contrary my mind was fearfully clear and active there was not a horror that i missed the strength and agility of my captor were astounding i could no more have struggled with him than with a lion only one thing flashed upon me to do i yelled with all the strength of my lungs but they had become accustomed to our voices now and the mad- dened creature was so intent upon his fell purpose that a cannon-shot would not have diverted him from it he got me to the altar where the preceding vic- tim already lay with his heart torn out and press- ing me against it with all his bestial force raised his pointed staff to transfix me with my dying eyes i saw the earth gleaming down upon me and will you believe it my heart gave a glad bound at the sight she was my mother planet and the thought that she might help me in my extremity raced across my brain but the dreadful spear had already begun to descend i could see the sweeping muscles under the lithe fur and i pressed my eyes tight shut bang something grazed my shaulder and i felt the wam blood gush out then i knew no more a recovery from a swoon in the midst of a dream of boyhood scenes a mur- mur of familiar voices awoke me i opened my eyes and couldn't make out where i was i must still be dreaming i said to myself and closed my eyes once more then i heard edmund saying he's coming out all right i opened my eyes again but still the scene puz- zled me i saw edmund's face however and behind him jack and henry standing with anxious looks but this was not my room it seemed to be a cave with faint firelight on the walls where am i i asked back in the cavern and coming along all right edmund answered smiling back in the cavern what could that mean then suddenly the whole thing flashed back into my mind so he didn't sacrifice me i said shivering at the thought not on your life jack's hearty voice broke in edmund was too quick for that but only by the fraction of a second said ed- mund still smiling what happened then i asked my recollections coming back stronger every moment a good long shot happened said jack the best i ever saw i looked at edmund he saw that i wanted the story and could bear it and his countenance be- coming serious he began when that fellow snatched you and leaped into the circle i had my fur coat wrapped so closely around me not anticipating any danger that for quite ten seconds i was unable to get out my pistol i tore the garment open just in time for already he was pressing you against the accursed stone with his spear poised i'm used to quick shooting and i didn't waste any time finding my aim even as it was the iron point had touched you when the bullet crashed through his head the shock swerved the weapon a little and you got only a scratch on the shoulder which might have been a columbus of space  more serious but for the thickness of your arctic coat the dead priests and a life saved the fellow fell dead beside you and under the circumstances i felt compelled to shoot the other one also for they were both insane with the delirium of their bloody rites and i knew that our lives would never be safe as long as they remained fit for mischief i'm sorry to have had to start killing right and left like this but i reckon that's the lot of all in- vaders wherever they go it's our second lesson and i think it will prove final when their priests were dead the rest had no fight in them in fact they never intended to harm us but nobody knows what those two chaps might have led them into my conscience is easy about them anyhow how long have i been here i asked two days by the calendar clock said jack yes edmund assented two days i never saw a man so knocked out by a little shock for your wound wasn't much i fixed that up in five minutes you must have been scared to the very bottom of your soul--not that i blame you how- ever but look at yourself he held a pocket-mirror before me and then i saw that my hair was streaked with gray but we haven't been idle in the mean time ed- mund went on i've got two sleds nearly com- pleted and tomorrow--earth time--i mean to set out my wound was very slight and the effects of the shock had all passed off during my long spell of insensibility in an hour or two i was aroused busy with the others i found that edmund had already picked out the natives that he meant to take with us they were a dozen huge fellows who he had discovered pos- sessed more than average intelligence among them was one of the smiths the best of the lot and for convenience edmund had given him a name something resembling that by which his comrades called him--juba starting the sled trip among his other apparently infinite stores of useful things in the car edmund had a roll of small strong steel cable and this now came ad- mirably into play the two sleds were pitched one behind another with a piece of the cable and a line about a hundred feet long connected them with the car the latter could thus rise to a considerable height without lifting the sleds from the ground the sleds were provisioned from the stores of the natives and we took some of their food in the car also not merely to eke out our own but because we had come to like it the fellows selected to join our expedition made no objection on the contrary they seemed proud to accompany us and were evidently envied by their comrades the scene at starting was a strange one about five hundred natives the entire population of the group of caverns belonging to their tribe which were distributed over about a square mile assembled at the entrance to our cavern to see us off as we started the natives on the sleds being unused to the motion clung together like so many awk- ward white bears taking a ride in a circus their friends stood about the ill-omened sacri- ficial-stone waving their long arms while their huge eyes goggled in the starlight jack in a burst of enthusiasm fired four or five shots from his pistol as the reports crashed through the heavy air you should have seen the crowd vanish down the hole the sight made me wince when i thought that they must have gone down like a cataract all heaped together but they were tough and i trust that no heads were broken the effect on our twelve fellows on the sleds came near being disastrous i thought that they would leap off and run and no doubt they would have done so but for the fact that edmund put on so much speed that a new terror instantly took the place of the old one instinct taught them not to jump when the ground was spinning away under them at the rate of sixty miles an hour edmund brought jack sharply to book for his thoughtlessness give me your pistol he said in his old mas- terful way which nobody that i ever saw could stand against jack was almost twice his size but he handed over the pistol like a rebuked schoolboy when you learn how to use it i'll give it back to you said edmund and that closed the incident the plan of the sleds worked like magic a hundred mile an hour sleigh ride after their first fear had vanished the natives began immensely to enjoy the new sensation edmund worked up the speed as he had promised to a hundred miles an hour and even for us in the car it was a glorious spin but there was one danger that had to be guarded against--the mouths of the cavern as i have told you the natives were divided into tribes each tribe being in possession of a group of caverns these caverns were undoubtedly of natural origin but why they were not more uniformly dis- tributed over the surface i cannot say anyhow the fact was that perhaps forty or fifty pits would be found scattered over a mile or two of ground and many of them connected by under- ground passages and then there would be a long distance without any caverns all seemed to be inhabited and to that fact we owed in a great measure the safety of the sleds the shafts of light issuing from the caverns were so many beacons in the endless night telling us where the underground settlements lay and so we avoided running the sleds into the holes although we had one or two narrow escapes as it was twice edmund insisted on stopping at a group of caverns to make the acquaintance of their in- habitants on both occasions we descended into the caves and found the creatures at home whether they would have received us so civilly if we had not taken juba along i can't say  amazing stories juba the venustian intercessor invariably he acted as intercessor and in- terpreter and i guess our reputation suffered no belittlement from his accounts of our prowess it was evident edmund said that there were dif- ferences of dialect in the language of the various tribes which puzzled juba somewhat but he also said that he was now convinced that there existed among these people an unexplained power of com- municating thought which had no connection with the utterance of sounds it wasn't a sign-language like that of deaf mutes either the mystery was not solved until we got round on the daylight side of venus but it turned out to be one of the most incredible of all our dis- coveries in that strange world you'll hear about it when i come to it i we continued to guide our course by the stars-- and they were certainly magnificent with the earth for a very queen of gems set in the midst of them-- until we had traveled some four thousand miles all the time of course approaching the edge of the sunward hemisphere and now a new phenomenon struck us for some time along the horizon ahead had stretched a faint streak like the first light of dawn look said edmund there lie the sunlands of venus although the sun never rises on this part of the planet it will rise for us because we are approaching it there was nothing to surprise us in all this but as we drew nearer and the arc of dawn rose higher in the sky and glowed more softly beauti- ful there appeared at its base those same many colored flames which had astonished us on our ap- proach to the planet after we had got into its shadow and begun to see its atmosphere as a great ring of light around it the sun being behind the reappearance of these flames startled us they've got something to do with the sunrise edmund declared but i can't make out what it is don't run us into a conflagration said jack we've had enough to do to stand the cold here and to put up with the company of these furry beasts but i object to being rushed next into a land of salamanders they probably are fire-eaters on the other side if you can show us some tem- perate or not too torrid land where the people are as beautiful and attractive as they ought to be on a world called venus i'm with you with all my heart that's not fire replied edmund why not inquire of juba i asked a very good idea i'll try and edmund stopped the car juba as he had already been taught to do whenever we stopped immediately jumped off his sled and came running to us edmund took his match-box from his pocket struck a match and while attracting juba's attention pointed alternate- ly to match flame and the fiery objects on the horizon juba understood at once and vigorously shook his head while his big luminous eyes almost seemed to speak if we could have understood their mean- ing phosphorescent waves appeared to chase one another in their depths and edmund asserted that it certainly was a language expressed without sounds if it was a language i positively think that edmund had begun to understand it for after a few minutes during which he and juba gesticulated and motioned and stared in each other's faces ed- mund turned to us and said i ought to have foreseen this and i am ashamed of myself because i didn't those seeming flames on the horizon are due to--what do you think mountains of crystal mountains of crystal we all exclaimed the mountains of crystal the cause of the flames yes just that it's all plain enough when you think about it venus being a world half day and half night is necessarily as hot on one side as it is cold on the other all the clouds and most of the moisture are on the day side of the planet where the sunbeams act the hot air charged with moisture rises over the middle of the sunward hemisphere and flows off above on all sides toward the night hemisphere while from the latter cold air flows in underneath to take its place along the junction between the two hemispheres the clouds and moisture are con- densed by the increasing cold and fall in cease- less storms of snow this snow descending uninterruptedly for ages has piled up in vast mountainous masses the moisture cannot pass very far into the night hemi- sphere without being condensed and so it is all arrested within a great ring or band completely encircling the planet and marking the division be- tween perpetual day and perpetual night what look like gigantic flames to us are the sunbeams striking those mountains of solidified snow and ice from behind and breaking into pris- matic fire the thing seemed simple enough after edmund had explained it but the effects were splendid and awful beyond description i foresee now considerable trouble for us ed- mund continued there's been a warning of that too if i had but heeded it i've noticed for some time that a wind gradually getting stronger has been following us sometimes dying away and then coming up again it is likely that this wind gets to be a terrible tempest in the neighborhood of those ice mountains it is the back suction caused--as i have already told you--by the rising of the heated air in the sunny side of the planet it may play the deuce with us when we get into the midst of it but did you learn all this from juba i asked oh no of course not i only managed to make out from him that his people knew of the existence of these icy barriers but the explanation flashed upon me as soon as i got hold of the main fact now we've got to be a little cautious in our approach danger of an irresistible wind we slowed down accordingly and as soon as we did so we began to notice the wind that edmund had spoken of it came in great gusts a columbus of space  from behind gradually increasing in frequency and in fury soon it was strong enough to drive the sleds without any pulling from the car and some- times they were forced close under us and even ahead of us the natives hanging on in wild alarm edmund managed to govern the motion of the car for a while holding it back against the storm but as he confessed to us this was a thing he had made no provision for and eventually we became almost as helpless as a ship in a typhoon i could easily cut loose from these fellows and run right out of this said edmund but i'm not going to do it i've taken them into my service and i'm bound to look out for them if there was room for them in the car it would be all right by jove i've got it he added a moment later i'll fetch up the sleds attach them under the car like the basket of a balloon and carry them all there's plenty of power it's only room that's wanting it was no sooner said than done with edmund by this time we were getting into the ice great hummocks of it surrounded us although there was nothing yet resembling the mountains that edmund had spoken of and we dropped the car down in the lee of an icy hill where the force of the wind was broken the sky overhead was still free from clouds but ahead we could see them whirling and tumbling in mighty masses of vapor lashing the two sleds together we attached them about ten feet below the car with wire ropes then the natives were assembled and edmund made them fasten themselves securely when everything was ready we four entered the car and the power was turned on we'll rise straight up said edmund until we are out of the wind and then we'll sail over the mountains and come down as nice as you please on the other side it was a beautiful program and we had com- plete confidence in our leader but it didn't work as we expected even his genius had met its match this time the wind at last strikes them no sooner had we risen out of the protection of the ice hummock than the wind caught us it was a blast of such power and ferocity as we had not yet encountered in an instant the car was spinning like a top and there away we rushed before the tempest the sleds being banged against the car like tassels whipping in a storm it was a wonder of wonders that the creatures on them were not flung off or killed by the frequent im- pacts but fortunately edmund had seen that they were securely fastened and as you know already they could stand knocks like so many bears in the course of twenty minutes we must have traveled twice as many miles perfectly helpless to arrest our mad rush or to divert our course pitched hither and thither and sprawling on the floor half the time the noise was awful and nobody even tried to speak the shutters were open and suddenly i saw through one of the windows a sight that i thought was surely my last the car seemed to be sweeping through a dense cloud of boiling vapors when they split asunder before my eyes and there almost right against us was a glittering precipice of pure ice gleaming wickedly with blue flashes and we were rushing at it as if we had been shot from a cannon there was a terrific shock which i thought for a moment must have crushed the car like an egg- shell and then down we fell--down and down chapter vi lost in the crystal mountains if we had seen the danger earlier and had not been so tumbled topsy-turvy by the pitching of the car in the wind i suppose that edmund would have prevented the collision just as he had steered us away from some of the meteors by set- ting up an atomic reaction serving for a push but there was no chance for that the blow against the precipice was not however as severe as it had seemed to me and the car was not smashed but the fall was terrible there was only one thing which saved us from destruction at the base of the great cliff of solid ice against which the wind had hurled the car an immense deposit of snow had collected and into this we fell we were all tumbled in a heap the car and the sleds being inextricably entangled with the wire ropes fortunately however the stout windows were not broken and after we had struggled to our feet as the car lay on its side edmund managed to open the door he made us put on our furs but even with them we found the cold almost intolerable but the natives paid no attention to it not one of them was seriously hurt and they were still attached to the sled so firmly had they been bound under edmund's direction before we started from the hummock we unloosed them and then began to examine the situation above us towered the icy precipice disappearing in whirling clouds high overhead and the wind drove square against it with the roar of niagara the air was filled with snow and ice-dust and at times we could not see objects ten feet away our poor furry companions huddled together as soon as we got them upon their feet and were of no use to themselves or to us danger of destruction among the ice mountains well we've got to get out of this mighty quick said edmund come hustle now and we'll repair the ship we got to work juba alone aiding us and soon had the sleds out of the tangle and again properly attached to the car then we entered the latter and edmund fumbled a while with his machinery in the course of ten or fifteen minutes he said that it was damaged but would still work and that we'd start as soon as we could replace the natives on the sleds we got them together with a good deal of trouble for they were frightened out of their wits and would have run away had they known where to go but they had sense enough to understand that their safety depended entirely  amazing stories upon us when they were once more safely at- tached we entered the car and prepared to ascend you notice said edmund that this wind is variable and there's our chance we hadn't noticed it but he had and that was sufficient when the blasts weaken he continued the air springs back from the face of the precipice and then whirls round to the left i've no doubt that there's a passage there through which the wind finds its way back behind this icy mountain and if we can get there we shall probably find some sort of shelter then i hope it'll be comparatively an easy thing to make our way into a calmer region of the atmosphere i'm going to take advantage of the first lull it worked out just as he had predicted as the wind surged back after a particularly vicious rush against the mighty blue cliff we cut loose and sailed up into it and away we went we rushed past the glittering wall so swiftly that it made our heads swim in two or three minutes we rounded a corner and then found ourselves in a kind of atmospheric eddy where the car simply spun round and round with the two united sleds hanging be- low it now for it said edmund and touched a knob one crisis is passed without accident instantly we rose rapidly we must have shot up a couple of thousand feet when the wind caught us again coming apparently over the top of the icy barrier that we had flanked it swept us off with terrific speed suddenly the air cleared all about the spectacle that opened around and below was--well i wish i could describe it but a hun- dred languages rolled into one couldn't do it we were in the midst of the crystal mountains they towered around us on every side and stretched away in ranges of shining pinnacles and such shapes such colors such flashing and blazing of gigantic rainbows and prisms there were mountains that looked to my amazed eyesight as lofty and massive as mont blanc com- posed all of crystalline ice refracting and reflecting the sunbeams with iridescent splendor for now we could begin to see the orb of the sun itself poised on the edge of the jagged gem-glittering horizon the jeweled summit split its beams into a million bright halos there was one mighty peak still ahead of us but toward which we were rushed sidewise with terrific speed that will haunt my dreams forever it towered high above our level and was simply one awful coruscating alp of light darting out on every side blinding rays of a thousand splendid hues as if a whole worldful of emeralds rubies sap- phires and diamonds had been heaped together in one stupendous pile and set on fire by the sun we were speechless even edmund but presently he spoke very calmly but what he said instantly changed our amazement to terror boys he said there's something serious the matter with the apparatus i can't make the car rise higher i can no longer cause it to react against an obstacle we are at the mercy of the wind if it carries us against that glittering devil no power under heaven can help us if my hair had not whitened before it certainly would have whitened now when we were swept against the first icy preci- pice the danger had come upon us suddenly unex- pectedly out of a concealing cloud but now we had to bear the fearful strain of expectation to see ourselves hurried to destruction with our eyes wide open to the terrible truth i thought that even edmund's iron face paled a little on we rushed still borne sidewise so that the spectacle was straight before us in all its awful- ness as with fascinated eyes we stared through the window we were almost upon the mountain- peak when edmund shouted with a glad voice we're safe look he continued see how those particles of ice swept from the face by the tempest leap hitherward and then whirl round the peak we may touch it but the air having a free vent on each side will carry us one way or the other before a serious shock occurs castaways in a valley of ice he had hardly finished speaking when the crisis arrived we did just touch the front of a cliff but it was narrow and sloping and the wind howling past it carried us in an instant round the obstruction scared ourselves for nothing said edmund we were really as safe as a boat in a rapid the velocity of the current sheered us off but there was a worse danger which he hadn't yet had time to think about we began to think of it however when after the scintillant peak was left behind we saw edmund again working away at his machinery while at the same time the car commenced to sink what's the matter now i asked we seem to be going down so we are edmund replied and i'm afraid we'll not go up again right away the power is failing all the while it will be pretty hard on us to have it stop in this frightful place but it looks as though that were our fate lost and helpless in these mountains of ice the thought was too terrible to be entertained for the first time since this adventure began i heard connected words from henry's lips their emphasis was terrible edmund stonewall he said hoarsely if you are the cause of my death with your infernal in- vention may you be condemned to-- but he never finished the sentence his face turned as white as a sheet and he sank upon the floor poor fellow said edmund he's fainted in a few minutes jack and i had henry in his senses again but as weak as a child and lying on one of the cushioned benches in the mean time the car had descended upon the snow in a deep valley where we were protected from the wind in the profound depression where we now found ourselves a kind of twilight prevailed we got out of the car unloosed our companions from the sleds and then began to look around a columbus of space  all about us towered the crystal mountains their bases--where they were not buried in snow and broken ice--reflecting deep hues of purple and ultra- marine while their upper parts where the sun- light touched them sparkled with amazing bril- liance henry was now able to join us but not a word was said concerning his outbreak was there ever such a situation as ours twenty-six millions of miles from home cast away in a place wild and wonderful beyond imagination millions of miles from all human aid or sympathy millions of miles even from the very world that had witnessed our birth i could in bitterness of spirit have laughed at the mere suggestion that there was any hope for us and yet at that very moment not only was there hope but there was even the certainty of deliverance it lay in the brain of the wonderful man who had brought us thither i have told you that it was twilight in the valley where we were but when as frequently occurred tempests of snow burst over the mountains above us and filled the air the twilight was turned to deepest night and then we had to illumine the electric lamps in the car the natives being used to darkness needed no artificial illumination in fact we found that as soon as the sunlight reached us their great eyes were almost blinded and they suffered cruelly from an infliction so utterly beyond all their experience edmund never lost his self-command he tried to cheer us up i'm going to make some hot coffee he said and then i'll sit down and think it out but first i must see to our fellows there for we may have to stay here a while and even with their furry skins they'll suffer from this kind of weather saving the natives on the sleds under his directions we took a lot of extra furs from the car and stretching them upon the upright stakes attached to the corners of the sleds we made a kind of tent under which the natives huddled for protection there being no wind to speak of here this was not so difficult as it might seem the fellows were very glad of the shelter that we had given them for some of them were already beginning to shiv- ver no sooner were they housed than they fell to eating we then entered the car and turned on the electric range and ten minutes later we were enjoying our coffee when we had finished we got out our pipes and smoked as if there had been no crystal moun- tains tottering over us and no howling tempest tear- ing through the cloud-filled sky a thousand feet or so above our heads we talked of our adventure and of home--home twenty-six million miles away in fact it might have been nearer thirty millions by this time for edmund had told us that venus having passed con- junction was beginning to recede from the earth but edmund did not join in our conversation now he sat apart thinking and we respected his isola- tion knowing that our only chance of escape lay in him at last without saying a word he went outside and remained a long time then he came back smiling i've found the solution he said we'll get out all right but we shall have to wait a while what is it we asked in concert what have you found the libration of venus to rescue the visitants albert he said turning to me you ought to know what libration means well it's libration that is going to save us as venus travels around the sun she turns just once on her axis in making one circuit the consequence as you al- ready know is that she has one side where the sun never rises while the other side always faces the sun but since her orbit is not a perfect circle she travels a little faster at certain times and a little slower at others while her slow rotation on her axis never varies the result is that along the border between the day and night hemispheres there is a narrow strip where the sun rises and sets once in each of her years which are about two hundred and twenty-five of our days in length on this strip the sun shines continuously for about sixteen weeks gradually rising during eight of those weeks and gradually sinking for eight weeks more then during the following sixteen weeks the sun is entirely absent from the strip now we are just in that strip and we may thank our stars for it by good luck after we were swept past that blazing peak of ice which nearly shipwrecked us the wind carried us on so far before the power gave out that we descended on the sun- ward side of the crest of the icy range the sun is at present just beginning to rise on this part of the planet and it will continue to rise for several weeks the result will be that a great melting of ice and snow will take place all around us here and a river will be formed in this valley flowing off toward the sunward hemisphere exactly where we want to go i'm going to take advantage of the torrent and float down with it it's our only chance for we couldn't possibly clamber over all this hummocky ice and drag the car with us why not leave the car behind then asked henry edmund looked at him and smiled do you want to stay on venus all your life he asked i can repair the mechanism if i can find certain substances which i am sure exist on this planet as well as on the earth but there is no use of looking for them in this icy waste no we can never abandon the car we must take it with us and the only way to take it is with the aid of the river of ice and snow-water which will soon be created by the rising sun but how will you manage to float i asked the car being air-tight will float like a buoy and how about the natives ah i'll have to think about that but we'll save them too if possible of course edmund was right he always was but i'll cut short the story of our stay in that awful valley every twenty-four hours by the calendar clock  amazing stories we saw that the sun had risen higher and as it rose the sky cleared and its beams falling uninter- ruptedly became hotter and hotter soon we had no longer any use for furs or for the electric heat in the car at the same time the melting began it was a new danger for us yet we watched it joyously since it offered our only chance of escape we were just in the bottom of the valley near its head it wound away before us turning out of sight beyond a vast hill of ice streams began to trickle down the heights behind us and uniting they formed a rivulet at our feet flowing over smooth ice with great velocity a deluge from the melting ice edmund's plan for saving the natives was now put into operation i'll take juba into the car he said there's just room for him for the others we'll fasten the sleds one on each side of the car which is buoyant enough to float them and they'll have to take their chances outside we made all these arrangements while the rivulet gradually swelled into a torrent before it had become too broad and deep we managed to place the car with the sleds like outrider across the center of its course then we took our places and waited higher and higher rose the water while from the slopes behind and around us avalanches of ice descended and great cataracts began to leap and pour it was a mercy that we were so situated that the avalanches did not reach us although we received some pretty hard knocks from ice floes borne away in the current at last the stream became deep enough to float us shall i ever forget that moment there came a sudden wave of water forced on by a great slide of ice we were lifted upon its crest and away we went the car was more buoyant than i had believed possible the sleds fastened on each side served to give it a certain stability and it did not sink as deep as the bottom of the windows the latter though formed of glass of great thickness might have been broken by the tossing ice if they had not been divided into many small panes separated by bars of steel which projected a few inches on the outside i made that arrangement for meteoric frag- ments said edmund but i never thought of ice when i did it the dangers lessen as the ice melts the increasing force of the current soon sent us spinning down the valley we swept around the nearest ice peak on the left and as we passed under its projecting buttresses a fearful roar above informed us that an avalanche was let loose we could not withdraw our eyes from the win- dow on that side of the car and presently immense masses of ice came crashing into the water throw- ing it over us in floods and half drowning the poor wretches on the sleds still they clung on fastened together and we could do nothing to help them the uproar continued and the ice came down faster and faster with a deluge of water the car pitched and rolled until we could hardly keep our feet hanging on to every support within reach poor juba was a picture of abject terror he hung moaning to a bench his huge eyes aglow with fright suddenly the car seemed to be lifted from the water then it fell back again and was sub- merged so that we were buried in night we rose again to the surface and edmund glancing from the window shouted they're gone heaven have pity on them in spite of their fastenings the water and the ice had swept every living soul from the sled on the left we rushed to the other window it was the same story there--the sled on that side was empty too i saw a furry body tossed in the torrent along side and then it disappeared in the raging water at the same time edmund exclaimed heaven forgive me for bringing these poor crea- tures here to lose them chapter vii the children of the sun but the situation was too exciting to permit us to think long of the poor creatures whose deaths we had undoubtedly caused there seemed less than an even chance of our getting through ourselves as we went tossing and whirling on the water rose still higher and the blocks of ice assailed us on all sides first the sled on the left was torn loose then the other disappeared the car was left to make its own way but the loss of the sleds was a good thing now that their occupants were gone it eased off the weight and the car rose much higher in the water and gave room more readily when pressed by ice blocks it rolled more than before to be sure but still it was well ballasted and did not turn turtle it took one fearful plunge however over a perpendicu- lar fall of i should say twenty or thirty feet in height but the water was very deep and we came up again after the plunge like a cork and whirled off down the rapids the belt of storms at last the stream became so broad that the danger from the floating ice was to an extent relieved and we began to look about us more coolly as in all cases of long-continued peril we were becoming hardened by so many escapes and grow- ing more and more confident we had got out of the ice mountains by this time and the elevations about us were of no great height but we could see the glittering peaks towering far behind and it was a most appalling sight to watch many of the nearer hills suddenly sink collapse and disappear just as--if you have ever watched the operations of the cook in the kitchen when a boy--you have seen pinnacles of soft sugar melt down in water edmund said that all of the icy hills and mounds through which we were passing no doubt owed their existence to pressure from behind where the a columbus of space  sun never rose and where the ice was piled into actual mountains these foot-hills were in fact enormous glaciers thrust out toward the sunward hemisphere after a long time the river that bore us broad- ened out into a veritable lake the surface around became comparatively level and was all covered with the water the sun rose higher and higher as we approached it and the heat increased vast fields of ice floated in the great lake whose water was not muddy as it would have been if it had passed over soil but of crystal purity and won- derfully blue in the deep places and now we began to notice the wind again it came fitfully first from one direction and then from another at times it rose to the fury of a tempest and lifted the water into huge waves but the car rode them beautifully therein lies our greatest danger said edmund the current still sets in the same direction and i foresee that we shall be carried into a region where the contending winds will play perfect havoc the airships of venus it is the region where the hot air from the sunward side begins to descend and the cold air from the other side meets it it is a belt of storms and it may form a barrier more tremendous than the crystal mountains themselves we shall have all we can do to escape being cast away when we approach a shore--for shore of some kind there must be it came out nearly as he had anticipated except that the current gradually died away and we found ourselves driven about by the wind this continual- ly increased in force and at last the sky became choked with dense clouds which swept down upon the face of the waters and were whirled into black tornadoes by the circling blasts frequently the car was deluged by waterspouts and at such times when in the center of the gyrat- ing spouts it would actually be lifted clear into the air an ordinary vessel would have been unable to live five minutes in that hell of waters and of winds but the car went through it like a giant bubble i do not know how long all this lasted it might have been forty-eight hours the thing became worse and worse sometimes rain mingled with hail descended in vast sheets half of the time one window or the other was submerged and when we were able to look out we could see nothing but the awful clouds whipping the surface of the water but at length and with amazing quickness there came a change the clouds broke away brilliant sunlight streamed into the car and as we rocked first to one side and then to the other we caught glimpses of a marvelous dome high overhead it was not a blue vault such as we see on the earth it was of an indescribably soft grayish color and under it floated here and there delicate curtains of cloud like the mackerel skies that pre- cede a storm they were tinted like sheets of mother-of-pearl but although the light was bright no sunshine appeared the lake had now expanded into an apparently boundless sea whose surface had quieted down for the winds no longer blew with their former violence presently jack who was standing alone at one of the windows called to us we went to his side of the car and he pointed to something that glittered high up in the air what's that he asked what are those rather i demanded for i had caught sight of a dozen of the glittering objects ranged in an almost straight row at an elevation perhaps of two thousand feet and several miles away from us a new race of venustians nobody answered for a long time while we continued to gaze in astonishment even juba noticed the things with his moon eyes which did not suffer here quite as much as they had done in the sunshine at last edmund said those are air-ships air-ships yes nothing less an exploring expedition i shouldn't wonder i anticipated something of that kind you know already how dense the atmosphere of venus is it follows that balloons and air-ships can float much more easily here than over the earth i was prepared to find the inhabitants of venus skilled in aerial navigation and i'm not disap- pointed then you think that there are people in those things up there of course and i reckon that they've seen us and are going to investigate us it was a startling thought and i confess that i had to screw up my courage to be sure we had come here expecting to find inhabitants but i at least hadn't looked to meet them so soon and cer- tainly i was not expecting first to find them in the sky i felt like the hunter who goes after a grizzly and suddenly perceives his enemy staring down from a rock just over his head edmund was evidently correct in surmising that they had seen us some kind of signal flashed among the air-ships and they altered their course still keeping in line they began to advance in our direction at the same time gradually descending as they drew nearer we could make out some of their details the effect of loud sound in the dense atmosphere of the planet they were long and narrow and bore consider- able resemblance to airplanes which i had seen at home but they were much more complete they were evidently driven by screws and they seemed to be steered with great ease and certainty their approach was rapid when we first saw them they were probably three miles away but in the course of some minutes they had drawn so near that we could see their decks crowded with what certainly looked like human beings i felt a great relief in noticing that they bore no resemblance to the creatures we had en- countered on the night side of the planet but then came the disturbing thought--shall we be any safer because they are more like men with increase of intelligence comes increase of the power and often of the disposition to do evil however  amazing stories we had to face our fate whatever it might be it wasn't likely that they would begin by making an end of us their curiosity would first have to be satisfied they showed no apprehension why should they all that they saw as yet was an odd-looking affair floating on the water they might take it for some strange marine animal but they could never imagine that it contained intelligent beings whose eyes were watching them at length they came to rest within a hundred yards of the car then one of the air-ships settled gracefully down upon the water where it rose and fell with the swell as gently as a swan with some appearance of caution it began to approach us what should we do edmund answered the question in a practical manner without consulting the rest of us he threw open a window and stepped out upon a steel ledge running just beneath it you should have seen the astonishment of our inquisitors when they caught sight of him instantly they stopped the slow movement of their craft and gathered at its bow staring at edmund and making all sorts of strange gestures edmund repeated the same maneuvers that he had employed at the entrance of the cavern where we first landed hallo you he called out a beautiful woman in command his voice sounded like a tremendous crack and a momentary panic seized them they were evidently as unused to loud voices as were the crea- tures on the other side of the planet but they were not so easily cowed feeling themselves at a safe distance from the strange monster they held their ground we were not prepared for their next move if they had given no evidence of the abject fright that had overcome the creatures of the cavern when their ears were thus assailed they had at least shown that they were greatly startled and dis- turbed and we ascribed their comparative coolness to the fact that they were in a ship which they knew could take flight into the air at a moment's notice but we misjudged them or rather one of them to our surprise after the momentary effect of edmund's shout had passed they began again to approach us reading our souls then we saw that this maneuver was due to the commands of a person standing near the bow and our amazement may be imagined when we recognized--beyond all possibility of doubt-- that this person was a woman they were now within fifteen yards of us and every detail of the faces and figures was visible there were perhaps thirty persons on the air- ship which continued floating easily on the water and of these half a dozen were certainly women they stood in a group in front of the men and one of them as i have said by her commands directed the movements of the vessel jack whose irrepressible optimism had not been permanently affected by our recent terrible experiences ex- claimed as we all crowded at the window behind edmund amazons upon my word the women are in command here i should rather have expected to see mars leading the venuses not amazons in appearance i replied did you ever see any creatures more beautiful than those and indeed as the way of the approaching craft was stopped and it drifted very slowly nearer our eyes were fairly dazzled by the spectacle which those women presented their forms and faces were distinctly human in type but with a suggestion of something almost superhuman i particularly noticed their leader she was bewildering she seemed a madonna just descending from the sky and yet she was rather an aphrodite than a madonna her complexion was light with a flame upon the cheeks her hair a chestnut blond her eyes of a pure sapphire-blue seemed to radiate a light of their own i had never seen had never dreamed of such eyes they were more than eyes they were truly what the poets had imagined--win- dows of the soul such expression as they had i verily believe that they spoke i could feel a strange influence proceeding from them her dress and that of her companions was some- thing that i cannot describe farther than to say that it suggested the attire of a greek statue it was not the dress that terrestrial women would wear at the present time except perhaps in some remote pacific island but it revealed and enhanced the beauty of the wearer in a manner that would have driven an artist wild with admiration in the presence of this vision we had no eyes for the men in the background and yet as a glance showed they were no less remarkable for physical attractions they were of about the average human stature and very perfectly formed with attire as classically simple as that of their beautiful companions we were all so lost in amazement and admiration that even edmund seemed to have been struck dumb and motionless not knowing what to do the craft drifted within four or five yards of the car and then the woman who commanded it slowly lifted her right hand revealing a glittering bracelet of gems upon her white wrist and with a smile of indescribable winningness made a mo- tion which said as plainly as words could have done strangers you are welcome chapter viii an adventure in the air i must hurry on to what followed that first meeting on the sea the events were so won- derful they so transcended all human exper- ience that to relate them in detail would require volumes and among them there are things impos- sible to describe because so entirely without ter- restrial analogy it was now that we first became completely aware a columbus of space  of the existence of that incredible power of com- municating thought without the intervention of spoken language to which i have before referred it might perhaps be described as a kind of telepathy i have already told you that at the first glance into the eyes of the aphrodite who com- manded the air-craft i felt that in some strange manner those eyes could speak and so they could they all had a language of the eyes--or at least a language that seemed to radiate from them i thought of the speculations of a german enthusiast that i had read concerning odic force and yet they spoke with their lips also in low soft tones exceedingly agreeable to the ear but this language of sounds was only a subsidiary method of communication the other was the tongue of nature and we felt that our minds could comprehend it although at first only in a dim un- certain way we did not know exactly how to reply but they understood us a language and no language they seemed to read our souls we had only to think what we would say and with amaz- ing readiness they interpreted many of our thoughts it was mind-reading carried to perfec- tion so no long time had elapsed before an astonish- ing degree of mutual comprehension was estab- lished juba comprehended even quicker than we did which was but natural and yet these blond clean-skinned people were as much astonished at his appearance as at ours it was evident that the inhabitants of the two sides of this strange world had never before en- countered one another still they seemed to under- stand instinctively that juba for all his extraor- dinary features and his baboon-like form was more closely allied to them than to us edmund who so greatly excelled the rest of us in intellectual force made rapid progress in the unparalleled intercourse which now began to our surprise it was not long before he told us the name of the beautiful commander or one of them for he said she seemed to have several names--one or more of which he thought might be titles they call her ala he said at least that is as near as i can pronounce it and we may as well accept that for her name as soon as it became evident that we had nothing to fear from these people--at least for the present --jack's enthusiasm knew no bounds jove edmund he said but i thank you for bringing me here this is venus without a doubt later i shall tell you more about that wonderful language which was at the same time no language and all language--for it developed into things in- finitely more incredible than any that i have yet related but enough for the present you can now comprehend how it was that land- ing in another world we were able so soon to establish an understanding and even an intimacy with its inhabitants believe me on the earth no- body has yet begun to dream what mind means edmund soon made ala understand that we wished to journey into the lands lying beyond the shores of the sea he told us afterward that his conjecture had been right and that the air-ships were really on an exploring expedition along the borders of the world of light because the inhabi- tants on that side of venus had a great curiosity to know what lay beyond the storms and clouds in the mysterious empire of night evidently it was the violent tempests which pre- vailed near the crystal mountains that prevented the passage of their aerial craft the mountains themselves they had never seen but they felt that they had made a discovery of the first magnitude in finding us for they took us to be inhabitants of the other side of the planet although they were puzzled by the manifest difference between juba and the rest a magnificent reception i may say here that although the light was more diffused and softer under the cloudlike dome than in the sunshine that prevails on the earth juba's huge eyes suffered so much that we contrived for him a mask to protect them later on he became better able to bear the light feeling that their expedition had been crowned with unlooked-for success our new friends were ready to gratify edmund's desire by hurrying back to their home only one difficulty was encountered at the start edmund refused absolutely to abandon the car it was of course indispensable to us and he was sure that he could repair the apparatus once in possession of the materials that he required finally it was arranged that the car should be at- tached to one of the airships and towed after it as we had towed the sleds but ala insisted that we should become her guests on her yacht as jack called it and we gladly consented we saw no danger and apprehended none imme- diately nevertheless we kept our automatic pis- tols in our pockets and each also armed himself with an automatic repeating-rifle our hosts showed no special curiosity about these things the nature of which they did not understand the airships were extremely ingenious ed- mund examined the one we were on from stem to stern and i have no doubt that when he was through he understood it quite as well as its build- ers did it was lucky that he did if they had my secret he said to us they would be incomparable they are a great people all the more pity that you brought nothing better than automatic arms said jack i don't believe that they have anything as good in that line edmund replied from what i can make out they are not much given to fighting we made rapid progress and after twenty-four hours came in sight of land the coast was not high but far beyond it we could see ranges of mountains and apparently ris- ing from the foot-hills of these mountains there were visible curious objects the nature of which we could not make out from so great a distance they resembled immense floating cobwebs as much as anything that i can liken them to ed- mund tried to find out from ala what it was that continued on page  the empire of the ants by  hg wells author of the crystal egg the man who could work miracles etc he did not see them actually rush for the lieutenantbut he has no doubt they did make a concerted rush suddenly the lieutenant was shouting and cursing and beating his legs i'm stung he shouted with a face of hate and accusation  the empire of the ants  i the great river when captain gerilleau received instruc- tions to take his new gunboat the ben- jamin constant to badama on the batemo arm of the guaramadema and there assist the inhabitants against a plague of ants he suspected the authorities of mockery his promotion had been romantic and irregular the affections of a prominent brazilian lady and the captain's liquid eyes had played a part in the process and the diario and o futuro had been lamentably disrespectful in their comments he felt he was to give further occasion for disre spect he was a creole his conceptions of etiquette and discipline were pure-blooded portuguese and it was only to holroyd the lancashire engineer who had come over with the boat and as an exercise in the use of english--his th sounds were very uncer- tain---that he opened his heart  it is in effect he said to make me absurd what can a man do against ants dey come dey go they say said holroyd that these don't go that chap you said was a sambo- zambo--it is a sort of mixture of blood sambo he said the people are going the captain smoked fretfully for a time dese tings ave to happen he said at last what is it plagues of ants and suchlike as god wills dere was a plague in trinidad--the little ants that carry leaves all der orange-trees all der mangoes what does it matter sometimes ant armies come into your houses--fighting ants a different sort you go and they clean the house then you come back again--the house is clean like new no cockroaches no fleas no jiggers in the floor that sambo chap said holroyd says these are a different sort of ant the captain shrugged his shoulders fumed and gave his attention to a cigarette afterwards he reopened the subject my dear olroyd what am i to do about dese infernal ants six days up the amazon the captain reflected it is ridiculous he said but in the afternoon he put on his full uniform and went ashore and jars and boxes came back to the ship and subsequently he did and holyroyd sat on deck in the evening coolness and smoked profoundly and marvelled at brazil they were six days up the amazon some hundreds of miles from the ocean and east and west of him there was a horizon like the sea and to the south nothing but a sand-bank island with some tufts of scrub the water was always running like a sluice thick with dirt animated with crocodiles and hovering birds and few by some in- a well-known entomologist once made the remark that if the insect world instead of fighting each other should suddenly decide to fight the human race we should all soon be annihilated we know the tremendous power for organization among the ants and we also know that they have readied a pretty high stage of civilization for one thing they seem to be able to govern themselves much better than we can ourselves in the tropical countries there are many species of giant and poisonous ants existing even now and they are well known for their ravages and for their destructive power we can only wish that the bril- liant story penned here by our famous author will never come true exhaustible source of tree trunks and the waste of it the headlong waste of it filled his soul the town of alemquer with its meagre church its thatched sheds for houses its discoloured ruins of ampler days seemed a little thing lost in this wilderness of nature a sixpence dropped on sahara he was a young man this was his first sight of the tropics he came straight from england where nature is hedged ditched and drained into the perfection of submission and he had suddenly discovered the in- significance of man for six days they had been steaming up from the sea by unfrequented channels and man had been as rare as a rare butterfly one saw one day a canoe another day a distant station the next no men at all he began to perceive that man is indeed a rare animal having but a precarious hold upon this land he perceived it more clearly as the days passed and he made his devious way to the batemo in the company of this remarkable commander who ruled over one big gun and was forbidden to waste his ammunition holroyd was learning spanish in- dustriously but he was still in the present tense and substantive stage of speech and the only other person who had any words of english was a negro stoker who had them all wrong the second in command was a portuguese da cunha who spoke french but it was a different sort of french from the french holroyd had learnt in southport and their intercourse was confined to politenesses and simple propositions about the weather and the weather like everything else in this amazing new world the weather had no human aspect and was hot by night and hot by day and the air was steam even the wind was hot steam smelling of vegetation in decay and the alligators and the strange birds the flies of many sorts and sizes the beetles the ants the snakes and monkeys seemed to wonder what man was doing in an atmosphere that had no gladness in its sunshine and no coolness in its night to wear clothing was intoler- able but to cast it aside was to scorch by day and expose an ampler area to the mosquitoes by night to go on deck by day was to be blinded by glare and to stay below was to suffoc- ate and in the daytime came certain flies ex- tremely clever and noxious about one's wrist and ankle captain gerilleau who was holroyd's sole distraction from these physical distresses developed into a formid- able bore telling the simple story of his heart's affection day by day a string of anonymous women as if he were telling beads sometimes he sug- gested sport and they shot at alligators and at rare intervals they came to human aggregations in the waste of trees and stayed for a day or so and drank and sat about and one night danced with creole girls who found holroyd's poor elements of spanish without either past tense or future amply  amazing stories sufficient for their purposes but these were mere luminous chinks in the long gray passage of the streaming river up which the throbbing engines beat a certain liberal heathen deity in the shape of a demi-john held seductive court aft and it is probable forward but gerilleau learnt things about the ants more things and more at this stopping-place and that and became interested in his mission dey are a new sort of ant he said we have got to be--what do you call it--entomologie big five centimetres some bigger it is ridiculous we are like the monkeys--sent to pick insects but dey are eating up the country the fatal ants he burst out indignantly suppose--suddenly there are complications with europe here and i--soon we shall be above the bio negro--and my gun useless he nursed his knee and mused dose people who were dere at de dancing place dey ave come down dey ave lost all they got de ants come to deir house one afternoon every one run out you know when de ants come one must-- every one runs out and they go over the house if you stayed they'd eat you see well presently dey go back dey say the ants ave gone  de ants aven't gone dey try to go in--de son e goes in de ants fight swarm over him bita im presently he comes out again-- screaming and running he runs past them to the river see he gets into de water and drowns de ants--yes gerilleau paused brought his liquid eyes close to holroyd's face tapped holroyd's knee with his knuckle that night he dies just as if he was stung by a snake poisoned--by the ants who knows gerilleau shrugged his shoulders perhaps they bit him badly when i joined dis service i joined to fight men dese things dese ants dey come and go it is no business for men after that he talked frequently of the ants to holroyd and whenever they chanced to drift against any speck of humanity in that waste of water and sunshine and distant trees holroyd's improving knowledge of the language enabled him to recognise the ascendant word sauba more and more com- pletely dominating the whole he perceived the ants were becoming interesting and the nearer he drew to them the more interesting they became gerilleau abandoned his old themes almost suddenly and the portuguese lieutenant be- came a conversational figure he knew something about the leaf-cutting ant and expanded his knowl- edge gerilleau sometimes rendered what he had to tell to holroyd he told of the little workers that swarm and fight and the big workers that command and rule and how these latter always crawled to the neck and how their bites drew blood he told how they cut leaves and made fungus beds and how their nests in caracas are sometimes a hundred yards across two days the three men spent disputing whether ants have eyes the dis- cussion grew dangerously heated on the second afternoon and holroyd saved the situation by going ashore in a boat to catch ants and see he cap- tured various specimens and returned and some had eyes and some hadn't also they argued do ants bite or sting dese ants said gerilleau after collecting in- formation at a rancho have big eyes they don't run about blind--not as most ants do no dey get in corners and watch what you do and they sting asked holroyd yes dey sting dere is poison in the sting he meditated i do not see what men can do against ants dey come and go but these don't go they will said gerilleau the hopeless wilderness past tamandu there is a long low coast of eighty miles without any population and then one comes to the confluence of the main river and the batemo arm like a great lake and then the forest came nearer came at last intimately near the character of the channel changes snags abound and the benjamin constant moored by a cable that night under the very shadow of dark trees for the first time for many days came a spell of cool- ness and holroyd and gerilleau sat late smoking cigars and enjoying this delicious sensation geril- leau's mind was full of ants and what they could do he decided to sleep at last and lay down on a mattress on deck a man hopelessly perplexed his last words when he already seemed asleep were to ask with a flourish of despair what can one do with ants  de whole thing is absurd holroyd was left to scratch his bitten wrists and meditate alone he sat on the bulwark and listened to the little changes in gerilleau's breathing until he was fast asleep and then the ripple and lap of the stream took his mind and brought back that sense of im- mensity that had been growing upon him since first he had left para and come up the river the monitor showed but one small light and there was first a little talking forward and then stillness his eyes went from the dim black outlines of the middle works of the gunboat towards the bank to the black overwhelming mysteries of forest lit now and then by a fire-fly and never still from the murmur of alien and mysterious activities it was the inhuman immensity of this land that astonished and oppressed him he knew the skies were empty of men the stars were specks in an incredible vastness of space he knew the ocean was enormous and untamable but in england he had come to think of the land as man's in eng- land it is indeed man's the wild things live by sufferance grow on lease everywhere the roads the fences and absolute security runs in an atlas too the land is man's and all coloured to show his claim to it--in vivid contrast to the universal independent blueness of the sea he had taken it for granted that a day would come when everywhere about the earth plough and culture light tramways and good roads an ordered security would prevail but now he doubted the empire of the ants  the ants the real masters of the country this forest was interminable it had an air of being invincible and man seemed at best an infrequent precarious intruder one travelled for miles amidst the still silent struggle of giant trees of strangulating creepers of assertive flowers everywhere the alligator the turtle and endless varieties of birds and insects seemed at home dwelt irreplaceably--but man man at most held a footing upon resentful clearings fought weeds fought beasts and insects for the barest foothold fell a prey to snake and beast insect and fever and was presently carried away in many places down the river he had been manifestly driven back this de- serted creek or that preserved the name of a casa and here and there ruinous white walls and a shat- tered tower enforced the lesson the puma the jaguar were more the masters here who were the real masters in a few miles of this forest there must be more ants than there are men in the whole world this seemed to holroyd a perfectly new idea in a few thousand years men had emerged from barbarism to a stage of civilisation that made them feel lords of the future and masters of the earth but what was to prevent the ants evolving also such ants as one knew lived in little communities of a few thousand individuals made no concerted efforts against the greater world but they had a lan- guage they had an intelligence why should things stop at that any more than men had stopped at the barbaric stage suppose presently the ants began to store knowledge just as men had done by means of books and records use weapons form great em- pires sustain a planned and organised war things came back to him that gerilleau had gathered about these ants they were approaching they used a poison like the poison of snakes they obeyed greater leaders even as the leaf-cutting ants do they were carnivorous and where they came they stayed    the forest was very still the water lapped in- cessantly against the side about the lantern over- head there eddied a noiseless whirl of phantom moths gerilleau stirred in the darkness and sighed what can one do he murmured and turned over and was still again holroyd was roused from meditations that were becoming sinister by the hum of a mosquito ii the ants in command of the canoe the next morning holroyd learned they were within forty kilometres of badama and his interest in the banks intensified he came up whenever an opportunity offered to examine the surroundings he could see no signs of human occupation whatever save for a weedy ruin of a house and the green-stained facade of the long- deserted monastery at moju with a forest tree growing out of a vacant window space and great creepers netted across its vacant portals several flights of strange yellow butterfles with semi- transparent wings crossed the river that morning and many alighted on the monitor and were killed by the men it was towards afternoon that they came upon the derelict cuberta she did not at first appear to be derelict both her sails were set and hanging slack in the after- noon calm and there was the figure of a man sitting on the fore planking beside the shipped sweeps an- other man appeared to be sleeping face downwards on the sort of longitudinal bridge these big canoes have in the waist but it was presently apparent from the sway of her rudder and the way she drifted into the course of the gunboat that something was out of order with her gerilleau surveyed her through a field-glass and became interested in the queer darkness of the face of the sitting man a red- faced man he seemed without a nose--crouching he was rather than sitting and the longer the cap- tain looked the less he liked to look at him and the less able he was to take his glasses away but he did so at last and went a little way to call up holroyd then he went back to hail the cuberta he hailed her again and so she drove past him santa rosa stood out clearly as her name as she came by and into the wake of the monitor she pitched a little and suddenly the figure of the crouching man collapsed as though all its joints had given way his hat fell off his head was not nice to look at and his body flopped lax and rolled out of sight behind the bulwarks caramba cried gerilleau and resorted to hol- royd forthwith holroyd was half-way up the companion did you see dat said the captain dead said holroyd yees you'd better send a boat aboard there's something wrong did you--by any chance--see his face what was it like it was--ugh--i have no words and the cap- tain suddenly turned his back on holroyd and be- came an active and strident commander the dead men on the canoe the gunboat came about steamed parallel to the erratic course of the canoe and dropped the boat with lieutenant de cunha and three sailors to board her then the curiosity of the captain made him draw up almost alongside as the lieu- tenant got aboard so that the whole of the santa rosa deck and hold was visible to holroyd he saw now clearly that the sole crew of the vessel was these two dead men and though he could not see their faces he saw by their outstretched hands which were all of ragged flesh that they had been subjected to some strange exceptional process of decay for a moment his attention con- centrated on those two enigmatical bundles of dirty clothes and laxly flung limbs and then his eyes went forward to discover the open hold piled high with trunks and cases and aft to where the little cabin gaped inexplicably empty then he became aware that the planks of the middle decking were dotted with moving black specks his attention was riveted by these specks they were all walking in directions radiating from the fallen man in a manner--the image came unsought to his mind--like the crowd dispersing from a bull- fight house canoe  amazing stories he became aware of gerilleau beside him capo he said have you your glasses can you focus as closely as those planks there gerilleau made an effort grunted and handed him the glasses there followed a moment of scrutiny it's ants said the englishman and handed the focused field- glass back to gerilleau his impression of them was of a crowd of large black ants very like ordinary ants except for their size and for the fact that some of the larger of them bore a sort of clothing of gray but at the time his inspection was too brief for particulars the head of lieutenant da cunha appeared over the side of the cuberta and a brief colloquy ensued you must go aboard said gerilleau the lieutenant objected that the boat was full of ants you have your boots said gerilleau the lieutenant changed the subject how did these men die he asked captain gerilleau embarked upon speculations that holroyd could not follow and the two men disputed with a certain increasing vehemence hol- royd took up the field-glass and resumed his scrutiny first of the ants and then of the dead man amidships he has described these ants to me very par- ticularly the lieutenant goes on board the canoe he says they were as large as any ants he has ever seen black and moving with a steady deliberation very different from the mechanical fussiness of the common ant about one in twenty was much larger than its fellows and with an ex- ceptionally large head these reminded him at once of the master workers who are said to rule over the leaf-cutter ants like them they seemed to be directing and co-ordinating the general movements they tilted their bodies back in a manner altogether singular as if they made some use of the fore feet and he had a curious fancy that he was too far off to verify that most of these ants of both kinds were wearing accoutrements had things strapped about their bodies by bright white bands like white metal threads he put down the glasses abruptly realising that the question of discipline between the captain and his subordinate had become acute it is your duty said the captain to go aboard it is my instructions the lieutenant seemed on the verge of refusing the head of one of the mulatto sailors appeared beside him i believe these men were killed by the ants said holroyd abruptly in english the captain burst into a rage he made no an- swer to holroyd i have commanded you to go aboard he screamed to his subordinate in portu- guese if you do not go aboard forthwith it is mutiny--rank mutiny mutiny and cowardice where is the courage that should animate us i will have you in irons i will have you shot like a dog he began a torrent of abuse and curses he danced to and fro he shook his fist he be- haved as if beside himself with rage and the lieu- tenant white and still stood looking at him the crew appeared forward with amazed faces suddenly in a pause of this outbreak the lieu- tenant came to some heroic decision saluted drew himself together and clambered upon the deck of the cuberta ah said gerilleau and his mouth shut like a trap holroyd saw the ants retreating before da cunha's boots the portuguese walked slowly to the fallen man stooped down hesitated clutched his coat and turned him over a black swarm of ants rushed out of the clothes and da cunha stepped back very quickly and trod two or three times on the deck holroyd put up the glasses he saw the scattered ants about the invader's feet and doing what he had never seen ants doing before they had nothing of the blind movements of the common ant they were looking at him--as a rallying crowd of men might look at some gigantic monster that had dispersed it how did he die the captain shouted holroyd understood the portuguese to say the body was too much eaten to tell what is there forward asked gerilleau the death of the lieutenant the lieutenant walked a few paces and began his answer in portuguese he stopped abrupt- ly and beat off something from his leg he made some peculiar steps as if he was trying to stamp on something invisible and went quickly towards the side then he controlled himself turned about walked deliberately forward to the hold clambered up to the fore decking from which the sweeps are worked stooped for a time over the second man groaned audibly and made his way back and aft to the cabin moving very rigidly he turned and began a conversation with his captain cold and respectful in tone on either side contrasting vividly with the wrath and insult of a few moments before holroyd gathered only fragments of its purport he reverted to the field-glass and was surprised to find the ants had vanished from all the exposed surfaces of the deck he turned towards the shadows beneath the decking and it seemed to him they were full of watching eyes the cuberta it was agreed was derelict but too full of ants to put men aboard to sit and sleep it must be towed the lieutenant went forward to take in and adjust the cable and the men in the boat stood up to be ready to help him holroyd's glasses searched the canoe he became more and more impressed by the fact that a great if minute and furtive activity was going on he perceived that a number of gigantic ants-- they seemed nearly a couple of inches in length-- carrying oddly-shaped burthens for which he could imagine no use--were moving in rushes from one point of obscurity to another they did not move in columns across the exposed places but in open spaced-out lines oddly suggestive of the rushes of modern infantry advancing under fire a number were taking cover under the dead man's clothes and a perfect swarm was gathering along the side over which da cunha must presently go he did not see them actually rush for the lieu- tenant as he returned but he has no doubt they the empire of the ants  did make a concerted rush suddenly the lieutenant was shouting and cursing and beating at his legs i'm stung he shouted with a face of hate and accusation towards gerilleau then he vanished over the side dropped into his boat and plunged at pnce into the water holroyd heard the splash the three men in the boat pulled him out and brought him aboard and that night he died iii the sinister canoe holroyd and the captain came out of the cabin in which the swollen and contorted body of the lieutenant lay and stood to- gether at the stern of the monitor staring at the sinister vessel they trailed behind them it was a close dark night that had only phantom flickerings of sheet lightning to illuminate it the cuberta a vague black triangle rocked about in the steamer's wake her sails bobbing and flapping and the black smoke from the funnels spark-lit ever and again streamed over her swaying masts gerilleau's mind was inclined to run on the un- kind things the lieutenant had said in the heat of his last fever he says i murdered im he protested it is simply absurd some one ad to go aboard are we to run away from these confounded ants when- ever they show up holroyd said nothing he was thinking of a dis- ciplined rush of little black shapes across bare sun- lit planking it was his place to go harped gerilleau he died in the execution of his duty what has he to complain of murdered    but the poor fellow was--what is it--demented he was not in his right mind the poison swelled him  u'm they came to a long silence we will sink that canoe--burn it and then the inquiry irritated gerilleau his shoulders went up his hands flew out at right angles from his body what is one to do he said his voice going up to an angry squeak anyhow he broke out vindictively every ant in dat cuberta--i will burn dem alive holroyd was not moved to conversation a dis- tant ululation of howling monkeys filled the sultry night with foreboding sounds and as the gunboat drew near the black mysterious banks this was re- inforced by a depressing clamour of frogs burning the canoe what is one to do the captain repeated after a vast interval and suddenly becom- ing active and savage and blasphemous decided to burn the santa rosa without further delay every one aboard was pleased by that idea every one helped with zest they pulled in the cable cut it and dropped the boat and fired her with tow and kerosene and soon the cuberta was crackling and flaring merrily amidst the immensities of the tropi- cal night holroyd watched the mounting yellow flare against the blackness and the livid flashes of sheet lightning that came and went above the forest sum- mits throwing them into momentary silhouette and his stoker stood behind him watching also the stoker was stirred to the depths of his lin- guistics sauba go pop pop he said wahaw and laughed richly but holroyd was thinking that these little crea- tures on the decked canoe had also eyes and brains the whole thing impressed him as incredibly foolish and wrong but--what was one to do this question came back enormously reinforced on the morrow when at last the gunboat reached badama the deserted village this place with its leaf-thatch-covered houses and sheds its creeper-invaded sugar-mill its little jetty of timber and canes was very still in the morning heat and showed never a sign of living men whatever ants there were at that distance were too small to see all the people have gone said gerilleau but we will do one thing anyhow we will oot and vissel so holroyd hooted and whistled then the captain fell into a doubting fit of the worst kind dere is one thing we can do he said presently what's that said holroyd oot and vissel again so they did the captain walked his deck and gesticulated to himself he seemed to have many things on his mind fragments of speeches came from his lips he appeared to be addressing some imaginary pub- lic tribunal either in spanish or portuguese hol- royd's improving ear detected something about am- munition he came out of these preoccupations suddenly into english my dear olroyd he cried and broke off with but what can one do they took the boat and the field-glasses and went close in to examine the place they made out a number of big ants whose still postures had a certain effect of watching them dotted about the edge of the rude embarkation jetty gerilleau tried ineffectual pistol shots at these holroyd thinks he distinguished curious earthworks running between the nearer houses that may have been the work of the insect conquerors of those human habitations the explorers pulled past the jetty and became aware of a human skeleton wearing a loin cloth and very bright and clean and shining lying beyond they came to a pause regarding this i ave all dose lives to consider said gerilleau suddenly holroyd turned and stared at the captain realis- ing slowly that he referred to the unappetising mix- ture of races that constituted his crew to send a landing party--it is impossible--im- possible they will be poisoned they will swell they will swell up and abuse me and die it is totally impossible  if we land i must land alone in thick boot and with my life in my hand perhaps i should live or again--i might not land i do not know i do not know holroyd thought he did but he said nothing de whole thing said gerilleau suddenly as been got up to make me ridiculous de whole thing  amazing stories bombarding the ants--a strange decision they paddled about and regarded the clean white skeleton from various points of view and then they returned to the gunboat then gerillau's indecisions became terrible steam was got up and in the afternoon the monitor went on up the river with an air of going to ask somebody something and by sunset came back again and anchored a thunderstorm gathered and broke furiously and then the night became beautifully cool and quiet and every one slept on deck except gerilleau who tossed about and muttered in the dawn he awak- ened holroyd lord said holroyd what now i have decided said the captain what--to land said holroyd sitting up brightly no said the captain and was for a time very reserved i have decided he repeated and hol- royd manifested symptoms of impatience well--yes said the captain i shall fire de big gun and he did heaven knows what the ants thought of it but he did he fired it twice with great sternness and ceremony all the crew had wadding in their ears and there was an effect of going into action about the whole affair and first they hit and wrecked the old sugar-mill and then they smashed the abandoned store behind the jetty and then gerilleau experienced the inevitable re- action it is no good he said to holroyd no good at all no sort of bally good we must go back-- for instructions dere will be de devil of a row about dis ammunition--oh de devil of a row you don't know olroyd he stood regarding the world in infinite perplex- ity for a space but what else was there to do he cried in the afternoon the monitor started down-stream again and in the evening a landing party took the body of the lieutenant and buried it on the bank upon which the new ants had so far not ap- peared    iv the conclusion i heard this story in a fragmentary state from holroyd not three weeks ago these new ants have got into his brain and he has come back to england with the idea as he says of exciting people about them before it is too late he said they threaten british guiana which cannot be much over a trifle of a thousand miles from their present sphere of activity and that the colonial office ought to get to work upon them at once he declaims with great passion these are intelligent ants just think what that means there can be no doubt they are a serious pest and that the brazilian government is well advised in offering a prize of five hundred pounds for some effectual method of extirpation it is certain too that since they first appeared in the hills beyond badama about three years ago they have achieved extraordinary conquests the whole of the south bank of the batemo river for nearly sixty miles they have in their effectual occupation they have driven men out completely occupied plantations and settlements and boarded and captured at least one ship it is even said they have in some inexplicable way bridged the very considerable capuarana arm and pushed many miles towards the amazon itself there can be little doubt that they are far more reasonable and with a far better social organisation than any previously known ant species instead of being in dispersed societies they are organised into what is in effect a single nation but their peculiar and immediate formidableness lies not so much in this as in the intelligent use they make of poison against their larger enemies it would seem this poison of theirs is closely akin to snake poison and it is highly probable they actually manufacture it and that the larger individuals among them carry the needle-like crystals of it in their attacks upon men what will the ants do in the future of course it is extremely difficult to get any detailed information about these new com- petitors for the sovereignty of the globe no eye- witnesses of their activity except for such glimpses as holroyd's have survived the encounter the most extraordinary legends of their prowess and capacity are in circulation in the region of the upper amazon and grow daily as the steady advance of the invader stimulates men's imaginations through their fears these strange little creatures are credited not only with the use of implements and a knowledge of fire and metals and with or- ganised feats of engineering that stagger our northern minds--unused as we are to such feats as that of the saubas of rio de janeiro who in  drove a tunnel under the parahyba where it is as wide as the thames at london bridge--but with an organised and detailed method of record and communication analogous to our books so far their action has been a steady progressive settle- ment involving the flight or slaughter of every human being in the new areas they invade they are increasing rapidly in numbers and holroyd at least is firmly convinced that they will finally dis- possess man over the whole of tropical south america and why should they stop at tropical south america well there they are anyhow by  or there- abouts if they go on as they are doing they ought to strike the capuarana extension railway and force themselves upon the attention of the european capitalist by  they will be half-way down the amazon i fix  or  at the latest for their discovery of europe the end the scientific adventures of mr fosdick by  jacque morgan the international electro-galvanic undertaking corporation mr fosdick had succeeded in lifting him out of the trough and had balanced him on one foot - a winged mercury of bright shinging copper splendid he ejaculated and gazed at his handiwork admiringly mr fosdick interests an old victim in one of his new inventions the first two envelopes contained only circulars but from the third dropped a bright yellow slip of paper and as eben stetzle loafing in the tinshop during the noon hour picked it up from the floor and handed it to mr fosdick he saw that it was a check signed by the ajax manu- facturing company and that it called for four hundred and twenty dollars in real money last month's royalties on my curling iron carelessly ex- plained the inventor he always spoke of the de- vice as a curling-iron although it was advertised and sold by the manufacturing company as a nut-cracker mr stetzle sighed gee i wish i could get in on some- thing like that running a dr fosdick who we know is a friend of our readers after his experiments with the seidlizsmobile and the feline electric plant takes a new departure and proposes to electroplate the dead in order to preserve them as beautiful statues for posterity although the author of this story is a comical genius his idea is certainly a beauti- ful one but he gives it a very funny touch and the reader will find that for sustained interest and pure comedy it is equal to the preceding stories which we have been fortu- nate enough to obtain chop mill is a mighty slow method of getting rich the sight of the check removed the last trace of bitterness that had lingered in eben's heart since his unhappy experience with the feline light and power company i should like to get in on the next good thing you get up he continued eyeing the check that protruded from mr fosdick's waistcoat pocket but of course i'm not going in on any more elec- trified cats the very sight of a cat makes me shudder even now mr fosdick gazed at his friend pensively i have been thinking he said of the or- ganization of a company that will make standard oil look like a penny savings bank eben stetzle drew in his breath with audible inquisitive- ness what is it what is it he demanded mr fosdick smiled blandly yes what is it he mimicked   amazing stories genially you don't think i'm going to divulge a secret that's worth millions do you eben's face fell i thought you'd let an old friend in--a brother lodge member he said wist- fully and at the same time eben formed his hands into the distress signal of the order mr fosdick pondered his lodge was to him a thing sacred every wednesday night in the hall over lem whitley's grocery store mr fosdick sat in state he was the presiding officer and the thun- der of his voice as he read the ritual to the trembling neophytes was a thing that was very dear to him and eben had given him the grand hailing sign brother stetzle he said at last i'm going to tell you--and what's more i'm going to let you in mr stetzle leaned forward and with great enthu- siasm gave mr fosdick the grip brother he exclaimed picking up his textbook electricity at a glance mr fosdick turned the pages until he came to the following paragraph flowers and even insects can be preserved in- definitely by powdering them with graphite and then depositing a thin film of copper over them by means of a plating battery does that mean anything to you his voice was tense with feeling mr stetzle read the paragraph and slowly shook his head who would want to preserve insects indefinitely i just hate the sight of em and eben scratched his back as though the very suggestion brought back unpleasant memories mr fosdick smiled tolerantly you are deficient in imagination eben he leaned forward and whispered what would you say to a scheme of using the principle for undertaking purposes mr stetzle failed to grasp the significance of the question i don't know of any insect undertakers--of course there's fellows in the big cities that make a business of killing- but i mean for men--for human beings preserving the dead a beautiful silver statue eben shook his head hopelessly i just can't quite get you mr fosdick sank back in his chair with almost a feeling of disgust he surveyed his unimiginative lodge brother for a long minute and then straighten- ing up outlined his scheme in words of few syllables it's like this eben he began if insects can be copper-plated human beings can be copper-plated and if a human being can be plated he or she can be preserved indefinitely--and with absolute fidelity as to face and form you take the old egyptian mummies--what are they to-day why just crumbling shells that don't look like anything but suppose those bodies had been electroplated why they would simply be statues of their original selves mr stetzle nodded i begin to understand now he said listen we'd simply make every corpse its own monument mount the monument on a cheap con- crete base and stand it up in the cemetery no ex- cavating no coffin no box--nothing but the monu- ment itself think of the saving the cadavers can be plated not planted at an expense of three dollars apiece--we can get fifty or even a hundred and there are annually over one and a half million deaths a year in this country alone suppose we only made a profit of ten dollars apiece the total is fifteen million for the united states annually add to that the profits on the undertaking of seven million funerals throughout the balance of the civi- lized world can you grasp it why eben a hun- dred thousand a day would be nothing mr stetzle sat as one in a trance it's over- powering he gasped mr fosdick smiled why i haven't begun yet as a matter of fact the profit per job of the inter- national electro-galvanic undertaking corporation --that will be the name of the concern--will be more like fifty dollars than ten and even more listen only the cheaper grades of corpses will be finished in copper the majority will be nickel-plated silver will be used for those of moderate means and gold for the aristocrats the proprietor of the chop-mill was speechless and just think what a handsome place the new cemeteries will be of a sunny morning copper nickel silver and gold statues all sprinkled about cheerful is no word for it why man they'd be- come amusement parks mr fosdick softly drummed his fingers upon the arm of his chair while he allowed the idea to sink in i've thought of a splendid new feature to the scheme suddenly said mr stetzle how would it do to have mounted in the statue somewhere a phonograph with a cylinder of last words or a song or a recitation--you remember how clem titus that's dead and gone now used to recite every time he got drunk goodbye jim take keer of your- self well that's the idea by pulling a string the phonograph reels out anything that was character- istic of the deceased old man fisher used to cuss the administration- i think that would be undignified interrupted mr fosdick a thousand of your confounded phono- graphs working at full blast--songs recitations speeches and so on why it would be noisier than coney island the enthusiasm of the new idea slowly faded from mr stetzle's face and he subsided well said he after a silence of some minutes when do we try it as soon as we can get a corpse must we wait there hasn't been a death in whiffleville in five years mr fosdick had not thought of that for a mo- ment his dream was shattered and then with the re- sourcefulness of the true inventor he thought of a way to overcome the difficulty no said he we will not wait we will try the scheme upon a living person--you mr stetzle paled i'd rather not he protested weakly i'm too fat and wouldn't look good the first statue will be you declared mr fos- dick why man it will be an honor but i don't want my ears and eyes and nose stopped up with no dodgasted copper-plating pro- tested eben once more mr fosdick's resourceful brain came to the rescue you will only be plated from the neck down the scientific adventures of mr fosdick  there was no escape mr fosdick was adamant and it was with great reluctance that mr stetzle finally agreed to submit to the experiment to-morrow said mr fosdick the embalming vat--the plating bath i should say--will be ready for you mr fosdick's associate to be experimented on the wooden trough borrowed for the occasion from jasper wilcox's hog-lot contained a solu- tion of copper sulphate the telegraph company through the agency of hi scruggs the local opera- tor had loaned the batteries and moses galblat had contributed the slab of copper junk to be used for the anode--in consideration of the sum of four dollars and eighteen cents everything was ready and at the quiet word of command from the chief engineer of the interna- tional electro-galvanic undertaking corporation mr stetzle quickly divested himself of his clothing and assisted mr fosdick who briskly began to pow- der the rotund form with graphite makes me look like a nigger-- i--i suppose it will come off all right remarked mr stetzle dubi- ously certainly it's just a matter of a little soap and water said the inventor smiling as he caught a distorted reflection of himself upon the highly polished surface of mr stetzle's stomach sure no doubt about it it was the work of only a few minutes for mr fosdick to pose mr stetzle in the plating bath you will represent the winged mercury one of the finest examples of ancient greek art said mr fosdick arranging the legs and arms as he had seen them in the illustration in the back of a dictionary i can make some little wings and solder them to your ankles afterwards mr stetzle thoroughly resigned to submit to anything made no comment and now said mr fosdick i'll just lock you up in the shop for an hour while i go out and fix the widow johnson's doorbell and put in a window at sam horton's and get lem hunter's umbrella what's busted and needs mending and do a few other little odds and ends the object experimented on--the unhappy mr stetzle --has fallen asleep during the process it was late in the afternoon when mr fosdick re- turned to the shop his errands had taken him much longer than he had supposed in the trough lay mr stetzle snoring the after- noon had been hot and the cooling influence of the plating bath had been more than he could resist flies had bothered him at first and in his endeavors to brush them off he had saturated his face and hair with the copper solution and mr fosdick was some- what startled to see that it had turned them a dark green wake up eben mr fosdick punched the re- cumbent form with a broom handle it was like punching a stone mr stetzle's ribs were incased in a quarter-inch armor of solid copper a tweak of the green nose brought better results and mr stetzle opened his eyes and endeavored to stir there was not the slightest movement it was the work of an hour perhaps and mr stetzle had begun to become petulant but in the end with the aid of a block and tackle mr fosdick had succeeded in lifting him out of the trough and had balanced him on one foot--a winged mercury of bright shining copper splendid he ejaculated and he gazed at his handiwork admiringly i'll get some of the boys down here to-morrow with old judge henley and we'll get up the incorporation papers in no time to-morrow yelled mr stetzle with a sudden and fierce indignation do you think i'm going to stand here on one foot all night like a dodgasted cigar store indian not on your life i've got complimentary tickets for uncle tom's cabin for this evening and i've got to take mrs stetzle and the children now you get me out of this dodgasted boiler plate union suit right now mr fosdick scratched his chin reflectively all right eben he soothed i'll split you up the back and you can scrawl out like a locust the shell will demonstrate the success of the idea he picked up a pair of calipers and applied it to various por- tions of mr stetzle's anatomy i should say that the metallic envelope is from a quarter to a half inch thick he remarked pensively you quit that figurin and get me out raged mr stetzle i ought to have had more sense after fooling with your dodgasted electrified cats and spending ten days on a foot square insulated gal- vanometer pier endurin the grins of all them dod- gasted students with great labor mr fosdick managed to lower mr stetzle to the floor and then with a cold chisel and hammer he began the work of divesting him of the metal that incrusted him with every blow of the hammer mr stetzle let forth a groan that chisel is going right into my backbone the subject in trouble--trying to get him out of his metallic casing mr fosdick considerately laid aside the chisel and took up a hacksaw it was slow work supper time came it grew dark and notwithstand- ing the lamentations and curses of mr stetzle the now somewhat alarmed mr fosdick had only cut a groove of about six inches along mr stetzle's spine dodgast you he bellowed i've missed my supper i've missed the opry and i'm missing my sleep why eben i'll get you a pillow and you can sleep while i work sleep ejaculated mr stetzle hotly how in thunder can i sleep with you a hammerin my vitals and a punchin into my backbone with a dodgasted cold chisel at dawn the thoroughly exhausted mr fosdick began to despair i'm afraid eben he said gravely that i'll have to crate you up and ship you down to the city where they have steam hammers and hydraulic jacks and things--unless--unless-- why hadn't he thought of it before--unless i can take the metal off the same way i put it on do anything snarled mr stetzle put me under a steam hammer rip me open with a hydraulic jack grind me apart on an emery wheel blow me open with dynamite melt me apart with an acetylene blowpipe--do any of the dodgasted things you have been talking about continued on page  dr ox's experiment by  jules verne i think it time toclose the valve you'd better not cried doctor ox if you attempt it i'll throttle you  dr ox's experiment  chapter i how it is useless to seek even on the best maps for the small town of quiquendone if you try to find on any map of fland- ers ancient or modern the small town of quiquendone probably you will not succeed is quiquendone then one of those towns which have disappeared no a town of the future by no means it exists in spite of geographies and has done so for some eight or nine hundred years it even numbers two thousand three hundred and ninety-three souls al- lowing one soul to each inhabitant it is situated thirteen and a half kilometers northwest of ouden- arde and fifteen and a quarter kilometers southeast of bruges in the heart of flanders the vaar a small tributary of the scheldt passes beneath its three bridges each of which is still covered with a quaint medieaval roof like that at tournay an old chateau is to be seen there the first stone of which was laid as long ago as  by count baldwin afterwards emperor of constantinople and there is a town hall with gothic windows crowned by a chaplet of battlements and surmounted by a turret- ed belfry which rises three hundred and fifty-seven feet above the soil every hour you may hear there a chime of five octaves a veritable aerial piano the renown of which surpases that of the famous chimes of bruges strangers--if ever any come to quiquen- done--do not quit the curious old town until they have visited its stadholder's hall adorned by a full-length portrait of william of nassau by bran- don the loft of the church of saint magloire a masterpiece of sixteenth century architecture the cast-iron well in the spacious place saint ernuph the admirable ornamentation of which is attributed to the artist-blacksmith quentin matsys the tomb formerly erected to mary of burgundy daughter of charles the bold who now reposes in the church of notre dame at bruges and so on the principal industry of quiquendone is the manufacture of whipped creams and barley-sugar on a large scale it has been governed by the van tricasses from father to son for sev- eral centuries and yet quiquendone is not on the map of flanders have the geographers forgotten it or is it an intentional omission that i cannot tell but quiquendone really exists with its nar- row streets its fortified walls its spanish-looking houses its market and its burgomaster--so much so that it has recently been the theatre of phenomena as incredible as they are true which are to be recounted in the present narration the placid flemings of flanders surely there is nothing to be said or thought against the flemings of western flanders they are a well-to-do folk wise prudent soci- able with even tempers hospitable perhaps a little the lovers of jules verne here find their author spin- ning a tale in a lighter vein it seems to us that our favorite author has deliberately drawn out the story in order to make the denouement if you have not guessed it by that time more striking there is of course excellent science in this story and if any one should go to the trouble of repeating dr ox's experiment on the vast scale shown here the results would probably be just as depict- ed by our famous author it is a charming tale and verne chose for good reason a small town in flanders because the dutch and flemish people are notorious for their supposed sleepiness heavy in conversation as in mind but this does not explain why one of the most interesting towns of their district has yet to appear on modern maps this omission is certainly to be regretted if only history or in default of history the chronicles or in default of chronicles the traditions of the country made mention of quiquendone but no neither atlases guides nor itineraries speak of it m joanne himself that energetic hunter after small towns says not a word of it it might be readily conceived that this silence would injure the com- merce the industries of the town but let us hasten to add quiquendone has neither industry nor com- merce and that it does very well without them its barley-sugar and whipped cream are consumed on the spot none is exported in short the quiquen- donians have no need of anybody their desires are limited their existence is a modest one they are calm moderate phlegmatic--in a word they are flemings such as are still to be met with sometimes between the scheldt and the north sea chapter ii in which the burgomaster van tricasse and the counselor niklausse consult about the af- fairs of the town yu think so asked the burgomaster i--think so replied the counselor after some minutes of silence you see we must not act hastily resumed the burgomaster we have been talking over this grave matter for ten years replied the counselor niklausse and i confess to you my worthy van tricasse that i cannot yet take it upon myself to come to a deci- sion i quite understand your hesitation said the burgomaster who did not speak until after a good quarter of an hour of reflection i quite understand it and i fully share it we shall do wisely to de- cide upon nothing without a more careful examina- tion of the question it is certain replied niklausse that this post of civil commissary is use- less in so peaceful a town as quiquendone our predecessor said van tricasse gravely our predecessor never said never would have dared to say that any- thing is certain every affirmation is subject to awkward qualifications the counselor nodded his head slowly in token of assent then he remain- ed silent for nearly half an hour after this lapse of time during which neither the counselor nor the burgomaster moved so much as a finger niklausse asked van tricasse whether his predecessor--of some twenty years before--had not thought of sup- pressing this office of civil commissary which each year cost the town of quiquendone the sum of thir- teen hundred and seventy-five francs and some cen- times  amazing stories i believe he did replied the burgomaster car- rying his hand with majestic deliberation to his ample brow but the worthy man died without having dared to make up his mind either as to this or any other administrative measure he was a bage why should i not do as he did counselor niklausse was incapable of originating any objection to the burgomaster's opinion the man who dies added van tricasse solemnly without ever having decided upon anything during his life has very nearly attained to perfection suzel van tricasse this said the burgomaster pressed a bell with the end of his little finger which gave forth a muffled sound--less a sound than a sigh presently some light steps glided softly across the tiled floor a mouse would not have made less noise running over a thick carpet the door of the room opened turning on its well-oiled hinges a young girl with long blonde tresses made her appearance it was suzel van tricasse the burgomaster's only daughter she handed her father a pipe filled to the brim and a small copper brazier spoke not a word and disappeared at once making no more noise at her exit than at her entrance the worthy burgomaster lighted his pipe and was soon hidden in a cloud of bluish smoke leaving counselor niklausse plunged in the most absorbing thought the room in which these two notable personages charged with the government of quiquendone were talking was a parlor richly adorned with carvings in dark wood a lofty fireplace in which an oak tree might have been burned or an ox roasted oc- cupied the whole of one of the sides of the room opposite to it was a trellised window the painted glass of which toned down the brightness of the sun- beams in an antique frame above the chimney- piece appeared the portrait of some worthy man at- tributed to memling which no doubt represented an ancestor of the van tricasse whose authentic genealogy dates back to the period when the flem- ings and guy de dampierre were engaged in wars with the emperor rudolph of hapsburgh this parlor was the principal apartment of the burgomaster's house which was one of the pleasant- est in quiquendone built in the flemish style with all the abruptness quaintness and picturesque- ness of pointed architecture it was considered one of the most curious monuments of the town a carthusian convent or a deaf and dumb asylum was not more silent than this mansion noise had no existence there people did not walk but glided about in it they did not speak they murmured there was not however any lack of women in the house which in addition to the burgomaster van tricasse himself sheltered his wife madame bri- gitte van tricasse his daughter suzel van tri- casse and his domestic lotche jansheu we may also mention the burgomaster's sister aunt her- mance an elderly maiden who still bore the nick- name of tatanemance which her niece suzel when a child had given her but in spite of all these ele- ments of discord and noise the burgomaster's house was as calm as a desert the burgomaster van tricasse the burgomaster was some fifty years old neither fat nor lean neither short nor tall neither rubicund nor pale neither gay nor sad neither contented nor discontented neither ener- getic nor dull neither proud nor humble neither good nor bad neither generous nor miserly neither courageous nor cowardly neither too much nor too little of anything--a man notably moderate in all respects whose invariable slowness of motion slightly hanging lower jaw prominent eyebrows massive forehead smooth as a copper plate and without a wrinkle would at once have betrayed to a physiognomist that the burgomaster van tricasse was phlegm personified never either from anger or passion had any emotion whatever hastened the beating of this man's heart or flushed his face never had his pupils con- tracted under the influence of any irritation how- ever ephemeral he invariably wore good clothes neither too large nor too small which he never seemed to wear out he was shod with large square shoes with triple soles and silver buckles which lasted so long that his shoemaker was in despair upon his head he wore a large hat which dated from the period when flanders was separated from hol- land so that this venerable masterpiece was at least forty years old but what would you have it is the passions which wear out body as well as soul the clothes as well as the body and our worthy burgomaster apathetic indolent indifferent was passionate in nothing he wore nothing out not even himself and he considered himself the very man to administer the affairs of quiquendone and its tranquil population the town indeed was not less calm than the van tricasse mansion it was in this peaceful dwelling that the burgomaster reckoned on attaining the ut- most limit of human existence after having how- ever seen the good madame brigette van tricasse his wife precede him to the tomb where surely she would not find a more profound repose than that she had enjoyed on earth for sixty years this demands explanation the van tricasse family might well call itself the jeannot family  this is why everyone knows that the knife of this typical personage is as celebrated as its proprietor and not less incapable of wearing out thanks to the double operation incessantly repeated of replacing the handle when it is worn out and the blade when it becomes worthless a precisely similar operation had been going on from time immemorial in the van tricasse family to which nature had lent herself with more than usual complacency from  it had invariably happened that a van tricasse when left a widower had remarried a van tricasse young- er than himself who becoming in turn a widow had married again a van tricasse younger than herself and so on without a break in the continuity from generation to generation each died in his or her turn with mechanical regularity thus the worthy madame brigette van tricasse had now her second husband and unless she violated her every duty would precede her spouse--he being ten years younger than herself--to the other world to make room for a new madame van tricasse upon this the burgomaster calmly counted that the family tradi- dr ox's experiment tion might not be broken such was this mansion peaceful and silent of which the doors never creaked the windows never rattled the floors never groaned the chimneys never roared the weather- cocks never grated the furniture never squeaked the locks never clanked and the occupants never made more noise than their shadows the god harpocrates would certainly have chosen it for the temple of silence chapter iii in which the commissary passauf enters as noisily as unexpectedly when the interesting conversation which has been narrated began it was a quarter before three in the afternoon it was at a quarter before four that van tricasse lighted his enormous pipe which could hold an ounce of to- bacco and it was at thirty-five minutes past five that he finished smoking it all this time the two comrades did not exchange  single word about six o'clock the counselor who had a habit of speaking in a very summary manner resumed in these words so we decide- to decide nothing replied the burgomaster i think on the whole that you are right van tricasse i think so too niklausse we will take steps with reference to the civil commissary when we have more light on the subject--later on there is no need for a month yet nor even for a year replied niklausse unfold- ing his pocket-handkerchief and calmly applying it to his nose there was another silence of nearly a quarter of an hour nothing disturbed this repeated pause in the conversation not even the appearance of the house-dog lento who not less phlegmatic than his master came to pay his respects to the parlor noble dog--a model for his race had he been made of pasteboard with wheels on his paws he would not have made less noise during his stay towards eight o'clock after lotche had brought the antique lamp of polished glass the burgomaster said to the counselor we have no other urgent matter to consider no van tricasse none that i know of have i not been told though asked the burgo- master that the tower of the oudenarde gate is likely to tumble down  ah replied the counselor really i should not be astonished if it fell on some passer-by any day oh before such a misfortune happens i hope we shall have come to a decision on the subject of this tower i hope so van tricasse there are more pressing matters to decide no doubt the question of the leather-market for instance the burning market what is it still burning still burning and has been for the last three weeks have we not decided in council to let it burn yes van tricasse--on your motion was not that the surest and simplest way to deal with it without doubt well let us wait is that all all replied the counselor scratching his head as if to assure himself that he had not forgotten anything important ah exclaimed the burgomaster haven't you also heard something of an escape of water which threatens to inundate the low quarter of saint jacques i have it is indeed unfortunate that this escape of water did not happen above the leather-market it would naturally have checked the fire and would thus have saved us a good deal of discussion what can you expect niklausse there is noth- ing so illogical as accidents they are bound by no rules and we cannot profit by one as we might wish to remedy another it took van tricasse's companion some time to digest this fine observation well but resumed the counselor niklausse after the lapse of some moments we have not spoken of our great affair what great affair have we then a great af- fair said the burgomaster no doubt about lighting the town oh yes if my memory serves me you are re- ferring to the lighting plan of doctor ox precisely it is going on niklausse replied the burgo- master they are already laying the pipes and the works are entirely completed perhaps we have hurried a little in this matter said the counselor shaking his head perhaps but our excuse is that doctor ox bears the whole expense of his experiment it will not cost us a sou that true enough is our excuse moreover we must advance with the age if the experiment suc- ceeds quiquendone will be the first town in fland- ers to be lighted with the oxy--what is the gas called oxyhydric gas well oxyhydric gas then oxyhydric gas lighting for quiquendone at this moment the door opened and lotche came in to tell the burgomaster that his sup- per was ready counselor niklausse rose to take leave of van tricasse whose appetite had been stimulated by so many affairs discussed and decisions taken and it was agreed that the council of notables should be convened after a reasonably long delay to determine whether a decision should be provisionally arrived at with reference to the really urgent matter of the oudenarde gate the two worthy administrators then directed their steps towards the street door the one conduct- ing the other the counselor having reached the last step lighted a little lantern to guide him through the obscure streets of quiquendone which doctor ox had not yet lighted it was a dark octo- ber night and a light fog overshadowed the town niklausse's preparations for departure consumed at least a quarter of an hour for after having light-  amazing stories ed his lantern he had to put on his big cow-skin shoes and his sheep-skin gloves then he put up the furred collar of his overcoat turned the brim of his felt hat down over his eyes grasped his heavy crow-beaked umbrella and got ready to start however when lotche who was lighting her master was about to draw the bars of the door an unexpected noise arose outside yes strange as the thing seems a noise--a real noise such as the town had certainly not heard since the taking of the donjon by the spaniards in --a terrible noise awoke the long dormant echoes of the venerable van tricasse mansion someone knocked heavily upon this door hither- to virgin to brutal touch redoubled knocks were given with some blunt implement probably a knotty stick wielded by a vigorous arm with the strokes were mingled cries and calls these words were dis- tinctly heard monsieur van tricasse monsieur the burgo- master open open quickly the burgomaster and the counselor absolutely astounded looked at each other speechless this passed their comprehension if the old cul- verin of the chateau which had not been used since  had been let off in the parlor the dwellers in the van tricasse mansion would not have been more dumbfounded meanwhile the blows and cries were redoubled lotche recovering her coolness had plucked up enough courage to speak who is there it is i i i who are you the commissary passauf a threatened duel the commissary passauf the very man whose office it had been contemplated to sup- press for ten years what had happened then could the burgundians have invaded qui- quendone as they did in the fourteenth century no event of less importance could have so moved commissary passauf who in no degree yielded the palm to the burgomaster himself for calmness and phlegm on a sign from van tricasse--for the worthy man could not have articulated a syllable--the bar was pushed back and the door opened commissary passauf flung himself into the ante- chamber one would have thought there was a hurricane what's the matter monsieur the commissary asked lotche a brave woman who did not lose her head under the most trying circumstances what's the matter replied passauf whose big round eyes expressed a genuine agitation the matter is that i have just come from doctor ox's who has been holding a reception and that there - there there i have witnessed such an altercation as-- monsieur the burgomaster they have been talking politics politics resumed commissary passauf which has not been done for perhaps a hundred years at quiquendone then the discussion got warm and the advocate andre schut and the doctor domini- que custos became so violent that it may be they will call each other out call each other out cried the counselor a duel a duel at quiquendone and what did advo- cate schut and doctor custos say just this monsieur advocate said the doctor to his adversary you go too far it seems to me and you do not take sufficient care to control your words the burgomaster van tricasse clasped his hands --the counselor turned pale and let his lantern fall --the commissary shook his head that a phrase so evidently irritating should be pronounced by two of the principal men in the country this doctor custos muttered van tricasse is decidedly a dangerous man--a hare-brained fellow come gentlemen on this counselor niklausse and the commissary accompanied the burgomaster into the parlor chapter iv in which doctor ox reveals himself as a physiologist of the first rank and as an audacious experimentalist who was this personage known by the sing- ular name of doctor ox an original character for certain but at the same time a bold savant a physiologist whose works were known and highly estimated throughout learned europe a happy rival of the davys the daltons the bostocks the menzies the godwins the vierordts--of those noble minds who have placed physiology among the highest of modern sciences doctor ox was a man of medium size and height aged--but we cannot state his age any more than his nationality besides it matters little let it suffice that he was a strange personage impetuous and hot-blooded a regular oddity out of one of hoff- mann's volumes and one who contrasted amus- ingly enough with the good people of quiquendone he had an imperturbable confidence both in himself and in his doctrines always smiling walking with head erect and shoulders thrown back in a free and unconstrained manner with a steady gaze large open nostrils a vast mouth which inhaled the air in liberal draughts his appearance was far from un- pleasing he was full of animation well propor- tioned in all parts of his bodily mechanism with quicksilver in his veins and a most elastic step he could never stop still in one place and relieved himself with impetuous words and a superabund- ance of gesticulations was doctor ox rich then that he should un- dertake to light a whole town at his expense probably as he permitted himself to indulge in such extravagance--and this is the only answer we can give to this indiscreet question doctor ox had arrived at quiquendone five months before accompanied by his assistant who answered to the name of gedeon ygene a tall dried-up thin man haughty but not less vivacious than his master what does dr ox want to do and next why had doctor ox made the prop- osition to light the town at his own expense why had he of all the flemings selected the peaceable quiquendonians to endow their town with dr ox's experiment  the benefits of an unheard-of system of lighting did he not under this pretext design to make some great physiological experiment by operating in anima vili in short what was this original per- sonage about to attempt we know not as doctor ox had no confident except his assistant ygene who moreover obeyed him blindly as it appeared at least doctor ox had agreed to light the town which had much need of it espec- ially at night as commissary passauf wittily said works for producing a lighting gas had accordingly been established the gasometers were ready for use and the main pipes running beneath the street pavements would soon appear in the form of burn- ers in the public edifices and the private houses of certain friends of progress van tricasse and nik- lausse in their official capacity and some other worthies thought they ought to allow this modern light to be introduced into their dwellings if the reader has not forgotten it was said dur- ing the long conversation of the counselor and the burgomaster that the lighting of the town was to be achieved not by the combustion of common car- buretted hydrogen produced by distilling coal but by the use of a more modern and twenty-fold more brilliant gas oxyhydric gas produced by mixing hydrogen and oxygen the doctor who was an able chemist as well as an ingenious physiologist knew how to obtain this gas in great quantity and of good quality not by using sodium manganate according to the method of m tessie du motay but by the direct decomposition of slightly acidulated water by means of a battery made of new elements invented by himself thus there were no costly materials no platinum no re- torts no combustibles no delicate machinery to produce the two gases separately an electric cur- rent was sent through large basins full of water and the liquid was decomposed into its two constitu- ent parts oxygen and hydrogen the oxygen passed off at one end the hydrogen of double the volume of its late associate at the other as a necessary precaution they were collected in separate reser- voirs for their mixture would have produced a frightful explosion if it had become ignited thence the pipes were to convey them separately to the various burners which would be so placed as to pre- vent all chance of explosion thus a remarkably brilliant flame would be obtained whose light would rival the electric light it was certain that the town of quiquendone would by this liberal contrivance gain a splendid lighting but doctor ox and his assistant took little account of this as will be seen in the sequel in dr ox's laboratory the day after that on which commissary pas- sauf had made his noisy entrance into the burgomaster's parlor gedeon ygene and doc- tor ox were talking in the laboratory which both oc- cupied in common on the ground-floor of the prin- cipal building of the gas-works well ygene well cried the doctor rubbing his hands you saw at my reception yesterday the cool-bloodedness of these worthy quiquendonians for animation they are midway between sponges and coral you saw them disputing and irritating each other by voice and gesture they are already metamorphosed morally and physically and this is only the beginning wait till we treat them to a big dose indeed master replied ygene scratching his sharp nose with the end of his forefinger the ex- periment begins well and if i had not prudently closed the supply-tap i know not what would have happened you heard schut the advocate and custos the doctor resumed doctor ox the phrase was by no means ill-natured in itself but in the mouth of a quiquendonian it is worth all the insults which the homeric heroes hurled at each other before drawing their swords ah these flemings you'll see what we shall do some day we shall make them ungrateful replied ygene in the tone of a man who esteems the human race at its just worth bah said the doctor what matters it whether they think well or ill of us so long as our experi- ment succeeds besides returned the assistant smiling with a malicious expression is it not to be feared that in producing such an excitement in their respiratory organs we shall somewhat injure the lungs of these good people of quiquendone so much the worse for them it is in the inter- ests of science what would you say if the dogs or frogs refused to lend themselves to the experiments of vivisection it is probable that if the frogs and dogs were consulted they would offer some objection but doctor ox imagined that he had stated an un- answerable argument for he heaved a great sigh of satisfaction the great experiment after all master you are right replied ygene as if quite convinced we could not have hit upon better subjects than these people of quiquendone for our experiment we--could--not said the doctor slowly artic- ulating each word have you felt the pulse of any of them some hundreds and what is the average pulsation you found not fifty per minute see--this is a town where there has not been the shadow of a discussion for a century where the carmen don't swear where the coachmen don't insult each other where horses don't run away where the dogs don't bite where the cats don't scratch--a town where the police-court has nothing to do from one year's end to another--a town where people do not grow enthusiastic about anything neither about art or business--a town where the gendarmes are a sort of myth and in which an indictment has not been drawn up for a hundred years--a town in short where for three centuries nobody has struck a blow with his fist or so much as exchanged a slap in the face you see ygene that this cannot last and that we must change it all perfectly perfectly cried the enthusiastic as- sistant and have you analyzed the air of this town master i have not failed to do so seventy-nine parts of nitrogen and twenty-one of oxygen carbonic acid  amazing stories and water vapor in variable quantity these are the ordinary proportions good doctor good replied ygene the ex- periment will be made on a large scale and will be decisive and if it is decisive added doctor ox tri- umphantly we shall reform the world chapter v in which the burgomaster and the counselor pay a visit to doctor ox and what follows the counselor niklausse and the burgomas- ter van tricasse at last knew what it was to have an agitated night the grave event which had taken place at doctor ox's house actually kept them awake what consequences was this af- fair destined to bring about they could not im- agine would it be necessary for them to come to a decision would the municipal authority whom they represented be compelled to interfere would they be obliged to order arrests to be made that so great a scandal should not be repeated all these doubts could not but trouble these soft natures and on that evening before separating the two notables had decided to see each other the next day on the next morning before dinner the burgo- master van tricasse proceeded in person to the counselor niklausse's house he found his friend more calm he himself had recovered his equani- mity nothing new ask van tricasse nothing new since yesterday replied niklausse and the doctor dominique custos i have not heard anything either of him or of the advocate andre schut after an hour's conversation which consisted of three remarks which it is needless to repeat the counselor and the burgomaster had resolved to pay a visit to doctor ox so as to draw from him with- out seeming to do so some details of the affair contrary to all their habits after coming to this decision the two notables set about putting it into execution forthwith they left the house and directed their steps towards doctor ox's laboratory which was situated outside the town near the ou- denarde gate--the gate whose tower threatened to fall in ruins they did not take each other's arms but walked side by side with a slow and solemn step which took them forward but thirteen inches per second this was indeed the ordinary gait of the quiquen- donians who had never within the memory of man seen anyone run across the streets of their town from time to time the two notables would stop at some calm and tranquil crossway or at the end of a quiet street to salute the passers by good morning monsieur the burgomaster said one good morning my friend responded van tri- casse anything new monsieur the counselor asked another nothing new answered niklausse a visit to dr ox's laboratory but by certain agitated motions and ques- tioning looks it was evident that the al- tercation of the evening before was known throughout the town observing the direction taken by van tricasse the most obtuse quiquendonians guessed that the burgomaster was on his way to take some important step the custos and schut affair was talked of everywhere but the people had not yet come to the point of taking the part of one or the other the advocate schut having never had occasion to plead in a town where attorneys and bailiffs only existed in tradition had conse- quently never lost a suit as for the doctor custos he was an honorable practitioner who after the ex- ample of his fellow-doctors cured all the illnesses of his patients except those of which they died--a habit unhappily acquired by all the members of all the faculties in whatever country they may prac- tice on reaching the oudenarde gate the counselor and the burgomaster prudently made a short de- tour so as not to pass within reach of the tower in case it should fall then they turned and looked at it attentively i think that it will fall said van tricasse i think so too replied niklausse unless it is propped up added van tricasse but must it be propped up that is the ques- tion that is--in fact--the question some moments after they reached the door of the gas-works can we see doctor ox they asked doctor ox could always be seen by the first au- thorities of the town and they were at once intro- duced into the celebrated physiologist's study perhaps the two notables waited for the doctor for about an hour at least it is reasonable to sup- pose so as the burgomaster--never has this hap- pened in his life before--betrayed a certain amount of impatience from which his companion was not exempt doctor ox came in at last and began to excuse himself for having kept them waiting he had to approve a plan for the gasometer rectify some of the machinery--but every thing was going on well the pipes intended for the oxygen were already laid in a few months the town would be splendidly lighted the two notables might even now see the orifices of the pipes which were laid on in the lab- oratory then the doctor begged to know to what he was indebted for the honor of this visit only to see you doctor to see you replied van tricasse it is long since we have had the pleasure we go abroad but little in our good town of quiquendone we count our steps and measure our walks we are happy when nothing disturbs the uniformity of our habits niklausse looked at his friend his friend had never said so much at once--at least without taking time and giving long intervals between his sen- tences it seemed to him that van tricasse expres- sed himself with a certain volubility which was by no means common with him niklausse himself ex- perienced a kind of irresistible desire to talk as for doctor ox he looked at the burgomaster with sly attention van tricasse who never argued until he had snugly ensconced himself in a spacious armchair had risen to his feet i know not what nervous ex- dr ox's experiment  citement quite foreign to his temperament had taken possession of him he did not gesticulate as yet but this could not be far off as for the counselor he rubbed his legs and breathed with slow and long gasps his look became animated little by little and he had decided to support at all hazards if need be his trusty friend the burgo- master van tricasse got up and took several steps then he came back and stood facing the doctor and in how many months he asked in a some- what emphatic tone do you say that your work will be finished in three or four months monsieur the burgo- master replied doctor ox three or four months--it's a very long time said van tricasse altogether too long added niklausse who not being able to keep his seat rose also this lapse of time is necessary to complete our work returned doctor ox the workmen whom we have had to choose in quiquendone are not very expeditious how not expeditious cried the burgomaster who seemed to take the remark as personally offen- sive the slow flemish workmen no monsieur van tricasse replied doctor ox obstinately a french workman would do in a day what it takes ten of your workmen to do you know they are regular flemings flemings cried the counselor whose fingers closed tightly in what sense sir do you use that word why in the amiable sense in which everybody uses it replied doctor ox smiling ah but doctor said the burgomaster pacing up and down the room i don't like these insinua- tions the workmen of quiquendone are as efficient as those of any other town in the world you must know and we shall go neither to paris nor london for our models as for your project i beg you to hasten its execution our streets have been un- paved for the putting down of your conduit-pipes and it's a hindrance to traffic our trade will begin to suffer and i being the responsible authority do not propose to incur reproaches which will be but too just worthy burgomaster he spoke of trade of traffic and the wonder was that those words to which he was quite unaccustomed did not scorch his lips what could be passing in his mind besides added niklausse the town cannot be deprived of light much longer but urged doctor ox a town which has been unlighted for eight or nine hundred years-- all the more necessary is it replied the burgo- master emphasizing his words times alter man- ners alter the world advances and we do not wish to remain behind we desire our streets to be lighted within a month or you must pay a large indemnity for each day of delay and what would happen if amid the darkness some affray should take place no doubt cried niklausse it requires but a spark to inflame fleming fleming flame apropos of this said the burgomaster inter- rupting his friend commissary passauf our chief of police reports to us that a discussion took place in your drawing-room last evening doctor ox was he wrong in declaring that it was a political discussion by no means monsieur the burgomaster re- plied doctor ox who with difficulty repressed a sigh of satisfaction so an altercation did take place between domi- nique custos and andrd schut yes counselor but the words which passed were not of grave import a threatened dispute not of grave import cried the burgomas- ter not of grave import when one man tells another that he does not measure the effect of his words but of what stuff are you made monsieur do you not know that in quiquendone nothing more is needed to bring about extremely disastrous results but monsieur if you or anyone else presume to speak thus to me-- or to me added niklausse as they pronounced these words with a menacing air the two notables with folded arms and bristling air confronted doctor ox ready to do him some violence if by a gesture or even the expression of his eye he manifested any intention of contradicting them but the doctor did not budge at all events monsieur resumed the burgo- master i propose to hold you responsible for what passes in your house i am bound to insure the tranquility of this town and i do not wish it to be disturbed the events of last evening must not be repeated or i shall do my duty sir do you hear then reply sir the burgomaster as he spoke under the influence of extraordinary excitement elevated his voice to the pitch of anger he was furious the worthy van tricasse and might certainly be heard outside at last beside himself and seeing that doctor ox did not reply to his challenge come niklausse said he and slamming the door with a violence which shook the house the burgomaster drew his friend after him little by little when they had taken twenty steps on their road the worthy notables grew more calm their pace slackened their gait became less fever- ish the flush on their faces faded away from being crimson they became rosy a quarter of an hour after quitting the gas-works van tricasse said softly to niklausse an amiable man doctor ox it is always a pleasure to see him chapter vi in which frantz niklausse and suzel van tricasse form certain projects for the future our readers know that the burgomaster had a daughter suzel but shrewd as they may be they cannot have divined that the coun- selor niklausse had a son frantz and had they di- vined this nothing could have led them to imagine that frantz was the betrothed lover of suzel we will add that these young people were made for each  amazing stories other and that they loved each other as folks did love at quiquendone it must not be thought that young hearts did not beat in this exceptional place only they beat with a certain deliberation there were marriages there as in every other town in the world but they took time about it betrothed couples before engaging in these terrible bonds wished to study each other and these studies lasted at least ten years as at col- lege it was rare that anyone was accepted before this lapse of time courtships in quiquendone yes ten years the courtships last ten years and is it after all too long when the being bound for life is in consideration one studies ten years to become an engineer or physi- cian an advocate or attorney and should less time be spent in acquiring the knowledge to make a good husband is it not reasonable and whether it is due to temperament or reason the quiquendonians seem to us to be in the right in thus prolonging their courtship when marriages in other more lively and exciteable cities are seen taking place within a few months we must shrug our shoulders and hasten to send our boys to the schools and our daughters to the pensions of quiquendone for half a century one single marriage was known to have taken place after the lapse of only two years of courtship and that turned out badly frantz niklausse then loved suzel van tricasse but quietly as a man would love when he has ten years before him in which to obtain the beloved ob- ject once every week at an hour agreed upon frantz went to fetch suzel and took a walk with her along the banks of the vaar he took good care to carry his fishing-tackle and suzel never forgot her canvas on which her pretty hands em- broidered the most unlikely flowers frantz was a young man of twenty-two whose cheeks betrayed a soft peachy down and whose voice had scarcely a compass of one octave as for suzel she was blonde and rosy she was seventeen and did not dislike fishing a singular occupation this however which forces you to strug- gle craftily with a barbel but frantz loved it the pastime was congenial to his temperament as patient as possible content to follow with his rather dreamy eye the cork which bobbed on the top of the water he knew how to wait and when after sitting for six hours a modest barbel taking pity on him consented at last to be caught he was happy--but he knew how to control his emotion on this day the two lovers--one might say the two betrothed--were seated upon the verdant bank the limpid vaar murmured a few feet below them suzel quietly drew her needle across the canvas frantz automatically carried his line from left to right then permitted it to descend the current from right to left the fish made capricious rings in the water which crossed each other around the cork while the hook hung useless near the bottom frantz and suzel go a-fishing from time to time frantz would say with- out raising his eyes i think i have a bite suzel do you think so frantz replied suzel who abandoning her work for an instant followed her lover's line with earnest eye n-no resumed frantz i thought i felt a little twitch i was mistaken you will have a bite frantz replied suzel in her pure soft voice but do not forget to strike at the right moment you are always a few seconds too late and the barbel takes advantage to escape would you like to take my line suzel willingly frantz then give me your canvas we shall see whether i am more adroit with the needle than with the hook and the young girl took the line with trembling hand while her swain plied the needle across the stitches of the embroidery for hours together they thus exchanged soft words and their hearts palpi- tated when the cork bobbed on the water ah could they ever forget those charming hours during which seated side by side they listened to the mur- murs of the river the sun was fast approaching the western hori- zon and despite the combined skill of suzel and frantz there had not been a bite the barbels had not shown themselves complacent and seemed to scoff at the two young people who were too just to bear them malice we shall be more lucky another time frantz said suzel as the young angler put up his still vir- gin hook let us hope so replied frantz then walking side by side they turned their steps towards the house without exchanging a word as mute as their shadows which stretched out before them suzel became very very tall under the oblique rays of the setting sun frantz appeared very very thin like the long rod which he held in his hand they reached the burgomaster's house green tufts of grass bordered the shining pavement and no one would have thought of tearing them away for they deadened the noise made by the passers-by as they were about to open the door frantz thought it his duty to say to suzel you know suzel the great day is approaching it is indeed frantz replied the young girl with downcast eyes yes said frantz in five or six years-- good-bye frantz said suzel good-bye suzel replied frantz and after the door had been closed the young man resumed the way to his father's house with a calm and equal pace chapter vii in which the andantes become allegros and the allegros vivaces the agitation caused by the schut and custos affair had subsided the affair led to no seri- ous consequences it appeared likely that quiquendone would return to its habitual apathy which that unexpected event had for a moment dis- turbed meanwhile the laying of the pipes destined to conduct the oxyhydric gas into the principal edifices of the town was proceeding rapidly the main pipes and branches gradually crept beneath the pave- dr ox's experiment  ments but the burners were still wanting for as it required delicate skill to make them it was necessary that they should be fabricated abroad doctor ox was here there and everywhere neither he nor ygene his assistant lost a moment but they urged on the workmen completed the delicate me- chanism of the gasometer fed day and night the immense batteries which decomposed the water un- der the influence of a powerful electric current yes the doctor was already making his gas though the pipe-laying was not yet done a fact which between ourselves might have seemed a little singular but before long--at least there was reason to hope so-- before long doctor ox would inaugurate the splen- dors of his invention in the theater of the town for quiquendone possessed a theater--a really fine edifice in truth--the interior and exterior ar- rangement of which combined every style of archi- tecture nor was this surprising the theater hav- ing been commenced under the burgomaster lud- wig van tricasse in  and only finished in  under the burgomaster natalis van tricasse it had required seven hundred years to build it and it had been successively adapted to the architec- tural style in vogue in each period but for all that it was an imposing structure the roman pillars and byzantine arches of which would appear to ad- vantage lit up by the oxyhydric gas the quiquendone theater pretty nearly everything was acted at the theatre of quiquendone but the opera and the opera comique were especially patronized it must however be added that the composers would never have recognized their own works so entirely changed were the movements of the music in short as nothing was done in a hurry at qui- quendone the dramatic pieces had to be performed in harmony with the peculiar temperament of the quiqendonians though the doors of the theater were regularly thrown open at four o'clock and closed again at ten it had never been known that more than two acts were played during the six inter- vening hours robert le diable les huguenots or guillaume tell usually took up three evenings so slow was the execution of these masterpieces the vivaces at the theatre of quiquendone lagged like real adagios the allegros were long-drawn out indeed the demi semi-quavers were scarcely equal to the ordinary semibreves of other countries the most rapid runs performed according to qui- quendonian taste had the solemn march of a chant the gayest shakes were languishing and measured that they might not shock the ears of the dilettanti to give an example the rapid air sung by figaro on his entrance in the first act of le barbier de seville lasted fifty-eight minutes--when the actor was particularly enthusiastic artists from abroad as might be supposed were forced to conform themselves to quiquendonian fashions but as they were well paid they did not complain and willingly obeyed the leader's baton which never beat more than eight measures to the minute in the allegros but what applause greeted these artists who en- chanted without ever wearying the audiences of quiquendone all hands clapped one after another at tolerably long intervals which the papers char- acterized as frantic applause and sometimes nothing but the lavish prodigality with which mor- tar and stone had been used in the twelfth century saved the roof of the hall from falling in besides the theatre had only one performance a week that these enthusiastic flemish folk might not be too much excited and this enabled the actors to study their parts more thoroughly and the spec- tators to digest more at leisure the beauties of the masterpieces brought out on the stage such had long been the drama at quiquendone foreign artists were in the habit of making engage- ments with the director of the town when they wanted to rest after their exertions in other towns and it seemed as if nothing could ever change these inveterate customs when a fortnight after the schut-custos affair an unlooked-for incident oc- curred to throw the population into fresh agitation an opera day it was on a saturday an opera day it was not yet intended as may be well supposed to in- augurate the new illumination no the pipes had reached the hall but for reasons indicated above the burners had not yet been placed and the wax candles still shed their soft light upon the nu- merous spectators who filled the theatre the doors had been opened to the public at one o'clock and by three the hall was half full a queue had at one time been formed which extended as far as the end of the place saint ernuph in front of the shop of josse lietrinck the apothecary this eagerness was sig- nificant of an unusually attractive performance are you going to the theater this evening in- quired the counselor the same morning of the burgo- master i shall not fail to do so returned van tricasse and i shall take madame van tricasse as well as our daughter suzel and our dear tatanemance who all dote on good music madamoiselle suzel is going then certainly niklausse then my son frantz will be one of the first to arrive said niklausse a spirited boy niklausse replied the burgo- master sententiously but hot-headed he will require watching he loves van tricasse--your charming suzel well niklausse he shall marry her now that we have agreed on this marriage what more can he desire he desires nothing van tricasse the dear boy but in short we'll say no more about it--he will not be the last to get his ticket at the box office ah vivacious and ardent youth replied the burgomaster recalling his own past we have also been thus my worthy counselor we have loved-- we too we have danced attendance in our day till to-night then till to-night by-the-bye do you know this fiovaranti is a great artist and what a welcome he has received among us it will be long before he will forget the applause of qui- quendone the opera les huguenots the tenor fiovaranti was indeed going to sing fiovaranti who by his talents as a virtuoso his perfect method his melodious  amazing stories voice provoked a real enthusiasm among the lovers of music in the town for three weeks fiovaranti had been achieving a brilliant success in les huguenots the first act interpreted according to the tastes of the qui- quendonians had occupied an entire evening of the first week of the month another evening in the second week prolonged by infinite andantes had elicited for the celebrated singer a real ovation his success had been still more marked in the third act of meyerbeer's masterpiece but now fiovar- anti was to appear in the fourth act which was to be performed on this evening before an impatient public ah the duet between raoul and valentine that pathetic love-song for two voices that strain so full of crescendos stringendos and piu crescen- dos--all this sung slowly compendiously intermin- ably ah how delightful at four o'clock the hall was full the boxes the orchestra the pit were overflowing it was customary for the quiquendonians while awaiting the rise of the curtain to sit silent some reading the paper others whispering low to each other some making their way to their seats slowly and noise- lessly others casting timid looks towards the be- witching beauties in the galleries but on this evening a looker-on might have ob- served that even before the curtain rose there was unusual animation among the audience people were restless who were never known to be restless before the ladies fans fluttered with abnormal rapidity all appeared to be inhaling air of excep- tional stimulating power everyone breathed more freely the eyes of some became unwontedly bright and seemed to give forth a light equal to that of the candles which themselves certainly threw a more brilliant light over the hall it was evident that people saw more clearly though the number of candles had not been increased ah if doctor ox's experiment were being tried but it was not being tried as yet the musicians of the orchestra at last took their places the first violin had gone to the stand to give a modest la to his colleagues the stringed instruments the wind instruments the drums and cymbals were in accord the conductor only waited the sound of the bell to beat the first bar the bell sounds the fourth act begins the allegro appassionato of the inter-act is played as usual with a majestic deliberation which would have made meyerbeer frantic and all the majesty of which was appreciated by the quiquendonian dilettanti an opera at express speed but soon the leader perceived that he was no longer master of his musicians he found it difficult to restrain them though usually so obedient and calm the wind instruments be- trayed a tendency to hasten the movements and it was necessary to hold them back with a firm hand for they would otherwise outstrip the stringed in- struments which from a musical point of view would have been disastrous the bassoon himself the son of josse lietrinck the apothecary a well- bred young man seemed to lose his self-control meanwhile valentine has begun her recitative i am alone etc but she hurries it the leader and all his musicians perhaps uncon- sciously follow her in her cantabile which should be taken deliberately like a - as it is when raoul appears at the door at the bottom of the stage between the moment when valentine goes to him and that when she conceals herself in the chamber at the side a quarter of an hour does not elapse while formerly according to the traditions of the quiquendone theater this recitative of thirty-seven bars was wont to last just thirty-seven minutes saint bris nevers cavannes and the catholic nobles have appeared somewhat prematurely per- haps upon the scene the composer has marked allegro pompose on the score the orchestra and the lords proceed allegro indeed but not at all pompose and at the chorus in the famous scene of the bene- diction of the poniards they no longer keep to the enjoined allegro singers and musicians break away impetuously the leader does not even attempt to restrain them nor does the public protest on the contrary the people find themselves carried away and see that they are involved in the move- ment and that the movement responds to the im- pulses of their souls will you with me deliver the land from troubles increasing an impious band they promise they swear nevers has scarcely time to protest and to sing that among his ances- tors were many soldiers but never an assassin he is arrested the police and the aldermen rush for- ward and rapidly swear to strike all at once saint bris shouts the recitative which summons the cath- olics to vengeance the three monks with white cowls hasten in by the door at the back of nevers's room without taking any account of the stage directions which enjoin on them to advance slowly already all the artists have drawn sword or poniard which the three monks bless in a trice the so- pranos tenors bassos attack the allegro furioso with cries of rage and of a dramatic - time they make it - quadrille time then they rush out bellowing at midnight noiselessly god wills it yes at midnight the audience in a frenzy at this moment the audience start to their feet everybody is agitated--in the boxes the pit the galleries it seems as if the spectators are about to rush upon the stage the burgomaster van tricasse at their head to join with the conspir- ators and annihilate the huguenots whose religious opinions however they share they applaud call before the curtain make loud acclamations tatane- mance grasps her bonnet with feverish hand the candles throw out a lurid glow of light raoul instead of slowly raising the curtain tears it apart with a superb gesture and finds himself confronting valentine at last it is the grand duet and it starts off allegro vivace raoul does not wait for valentine's pleading and valentine does not wait for raoul's responses the fine passage beginning danger is passing time is flying becomes one of those rapid airs dr ox's experiment  which have made offenbach famous when he com- posed a dance for conspirators the andante amoro- so thou hast said it aye thou lovest me becomes a real vivace furioso and the violoncello ceases to imitate the inflections of the singer's voice as in- dicated in the composer's score in vain raoul cries speak on and prolong the ineffable slumber of my soul valentine cannot prolong it is evident that an unaccustomed fire devours her her b's and her c's above the stave were dreadfully shrill he struggles he gesticulates he is all in a glow the alarum is heard the bell resounds but what a panting bell the bell-ringer has evidently lost his self-control it is a frightful tocsin which violently struggles against the fury of the orchestra finally the air which ends this magnificent act beginning no more love no more intoxication o the remorse that oppresses me which the composer marks allegro con moto becomes a wild prestissimo you would say an express train was whirling by the alarum resounds again valentine falls faint- ing raoul precipitates himself from the window almost a riot at the end of the opera it was high time the orchestra really intoxi- cated could not have gone on the leader's baton is no longer anything but a broken stick on the prompter's box the violin strings are broken and their necks twisted in his fury the drummer has burst his drum the counter-bassist has perched on the top of his musical monster the first clari- onet has swallowed the reed of his instrument and the second hautboy is chewing his reed keys the groove of the trombone is strained and finally the unhappy cornetist cannot withdraw his hand from the bell of his instrument into which he had thrust it too far and the audience the audience panting all in a heat gesticulate and howl all the faces are as red as if a fire were burning within their bodies they crowd each other hustle each other to get out--the men without hats the women without mantles they elbow each other in the corridors crush between the doors quarrel fight there are no longer any officials any burgomaster all are equal amid this infernal frenzy some moments after when all have reached the street each one resumes his habitual tranquility and peaceably enters his house with a confused re- membrance of what he has just experienced the fourth act of the huguenots which for- merly lasted six hours began on this evening at half-past four and ended at twelve minutes before five it had only lasted eighteen minutes chapter viii in which the ancient and solemn german waltz becomes a whirlwind but if the spectators leaving the theater re- sumed their customary calm if they quietly regained their homes preserving only a sort of passing stupefaction they had none the less un- dergone a remarkable exaltation and overcome and weary as if they had committed some excess of dis- sipation they fell heavily upon their beds the next day each quiquendonian had a kind of recollection of what had occurred the evening be- fore one missed his hat lost in the hubbub an- other a coat-flap torn in the brawl one her delicate- ly fashioned shoe another her best mantle memory returned to these worthy people and with it a cer- tain shame for their unjustifiable agitation it seemed to them an orgy in which they were the un- conscious heroes and heroines they did not speak of it they did not wish to think of it but the most astounded personage in the town was van tri- casse the burgomaster the wig of van tricasse the next morning on waking he could not find his wig lotche looked everywhere for it but in vain the wig had remained on the field of battle as for having it publicly claimed by jean mistrol the town-crier--no it would not do it were better to lose the wig than to advertise him- self thus as he had the honor to be the first magis- trate of quiquendone the worthy van tricasse was reflecting upon this extended beneath his sheets with bruised body heavy head furred tongue and burning breast he felt no desire to get up--on the contrary--and his brain worked more during this morning than it had probably worked before for forty years the worthy magistrate recalled to his mind all the incidents of the incomprehensible performance he connected them with the events which had taken place shortly before at doctor ox's reception he tried to dis- cover the causes of the singular excitability which on two occasions had betrayed itself in the best citizens of the town what can be going on he asked himself what giddy spirit has taken possession of my peaceable town of quiquendone are we about to go mad and must we make the town one vast asy- lum for yesterday we were all there notables counselors judges advocates physicians school- masters and all if my memory serves me--all of us were assailed by this excess of furious folly but what was there in that infernal music it is inex- plicable yet i certainly ate or drank nothing which could put me into such a state no yesterday i had for dinner a slice of well done veal several spoonfuls of spinach with sugar eggs and a little beer and water--that couldn't get into my head no there is something that i cannot explain and as after all i am responsible for the conduct of the citizens i will have an investigation an investigation by the municipal council but the investigation though decided upon by the municipal council produced no re- sult if the fats were clear the causes es- caped the sagacity of the magistrates besides tranquillity has been restored in the public mind and with tranquillity forgetfulness of the strange scenes of the theatre the newspapers avoided speaking of them and the account of the perform- ance which appeared in the quiquendone memorial made no allusion to this intoxication of the entire audience meanwhile though the town resumed its habitual phlegm and became apparently flemish as before it was observable that at bottom the character and  amazing stories temperament of the people changed little by little one might have truly said with dominique custos the doctor that their nerves were affected let us explain this undoubted change only took place under certain conditions when the quiquen- donians passed through the streets of the town walked in the squares or along the vaar they were always the cold and methodical people of former days so too when they remained at home some working with their hands and others with their heads--these doing nothing those thinking noth- ing--their private life was silent inert vegetating as before no quarrels no household squabbles no acceleration in the beating of the heart no excite- ment of the brain the mean of their pulsations re- mained as it was of old but strange and inexplicable phenomenon though it was which would have defied the sagacity of the most ingenious physiologists of the day if the in- habitants of quiquendone did not change in their home life they were visibly changed in their civil life and in their relations between man and man to which it leads the strange localization of the excitement if they met together in some public edifice it did not work well as commissary passauf ex- pressed it on change at the town-hall in the amphitheater of the academy at the sessions of the council as well as the reunions of the savants a strange excitement seized the assembled citizens their relations with each other became embarrass- ing before they had been together an hour in two hours the discussion degenerated into an angry dis- pute heads became heated and personalities were used even at church during the sermon the faith- ful could not listen to van stabel the minister in patience and he threw himself about in the pulpit and lectured his flock with far more than his usual severity at last this state of things brought about altercations more grave alas than that between custos and schut and if they did not require the interference of the authorities it was because the antagonists after returning home found therein its calm forgetfulness of the offences offered and received this peculiarity could not be observed by these minds which were absolutely incapable of recognis- ing what was passing in them one person only in the town he whose office the council had thought of suppressing for thirty years michael passauf had remarked that this excitement which was absent from private houses quickly revealed itself in public edifices and he asked himself not without a cer- tain anxiety what would happen if this infection should ever develop itself in the family mansions and if the epidemic--this was the word he used-- should extend through the streets of the town then there would be no more forgetfulness of in- sults no more tranquillity no intermission in the delirium but a permanent inflammation which would inevitably bring the quiquendonians into col- lision with each other what would happen then commissary passauf asked himself in terror how could these furious savages be arrested how check these goaded tem- peraments my office would be no longer a sine- cure and the council would be obliged to double my salary--unless it should arrest me myself for dis- turbing the public peace the banker's dancing party these very reasonable fears began to be real- ized the infection spread from change the theatre the church the town-hall the acad- emy the market into private houses and that in less than a fortnight after the terrible performance of the huguenots its first symptoms appeared in the house of col- laert the banker that wealthy personage gave a ball or at least a dancing-party to the notabilities of the town he had issued some months before a loan of thirty thousand francs three quarters of which had been subscribed and to celebrate this financial success he had opened his drawing-rooms and given a party to his fellow-citizens the dancing everybody knows that flemish parties are innocent and tranquil enough the principal expense is usually in beer and sirups some conversation on the appearance of crops the fine con- dition of the gardens the care of flowers and es- pecially of tulips a slow and measured dance from time to time perhaps a minuet sometimes a waltz but one of those german waltzes which achieve a turn and a half per minute and during which the dancers hold each other as far apart as their arms will permit--such is the usual fashion of the balls attended by the aristocratic society of quiquen- done but the dancers always lagged behind the orchestra no matter how slow the measure and it had to be abandoned these peaceable reunions in which the youths and maidens enjoyed an honest and moderate pleas- ure had never been attended by any outburst of ill- nature why then on this evening at collaert the banker's did the sirups seem to be transformed into heady wines into sparkling champagne into heat- ing punches why towards the middle of the eve- ning did a sort of mysterious intoxication take possession of the guests why did the minuet be- come a jig why did the orchestra hurry with its harmonies why did the candles just as at the theatre burn with unwonted refulgence what electric current invaded the banker's drawing- rooms how happened it that the couples held each other so closely and clasped each other's hands so convulsively that the cavaliers seuls made them- selves conspicuous by certain extraordinary steps in that figure usually so grave so solemn so majestic so very proper alas what edipus could have answered these unsolvable riddles commissary passauf who was present at the party saw the storm coming distinct- ly but he could not control it or fly from it and he felt a kind of intoxication entering his own brain all his physical and emotional faculties increased in intensity he was seen several times to throw him- self upon the confectionery and devour the dishes as if he had just broken a long fast the animation of the ball was increasing all this while a long murmur like a dull buzzing escaped from all breasts they danced--really danced the feet were agitated by increasing frenzy the faces dr ox's experiment  became as purple as that of silenus the eyes shone like carbuncles the general fermentation rose to the highest pitch waltz from der freischuetz and when the orchestra thundered out the waltz in der freischutz--when this waltz so german and with a movement so slow was attacked with wild arms by the musicians--ah it was no longer a waltz but an insensate whirlwind a gyration worthy of being led by some mephisto- pheles beating the measure with a firebrand then a galop an infernal galop which lasted an hour without any one being able to stop it whirled off in its windings across the halls the drawing-rooms the antechambers by the staircases from the cel- lar to the garret of the opulent mansion the young men and young girls the fathers and mothers people of every age of every weight of both sexes collaert the fat banker and madame collaert and the counselors and the magistrates and the chief justice and niklausse and madame van tricasse and the burgomaster van tricasse and the com- missary passauf himself who never could recall af- terwards who had been his partner on that terrible evening but she did not forget and ever since that day she has seen in her dreams the fiery commissary enfolding her in an impassioned embrace and she--was the amiable tatanemance chapter ix in which doctor ox and ygene his assistant say a few words well ygene well master all is ready the laying of the pipes is finished at last now then we are going to operate on a large scale on the masses chapter x in which it will be seen that the epidemic invades the entire town and what effect it produces during the following months the evil in place of subsiding became more extended from private houses the epidemic spread into the streets the town of quiquendone was no longer to be recognized a phenomenon yet stranger than those which had already happened now appeared not only the ani- mal kingdom but the vegetable kingdom itself be- came subject to the mysterious influence according to the ordinary course of things epi- demics are special in their operation those which attack humanity spare the animals and those which attack the animals spare the vegetables a horse was never afflicted with small-pox nor a man with the cattle-plague nor do sheep suffer from the po- tato-rot but here all the laws of nature seemed to be overturned not only were the character tem- perament and ideas of the townsfolk changed but the domestic animals--dogs and cats horses and cows asses and goats--suffered from this epidemic influence as if their habitual equilibrium had been changed the plants themselves were infected by a similar strange metamorphosis in the gardens and vegetable patches and or- chards very curious symptoms manifested them- selves climbing plants climbed more audaciously tufted plants became more tufted than ever shrubs became trees cereals scarcely sown showed their little green heads and gained in the same length of time as much in inches as formerly under the most favorable circumstances they had gained in fractions asparagus attained the height of several feet the artichokes swelled to the size of melons the melons to the size of pumpkins the pumpkins to the size of barrels the gourds to the size of the belfry bell which measured in truth- nine feet in diameter the cabbages were bushes and the mush- rooms were umbrellas the fruits did not lag behind the vegetables it required two persons to eat a strawberry and four to consume a pear the grapes also attained the enormous proportions of those so well depicted by poussin in his return of the envoys to the prom- ised land the giant tulip it was the same with the flowers immense vio- lets spread the most penetrating perfumes through the air exaggerated roses shone with the brightest colors lilies formed in a few days impenetrable copses geraniums daisies camellias rhododendrons invaded the garden walks and stifled each other and the tulips--those dear lili- aceous plants so dear to the flemish heart--what emotion they must have caused to their zealous culti- vators the worthy van bistrom nearly fell over backwards one day on seeing in his garden an enormous tulipa gesneriam a gigantic monster whose cup afforded space for a nest of a whole fam- ily of robins the entire town flocked to see this floral phenom- enon and renamed it the tulipa quiquendonia but alas if these plants these fruits these flowers grew visibly to the naked eye if all the vegetables insisted on assuming colossal proportions if the brilliancy of their colors and perfume intoxi- cated the smell and the sight they quickly withered the air which they absorbed rapidly exhausted them and they soon died faded and dried up such was the fate of the famous tulip which after several days of gorgeous splendor became emaciated and fell lifeless the domestic animals it was soon the same with the domestic animals from the house dog to the stable pig from the canary to the turkey of the back court it must be said that in ordinary times these animals were not less phlegmatic than their masters the dogs and cats vegetated rather than lived they never betrayed a wag of pleasure nor a snarl of wrath their tails moved no more than if they had been made of bronze such a thing as a bite or scratch from any of them had not been known from time immemorial as for mad dogs they were looked upon as imaginary beasts like the griffins and the rest in the menagerie of the apocalypse but what a change had taken place in a few months the smallest incidents of which we are try- ing to reproduce dogs and cats began to show teeth and claws several executions had taken place after reiterated offenses a horse was seen for  amazing stories the first time to take his bit in his teeth and rush through the streets of quiquendone an ox was ob- served to precipitate itself with lowered horns up- on one of his herd an ass was seen to turn himself over with his legs in the air in the place saint ernuph and bray as ass never brayed before a sheep actually a sheep defended valiantly the cut- lets within him from the butcher's knife the madness spreads van tricasse the burgomaster was forced to make police rules and regulations concern- ing the domestic animals as seized with lun- acy they rendered the streets of quiquendone un- safe but alas if the animals were mad the men were scarcely less so no age was spared by the scourge babies soon became quite insupportable though till now so easy to bring up and for the first time honore syntax the judge was obliged to apply the rod to his youthful offspring there was a kind of insurrection at the high school and the dictionaries became formidable missiles in the classes the scholars would not sub- mit to be shut in and besides the infection took the teachers themselves who overwhelmed the boys and girls with extravagant tasks and punishments another strange phenomenon occurred all these quiquendonians so sober before whose chief food had been whipped creams committed wild excesses in their eating and drinking their usual regimen no longer sufficed each stomach was transformed into a gulf and it became necessary to fill this gulf by the most energetic means the consumption of the town was trebled instead of two repasts they had six many cases of indigestion were reported the counselor niklausse could not satisfy his hun- ger van tricasse found it impossible to assuage his thirst and remained in a state of rabid semi- intoxication in short the most alarming symptoms manifest- ed themselves and increased from day to day drunken people staggered in the streets and these were often citizens of high position the physician's work increases dominique custos the physician had plenty to do with the heartburns inflam- mations and nervous affections which proved to what a strange degree the nerves of the people had been irritated there were daily quarrels and altercations in the once deserted but now crowded streets of quiquen- done for nobody could stay at home any longer it was necessary to establish a new poilce force to con- trol the disturbers of the public peace a prison cage was established in the town hall and speedily became full night and day of refractory offenders commissary passauf was in despair a marriage was concluded in less than two months--such a thing had never been seen before yes the son of rupp the schoolmaster wedded the daughter of augustine de rovere and that fifty- seven days only after he had petitioned for her hand and heart other marriages were decided upon which in old times would have remained in doubt and dis- cussion for years the burgomaster perceived that his own daughter the charming suzel was escap- ing from his hands as for dear tatanemance she had dared to sound commissary passauf on the subject of a union which seemed to her to combine every ele- ment of happiness fortune honor youth at last--to reach the depths of abomination--a duel took place yes a duel with pistols--horse- pistols--at seventy-five paces with ball cartridges and between whom our readers will never be- lieve  between m frantz niklausse the gentle angler and young simon collaert the wealthy banker's son and the cause of this duel was the burgomaster's daughter for whom simon discovered himself to be fired with passion and whom he refused to yield to the claims of an audacious rival chapter xi in which the quiquendonians adopt an heroic resolution we have seen to what a deplorable condition the people of quiquendone were reduced their heads were in a ferment they no longer knew or recognized themselves the most peaceable citizens had become quarrelsome if you looked at them askance they would speedily send you a challenge some let their mustaches grow and several--the most belligerent--curled them up at at the ends this being the condition the administration of the town and the maintenance of order in the streets became difficult tasks for the government had not been organized for such a state of things the burgomaster--that worthy van tricasse whom we have seen so placid so dull so incapable of coming to any decision--the burgomaster became intract- able his house resounded with the sharpness of his voice he made twenty decisions a day scolding his officials and himself enforcing the regulations of his administration ah what a change the amiable and tranquil mansion of the burgomaster that good flemish home--where was its former calm what changes had taken place in your household economy mad- ame van tricasse had become acrid whimsical harsh her husband sometimes succeeded in drown- ing her voice by talking louder than she but could not silence her the petulant humor of this worthy dame was excited by everything nothing went right the servants offended her every moment tatanemance her sister-in-law who was not less ir ritable replied sharply to her m van tricasse nat- urally supported lotche his servant as is the case in all good households and this permanently exas- perated madame who constantly disputed dis- cussed and made scenes with her husband changes in the household what on earth is the matter with us cried the unhappy burgomaster what is this fire that is devouring us are we possessed with the devil ah madam van tricasse you will end by making me die before you and thus violate all the traditions of the family the reader will not have forgotten the strange custom by which m van tricasse would become a dr ox's experiment  widower and marry again so as not to break the chain of descent meanwhile this disposition of all minds pro- duced other curious effects worthy of note this ex- citement the cause of which has so far escaped us brought about unexpected physiological changes talents hitherto unrecognized betrayed them- selves aptitudes were suddenly revealed ar- tists before common-place displayed new ability politicians and authors arose orators proved them- selves equal to the most arduous debates and on every question inflamed audiences which were quite ready to be inflamed from the sessions of the council this movement spread to the public political meetings and a club was formed at quiquendone while twenty newspapers the quiquendone signal the quiquendone impartial the quiquendone radi- cal and so on written in an inflammatory style raised the most important questions an impending war but what about you will ask apropos of everything and of nothing apropos of the oudenarde tower which was falling and which some wished to pull down and others to prop up apropos of the police regulations issued by the council which some obstinate citizens threat- ened to resist apropos of the sweeping of the but- ters repairing the sewers and so on nor did the enraged orators confine themselves to the internal administration of the town carried on by the cur- rent they went further and essayed to plunge their fellow-citizens into the hazards of war quiquendone had had for eight or nine hundred years a casus belli of the best quality but she had precisiously laid it up like a relic and there had seemed some probability that it would become ef- fete and no longer serviceable this was what had given rise to the casus belli it is not generally known that quiquendone in this cosy corner of flanders lies next to the little town of virgamen the territories of the two communities are con- tiguous well in  some time before count baldwin's departure to the crusades a virga- men cow--not a cow belonging to a citizen but a cow which was common property let it be observed --audaciously ventured to pasture on the territory of quiquendone this unfortunate beast had scarce- ly eaten three mouthfuls but the offense the abuse the crime--whatever you will--was committed and duly indicted for the magistrates at that time had already begun to know how to write revenge for a national offence we will take revenge at the proper mo- ment said simple natalis van tricasse the thirty-second predecessor of the burgo- master of this story and the virgamenians will lose nothing by waiting the virgamenians were forewarned they wait- ed thinking without doubt that the remembrance of the offense would fade away with the lapse of time and really for several centuries they lived on good terms with their neighbors of quiquen- done but they counted without their hosts or rather without this strange epidemic which radically changing the character of the quiquendonians aroused their dormant vengeance it was at the club of the rue monstrelet that the truculent orator schut abruptly introducing the subject to his hearers inflamed them with the expressions and metaphors used on such occasions he recalled the offense the injury which had been done to quiquen- done and which a nation jealous of its rights could not admit as a precedent he showed the in- sult to be still existing the wound still bleeding he spoke of certain special head-shakings on the part of the people of virgamen which indicated in what degree of contempt they regarded the people of quiquendone he appealed to his fellow-citizens who unconsciously perhaps had supported this mortal insult for long centuries he adjured the children of the ancient town to have no other pur- pose than to obtain a substantial reparation and lastly he made an appeal to all the living energies of the nation with what enthusiasm these words so new to quiquendonian ears were greeted may be sur- mised but cannot be told all the auditors rose and with extended arms demanded war with loud cries never had the advocate schut achieved such a success and it must be avowed that his triumphs were not few a memorable reading the burgomaster the counselor all the not- abilities present at this memorable meeting would have vainly attempted to resist the popular outburst besides they had no desire to do so and cried as loud if not louder than the rest to the frontier to the frontier as the frontier was but three kilometers from the walls of quiquendone it is certain that the virga- menians ran a real danger for they might easily be invaded without having had time to look about them meanwhile josse lietrinck the worthy chemist who alone had preserved his senses on this grave occasion tried to make his fellow-citizens compre- hend that guns cannon and generals were equally wanting to their design they replied to him not without many impatient gestures that these gen- erals cannon and guns would be improvised that the right and love of country sufficed and rendered a people irresistible hereupon the burgomaster himself came forward and in a sublime harangue make short work of those pusillanimous people who disguise their fear under a veil of prudence which veil he tore off with a pa- triotic hand at this sally it seemed as if the hall would fall in under the applause the vote was eagerly demanded and was taken amid acclamations the cries of to virgamen to virgamen redoubled the burgomaster then took it upon himself to put the armies in motion and in the name of the town he promised the honors of a triumph such as was given in the times of the romans to that one of its generals who should return victorious meanwhile josse lietrinck who was an obstinate fellow and did not regard himself as beaten though he really had been insisted on making another ob- servation he wished to remark that the triumph was only accorded at rome to those victorious gen- erals who had killed five thousand of the enemy  amazing stories well well cried the meeting deliriously and as the population of the town of virgamen consists of but three thousand five hundred and seventy-five inhabitants it would be difficult un- less the same person was killed several times- but they did not let the luckless logician finish and he was turned out hustled and bruised citizens said pulmacher the grocer who usually sold groceries by retail whatever this cowardly apothecary may have said i engage by myself to kill five thousand virgamenians if you will accept my services five thousand five hundred cried a yet more resolute patriot six thousand six hundred retorted the grocer seven thousand cried jean orbideck the con- fectioner of the rue hembling who was on the road to fortune by making whipped creams adjudged exclaimed the burgomaster van tricasse on finding that no one else rose on the bid and this was how jean orbideck the confection- er became general-in-chief of the forces of qui- quendone chapter xii in which ygene the assistant gives a reasonable piece of advice which is eagerly rejected by doctor ox well master said ygene next day as he poured the pails of sulphuric acid into the troughs of the great battery well resumed doctor ox was i not right see to what not only the physical developments of a whole nation but its morality its dignity its talents its political sense have come it is only a question of molecules no doubt but- but- do you not think that matters have gone far enough and that these poor devils should not be excited beyond measure no no cried the doctor no i will go on to the end as you will master the experiment however seems to me conclusive and i think it time to- to- to close the valve you'd better not cried doctor ox if you at- tempt it i'll throttle you chapter xiii in which it is once more proved that by taking high ground all human littlenesses may be overlooked you say asked the burgomaster van tricasse of the counselor niklausse i say that this war is necessary replied niklausse firmly and that the time has come to avenge this insult and i repeat to you snapped the burgomaster tartly that if the people of quiquendone do not profit by this occasion to vindicate their rights they will be unworthy of their name and as for me i maintain that we ought with- out delay to collect our forces and lead them to the front really monsieur really replied van tricasse and do you speak thus to me to yourself monsieur the burgomaster and you shall hear the truth unwelcome as it may be and you shall hear it yourself counselor re- turned van tricasse in a passion for it will come better from my mouth than from yours yes monsieur yes any delay would be dishonorable the town of quiquendone has waited nine hundred years for the moment to take its revenge and what- ever you may say whether it pleases you or not we shall march upon the enemy ah you take it thus replied niklausse harshly very well monsieur we will march without you if it does not please you to go a burgomaster's place is in the front rank monsieur and that of a counselor also monsieur you insult me by thwarting all my wishes cried the burgomaster whose fists seemed likely to hit out before long and you insult me equally by doubting my pa- triotism cried niklausse who was equally ready for a tussle i tell you monsieur that the army of quiquen- done shall be put in motion within two days and i repeat to you monsieur that forty-eight hours shall not pass before we shall have marched upon the enemy the counselor and the burgomaster it is easy to see from this fragment of conversa- tion that the two speakers supported exactly the same idea both wished for hostilities but as their excitement disposed them to altercation niklausse would not listen to van tricasse nor van tricasse to niklausse had they been of contrary opinions on this grave question had the burgomas- ter favored war and the counselor insisted on peace the quarrel could not have been more violent these two old friends gazed fiercely at each other by the quickened beating of their hearts their red faces their contracted pupils the trembling of their muscles their harsh voices it might be conject- ured that they were ready to come to blows but the striking of a large clock happily checked the adversaries at the moment when they seemed on the point of assaulting each other at last the hour has come cried the burgomaster what hour asked the counselor the hour to go to the belfry tower it is true and whether it pleases you or not i shall go monsieur and i too let us go let us go it might have been supposed from these last words that a collision had occurred and that the adversaries were proceeding to a duel but it was not so it had been agreed that the burgomaster and the counselor as the two principal dignitaries of the town should repair to the town hall and there show themselves on the high tower which overlooked quiquendone that they should examine the surrounding country so as to make the best strategic plan for the advance of their troops though they were in accord on this subject they did not cease to quarrel bitterly as they went their dr ox's experiment  loud voices were heard resounding in the streets but all the passers-by were now accustomed to this the exasperation of the dignitaries seemed quite natural and no one took notice of it under the circumstances a calm man would have been re- garded as a monster climbing the belfry tower the burgomaster and the counselor having reached the porch of the belfry were in a paroxysm of fury they were no longer red but pale this terrible discussion though they had the same idea had produced internal spasms and everyone knows that paleness shows that anger has reached its last limits at the foot of the narrow tower staircase there was a real explosion who should go up first who should first creep up the winding steps truth compels us to say that there was a tussle and that the counselor niklausse forgetful of all that he owed to his superior to the supreme magistrate of the town pushed van tricasse violently back and dashed up the staircase first both ascended denouncing and raging at each other at every step it was to be feared that a ter- ribel climax would occur on the summit of the tower which rose threehundred and fifty-sevfen feet above the pavement the two enemies soon got out of breath how- ever and in a little while at the eightieth step they began to move up heavily breathing loud and short then--was it because of their being out of breath--their wrath subsided or at least only be- trayed itself by a succession of unseemly epithets they became silent and strange to say it seemed as if their excitement diminished as they ascended higher above the town a sort of lull took place in their minds their brain became cooler and sim- mered down like a coffee pot when taken away from the fire why a lull in the excitement we cannot answer this why but the truth is that having reached a certain landing- stage two hundred and sixty-feet above ground the two adversaries sat down and really more calm looked at each other without any anger in their faces how high it is said the burgomaster passing his handkerchief over his rubicund face very high returned the counselor do you known that we have gone fourteen feet higher than the church of saint michael at hamburg i know it replied the burgomaster in a tone of vanity very pardonable in the chief magistrate of quiquendone the two notabilities soon resumed their ascent casting curious glances through the loopholes pierced in the tower walls the burgomaster had taken the head of the procession without any re- mark on the part of the counselor it even hap- pened that at about the three hundred and fourth step van tricasse being completely tired out nik- lausse kindly pushed him from behind the burgo- master offered no resistance to this and when he reached the platform of the tower said graciously thanks niklausse i will do the same for you one day a little while before it had been two wild beasts ready to tear each other to pieces who had present- ed themselves at the foot of the tower it was now two friends who reached its summit the weather was superb it was the month of may the sun had absorbed all the vapors what a pure and limpid atmosphere the most minute ob- jects over a broad space might be discerned the walls of virgamen glistening in their whiteness-- its red pointed roofs its belfries shining in the sunlight--appeared a few miles off and this was the town that was foredoomed to all the horrors of fire and pillage peace once more the burgomaster and the counselor sat down beside each other on a small stone bench like two worthy people whose souls were in close sympathy as they recovered breath they looked around then after a brief silence how fine this is cried the burgomaster yes it is admirable replied the counselor does it not seem to you my good van tricasse that humanity is destined to dwell rather at such heights than to crawl about on the surface of our globe i agree with you honest niklausse returned the burgomaster i agree with you you seize sen- timent better when you get clear of nature you breathe it in every sense it is at such heights that philosophers should be formed and that sages should live above the miseries of this world shall we go around the platform asked the counselor let us go around the platform replied the burgomaster and the two friends arm in arm and putting as formerly long pauses between their questions and answers examined every point of the horizon it is at least seventeen years since i have as- cended the belfry tower said van tricasse i do not think i ever came up before replied niklausse and i regret it for the view from this height is sublime do you see my friend the pretty stream of the vaar as it winds among the trees and beyond the heights of saint hermandad how gracefully they shut in the horizon observe that border of green trees which nature has so picturesquely arranged ah nature nature nik- lausse could the hand of man ever hope to rival her it is enchanting my excellent friend replied the counselor see the flocks and herds lying in the verdant pasture -- the oxen the cows the sheep and the laborers going to the fields you would say they were arcadian shepherds they only want a bagpipe and over all this fertile country the beautiful blue sky which no vapor dims ah niklausse one might become a poet here i do not understand why saint simeon stylites was not one of the greatest poets of the world it was because perhaps his column was not high enough replied the counselor with a gentle smile  amazing stories the chimes of quiquendone at this moment the chimes of quiquendone rang out the clear bells played one of their most melodious airs the two friends listened in ecstasy then in his calm voice van tricasse said but what friend niklausse did we come to the top of this tower to do in fact replied the counselor we have per- mitted ourselves to be carried away by our reveries - what did we come here to do repeated the burgomaster we came said niklausse to breathe this pure air which human weaknesses have not corrupted well shall we descend friend niklausse let us descend friend van tricasse they gave a parting glance at the splendid pano- rama which was spread before their eyes then the burgomaster passed down first and began to de- scend with a slow and measured pace the coun- selor followed a few steps behind they reached the landing stage at which they had stopped on ascend- ing already their cheeks began to redden they tarried a moment then resumed their descent in a few moments van tricasse begged niklausse to go more slowly as he felt him on his heels and it worried him it even did more than worry him for twenty steps lower down he ordered the coun- selor to stop that he might get on some distance ahead the counselor replied that he did not wish to re- main with his leg in the air to await the good pleas- ure of the burgomaster and kept on van tricasse retorted with a rude expression the counselor responded by an insulting allusion to the burgomaster's age destined as he was by his family traditions to marry a second time the burgomaster went down twenty steps more and warned niklausse that this should not pass thus niklausse replied that at all events he would pass down first and the space being very narrow the two dignitaries came into collision and found themselves in utter darkness the words block- head and booby were the mildest which they now applied to each other we shall see stupid beast cried the burgomas- ter--we shall see what figure you will make in this war and in what rank you will march in the rank that precedes yours you silly old fool replied niklausse the dispute begins again then there were other cries and it seemed as if bodies were rolling over each other what was going on why were these dispositions so quickly changed why were the gentle sheep of the tower's summit metamorphosed into tigers two hundred feet below it however this might be the guardian of the tower hearing the noise opened the door just at the mo- ment when the two adversaries bruised and with protruding eyes were in the act of tearing each other's hair--fortunately they wore wigs you shall give me satisfaction for this cried the burgomaster shaking his fist under his adver- sary's nose whenever you please growled the counselor niklausse attempting to respond with a vigorous kick the guardian who was himself in a passion--i cannot say why--thought the scene a very natural one i know not what excitement urged him to take part in it but he controlled himself and went off to announce throughout the neighborhood that a hos- tile meeting was about to take place between the burgomaster van tricasse and the counselor nik- lausse chapter xiv in which matters go so far that the inhabitants of qui- quendone the reader and even the author demand an immediate denouement the last incident proves to what a pitch of ex- citement the quiquendonians had been wrought the two oldest friends in the town --and the most gentle before the advent of the epi- demic--to reach this degree of violence and that too only a few minutes after their old mutual sympathy their amiable instincts their contempla- tive habit had been restored at the summit of the tower on learning what was going on doctor ox could not contain his joy he resisted the arguments which ygene who saw what a serious turn affairs were taking addressed to him besides both of them were infected by the general fury they were not less excited than the rest of the population and they ended by quarreling as violent- ly as the burgomaster and the counselor besides one question eclipsed all others and the intended duels were postponed by issue of the vir- gamenian difficulty no man had the right to shed his blood uselessly when it belonged to the last drop to his country in danger the affair was in short a grave one and there was no withdrawing from it beginning the war the burgomaster van tricasse despite the war-like ardor with which he was filled had not thought it best to throw himself upon the enemy without warning him he had therefore through the medium of the rural policeman hotter- ing sent to demand reparation of the virgamenians for the offense committed in  on the quiquen- donian territory the authorities of virgamen could not at first imagine of what the envoy spoke and the latter despite his official character was conducted back to the frontier very cavalierly van tricasse then sent one of the aides-de-camp of the confectioner-general citizen hildevert shu- man a manufacturer of barley sugar a very firm and energetic man who carried to the authorities of virgamen the original minute of the indictment drawn up in  by order of the burgomaster natalis van tricasse the authorities of virgamen burst out laughing and served the aide-de-camp in the same manner as the rural policeman the burgomaster then assembled the dignitaries of the town a letter remarkably and vigorously drawn up was written as an ultimatum the cause of quarrel dr ox's experiment  was plainly stated and a delay of twenty-four hours was accorded to the guilty city in which to repair the outrage done to quiquendone the letter was sent off and returned a few hours afterwards torn to bits which made so many fresh insults the virgamenians knew of old the fore- bearance and equanimity of the quiquendonians and made sport of them and their demand of their casus belli and their ultimatum there was only one thing left to do--to have recourse to arms to invoke the god of battles and after the prussian fashion to hurl themselves upon the virgamenians before the latter could be pre- pared this decision was made by the council in solemn conclave in which cries objurgations and menacing gestures were mingled with unexampled violence an assembly of idiots a congress of madmen a club of maniacs would not have been more tumul- tuous assembling the troops as soon as the declaration of war was known general jean orbideck assembled his troops perhaps two thousand three hundred and ninety-three combatants from a population of two thousand three hundred and ninety-three souls the women the children the old men were joined with the able-bodied males the guns of the town had been put under requisition five had been found two of which were without cocks and these had been dis- tributed to the advance guard the artillery was composed of the old culverin of the chateau taken in  at the attack on quesnoy one of the first occasions of the use of cannon in history and which had not been fired off for five centuries happily for those who were appointed to take it in charge there were no projectiles with which to load it but such as it was this engine might well impose on the enemy as for side-arms they had been taken from the museum of antiquities--flint hatchets hel- mets frankish battle axes javelins halberds ra- piers and so on and also out of those domestic ar- senals commonly known as cupboards and kit- chens but courage the right hatred of the for- eigner the yearning for vengeance -were to take the place of more perfect engines and to replace--at least it was hoped so--the modern machine guns and breech-loaders the troops were passed in review not a citizen failed at the roll call general orbideck whose seat on horse-back was far from firm and whose steed was a vicious beast was thrown three times in front of the army but he got up again without injury and this was regarded as a favorable omen the burgomaster the counselor the civil commis- sary the chief justice the school teacher the banker the rector--in short all the notabilities of the town--marched at the head there were no tears shed either by mothers sisters or daughters they urged on their husbands fathers brothers to the combat and even followed them and formed the rear guard under the orders of the courageous madam van tricasse the crier jean mistrol blew his trumpet the army moved off and directed itself with ferocious cries towards the oudenarde gate shutting off the oxygen at the moment when the head of the column was about to pass the walls of the town a man threw himself before it stop stop fools that you are he cried sus- pend your blows let me shut the valve you are not changed in nature you are good citizens quiet and peacable if you are so excited it is my mas- ter doctor ox's fault it is an experiment under the pretext of lighting your streets with oxyhydric gas he has saturated- the assistant was beside himself but he could not finish at the instant that the doctor's secret was about to escape his lips doctor ox himself pounced upon the unhappy ygene in an indescrib- able rage and shut his mouth by blows with his fist it was a battle the burgomaster the counselor the dignitaries who had stopped short on ygene's sudden appearance carried away in turn by their exasperation rushed upon the two strangers with- out waiting to hear either the one or the other doctor ox and his assistant beaten and lashed were about to be dragged by order of van tricasse to the roundhouse when- chapter xv in which the denouement takes place when a formidable explosion resounded all the atmosphere which enveloped quiquen- done seemed on fire a flame of an intensity and vividness quite unwonted shot up into the hea- vens like a meteor had it been night this flame would have been visible for ten leagues around the whole army of quiquendone fell to the earth like an army of monks happily there were no victims a few scratches and slight hurts were the only result the confectioner who as chance would have it had not fallen from his horse this time had his plume singed and escaped without any further injury what had happened something very simple as was soon learned the gas works had just blown up during the absence of the doctor and his assistant some careless mis- take had no doubt been made it is not known how or why a communication had been established be- tween the reservoir which contained the oxygen and that which inclosed the hydrogen an explosive mixture had resulted from the union of these two gases to which fire had accidentally been applied this changed everything but when the army got upon its feet again doctor ox and his assistant ygene had disappeared chapter xvi in which the intelligent reader sees that he has gues- sed correctly despite all the author's precautions after the explosion quiquendone immedi- ately became the peaceable phlegmatic and flemish town that it formerly was after the explosion which indeed did not cause a very lively sensation each one without knowing why mechanically took his way home the burgo- master leaning on the counselor's arm the advo- continued on page  the talking brain by  mh hasta he lived near to madness with his grisly guest the placid waxen features must have been worst of all - with their staring indifferent eyes behind which his victim and his judge spoke out in endless alternate prayer and invective - the face with- out feeling hiding hell  the talking brain  the beginning of a strange story--a friendless scientist the death of the student vinton and professor murtha's suicide following brought the university a good deal of unwelcome prominence in fact the newspapers demanded investigation and president archer asked me to prepare a statement of the facts for general publication because i know them better than anyone now living circumstances forced me into the very heart of the affair i am glad of the opportunity to explain it for my own name was rather unpleasantly men- tioned on recent front pages i worked with murtha for months perhaps i helped him somewhat in de- veloping the remarkable instruments which tempted him to crime i introduced him to vinton i was with him the night of his death and heard his con- fession and for the validity of his notes i am his sole witness to science it is said that i was his only friend this last is not quite true murtha had no friends --he was not a man who could or would undertake the ordinary human relations up to his last days he was self-sufficient--impersonal--official--unbend- ingly scientific the first evening i met him an incident occurred which illustrates very well why he was rather outside the general fellowship of the faculty we were introduced at the club by jedney murtha's department head here's a new chap we're extra proud to have in the psychology depart- ment he said and thep with a twinkle look out for him harvey for he's dabbling with your spe- cialty and he'll show up all of us old boys if we don't hustle he went on to say the usual amiable things about my electrical work and the more recent x-ray research with crystals then he moved away leav- ing us together i made conversation since professor murtha seemed inclined to leave me the duty and i studied him he was ill-at-ease there was clearly no humor there for he made no attempt to respond to jedney's joviality he was of medium height with rather an academic face beneath red hair and his speech was clipped and formal he dressed with almost conspicuous quiet- ness a typical assistant professor you might judge from the description-- and yet somehow the man was set off from the rest of us as an arrow is distinguished in a rack of walking sticks it was not poise or strength it was rather a kind of fierce concentration on some hidden purpose it was the most noticeable thing about him testing the psychological reactions unknown to the subject of the experiment we talked of trivialities and then i rose to go uninvited he was beside me at once with a the possibility of maintaining life in an organ separ- ated from the body to which it belongs is claimed to have been approached by dr flexner a celebrated scien- tist the insertion of tissue from one live animal into another even the transfusion of blood which of course is comparatively simple suggests endless possibilities to the creative surgeon and in this story our author depicts such a surgeon--a wonderful genius wrapt up in his science self-contained aloof from the rest of humanity-- and tells of his work upon living subjects and leads to a denouement that is only reached at the very end of the story which compares favorably with edgar a poe's tales it is an interesting successor to the wonderful story the case of m valdemar light flowing step and we passed out onto the dim- ming campus beneath the sturdy elms opposite carson hall he said in a hesitant way which he seemed to try to make cordial could you come up to my rooms for a few minutes professor harvey i'd like very much to have your help with this new electro-neural work i'm undertaking professor jedney says you know more about the action of weak electric currents than anyone else on this side of the atlantic i want to ask a few questions i was idle that evening and i went he installed me by an open fire--it was september but chilly-- and left me after pushing a box of cigarettes to my elbow i had time to receive an impression of austere richness--handsome books the glint of ma- hogany etchings--before he returned with a small box that trailed wires he set it on the table beside me took the chair opposite and lighted a cigarette the box contained a galvanometer with a record- ing dial and two wrist straps were in the circuit he explained that he wanted to get some records of the body's resistance to electric currents and asked if i would mind his taking one while we talked all that was required was that i should wear the straps i consented we discussed currents and resistances he spoke intelligently and betrayed a good knowledge of the physical side of the subject although he was weak in mathematics it was interesting to see how he came to life in the talk shyness and self-conscious- ness vanished as soon as he spoke of technicalities he was vital interested assured but suddenly he seemed to remember something he checked him- self rose and picked a book from the table near at hand it fell open to a familiar passage the shakespearean test here's something i'd like to read you he said abruptly we had been talking about hys- teresis and steinmetz's formulae and i blinked a bit with surprise when he began to read from shake- speare -- the scene in king john where little prince arthur pleads with hubert for his eyesight the king you remember has ordered hubert to blind the child some of the passages are so poig- nant they hurt arthur must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes  hubert young boy i must arthur and will you hubert and i will arthur have you the heart when your head did but ache i knit my handkercher about your brows the best i had a princess wrought it me and i did never ask it you again and with my hand at midnight held your head and like the watchful minutes to the hour still and anon cheered up the heavy time they were two suffering people together man  amazing stories and boy--the one with his terror of the flaming iron and the other with his memory of the child's gentle- ness and helplessness and his dread of seeing for- ever the blackened empty sockets under the smooth boyish forehead--and going to his grave with the smell of searing flesh in his nostrils it is no won- der hubert's voice shook as he answered the prince's question is there no remedy hubert none but to lose your eyes arthur o heaven that there were but a mote in yours a grain of dust a gnat a wandering hair any annoyance in that precious sense then feeling what small things are boisterous there your vile intent must needs seem horrible it is easy to be brutal at a distance--but to hurt something small and helpless is enough to make a man detest himself let me not hold my tongue let me not hubert or hubert if you will cut out my tongue so i may keep mine eyes o spare mine eyes i have never seen the play on the stage but i can imagine the sigh of relief that flutters over an audience when hubert breaks down and exclaims i will not touch thine eyes and the boy's reply comes like a benediction ah now you look like hubert all this while you were disguised i had forgotten murtha and everything in fact but prince arthur--when suddenly the reading stopped lifting the galvanometer lid murtha re- moved the disc of paper on which was scratched a wavering line a discussion of the result of the test see he said as he took several similar discs from a table drawer here are some pictures of sympathy you know i suppose that the body's resistance to electricity varies with its emotional state i couldn't let you know i was planning a test or you'd have been on your guard--but the light current i sent through you while i was reading made a chart which tells how responsive you are to appeals of this sort i stared at him uncertain whether to laugh or be irritated at his casual trespass on the emotional privacy of a stranger his guest this was science with a vengeance but he laid the last record be- side the others carefully noting my name and the date and went on placidly here is president archer's reaction to that same passage-- evidently i was not alone--and this is cardy's--and this is de grasse's notice the excitable latin tempera- ment in that sharp down-swing this one i got from the boy who cleans up my laboratory by the way come and let me show you the place i've fixed up to work in what could i say he was so simple so naive about it all i tried a question as i rose to follow him have you ever tested yourself murtha  what does that passage mean to you nothing more than material for an experiment no one could test himself that way--an emotion alters when you try to watch it i like the scene well enough it's a fine piece of writing perhaps i do seem pretty cold-blooded about it but that is because i've been over it so often and i know it all so well now here is my work table with water and gas and electrical connections and this is a small lathe-- and he was off on the subject of his work- room it was an admirable place--light clean well- equipped there were sinks and tables glass cabi- nets full of glittering instruments a hood with a fan for exhausting gases in one corner on a pedestal was a life-sized head and bust in wax-work --which i took to be one of those cheerful models anatomists and psychologists have to indicate the structure of the head brain and the muscular and nervous systems beside it an electrical transformer gave him a wide range of voltages dark shades and a battery of powerful lights with reflectors and color screens put the lighting in his control there was even an operating table rolled against the wall i was impressed and said so and he was very evi- dently pleased but as i left i wondered about a man who could traffic thus in his associates personal feelings with such scant apology and who could think that that terrible scene was merely fine writing i agreed with page in the department of history who said to me next day the man's too damned scientific for my tastes he told me life was simply another form of energy i've met men who said they were me- chanists but i never met one who acted the part as thoroughly as murtha i related my experience of the night before and page grinned that is just what archer said--and cardy--and several more he's impartial anyway he was he treated us all alike and all rather as if we were laboratory animals he sought me out and set himself to cultivate me with earnest thor- oughness but he had no idea of how to go about it i could not help realizing that he wanted me near him mainly for what i knew of the electrical science he required he had none of the tact or intuition which might have concealed his selfishness he hardly knew how to make his contacts agreeable as a human being i never touched him more about professor murtha the strange scientist i tried to having seats for a symphony con- cert i invited him to go with mrs harvey and myself but he excused himself--and when we came home we saw the lights burning late in his labora- tory i took him around to one of the wednesday evening bridge gatherings of the men of the faculty at the club but he pleaded ignorance of the game escaped early and never came again he even avoided the baseball games perhaps it was partly from shyness and a fear of human contacts partly from pride and an arrogant exclusiveness but chiefly i think from a genuine enthusiasm for his research i learned a little of his history while we worked together he had been sent to medical school by a wealthy uncle--had gained the love of scientific in- vestigation and had accomplished enough in his ordinary classes to gain his degree--had spent sev- eral miserable years as a general practitioner in the country paying as little attention as possible to his patients and heartily disliked by most of them-- and had suddenly come into wealth on the death of the uncle freedom and leisure he turned to ac- count and he was already a man of note when the talking brain  jedney introduced us that first evening he was two-sided--daring and aggressive in his work thorough and patient and precise but shy awkward inept in everyday matters only once did i detect evidence of real emotion when a speaker at the commencement exercises paid a tribute to science it was commonplace enough-- huxley said it all better years before but i hap- pened to glance at murtha and was amazed to see how his eyes were shining in the crowd moving out at the end we came together and he spoke to me almost breathlessly wasn't that great there's a man who sees truly harvey--he knows science is food and drink it is rest and work it is life itself to me you people who can work and stop-- he broke off flushed and moved away in silence i had not the heart to follow him and point out that the speaker was a politician a professional orator who knew neither science nor scientists--inexpensive and sentimental but murtha was sincere there are people who can love an abstraction that way--who can fling their own egotisms into a cause and forget themselves for it and i believed he was one of them he had his limitations even the memory of his tragic end has not wiped out the general enjoyment of his reply when someone asked him something about the lion of lucerne i know absolutely nothing about zoology he said in his laboratory however he was inspired as a great actor is before an audience my own work was in one of those stages of routine checking im- portant in all research but leaving the mind free and murtha's daring hypotheses attracted me i disliked him--but the problems he offered were fas- cinating experiments in vivisection--a selenium retina during the autumn we restored something very like sight to a blind rabbit a student named vinton had volunteered for experiment but we were uncertain how the voltages we used would affect the nervous system and it seemed best to try first with the rabbit i didn't enjoy the blinding of the poor little beast--it reminded me most un- pleasantly of little prince arthur in its patient helplessness--but murtha was briskly efficient and had no qualms with selenium as the basis of an artificial retina we were able to make the creature turn toward the light and even follow an electric torch about a darkened room later we planned to conduct tests with vinton who would be able to de- scribe his sensations sight investigations were therefore postponed and we took up hearing by means of a series of helmholz resonators we built artificial ears tuned to cover two octaves and had just finished them when fortune favored us a trepanning case at fairchild hospital gave murtha the chance to set his electrodes directly on an exposed human brain trans- mitting sound over his wires and past nature's or- dained channels direct to the center of consciousness to me it was uncanny--although it was nothing to what followed later perhaps his triumph in this case gave him his dreadful idea at any rate he flung himself into famous monument to louis xvi's swiss guards--ed the work more savagely than ever and hardly took time away for meals and sleep he had but one advanced class that year and no elementary work so that almost the whole day and night belonged to the work he loved also such had been our prog- ress that he could go on with only occasional assist- ance from me this was fortunate for a short time before i had been appointed to accompany the frazier polar ex- pedition on the air-flight to the north the following april we wanted to check vegard's and mclen- nan's studies of the aurora and to pick up whatever else we might see of interest in the region of the pole i made preparations to turn over my crystal research to dr marling who also took my classes and my administrative duties it was necessary for me to do a good deal of extra reading and some consultation with the people in the department of astronomy and to correspond with other physicists to be ready but i found time to be present when murtha went over the contemplated experiment with vinton a brilliant student afflicted with blindness--murtha experiments with his eyes vinton was blind--but he was a brilliant young- ster and led most of his classes in spite of his handicap to watch him swing along the street you might think he could see as well as anyone there was a curious mottled scar across his face without which he would have been handsome for there was none of the vacancy in his expression that generally marks the blind man he looked clean and young and decent and he was--the sort that makes me enjoy being a teacher against the dark curtain he used to see pictures-- for there were two books of verse to his credit and he was paying his way through school by writing pirate stories if he had been different there might have been something pitiful in the idea of a blind boy's writing of adventure but he never asked sym- pathy he wanted desperately to see however for as soon as the rumor of our work reached him he came and offered to help he would run any risk or endure any hardship when i was convinced there was very little of either involved i took him around to murtha be- fore we went ahead murtha asked him how did your lose your sight and he replied when i was nine a chum of mine and i rigged a telegraph line between our homes and studied morse one day i pulled a wet battery down on my face that is why i'm scarred in this way murtha was satisfied-- i wanted to make sure that the optic nerves were sound for i can't get farther in he explained and we put the boy on the operating table murtha made his incisions connected his electrodes and swung in the current for a time nothing happened and then the most beautiful look came upon his face and he said very softly i can see a yellow light murtha pulled the window blinds and brought his electric torch into action he flashed it on the selenium shut it off flashed it on darkened it again--and each time vinton reported the waxing and waning of the radi- ance color screens were tried but all except the blue screen dimmed the image or illumination or  amazing stories whatever it was that went to him through the selen- ium and the wires in time perhaps murtha would enable the blind to see again the boy agreed to give him as much time as he wanted and we came away together we walked in silence most of the way to his room--he was very evidently stirred--but as he left me he said in a tone of reverence he's wonderful isn't he yes i replied i hope he can do this thing he's started won't you come in and meet mother he asked ever since ray accident she's been eyes for me she's very much interested in all this work thank you i can't this morning i said i'd like to later though i wish i might be here to see it all through but you know about the expedition we parted--but it was certain murtha had at least one worshipper well--who can blame the boy he had no idea of the hollowness behind that remarkable mind and the reaction to a promise of sight is a thing which we who see as a matter of course can hardly understand at any rate there seemed no harm in it at worst he would only lose a few illusions an expedition to the arctic and the return as the months went by and the time came nearer for sailing i had to withdraw more and more from murtha's investigations i knew however that he was going far to duplicate the whole efferent nervous system--the senses taste he readily matched nerves of heat and cold he constructed but the other touch-sensations eluded him--as did the colors blue red and green and of course the most difficult of all would be the complex sense of smell before undertaking that he tried to develop an ef- ferent nerve--or at least one relay of the pathway by which orders go from the brain to the muscles i did not learn how he would know when he had been successful in this last in the excitement of departure i all but forgot him and afterward he seldom troubled my memory the journey was such a novel interruption of my quiet life--the voyage to norway the airplane flight our forced landing the struggle over the ice by sledge the coming of winter that forced us to camp on northeast land the polar darkness the desola- tion few chances for observation but endless hours of playing cards snow--wind--the returning sun-- the grinding ice that piled up on our barren rock threatening to sweep us into the sea food running low--the coming of the ship--that glorious first sight of green trees and the easy journey home with somewhat of scientific value but without the glory or satisfaction of having been anywhere near the pole there was the usual newspaper excite- ment and we learned that we had been a source of anxiety to the whole civilized world ever since our start frazier's classic reply that we had also been something of a source of anxiety to ourselves struck the desired note and the public had a very good time with us a shocking change in murtha i was rather surprised to find murtha at the pier when we steamed in and still more surprised at the shocking change in the man he was gaunt and pale and looked at least ten years older in place of his former alternations of shyness and disciplined composure was a manner of slinking furtiveness he greeted me without heartiness but with urgent haste he seemed to want to get me away from my newly-met family for some mysterious private talk perhaps i was rather brusque in pointing out that my own preferences were against him but cer- tainly that was before i dreamed of the things he had to say i went home how good it was to relax into the old familiar ways and places--to see the people i had known to enjoy warmth and cleanliness and safety and leisure once again to find my friends and my books where they had always been to see the soft green of the campus and hear the voices of students in song through the quiet of the evening but twice i was asked have you seen murtha and one man handed me a newspaper clipping which told of vinton's death under rather unusual circum- stances all this was of course before the recent newspaper furor these two inquiries coupled with murtha's curious actions at the pier disturbed me and accordingly early in the evening i walked over to his room he was away i left a card with what was meant for a cheery message scribbled on it i had hardly reached home when his voice came to me strained and tense over the telephone couldn't you come back harvey for god's sake come if you can--i can't come to you and it is very important i'll be right there i said briefly it is queer now to remember the mood in which i set out his looks and manner had been ominous-- but i was so steeped in the peace and happiness of my homecoming that other people's affairs seemed of small account i was sorry for young vinton a splendid youngster cut off without his chance but he was gone beyond recall--and the wind was sweet murtha was a solemn self-centered individual seem- ingly in some distress--but i was glad of the young moon peering through the elms if i seem unduly hard-hearted i can only suggest that my critic spend seven months of exile on an arctic rock before passing final judgment murtha opened the door for me and led me to his fireplace without a word it was mild autumn but again a fire burned in the grate he stooped and warmed his hands and looking away from me at the fire he began to speak the words of his prepared speech tumbled over one another and got out of order in his eagerness to get them said a dreadful revelation harvey i--i want to talk to you about vinton he is dead as you've probably heard --or at least people think he is as a matter of fact he's in the laboratory he wanted me to do thej thing i've done--he urged me to--but i'm not sure-- that is--vinton--oh harvey i've killed him--or rather i've kept him alive--he'll be alive forever he broke off short and gasped like a swimmer com- ing up from deep water i don't know what i'm saying he sank back into the chair and covered his face with his hands what do you mean murtha tell me just what happened he looked over at me caught my eye and glanced hastilv back at the fire the astonishing confession the talking brain  was meaningless to me chiefly i think i was amazed at the evidence that there was really a human being capable of feeling inside that shell of mind and matter and handsome clothes which we had all called by his name he was a new man-- able to suffer but he began now to speak--and his story was beyond belief some months after i sailed vinton had been the victim of a motor accident going home late one night through the familiar streets night was like day to him--but alas not to the driver of the car that crushed him he could speak when they picked him up and he begged to be taken to murtha's room murtha he knew was a physician and he did not want his mother alarmed unnecessarily he had no idea how badly he was hurt but a moment's examination told murtha he could do very little he stopped the hemorrhages and tried with local anaesthetics to make the poor broken body temporarily comfortable --but there was no cure ever again for vinton life--yes but helplessness and probable pain as long as he might live pain that would stand between him and his fancies pain that in time would wear down his courage and break his self-control he told it all to the boy with his blunt unfeeling tact- lessness i cannot believe he deliberately made the picture dark details of the awful experiment but while he was speaking the temptation came-- the idea he had cherished as a wild impossible fancy how he presented it i do not know he could be very subtle when he chose perhaps he promised vinton immortality in this world--freedom from the body's limitations time without end for learning and thought and the creative activity the boy loved perhaps he only suggested the possibil- ity of escape from pain and a share in a daring ven- ture but i can imagine how it was--the confident self-assured man speaking as one with authority to the discouraged tortured youth who was trying to make up his mind to face a future of helpless idle- ness he who was to have been the support of that mother who was eyes to her son--who by the magic of his fancy was to have kept them in comfort-- must be a burden to her as long as he lasted alive at this point murtha threw his wealth into the scales he would make her an allowance to keep her comfortable--he would represent it as insurance and furthermore make her his heir remember he was the hero who was slowly giving him back his sight vinton knew the things murtha had accom- plished he knew of the work of loeb and carrel if a heart could be kept beating in a bottle for years at a time why should not a brain be kept thinking in a bottle forever there seemed nothing impos- sible in the plan how could he communicate that was simple--for he knew his morse and murtha had solved the problem of efferent impulses he must trust the man to carry out his promise about the money but if he did not there was the certainty of poverty for the woman struggling to support her invalid son insurance policies contain suicide clauses i was well aware--men had been known to kill themselves to get money for someone as dear as this mother was to her boy i was not surprised to hear that he had said yes murtha was his own anaesthetist he wheeled the operating table under the lights brought the head from his wax figure with its brain-shaped cavity ready and waiting and set it beside the table coolly mixed and spread the cleansing nourish- ing liquids in the wax interior made his tempera- ture coils and capillary tubes ready completed his electrical connections and applied the ether-cone the skull was fractured and he cut along the frac- ture he severed the spinal cord with infinite skill working feverishly probably in his excitement he forgot what manner of thing he was doing but before the night was gone he had moved--vinton-- from the kind familiar habitation of flesh and blood to that still dead body of wax and steel which was never meant to hold a fragile living spirit when he had finished he collapsed he slept out the night in the very chair where i was sitting his dreams were ghastly but in the morning he took himself strongly in hand and forced himself through the routine duties of a physician reporting a death his certificate was accepted without ques- tion then because of his connection with the uni- versity although he was not yet known locally as a medical man but as a teacher then he telephoned the mother and broke the news calling on her imme- diately after as her son's friend and physician he told his lie about the insurance and faithfully car- ried out the promised deception he left her with a check and a promise of more to come and it is probable that she never noticed that it was a per- sonal check on a local bank going back to his rooms he wrote out a clear short simple will in her favor had it witnessed locked it away and faced the placid waxen features of his apparatus dreadful messages from the transplanted brain of a dead man he took the speaking tube in hand and in a trembling voice--for by now he was feeling strangely about it all--he spoke some words in- stantly the telegraph key began to chatter--weak wobbly uncertain morse but clear enough to be unmistakable vinton was there alive he could not tell what it meant he did not know the code he took down the dots and dashes with infinite care for a long time and closing the key rushed out to buy a code-book the rest of the day he spent working out the message and such things as it contained cursesprayers pleading long stretches of incoherent letter-groups quotations from the boy's verse and evidence of frequent delirium it was dreadful--i am using murtha's word his horror grew and often he sprang up from the table only to return and plunge again into the work very soon he had memorized the dots and dashes and could read whole sentences --always bitter and terrible sentences in time he could endure no more and stole away to walk wild- eyed through the streets fighting for sanity and composure but always drawn by a fascination irresistible he returned to his rooms he opened the door again and the awful metallic voice seemed to condemn him in the rattling lan- guage which he could not yet translate by ear this time he took it gradually a few sentences at a time continued on page  high tension by  albert b stuart md as carter straightened to his feet and tossed the crumpled dollar on the table his arm struck the reading lamp and turned it over the globe caught in the trailing wire of his apparatus and burst there was a flash of bluish flame and carter sank limply to the floor  high tension  a wonderful surgeon--as irritable as able what is the matter madge the grave- featured head nurse stopped in front of the weeping girl as she asked the ques- tion i just can't stand that dr carter the girl gasped here i've been working for him in the operating room the last six months and he abuses me worse than if i were an apprentice i didn't do anything wrong but i couldn't work fast enough to suit him it was hurry up nurse--liga- tureneedle-holderwhy the deuce do you have to finger over everything before you can find what i want if i had had four hands instead of two i couldn't have worked fast enough to suit him he raved at his assistant all through the operation and no one could do anything fast enough to please him yes i know my dear the head nurse comforted dr carter is a very hard man to work for but you must remember that he is a wonderful surgeon and works under great nervous tension he may be the girl sobbed but he might act like a human being as the rest of the doctors do anyway my dear you must remember that dr carter is different from other doctors really he is uncanny in his ability he does things no other surgeon would even think of attempting and his knowledge of brain surgery is remarkable dr bryan was telling me just now that dr carter is the greatest living authority on brain-centers and their action that may be true replied the nurse but he isn't human there are times when i think he isn't just right his face is so flushed and red when he works and he looks like a man with a burning fever his eyes are so bright and piercing and he always wears that head lamp when he works he never leaves it off for a minute and heaven save anyone who touches it yes my dear the head nurse soothed he is a queer man but we have our duty to perform you must try to do your best even if it is hard and disagreeable at times with this copy-book comfort the head nurse continued on her morning round of inspection leav- ing the still weeping and irate nurse to compose herself as best she could dr reginald carter and his life described dr reginald carter was a queer man he came from the east unheralded and unknown and in the brief space of a few years had risen to the position of chief surgeon of the hospital and a commanding position in the medical profession about his antecedents nothing was known and being of a very reticent disposition he made few acquaintances except among medical associates no one could claim the position of friend with him the author of this narration is a medical doctor and his knowledge of medicine shown in what he tells us deserves respect he gives us quite an unusual story and not at all impossible if we take adequate consideration of our present meagre knowledge of high frequency electric currents that electrical currents could be responsible for a man's undreamt-of physical strength has perhaps not been exploited in science and it deserves more than pass- ing interest on the part of our research laboratories it is well known that a strong electrical current will affect our muscular actions to a tremendous extent so much so that when we grasp a highly-charged handle of an induction coil we find it impossible to let go of it these are facts not fiction we are quite certain that you will like this most amazing and unusual story lean and wiry of figure with dark eyes and rather swarthy complexion his personality was that of the student and dreamer--such a one as nature seemed to have designed to tread the pathways of life alone the little that could be learned of his past was very unsatisfying to the curious he had served in the army and was stationed in a large hospital in paris this much was known from the reports of soldiers that were patients in the hospital his reputation for surgical ability was known there and his work was the wonder of the hospital he made no friends even there and a soldier-patient was to him merely a problem which had to be dropped as soon as convalescence was established on his location in the city the american legion asked him to join their body which he did but he never even attended a meeting no lodge could claim him as a member he lived in an apartment in the upper part of the city--alone--except for a single man-servant like his master the servant was a taciturn reticent type with the single exception of dr james bryan dr carter's relations with the staff of the hospital was strictly formal he would occasionally unbend enough with dr bryan to briefly discuss an un- usual or interesting case such an attitude and such a personality would indubitably have spelled failure for anyone else but his weird and supernormal skill in diagnosis and his uncanny ability as a surgeon kept him supplied with work brain cases that seemed hope- less were referred to him time and again he had achieved the seemingly impossible and had restored unfortunates to life and well-being their words of gratitude left him untouched and his anger with and answer to one of the nouveaux-riches who tried to patronizingly offer him an excessive fee was the talk of the hospital for days my dear sir the doc- tor said you were a very interesting case you are well now and therefore of no further interest our relations were of a purely business nature and call for no payment beyond the bill i have rendered you gasping like a fish the patient hastily paid his bill and without further attempts left the hos- pital dr carter's gruffness seemed uncalled for dr carter's head-lamp to the nurses and internes of the hospital dr carter was a never-ending source of conversa- tion tinged with respect and fear as it was to work with him in the operating room was a task that daunted the stoutest-hearted nurse or interne dr carter demanded more of them than any other sur- geon of the hospital he himself worked with light- ning-like speed his deft hands moved with the skill and grace of the practiced musician and with no  amazing stories more lost motion or hesitancy than a well-oiled ma- chine no assistant however capable could keep up with his demands let alone anticipate his wishes and the doctor's biting and sarcastic words made the careless or laggard assistant and nurse wish they were somewhere else one thing peculiarly noticeable about the doctor was the head lamp that he always wore while work- ing a head lamp is needed to illuminate the deeper recesses of an operative wound but it is scarcely necessary to wear in the operating room all the time this head lamp was of a distinctive pattern and current was supplied to it by a small battery that the doctor carried in his hip pocket as soon as dr carter arrived at the hospital in the morning he went to the dressing-room and donned a gown and affixed the head lamp then he was ready to see whatever patients were referred to him with his brilliant shining eyes and his nervous intense manner he was a unique figure and caused a great deal of comment among his associates there was a suspicion that dr carter used drugs but the cleanliness and poise of the man's life forbade such a belief his nearest--one might say his only acquaintance --was dr james bryan to bryan the surgeon would occasionally unbend and there were times when his conversation even approached cordiality bryan on one or two occasions had tried to make some friendly advances once he asked dr carter to lunch with him carter's refusal was courteous but final and bryan did not try again the chief of detectives has an interview with dr bryan the loud insistent ringing of dr bryan's tele- phone awoke him early one morning it was the chief of detectives calling dr bryan had at times helped out the police department and his keen perception and active brain had more than once put them on the right track in some mysterious case the chief of detectives often said that bryan had missed his calling and should have been a detec- tive instead of a surgeon during the war bryan had in fact served in the intelligence department of the army and had re- ceived the warm commendations of his superiors for his capable work when bryan walked into the chief's office he was met by a worried and distraught officer doctor i am sure glad you came we are in a mess and you are probably the only man who can help us out flattering replied bryan you folks give me credit for capabilities i don't possess do you suppose doctor that we called you here just to pass the time of day we know all about your capabilities and we surely need your help well tell me your troubles the doctor grinned and i'll see what i can do it is more serious than you think the detective gravely replied this is a case of murder and a peculiarly baffling one too ah a murder the doctor replied what are the features that make this case so baffling he was all interest now as with glowing eyes and intent expression he questioned the chief well to begin with doctor we can only find one mark of violence on his body the coroner has ex- amined the body carefully and can give no cause of death don't you think it would be well if you came to look the body over surely surely the doctor replied will you ride in my car chief they hastened out to the waiting car and rapidly drove to the morgue who is the man bryan asked after they were ushered into the room and stood beside the murdered victim the chief referred to his notebook we have the name as ivan kronsky this name was found on letters in his pockets and the initials i k are marked on his linen we were called last night by the janitor of the earling apartments where he roomed kronsky had told the janitor to call him at six o'clock because he had to catch a train the janitor receiving no answer when he rang thought that he had not been awakened by the phone and went up to his room the door was ajar and he entered he found the body sprawled on the floor of the bed room he called the police at once i went up to the earling to look things over the chief continued i tell you doctor there was no clue or trace of the murderer in that room the only mark we can find is this bruise on the wrist the detective pointed to a ringlike bruise encir- cling the dead man's wrist ah said the doctor as he examined the arm both bones broken by direct violence now how could a man come by a circular bruise like that it looks as if his wrist had been squeezed in a vise queervery queer let's turn the body over and look at his back on turning the body over the head fell back in a strange manner that at once attracted the doctor's attention see here chief he exclaimed excited- ly as he pointed out a dark bruised area the size of a half dollar at the hair-line on the back of the neck the neck is broken see how it rolls around when i move the head what on earth could break a man's neck and not leave any mark bigger than that doctor that's the puzzle chief it looks as if some giant had pressed his thumb down there but what kind of a being could have sufficient strength to break the neck of a burly man with the pressure of a thumb the doctor turned the body back on the table and asked to see what had been found in the man's clothing a little heap of articles were turned over to him they were the usual things found in men's pockets a roll of bills a knife and a few keys made up the collection i found this on the floor the detective inter- jected handing the doctor a small flat-headed screw looks as though it might be out of a watch yes said the doctor absent-mindedly then with sudden interest where did you say you found it on the floor near the body can you attach any significance to that i don't know the doctor mused let me keep it it may help us he carefully placed the high tension  screw in an envelope and put it into his pocket let's go up to the apartment chief and see what we can find the scene of a murder short drive brought them to the earling-- one of those modern monstrosities the homes of so many of our city dwellers they were ac- companied to the apartment by a scared janitor of irish persuasion who however fearless they are of the living have a wholesome respect for the dead shore mr kronsky was a foine man tis many the tip he gave the byes when did you find him casey the chief asked just a little after six chief you say the door was wide open shore twas i was surproised to foind it thot way as kronsky was always careful to kape it locked dr bryan who had been carefully examining the lock looked up with sudden questioning eyes see chief this is a spring lock it works only from the inside this door was opened from the inside and left open the doctor without awaiting the chief's reply hurried into the room and opened the window the room was on the fourth floor of the apartment and a bare expanse of wall devoid of pipes or fire escape greeted the doctor's eyes the fire escape is at the end of the hall the chief answered the doctor's unspoken question see here doctor no one could climb that wall i've seen human flies but i never saw one that could climb a sheer wall like that don't be too sure chief there are ledges where a man if he had nerve enough could get a grip anyway the person or thing that could break a man's neck with his thumb might be active enough to climb the side of this wall he turned from the window and started a careful search of the room look as he might it bore out the chief's contention it was barren of the slight- est trace of evidence the man had simply died at the hands of some assailant who had come and gone as silently and mysteriously as the evening shadows chief we are up against a tough one accord- ing to the story books the criminal always leaves some clue always forgets something or slips up in some way that lets the astute investigator find his trail you and i know that this idea is pure bunk if it were not then why so many unsolved crimes i'm afraid you're right doctor sighed the chief the newspapers will give me the merry razz on this case never mind chief we all have our left-handed friends i'll think this thing over and see if there isn't some way smoke up chief he said handing the detective a fat cigar this may make things look brighter the flat-headed screw dr bryan was busy at his professional work for the rest of the day and did not have time to give any thought to the murder but in his room that evening he settled down for a period of intense concentration and study of the meager de- tails that he possessed he laid the little screw out on the table and studied it from every angle it was a peculiar screw short and flat-headed and re- sembled one of the screws from a watch as the chief had suggested in the meantime the chief had put in a busy day tracing the history of the murdered man this was as barren of results as was the search of the apartment the man was unknown outside of the apartment in which he lived and the bank where he had his account he seemed plentifully supplied with money on deposit and his safety deposit box disclosed a large investment in liberty bonds and a considerable collection of unset diamonds days passed into weeks and still the mystery re- mained unsolved to the chief the doctor briefly explained when i examine a sick man i must find a few symptoms or signs before i can make a diagnosis a murder case is the same unless we have something to work on we are helpless i think this case will be solved by chance and chance only chance indeed at last gave him a clue but his wildest stretch of imagination could not have shown him the strange denounement it was to bring forth dr bryan was unusually busy at the hospital for some weeks and had come in contact with dr car- ter more frequently than in the past a series of brain injuries brought them together on many occa- sions to bryan it seemed that carter was slightly more affable--though he still held himself aloof the two associates were standing in a corridor and discussing a recent case when they were startled by the screams of a nurse she came running down the hall wringing her handsthen at the sight of them she cried out oh come quick please a man got stuck in the elevator oh hurry please she sobbed hurrying down the hall they were met by an appalling sight the janitor of the hospital had brought the freight elevator to the second floor and left the door open while he unloaded some articles familiarity with the elevator had developed danger- ous habits he always reached in to the starting lever turned on the power and then stepped inside the car nothing ever happened this time how- ever his foot slipped as he stepped through the door and he fell on his face across the sill the heavy elevator came down with resistless power and pinned him to the floor the look of agony on the man's face was enough to appal even the doctors inured to sights of suf- fering as they were my god carter how can we get him out bryan cried someone run downstairs and shut off the power just a moment doctor dr carter stepped up and grasped the edge of the elevator top in his hands just get the man's shoulders and pull him out as i lift wondering at the apparent insanity of the request bryan mechanically obeyed with a heave of his slender shoulders dr carter lifted the elevator and bryan drew the body of the dying man out on the floor stunned at the tremendous feat of strength bryan could only stand there breathless then the arrival of an orderly with a cart distracted his at- tention and the care of the injured man drove all thoughts of it from his mind for the time being  amazing stories a strange interview between dr bryan and dr carter it was only in the quiet of his room that he had time to think over the surprising incident of the day carter had left the hospital without comment there had been no opportunity to talk with him and ask an explanation of the mystery mystery it washis whole life was a mystery bryan was being fully supplied with mysteries of late a sud- den thought struck himif he can lift an eleva- tor he can do other things then with a flash of recollectionthat screw is part of a head lamp he remembered now that carter had been wearing it at the time he called for his car and rapidly drove to dr carter's apartment his plan of action was not exactly clear in his mind how could he confront carter with such a meager bit of evidence as a little flat-headed screw the man would think him insane or drunk with his mind still in a state of confusion he arrived at carter's rooms he was ushered in by the taciturn man-servant dr carter looked up at him in surprise to what am i indebted for this call doctor he asked looking him squarely in the eye bryan advanced to the table and threw down the screw i just called to give you this screw out of that pet lamp of yours he replied for a fleeting moment a look of surprise not un- mixed with fear flashed in dr carter's eyes it was gone in an instant however and he smiled surely my dear fellow you haven't come out at this time of night to deliver such a paltry object as this not so paltry carter as you think this screw was found in the earling apartment under peculiar circumstances the smiling suave look disappeared from carter's face and it took on instead a grim and stern expres- sion of understanding tinged with menace oh yes i remember now you do a little dab- bling in detective science don't you well what of it my dear fellow use your judgment do you think you could go before any jury in this land of the free and convict me with one little screw as your evidence men have been convicted on less bryan an- swered coldly yes in the story books but not in courts of law go ahead my dear sir and do your little best do you think i have failed to make preparations for eventualities a direct accusation of murder carter was right and bryan knew it he knew enough of the law to realize that it would be absolutely foolish to attempt to lay a charge against carter and have the slightest hope of even getting it a respectable hearing before a grand jury in the present state of the case it would be impos- sible even to show a motive for the crime let alone to produce a scrap of evidence that would connect the slenderly built carter with the iron-muscled being who had broken a burly man with no other weapon than his hands carter silently sat watching the changing expres- sions of the other's face evidently reading accurately the thoughts that passed through bryan's mind don't you think doctor bryan that it would be better if i were to be allowed to make some sort of an explanation surely one has a right to give his reasons yes if one can give a reason for murder bryan retorted you use rather harsh terms doctor do you not please wait until you know the facts carter re- plied doctor while you were in the intelligence department service in france did you ever by any chance hear of serge ivanoff  ivanoff bryan started to his feet you mean to say that that man was serge ivanoff that devil of the russian revolution no other carter replied now you under- stand why i objected to the harsh term of murder that you applied no one could murder that man justifiable homicide is the only term that could be applied to his taking-off how did you happen to run across his trail i had no personal experience with the man bryan replied but one of my lieutenants entered russia and fell into his hands i had always liked the boy and the thought of his murder for that was what it was has always grieved me my experience was of a decidedly personal na- ture carter grimaced see here bryani can't bear to go into complete details as to the past some things are too painful to speak of even after the lapse of years it may help you to understand when i tell you that my family was of the old no- bility of russia we tried to escape the country but were apprehended you wonder why i have not made friends i tell you bryan it was the man whom i considered my closest friend who betrayed us my old father my sister a spasm of pain distorted his clear cut features see here bryan i can't go on i can only say that that devil was the cause of it all i was thrown in a filthy cell every day he used to call and manhandle me he wanted me to tell where our family jewels were hidden i refused to tell for i knew that it would mean my death as soon as he knew i won't trouble you with details but i escaped that escape is a horrible memory to me i dream of it in the night sometimes and wake wringing with perspiration i came to this country to repair my shattered health and plan for vengeance friends of mine informed me that ivanoff had been proscribed by the soviet government he was even too gross for them imagine my feelings when i was informed by secret agencies that he was in this very city i made my preparations and entered his apartment when i stepped into the room and stood before him he laughed at me ah my little doctor he cried you have come for another beating i see this one shall be the last for this country's laws allow one to kill a burglar can i ever forget the look on his face when i gripped his wrist with my fingers and broke the bones for once in his wicked life he had fallen into the hands of one stronger immeas- urably stronger than he devil as he was i could not find it in my heart to torture him i broke his neck with my hands and then quietly walked out of the room and down the stairs no one saw me and i came to my room with a feeling of duty well high tension  done you can call this murder if you like but i can not feel that it is your explanation is very clear bryan replied there is just one thing i cannot understand how could you who are not at all muscular or strong do as you have said explanation from dr carter--why he wore the head-light that requires an explanation said carter that will be rather hard to believe in fact if it weren't for that episode at the hospital i think you would put me down for the most monumental liar living i don't think anyone could blame you either i must go back to my earlier student days to give you a fair idea i was not always a student of medicine in fact i started out to be an electrical engineer but changed to medicine at the request of my father electricity has always been a fascinating study to me it has so many and varied manifestations in the ultimate i feel that we are going to find that the controlling principle of the universe is some form of electrical manifestation your great sur- geon crile has practically demonstrated that the body cell is in the final analysis an electrical ele- ment i have been especially interested in high fre- quency currents their effects are so totally unlike the currents of lower voltage and lesser frequency you know how we make use of them in electrical treat- ments well i experimented along this line and finally i was able to produce a current with a fre- quency rate far beyond any known also its effects were totally unlike any therapeutic current that is used i found that i was able to focus the effect of this current on a definite area in the tissues the apparatus was small and noiseless and could easily be carried in one's pocket it was only by chance that i discovered some of its properties during the war i was injured in the back of the head by a shell fragment the surgeon removed part of the fractured bone and left a small area of bony defect which did not heal over this scar at times caused me pain and it was in trying to relieve this pain that i made a startling discovery you know doc- tor that the human brain and body have capacities far in excess of what we daily use physiologists have determined that muscle tissue has capacities enormously in excess of what a man's nerve force is able to utilize for instance why is it that a baboon who weighs less than a man has over eight times the strength of a strong man his muscles are of no better substance than the man's the baboon is able to make them work to better advan- tage that is all well i found that when this high frequency current of mine was concentrated on a certain area of my brain i not only had a greatly increased men- tal capacity but i could also make use of the in- herent power in my muscles there were draw- backs however that i was unable to overcome i found that the heating effect which raised my body- temperature to around one hundred degrees fahren- heit also caused a mental irritation which you have noticed and which has made me heartily disliked by all who came in contact with me i couldn't help it it was impossible not to be impatient at the apparent slowness of their mentalities again it was a serious problem to get sufficient nutrition into my body to make up for the tremend- ous tissue waste that ensued from driving the engine at excessive speed i could never eat enough nor could my digestive organs handle what i did eat it was only by injecting nutriment solutions in- travenously that i was able to hold even at that i have come to the end the human body seems made to undergo a slow evolution and i have stepped centuries ahead of my time i am going away to try to rebuild my shattered health needless to say my invention goes with me i climbed the side of that building as easily as a baboon could because i was stronger than any baboon shall i give you a final demonstration the end of dr carter too dazed to reply bryan only stared at carter while he produced from a drawer the head lamp that he was in the habit of wearing he opened the small case which he carried in his pocket and showed a peculiar coil made of wire of hair-like fineness attached to this was apparently a minute condenser of innumerable plates i can't go into a technical explanation he said as he adjusted the lamp to his head the light is merely a blind and derives its current from a small battery of the usual flashlight type now he said as he adjusted the lamp do you want a demonstration ask me to give you the cube root of some number of six figures or read me a page from that book i will repeat it word for word or would a feat of strength be better he reached into his pocket drew out a silver dollar and with a twist of his fingers bent it double as carter straightened to his feet and tossed the crumpled dollar upon the table his arm struck the reading-lamp and knocked it over the globe caught in the trailing wire of his apparatus and burst there was a flash of bluish flame and carter sank limply to the floor springing to his feet bryan rushed to his side but the deadly current had done its work in some unexplainable way it was car- ried deep into the brain and death was instan- taneous when bryan later examined the coil and con- denser he found them burned beyond any hope of discovering their construction the coroner's verdict was death from accidental electrocution bryan still keeps the mutilated dollar and occasionally looks at it to assure himself that he is still sane and the chief of detectives is still looking for the murderer the end station x by  g mcleod winsor lieut hughes glanced up from his book at the sound of rapid footsteaps and saw the hurrying figure enter the signal room and cross toward the signaler's chair macrae was removing the head-piece as the professor paused macrae rose from his chair come here he said speaking in a ringing level tone of assured command macrae did not move he looked up their eyes met  what went before alan macrae simple uneducated yet a skilful radio operator endowed with an un- usually keen sense of hearing is sent as operator to a secret radio station operated by the british government known as station x some- where off on an island in the pacific he is chosen for the post because of his ability as a radio expert and his fine hearing he accepts the offer because the extra pay involved brings him that much nearer to the day when he and may treherne the heroine can be married he takes leave of his sweetheart with peculiar forebodings of impending intangible dangers fears which seem to have no foundation or reason he soon learns while still en route to the island that his partner-to-be for several months is not going to be much of a companion for him lieut wilson is very well educated and is very in- tolerant of macrae's educational shortcomings ling the chinese cook and caretaker completes the party to remain on the island and incidently also serves as the butt for lieut wilson's ill-temper before long both men--lieut wilson and the chinaman--are found lying dead apparently mur- dered by each other and it is probably because of his nervous condition caused by this mysterious murder that macrae falls under the influence of an inhabitant of venus who is known in this story as a venerian and whose voice comes to him over the radio telling him all kinds of interesting things about the inhabitants of venus giving him a great deal of scientific information etc although macrae understands nothing of the greatest part of it because london has received no answer from sta- tion x for three days the sagitta with a crew of investigators and relief is despatched to the island and arrives to find macrae lying on the floor appar- ently dead still wearing the ear-set the chair ori which macrae sat seems to have been thrown over and not another living soul is to be seen the doctor thinking that macrae may be suffering from catalepsy rather than that he is dead takes him back to london on the sagitta macrae re- covers on the boat and tells a weird tale which how- ever coincides perfectly until his shorthand notes of both his report and of the mysterious messages and with his diary when they arrive in london the government starts an investigation station x by  g mcleod winsor part ii chapter vii the voice from mars if the question had been asked who is the most eminent scientists of the day nine out of ten would have answered stanley rudge his distinguishing char- acteristic was his open-minded- ness if for example he had been a church dignitary his tolerance would have become a scandal the same qual- ity in him that would have caused him to make ribbons of the rubrics caused him to encounter an occasional sidelong look even in the halls of science it was disgusting to some of his confreres that a man whose scientific attainments and labors could not be gainsaid whose position was unchallengeable should dabble with the to them unclean thing should dare to assert the possibility of the existence of what could not be put under the microscope the value of his scientific admitted be- the story is now reaching an interesting point bring- ing in the tale of planetary inter-communication of the rivalry between the planets of hypnotism across millions of miles of space directly and indirectly all told with vraisemblance the rivalry of the powers for good and for evil the help given by the gentle inhabitants of venus the asperities of the martian inhabitants are all told of so that we almost believe the words of the author whose imagination follows such scientific lines and makes us feel that a climax perhaps fraught with disaster is approach- ing cause it was undeniable his leaning towards spirit- ualism was looked upon as a strange weakness in an otherwise fine intellect the extra narrow-minded believed that there must be a bee in his bonnet somewhere the professor was by no means thin-skinned but there are few who do not chafe however slight- ly under ridicule he was well aware that this had been the attitude with which his psychological investigations had been regarded and that the re- sults which he believed himself to have verified were met with undisguis- ed incredulity he knew also that his treatise on the habitability of mars had met with a cold recep- tion his own opinion on the universality of life that it would be found could the fact be ascertained to exist wherever the conditions necessary to organic chemistry rendered its presence possible he kept to himself that such conditions existed on mars and probably other planets he considered to be perfectly established in this view he did not stand alone but many hesitated   amazing stories professor rudge appears to be a great authority it will not be difficult to believe in the circum- stances of such division of opinion in the scien- tific world that when the case of macrae was brought to professor rudge's notice he took it up with enthusiasm the more he pondered over mac- rae's story the more interested he became he was convinced by his examination of macrae that there was no intentional deception and the peculiar con- ditions existing seemed absolutely to exclude any explanations other than the one advanced of this he was so convinced that he resolved at once to pur- sue the investigations on the spot in spite of its remoteness i am going to visit station x he said and i am going to take you with me macrae's reply surprised him no sir anything else that i can do to oblige you i will do but i will never never set foot on that island again what nonsense why man i cannot imagine a being on earth not grasping with avidity at such a chance to make himself forever celebrated you have already convinced me of the truth of your ac- count but i assure you others will not be so readily persuaded i cannot help it sir said macrae with quiet de- termination and i am very sorry indeed to dis- oblige you but you can and shall help it said the pro- fessor you must understand that because pend- ing investigation i accept your story that does not prove it it merely induces me to take you with me to the spot and devote the time necessary for its confirmation i regret sir very much that-- now macrae interrupted professor rudge on this point i will take no refusal you are at once to put any fanciful objections you may have on one side i shall procure an order from the admiralty and that will settle it i would rather resign my appointment than go there said macrae doggedly i beg of you sir to excuse me ask anything else of me but i can- not go back to that station i intend to reward you liberally for your time and services while we are away on a much higher scale than the pay you receive from the admir- alty thank you sir but-- rudge endeavors to induce the operator to go with him to station x when you think of miss treherne of whom you profess to be fond are you justified in refusing she is waiting un- til you are in a position to marry her and here are the very means you require and you refuse them professor rudge regarded macrae as an obstacle in his path of investigation it was a shrewd question macrae was silent he shuffled his feet and looked much disturbed the professor thinking his victory nearly won added surely also there is not a man in the world who will not envy you your fame think too of this young lady's pride and pleasure and of the im- measurable use you will be to all your species a use it would have been criminal to neglect by a persistence in your refusal what is any recom- pense that i can give you compared to the rewards the world will shower on you macrae looked as if he were being torn between two impulses his face was a picture of contending emotions at length he found his voice saying in a scarcely audible tone i am very sorry but i cannot return to station x it was the professor's turn to be silent he was astounded he looked at macrae with a glance that said plainly have i after all misread your char- acter yet in the face of the young fellow before him there was no trace of obstinacy its expres- sion was rather one of unrelieved distress such as one might feel on being asked the impossible by a friend whom he particularly wished to oblige making an elfort to conceal his annoyance pro- fessor rudge at last said of course you have had a terrible experience there and it is quite possible that you have not yet quite got over the shock of it i will not detain you longer at present return to plymouth and you will hear from me again soon continued indecision macrae took his leave and made his way to paddington in a state as depressed as well could be he did not deceive himself into the idea that professor rudge had given up the scheme macrae was convinced that he would apply for an admiralty order this if granted meant yielding or loss of his berth nevertheless he felt it literally true what he had said not that he would not but that for some reason he could not agree to go his only hope now was in the admiralty refus- ing the required permission this was not however the case the application was received with surprise but the fact that so great a scientist after full investigation was suf- ficiently interested to be willing to make such a journey showed that he at all events did not con- sider it a mere hallucination and certainly not as intentional deceit permission was consequently given him to take macrae to station x and au- thority would be given him to have the signal house placed at his disposal for such time as he might re- quire it consistent with the official duties of the post armed with this professor rudge went to plymouth and had another long interview with macrae it was not in the professor's nature to use the document he had in the way macrae had feared no threats were employed but every other means was taken to alter his determination mac- rae had taken such a genuine liking to the pro- fessor that the interviews were quite painful to him as he still felt unable to accede to his request any one acquainted with professor rudge knew that he was not a man lightly to give up a thing on which he had set his mind if he had been one easily diverted from his purpose his own early struggles would not have led to his present success a comparatively small matter was often sufficient to show the firm tenacity of his nature but this to him was no small matter as long therefore as he desired macrae to accompany him to station x so station x  long would he continue to fight to that end he would have gone off by himself at once but his long experience and profound knowledge of psychic phenomena taught him that it would be useless he fully understood that the ability to hear this voice across the void always supposing it to be genuine depended infinitely more on the previously estab- lished mental rapport of the speaker and listener than on the ears of the latter rudge continues his efforts he saw how the sensorial organism of mac- rae when he first heard the voice an ex- ceptional condition of an exceptional being poised by combined exhaustion and horror on a needle point of unstable equilibrium had enabled him to feel rather than hear the etheric impulse of the far-flung call by one chance in a million or rather in countless millions macrae while in a sub-conscious state had over his ears the receiver of the most powerful radio installation on earth by such a chance rapport had been established and now it only remained to take advantage of that fact macrae must be brought again to the instru- ment but how was his obstinacy to be subdued to the scientist everything reduced itself to a problem he knows there is no cause without ef- fect or effect without a cause professor rudge had ascertained macrae to be a young man of keen in- telligence but weak will the human will is like everything else in this that the weaker has to give way to the stronger rudge had no doubt as to his own will being much the stronger yet macrae did not give way there was the problem evidently containing an unknown quantity somewhere for further investigation the professor decided meanwhile to try to over- come the obstacle by further pressure and to that end made the acquaintance of may treherne he had learned that she made her living as a typist in plymouth he was agreeably surprised when he met her he perceived at once that she had been much bet- ter educated than macrae that she was a strong character of sound common sense he had intend- ed to enlist her aid by demonstrating to her the material advantages to macrae and eventually to herself he quickly saw that she would be capable of enthusiasm without regard to sordid considera- tions and began to ask himself how much he might tell her the operator's sweetheart tells him to go he decided that he was bound to respect the government secret but that he would trust her with what he considered his own thus showing the confidence with which she had in- spired him he was surprised to find how little macrae had told this had been due to the rebuke administered by captain evered on the sagitta of that the professor knew nothing under pledge of secrecy may treherne was placed in possession of the facts except that pro- fessor rudge was careful to omit everything that could indicate the existence of such a place as sta- tion x her enthusiasm was pleasant to witness and surpassed the professor's expectations the re- cord of the voice was placed in her hands and she was told it was a part in fact the end of a diary that macrae had kept while at the station in the form of daily letters addressed to herself then you did do it after all she said turning to macrae and there was that in her look and tone that showed the previous absence of the diary had not escaped her attention yet she had never once alluded to what must have appeared to her an un- fulfilled promise where then she asked is the rest of it the professor told her that at the admiralty it had been considered to contain remarks referring too closely to what were government secrets and that it had been confiscated in consequence i may add said he that i think they were on the whole justified oh she said and for a moment appeared about to say more but she took the discreet but unfem- inine course of adding nothing she put a great many questions to macrae on the subject on which professor rudge had enlight- ened her during these the professor who was on the watch to intervene if necessary was struck by the tactful way in which she kept within the bounds of that subject and did not tread on forbidden ground and to you alan she glowed has come this distinction you must go with professor rudge as he wishes and return the most famous man in the world professor rudge saw at once what a powerful ally he had enlisted and he could not doubt the re- sult but he was mistaken macrae was as im- movable as ever evolving a theory and some letters not being able to spend further time at ply- mouth the professor left the lovers to fight it out and returned to town but he had not abandoned the thing he knew he had for the moment played his best trump and while await- ing events he carefully studied the subject he gave special attention to what information he had been able to get from macrae respecting the time when he lost consciousness he was particularly struck with the words employed in describing it to dr anderson--then suddenly something like darkness descended on me accompanied by some sharp command of the first voice and i was ap- parently struck a violent blow in the darkness on the back of my head a theory was beginning to form itself in his mind but before working further on it he decided to await news from plymouth it was toward the end of macrae's month when there came a letter from may dear professor rudge-- i have not met with any success with alan and cannot understand him i thought i had the stronger will of the two i have done all i can to persuade him to do as you wish but failed he is not obstinate about it on the contrary he is greatly upset apparently at not being able to humor me in the circumstances i cannot do more and i beg of you not to write to him again on the subject it worries him so i am very sorry to disappoint you yours sincerely may treherne  amazing stories professor rudge laughed when he read the letter the little traitress got out of her depth and had to scramble back and now stands on the side of the enemy put not thy confidence in woman that girl is a brick and would scratch my face cheerfully if i returned to the charge but i know now all about it my theory is absolutely estab- lished may received the following reply my dear miss treherne-- short of hearing the voice myself i could not desire any better confirmation of its reality and that of the personality behind it than your letter this remark may appear to you cryptic so i will explain your opinion respecting the will of mr macrae compared with your own and i may say with mine is correct when i found we did not suc- ceed a reason for this had to be sought on read- ing over the reports in my possession i find that at the moment when he lost consciousness he had the distinct impression of an order being given him the order itself quite in accordance with the well- known laws of hypnotism does not now rise to the level of consciousness but none the less absolutely decides his will and conduct we have both been wasting our exertions and distressing our friend uselessly he does not yield because he cannot it is in fact not him we are up against but the venerian therefore there is the venerian it is possible although not certain that by means of hypnotism the order itself might be discovered but i think the course would be open to objection in this case for the purpose of investi- gation i am now so interested in it will be better to do nothing hastily that might interfere with the influence now at work the order may have been a prohibition from returning to the instrument for ever or for a time only in the latter case it may not be a long time so i propose to wait awhile and do nothing i wish the whole matter to remain a secret for the present so will you please burn this so soon as read with kind regards believe me yours sincerely stanley rudge may was pleased with the letter principally be- cause alan was not going to be worried any more on the general argument she did not feel compe- tent to form an opinion seeing the whole subject had become very distasteful to him macrae was not even shown the letter which may treherne duly burnt as requested that voice was from mars it must not be supposed that the subject by any means died out of the professor's thoughts he continued at intervals to give it careful study he often puzzled over the mystery of the two voices why were there two  what was the disagree- ment among the venerians it was inconceivable that there could be any person or party who could have any objection to communicate with the earth the voice had distinctly said they had longed for it for thousands of years that nothing but our own backwardness had prevented it in its last words according to macrae's report the voice had appeared to be about to give a warning when the other voice the greater voice--my god--the professor sprang from his chair in the excitement of his dis- covery--that's it he said to himself the whole thing is clear clear as possible that voice was from mars chapter viii at station x arrived at this new hypothesis professor rudge felt as a man might who had been hammering away with hammer and cold chisel at some old shell from a battlefield and sud- denly discovered before it was too late that the shell was charged he fully realized that if his surmise were correct the situation was not to be played with he also remembered that he had once made an attempt to establish communication or at least to exchange signals with mars he had failed fools rush in where angels fear to tread he muttered to himself no one else would have used the word as applied to him how fortunate that the influence of the venerian was too strong for my meddlesome interference time passed with things in this state no one having the least desire to make any further move it was as though station x had never existed at the expiration of macrae's leave of absence he had been ordered to one of the home stations after a medical examination as to fitness from there may treherne received frequent letters from him she thought she could perceive by these that he seemed in some way changed by his experiences there was none of the buoyancy of former days she wondered if it was regret at the loss of the double pay that had lasted so short a time and the consequent postponement of their plans if his life were as monotonous as hers she could forgive him any amount of depression the operator writes his consent to professor rudge on the th of june of the following year professor rudge who had come with regret to fear that the whole episode was closed was surprised to receive a letter from macrae writ- ten from the west of ireland installation known as the cruaghaun station which looks down on the atlantic rollers from a height of two thousand feet dear sir it ran-- if you still have the same wish as you had when last i saw you i would be glad to hear from you for my part i am now quite willing to go with you to the place you wished to visit look- ing back on it i feel quite ashamed of my previous obstinacy and am at a loss to account for it my inclination now is quite the other way i wish to go there and dream of it continually not only in sleep but frequently in a sort of waking dream while in this lonely spot almost as lonely as that other i seem as though called requested to come even a date seems put into my head and i feel a great desire to be there at that time you will think this a fanciful thing in the extreme but would it be possible to be there on the th of july i am writing you in the hope that your wish is the same and that the time is sufficient i think it is by the station x  time it took me to return hoping to hear from you soon i remain dear sir yours faithfully alan macrae that said the professor to himself quite settles one question he was forbidden for a time not for always evidently a definite named time how tremendous must be the psychic force wielded by these beings making a date with a venerian he saw there would be time to reach station x by the date given with a little govern- ment assistance at the other end obeying his first impulse he at once replied to macrae's letter while in the middle of his letter he paused a thought had occurred to him which completely altered the aspect of the affair he felt perfect con- fidence in obeying the wishes of the venerian but macrae had heard two voices both of which he de- scribed as addressing him with imperative orders of some kind he had also the impression that they were in opposition to each other by which influ- ence then was he now being swayed this it was vital to ascertain but how he decided not to proceed further unless or un- til this question could be answered for a mo- ment he saw no way of doing so but presently a possible clue occurred to him he turned to a book containing some astronomical tables after mak- ing a short calculation he gave vent to a sigh of relief what he had discovered was that on the th of july mars was in conjunction that is at the extreme other side of his orbit from the earth and with the sun itself intervening well done venerian he exclaimed aloud caught unawares evidently utterly by surprise and unprepared with not a second to lose contend- ing in a losing battle with a being greater than himself and every instant full of peril the venerian had kept his head in a moment of time he had de- cided on a plan of action made the astronomical calculation mentally forced his order on macrae and sent him into temporary oblivion to be out of harm's way something like darkness descended on me macrae had said accompanied by some sharp command of the first voice and i was apparently struck a violent blow on the back of my head the floor struck him in his conversation with macrae the venerian claimed the mental superiority it is already placed beyond dispute he has given his proofs the trip to station x and the parting of the lovers professor rudge was not a man who easily showed excitement or allowed himself to be influenced perceptibly by his emotions but for once he seemed a little carried away the thing he had desired more than he knew seemed at last to show probability of realization to be almost with- in his grasp in point of fact there was in his at- titude for the moment something of the man as well as the scientist he reflected that if this dis- covery fell to him he would not only have made an advance the extent of which was beyond human power to estimate but also he would have his op- ponents beaten the renewal of the admiralty permission and macrae's leave of absence were easily obtained it remained but to pack up the few things necessary for the journey and those that might be wanted at station x here professor rudge was in a quan- dary he could not decide how much or little to encumber himself with should he take books of reference what was really going to happen if all went well a scientific discussion would he not according to what had been spoken to macrae be in the position of a pupil with much to learn and little to impart he became so engrossed with the possibilities of the affair before him that his absent-mindedness became very pronounced and his sister who kept house for him had the gravest sus- picions that he must have fallen in love at last it was decided to go by p amp  steamer to hong- kong and there the admiralty had arranged to take them on board one of the cruisers attached to the china station and convey them to station x the authorities were quite willing to make this slight return for the valuable services the scientist had previously rendered in connection with radio tele- phony and the choice and equipment of these stations services for which he had refused remun- eration the leave-taking between macrae and may tre- herne again took place on plymouth hoe and again it fell to her lot to hearten her lover she could not fail to see how depressed he was are you sure you want to go on this journey alan she asked you remember we agreed that it should be given up i must go may he replied with decision in fact nothing would prevent me but do you remem- ber dear the last time we said good-bye when i went to--to that place i spoke to you then of a cloud looming in the future yes alan and you were justified may said but that is all past now isn't it the voyage to station x when i came back you said what had hap- pened had proved me right and i let it go at that but in spite of that the cloud has not passed away it remains ahead may darker than ever and very much nearer he shuddered involuntarily greatly distressed the girl endeavored to dissuade him even at this last moment from starting on such an ill-presaged journey but without success just as it had been before impossible to incline him to go now his one idea was to start she saw that further words would be wasted she was not her- self unduly impressed with his premonition yet she would have been quite willing for him to give up the idea finding him immovable she did her best to cheer him and with some success yet the parting was a sad one the outward cheerfulness of both somewhat forced the voyage passed uneventfully and on the th of july only a day from the time desired they were landed at station x professor rudge having made the acquaintance of lieutenant hughes the officer in charge found that arrangements against his arrival had been  amazing stories made and quarters allotted him and macrae he handed lieutenant hughes the written authority he had brought with him respecting the use of the signal-room and so great was his impatience to put the purpose of his journey to the test that he and macrae went to the signal-table that same evening waiting for the message from venus macrae put on the receivers are you there he said and it struck him at once that he had without premeditation used the same low tone as in his previous conversations he then sat silent professor rudge was sufficiently convinced of the interest of the venerians to feel confident that his and macrae's coming to station x had been observ- ed having the venerian's own word for it that such observation was within their power a prompt re- ply obviously depended on that the time seemed interminable the professor could not take his eyes off his companion nor could he sit still upon his chair neither could he now that the great moment had come entirely drive from his mind that second voice he felt as one reach- ing out in the dark expecting to grasp a desired object but with an uncomfortable feeling of not being certain on what his fingers might close one two three minutes passed he drummed with his fingers upon the table would the time never pass his watch was lying before him four five minutes passed six minutes the inter- val in macrae's previous conversations elapsed and there was no reply he felt his throat dry the second hand of his watch crawled on suddenly macrae gave a start at the sight of which the professor almost jumped out of his chair yes i am here said macrae then turning from the mouthpiece to the professor he said as he had agreed-- it is he the friendly venerians talking with station x after an interval the professor soon be- came accustomed to these intervals he saw macrae begin to take shorthand notes he repeated the words as he wrote and thus professor rudge was able to follow the conversation you have some one with you the conversa- tions are given without reference to the intervals yes there is a scientific gentleman with me and he hopes to speak with you we have already heard of professor rudge at this moment he could not hear my voice and you are necessary but for a reason i will explain to him when possible it is desirable to establish direct communication at once ask him if he is willing to place himself under my control in full rapport with me professor rudge on hearing these words as re- peated by macrae at once understood what was re- quired but not the means by which it was to be achieved for a moment he was silent it was a risk it was surrendering his ego to another for a few seconds he thought rapidly then he seemed to come to a decision he motioned macrae to remove the receivers from his ears macrae do you still clearly recall the two voices you heard at the moment you were last here very clearly sir i shall never forget either are you quite certain absolutely certain that the voice you now hear is the first voice the one with whom you had conversations quite sure sir did the voices have any resemblance none whatever the second voice he added and the professor noticed the same tone and look of awe that had struck his two hearers on board the sagitta was--was--i felt a worm this is the friendly voice that spoke to me all through after another short pause the professor said reply that i am willing to do as desired he added to himself but i cannot see how it is to be done macrae then replied to the voice yes he is willing hypnotism from the planet venus in due course came the direction face each other professor rudge perceived that macrae was in some way about to be used as the medi- um but could not guess the intended proceedings he knew that his companion's will was so much the weaker that of his own power he would be quite in- capable of acquiring the necessary dominance the voice then addressed macrae although you are under my influence and it is by the rapport so established that you hear me that is not enough for the present purpose in the present phase of the rapport the attempt would fail in the first place because you would probably be incapable of influencing professor rudge who has probably the stronger mind and in the second place because if you succeeded he would be under your influence not mine and therefore be still in- capable of hearing me it is necessary that you pass on into the second phase in which your conscious- ness is merged in mine you will now sleep and then act as i shall direct you in thought contact there will be little need of words at the first suggestion at the mention of the word sleep macrae instantly responded and offering no resistance his hold on consciousness slipped from him as it might from one who had taken an anaes- thetic professor rudge saw the change and his own knowledge of the subject enabled him to gather that the second phase had been brought about look fixedly in my eyes said the voice of the unconscious operator and on being obeyed he moved his hand in backward sweeps above the other's head as they remained eye to eye the professor began to notice a very peculiar expression that he had never noticed before in the eyes before him was it expression or was it something in their contour certainly very peculiar--and yet not altogether new to him how strangely fixed and unwinking they seemed he had never before seen anything like that in macrae's eyes--nor in those of any other human being what are those creatures that have eyes that these reminded him of his memory seemed vague--those passes were very soothing sleep said macrae in a quiet but firm tone the professor nodded sleep said macrae station x  the professor's head fell forward presently macrae evidently in obedience to in- structions rose saying come sit in this seat take the headpiece and put it on and hear the voice that will speak to you good appetites after the hypnotizing the other looking like a somnambulist changed places with him he put on the headpiece and macrae in obedience to a last suggestion gradually rose to consciousness he then saw the change that had been brought about and moved away toward the entrance he stood there a moment looking at the professor then heard him say yes i am here macrae quietly closed the door after him it was eight o'clock and night had descended he went to the door of the outer entrance but feeling no desire to join the station staff stood there watching a bright star that shone with silvery and steady beam in the western sky he knew that star was venus an hour passed he waited dozing on the bench in the corner of the little outer lobby of the station- house then he slept when he woke it was with a start broad day a hand upon his shoulder looking up he saw it was professor rudge standing beside him he immedi- ately rose good morning sir it has been a suc- cess you have heard he noticed that the professor wore a puzzled look the fact is said the latter i have heard nothing i know nothing even of how i came to be sitting with the receiver on my head can you give me some information macrae at once understood the situation he remembered his own twenty-hour spell the pro- fessor's seemed to have been only about twelve hours he explained that this was doubtless a similar experience professor rudge now understood what had hap- pened he realized that he like a bag full of in- formation had been untied taken by the bottom cor- ners and held upside down it seemed undignified but presently the sane and healthy man came to the surface and he laughed recovered his temper--and his appetite have you had anything to eat since yesterday macrae he asked no sir said macrae smiling then my boy let us attend to that at once everything else can wait so the station staff took possession of the signal- room and the professor took possession of the at- tendant and the two men ate six feet of burly brawn and muscle represented a powerful engine not to be kept going without considerable stoking after this he and his companion thoroughly ex- plored the island the professor was always care- ful to keep himself in thorough physical training and his companion would have been all the better had he followed the same course this was ma- crae's conclusion after the walking and cliff-climb- ing of the next two hours he returned to the sta- tion-house nearly run off his feet professor rudge believed in the strenuous life and he lived up to his creed chapter ix macrae under suspicion in the afternoon as soon as the instrument was again at his disposal professor rudge and macrae took possession of the signal-room the professor was impatient to find out if he would now be able to hear the voice himself and at once put on the headpiece are you there the tone was a little un- steady from suppressed excitement after the usual interval it was with a thrill of pleasure that he heard faint but clear a voice the voice there could be no mistaking its agreement with macrae's description yes professor rudge it said i am here but speak low as macrae did your other stations will then not hear you but i shall hear you also that you may have a record of our conversation repeat my words aloud to macrae and he will take them down i foresee proceeded the voice that you may disapprove of the manner of our first intercourse during the past night it was the best way it saved time which is most vital you have supple- mented to the utmost of your ability the information given by macrae and our future conversations can be devoted to the return you will no doubt desire except for a matter on which i must speak before you remove the receiver on what topic would you first wish to compare venerian opinions with your own the great moment of professor rudge's life as he heard these words professor rudge felt that the great moment of his life had come although he had rehearsed a hundred imaginary conversations with the voice on as many topics now that the voice was suddenly offered him he was momentarily at a loss what to say at last he spoke now that this new door to knowledge has been so unexpectedly opened to mankind i hope it will never be closed again i hope that the time is near when under your instruction our knowledge will be equal to your own so far as our lesser minds are capable of understanding all that constitutes your attainments we shall said the voice withhold no informa- tion we can give you it is not in our power to make you our equals the increase of knowledge will tend to develop your minds but you must ever remember that the two things are entirely separate entities i realize that said the professor and that as you are the greater in both respects you are the best judge of what should be our subject now as i have the use of the instrument for a limited time i will leave the choice to you and remain a listener to save the intervals of waiting for replies the venerian commended the course proposed by professor rudge and at once proceeded with what was practically a long scientific lecture that held his auditor spellbound with interest the attain- ments displayed the sweep of intellect indicated caused professor rudge to feel himself a novice again  amazing stories the venerian commenced by saying do not suppose we arrogate to ourselves anything ap- proaching infallibility we are but fellow travel- lers with yourselves toward the great goal--truth a theory of the universe told from venus the subject he chose was the venerian theory of the universe corresponding to what is known as the la placian theory but to which it had no resemblance your theory he said contemplates a universal loss of energy until space is peopled only by dead suns a universe with all heat light life extinct without one ray to wander through its blackness of darkness or one sigh to break its eternal silence to minds cultivated as are ours such a develop- ment with an eternity still to come would be suffi- cient refutation the venerian then proceeded to give the theory accepted in his world and to support it with such evidence that professor rudge's acceptance of it was complete and inevitable it proved to him the perfect and complete conservation of solar energy beyond possibility of dispute as soon as the enunciation of the new theory and its demonstration were completed the venerian said we felt that this was due to you as a first fruit of the information we hope to give you on many subjects in return for the information you have given us respecting your terrestrial affairs but we must now speak on a subject of more im- mediately vital importance do not repeat my words to macrae what follows is for yourself alone at this moment some one was heard knocking at the door of the signal-room evidently they were about to be interrupted in dumb show macrae im- parted the fact go said the professor and see if the instrument is wanted if so ask if we can retain it for a few minutes macrae presently returned from the door to say that lieutenant hughes wished to send a message but that it could wait a few minutes on replacing the receivers that he had removed to hear macrae's answer the professor found that the venerian had ceased speaking he had heard the words of macrae presently the voice resumed are you there professor rudge danger of interruption from mars on receiving the affirmative reply the voice proceeded do not speak remember that on the subject i am about to speak on noth- ing must be said to macrae there was great anxiety here lest you and he should not arrive in time by good fortune you did but every day now the position becomes less secure when my last interview with macrae on his first visit to this station was brought to an abrupt interruption it was on account of an unforeseen interruption from mars i was right thought the professor by an exhibition of powers that we did not even know them to possess macrae was reached indirectly through his rapport with me i was rapidly being overborne in my defence of him when i succeeded in entrancing him and had only just time to give him instructions to remain so until far from the island and not return to it until the th of july my instructions were inadequate and even faulty but the situation at the moment of giving them was extremely difficult we have now taken ade- quate precautions that the same thing shall not happen to you but we cannot undo the evil that may have been done in the case of macrae nor say for the present the extent of it it is this latter point that we wish to test we have reason to sup- pose that it is of a serious nature in fact fatal un- less guarded against with such extremely little time for thought my instructions to him were not to return to the island before the th of july the date suggested by the next conjunction of mars with time for reflection i should have taken a much more drastic course for this reason i feel to a certain extent responsible for the position that has arisen a posi- tion much too full of danger our reason now for fearing that the malign influence was successfully brought to bear on him is that although i did not bid him return yet he showed an anxious desire to be here by the expiration of the forbidden period his experiences at the station were not of a kind to make that desire natural as a spontaneous wish we therefore conclude that he is now of course quite unconsciously to himself under the martian's influence and that to allow him to go to the receiver after mars has passed from behind the solar screen would be to run the greatest risk to-day is safe probably tomorrow but it is best to be on the safe side for those beings always seem to surpass our calculations my instructions to you are to see to it as though your life depended on it which it may that macrae never again puts on the headpiece and that you find out by watching him whether he shows any secret desire to do so or is prompted to do so that is all do not reply i will be ready to con- tinue our discourse when you next come to the in- strument we will now tell lieutenant hughes that the signal-room is at his disposal said the professor what did the voice say the last minute or two asked macrae as they went out he spoke to me about the receiver said the professor calmly with the instructions he will give me i hope to be able to make improvement in that part of the instrument let us take a turn around the island night was falling as they returned to the station- house and macrae was told to defer writing out his report until next morning being tired he was glad of this respite and was soon fast asleep professor rudge also retired early to his room but not to sleep that afternoon had opened up to him novel views not merely on one but on many scientific subjects he was a student again his whole world revolutionized sleep what man could sleep in such circumstances ultimately after the first bent of the scientific had had its way with him he came down to the urgent matter dealt with in the venerian's last words late that night it was not musings on science that kept him awake but a sense of peril station x  the evil doings of the martians in the past every detail of the tragedy of mars of long ago as recounted in macrae's report came vividly before his mind there was no mys- tery about the manner of it he quite understood the method of the whole unspeakable crime from its full conception to its ghastly perpetration he knew better than to look upon it as a fable or old wife's tale the earnestness of the venerian carried con- viction in imagination he placed himself in the position of the lunarians just as a drowning man will grasp at a straw so those apparently perishing beings had allowed the instinct of self-preservation to stifle con- science he tried to realize the nature and power of the present martians his most vivid idea of them how- ever he got by realizing the evident terror with which they inspired the venerians if any martian could gain a footing on the earth by grasping at the personality of one of its inhabi- tants and so animating a human form the whole world by virtue of his psychic force and intellect would be at his mercy and that of all his kin who would follow the more the professor thought of it the more terribly he felt the weight of his responsi- bility knowing the fate that was now threatening the world and that only he and this far-off venerian stood between it and catastrophe more than once during the night the professor left his room and paced the little entrance lobby of the station-house into which both his and the signal- room opened each time that he closed his eyes be- fore a momentary doze had time to merge into sleep some weird nightmare connected with the subject of his thoughts effectually roused him two keys to one door the night seemed interminable it came to an end at last without incident at the earliest opportunity he asked lieu- tenant hughes if he could be provided with a key to the signal-room he had noticed that the door was never locked and seldom shut except in windy weather certainly sir said lieutenant hughes rather mystified by the request he was a good-natured young fellow who stood rather in awe of professor rudge on account of his fame thank you said the professor you may have wondered why i have come to this station the full details will i hope be known in due time but i may say that it is in connection with an experiment in radio telephony as you know this is the most pow- erful installation that exists and it is the only one adapted to my purpose i thought it must be something of that sort sir let me explain said the professor what may have seemed an odd request macrae who assists me is a very good fellow very competent intelligent and interested in what i am doing but you will understand that in some experiments the slightest unconsidered action may be very prejudicial i wish to make quite certain that he does not even with the best intentions meddle with any part of the mechan- ism in the signal-room when i am not there certainly sir said hughes the door can bei kept locked if the keys can be found if not i will have a couple made at once that will be no trouble to jones jones was the radio engineer acting with lieuten- ant hughes the professor was several times on the point of taking hughes to some extent into his confidence he saw both the advantages in and objections to do- ing so he finally decided to say nothing as yet by mid-day a key was handed to him the only other key said hughes remains with me so that will be all right this greatly allayed professor rudge's immediate sense of danger at the appointed time accompanied by macrae he went to the signal-table to resume the conversation of the day before his first call was answered is macrae with you came the question yes then we will go on with our discourse of yes- terday but at its termination send him from the room before you put down the receivers that we may speak of our difficulty respecting him then the professor repeating to macrae a fur- ther long exposition on various branches of science followed the listener was soon entranced by his in- terest in and lost in admiration of the long strides venerian science had made beyond the bounds of hu- man knowledge he was carried so far beyond his depth that he found it impossible while repeating the words mentally to follow the argument with the same rapidity giving up the attempt as confusing and tending to error he repeated mechanically wisely deciding to defer thought or study until he could read the communication at his leisure at its conclusion there was a short pause evi- dently intended to put the professor on his guard then the voice resumed do not repeat find some reason to dismiss macrae that seems all on the subject for the present macrae i think of asking a few questions but shall not require your help you must be pretty tired of it as the subject is rather beyond you is it not i do not understand it at all sir said macrae stifling a yawn then take the shorthand notes into your room and write them out for me while it is still daylight macrae left the signal-room re-adjusting the headpiece the professor said-- i am now alone have you taken adequate precautions against macrae coming to the instrument yes the door is now kept constantly locked when no messages are being sent the venerians tell of impending danger from mars that is well but i assure you that very great vigilance is necessary and we do not feel convinced that you are sufficiently alive to the danger that threatens you our only hope is based on the knowledge that you are not a man of small mind or lacking in imagination if such were the case we should despair of being able to assist you you would in that case infallibly regard the danger as remote almost unintelligible even unreal we are  amazing stories convinced that such is not the case with you but we doubt if you adequately appreciate the peril and its imminence although you already know its general nature let me at the risk of being wearisome again speak of it i am not able to tell you how the baleful in- fluence will act on macrae but you must be prepared for every subtle means of gaining its end have you seen anything as yet to arouse suspicion nothing whatever three days have now elapsed since the time of conjunction mars is now rapidly increasing his angle with the sun the time of danger is now very near if there is no sign of the influence we fear within a day or two all is well and the evil was not wrought remember whatever the time of day or night let me know at once of any overt sign i will of course do so said the professor on no account let yourself be lulled into any false idea of security by relying on the great physical su- periority you may possess in the event of the oc- currence of what we strive to guard against that would be entirely useless you and all your race would be brought to the means of communication like lambs to the slaughter we can resume our con- versation to-morrow at the same hour if no pre- vious call is rendered necessary regarding this as dismissal for the time pro- fessor rudge removed the receivers and sat for a time gazing at the instrument before him but not thinking of it it was with a very worried air that he ultimately rose and left the signal-room chapter x the venerian's anxiety with the venerian's words of warning still ringing in his ears professor rudge left the signal-room and went to his own apartment he was soon lost in thought but it was not on general science that his mind was concentrat- ed he was revolving the matter so urgently pressed on his attention by the venerian he was chiefly impressed by perceiving that how- ever keen his own sense of the danger from the mar- tians his informant was much more impressed and he did not forget that that informant was a being of higher mental status than himself he remem- bered words that although accompanied by some complimentary remark gave the impression that if the speaker's sense of the danger arose principally from a knowledge of the character of the martian it came also partly from a lack of reliance on the char- acter of humanity even as exemplified by himself he was told to be on the look-out for every kind of subtle means that the unseen enemy could pos- sibly seize on to achieve his ends at the same time he was unable to conceive of any means available or against which he could set a guard beyond taking the obvious precaution of keeping macrae from the signal-table this he had done effectually but the venerian in spite of the professor's promise was evidentally not fully reassured this gave profes- sor rudge an uneasy feeling for he did not disguise from himself for a moment the fact as to which possessed the better knowledge and judgment the venerians still fear the evil-minded martians the venerian had claimed for his race a great superiority over humanity and had given more than ample proof of it it was however clear that while having the greatest admiration for the science and mental status of the martians the venerian when acting in opposition to them felt his inferiority and danger of defeat how much greater must man's inferiority be if the venerian felt the greater anxiety it could but arise from a greater knowledge of the foe tax his brain as he would professor rudge could not see what more he could do he longed for the arrival of the sagitta he knew the impossibility of any one doing without sleep if his responsibility meant continual watchfulnes day and night he saw that time was fighting against him everything de- pended upon the arrival of the cruiser to ease his mind of mere useless worry he strove to fix his attention on the scientific revelations to which he had just listened had they stood alone he would have been able to think of nothing else they were epoch-making colossal yet it now required a distinct effort of will on his part to give to them the requisite concentration of mind in this however he at length succeeded scientific riches had been poured out to him with an unstinted hand he saw that this new knowledge meant revolution in the scientific world for it not only went far beyond the dreams of our greatest thinkers but was at variance with many theories long accepted each branch of science being so in- terwoven with others on which it impinges it was evident how deeply even those he had not heard dealt with would be affected as an instance he re- membered the long dispute between the geologists and the astronomers as to the age of the earth in which each side claimed to have proved the other wrong by many millions of years he saw that the whole argument fell to the ground before this new and splendid theory of the maintenance of the cosmos feeling at length that deep thought was not help- ing him to keep his brain prepared for its possible coming contest with sleepless hours he decided to drop the subject until next morning and seek the company of lieutenant hughes at their evening meal he realized that the time he had hitherto given to that young man considering that he was practically the host was scarcely sufficient for the needs of politeness he also wished to sound him with a view to deciding how far it would be possible or rather desirable to confide in him professor rudge found hughes a cheerful light- hearted fellow who proved pleasant company he made one or two attempts to interest him in scientific subjects but saw that although the young officer gave him polite and even deferential attention his leaning was certainly not in that direction and his information in such things was quite superficial the professor was confirmed in his opinion that to say nothing was best a walk on the island--professor rudge's suspicions in passing to his own room professor rudge once more tried the door of the signal-room it was securely locked he prepared himself to pass a night of watchfulness he felt the disadvant- station x  age of not knowing what form the danger would take or the direction from which it would come its intangibility might have caused it temporarily to fade from his mind and allow him a few hours rest but he was deterred by his knowledge of the anxiety of one better able than he to gauge the possibilities of the situation through such uneasy somnolence as he allowed himself and however much he endeavored to keep that being in the mental background there would persist in sometimes looming up before him the menace of the martian the next morning professor rudge rose early in spite of his disturbed rest he felt his anxiety less insistent than on the night before his was a spirit that soon rebounded from depression with the daylight he felt again almost his own sanguine and jovial self it was not that he forgot for one moment his danger and responsibility but that the morning brought him greater confidence in his ability to meet the situation he roused macrae and together they set off to the cliff and inhaled the breeze from the ocean cool in the early hours he took macrae with him partly that he might not be left at the station without his supervision and partly that he might take the earliest oppor- tunity of tactfully probing his mind and thoughts on the subject of his experiences on his first visit to the island he wished to see if any further light could be thrown on macrae's desire to return to station x professor rudge was careful not to let it appear to his companion that he was being examined or that the talk was with any definite object the point raised by the venerian that there was ground for suspicion in the desire of macrae to re- turn to station x where his previous experience had been so terrible would not have occurred to the pro- fessor but he now saw the full force of it he re- membered that macrae had never given him any rea- son for his wish and now ascertained without abrupty asking the question that he had none to give this did not come as a surprise to the profes- sor who knew more than most men about that ob- scure subject of the subconscious ego he saw that the fact went to support the venerian's opinion a conference with the venerians when they returned from their walk both eager for their breakfast professor rudge was thoroughly satisfied that macrae had no conscious wish to communicate with the martian the second voice as he invariably called it the professor noticed that whenever mac- rae used that phrase and he never did unless led to it the same expression of awe crept into his look and tone as had been noticed on that first occasion on board the sagitta short as the contact had been almost momentary and few if any the words that could have passed the impression made on macrae had been enormous it was something however to know that if macrae were likely to attempt anything that had to be guard- ed against he was himself totally ignorant of the fact with this partial relief of his anxiety the natural bent of professor rudge's mind asserted itself his thoughts again reverted to the great acquisition of knowledge so strangely given him he got from macrae the written report of the conversation of the previous afternoon he spent the greater part of the morning on this and in making notes of subjects he desired to speak about on the next occasion at the usual hour he and macrae went again to the signal-room the professor noticed that his first call was answered without a second's avoidable interval the fact impressed him with the fact of the con- stant attention evidently now given at the other end whatever uneasiness he might feel he became convinced that greater uneasiness existed there a circumstance that increased his own it was not so much his own acquaintance with the facts of the case that maintained his fears at the necessary level as the evident anxiety felt on venus apart from that and the daily reiteration of the warning those fears would inevitably have become lulled by the complete absence of any outward sign to stimulate them promptly to the usual call are you there came the reply do not repeat answer with one word yes or no has there been any sign or indications of what we fear no on what subject professor rudge do you wish to converse to-day cosmic history told by the venerians a long discourse ensued that ranged over a variety of subjects all of such intense inter- est to professor rudge as indeed they would have been to any man of scientific leanings or even ordinary intelligence that for the time all worry over other matters was forgotten these subjects included among others--nature's general method always in the material realm pro- ceeding in cycles never toward finality this was no new theory to professor rudge but now eluci- dated and exemplified in a way that thrilled him with admiration the origin of life was shown to be a thing quite outside the bounds of any finite intelli- gence whether human venerian or even martian the absolute futility was indicated of the human en- deavor to find out when and how matter first began to live the fact being that no matter ever did or ever would live the mystery of death was shown to be the mere withdrawal of a hand from a machine that would no longer work the illusion was caused by the fact of our waking consciousness being able only to see the machine he was given the geological period with dates of man's evolution as such and a short account of the ancestry of the present human races going back to remote times to which our historic period is as yes- terday this was followed by a comparison of the present political and social state of the two worlds here again professor rudge caught every word with intense avidity he quickly saw two things one that in this respect the state of things in the venerian world was ideal beyond his previous dreams of what any state could be the other that it would be worse than useless here spelling absolute anarchy at the conclusion of this part of the discourse there was a pause and remembering the similar pause of the day before the listener was on his  amazing stories guard then the voice resumed do not repeat let macrae now leave you turning to his companion and displacing the re- ceivers the professor said will you take your notes of what has passed into your room please and write them out for me give them to me as soon as they are ready a minute later he turned to the mouthpiece i am alone he said danger impending--precautions necessary in due course the voice resumed i must come back to the subject of the threatening danger we have now every reason to believe that the most careful vigilance is necessary although there has been no sign we believe that the influence of the enemy has now the opportunity to make itself felt if it is as we fear macrae may be prompted to do what he would himself be at a loss to give any in- telligent reason for watch him constantly i shall be extremely glad when he is out of the is- land that will be in two days said professor rudge meanwhile every precaution shall be taken every precaution you speak the words too lightly professor rudge i cannot describe to you the anxiety on your behalf that is felt here and when i say your behalf i mean all your kind it is necessary to speak plainly you are not sufficiently in earnest in this matter your whole world is now relying upon you alone if you only had a fuller grasp of the nature of the beings arrayed against you compared with whom we are children it might help you if indeed it did not paralyse you i charge you let there be no unprotected moment but two days professor rudge was profoundly impressed by the solemnity of this warning he did not know quite how to reply to it at another time he might have felt some resentment knowing the care he was taking and the anxious time he had been having he could scarcely admit the justice of the venerian's words they did however make him realize still more fully the concern and solicitude that obviously inspired them and so they fulfilled their purpose of heightening his own appreciation of the gravity of the situation i feel sure he said that you know better than i how full the position is of peril thank you for the further warning i promise to use the utmost care of which i am capable do you suppose our con- versation is being overheard on mars we are comparatively speaking so near and that planet at present so far removed and unfavorably placed that we do not think it can be but it is un- certain we only know that if the positions were reversed we should be unable to hear there is one other thing i must request of you--to come to the instrument at once if macrae shows any overt sign of the influence we fear if suspicion becomes con- verted into certainty then indeed our line of action must be reconsidered if there is nothing of this nature to communicate come to the instrument again to-morrow at the same time but from now on there will always be some one to answer your call that is all for the present professor rudge took off the headpiece and passed his hand over his forehead for a long time he sat lost in thought with an air even more wor- ried than on the day before he ultimately rose and left the signal-room he locked the door and was in the act of dropping the key in his pocket when mac- rae joined him you have finished yes sir here is the report said macrae add- ing if you have no further need of me today sir i should like to lie down my head aches a little certainly said the professor i shall not re- quire you i hope you will be all right again in the morning chapter xi danger imminent the professor sat down on the one seat in the little entrance lobby this had three doors which opened into it the station en- trance and entrances to the signal-room and to the room which the professor was occupying from his seat he therefore commanded all three doors sitting here he attempted to utilize the last rays of daylight in reading over the communication he had that afternoon received but even before the fading light compelled him gave it up he was too worried for mental concentration he gave rein to his thoughts the papers slipped from his fingers to the floor and lay there unheeded he recognized that no small part of the trouble that oppressed him was due to the vagueness of its nature he was acting in obedience to a warning which was in itself as mysterious as the danger in- dicated he was warned of an attack but not in- formed of its method as to preventing macrae from communicating with mars or with any one else that was simple the seeming simplicity did not however remove the unpleasant sensation of impending danger if there were but some outward sign he told himself his nerves would brace themselves to the occasion and he would be easier in his mind it was like fighting a phantom or expecting an attack in the dark but without knowing by what or from what direction after a time lieutenant hughes joined the pro- fessor and they were at the supper-table for a few minutes together the young man had been puz- zling for two days as how this learned scientist had acquired the reputation of being socially of a jovial disposition his learning was no doubt indisput- able but for the rest perhaps he had been over- rated tonight especially he seemed taciturnity itself professor rudge's night on watch in station x at a comparatively early hour professor rudge retired for the night the monotony of life at station x conduced to early hours his room was really that of lieutenant hughes good-naturedly given up to him during his stay professor rudge left the door open and drew his little camp bedstead to a point from which he could see the signal-room door he only partly undressed and decided to keep awake there was just sufficient light to see objects indistinctly the time passed very slowly once a grim sort of smile without any mirth in it passed over his face as he compared his present situation with his usual station x  life that life seemed almost as though it belonged to a distant past how far away london seemed how far away everything seemed--except danger knowing that however great the need of watch- fulness it would be impossible to go entirely with- out sleep the whole of the time until the sagitta was due he formed a plan of contenting himself with a comparatively short nap once a day while the signal- room was officially occupied as a young man he had been able to sleep just when and where he chose and he was relying on this faculty now at first he experienced no great difficulty in keeping awake in spite of the little sleep he had had since landing he rightly attributed his wakefulness to the strangeness of his experience and the peculiar un- canniness of the danger that threatened he could not bring himself to expect anything to happen at night there could be no possibility of wireless communication for the door was locked and the key in the pocket of his coat hanging on the peg within easy reach of his hand a hundred crowding thoughts passed through his mind he lost count of time macrae under martian influence is a somnambulist after at least a couple of hours--it may have been about midnight--the soft tread of bare feet but distinctly audible in the stillness was heard passing his door in the direction of the signal-room a form was just visible as it crossed the entrance lobby a good deal startled at this unexpected develop- ment the professor rose going quickly to the doorway he put out his head for a better view of the intruder the light was just sufficient to enable him to recognize the figure of macrae trying the signal-room door knowing it to be securely locked professor rudge stood a few seconds awaiting events several times the handle was turned back and a quiet attempt made to push open the door speaking quietly the professor asked what are you doing there macrae there was no answer but macrae turned and began to come back towards him passing without taking any notice although within a foot of him macrae walked out of the lobby and toward his own apartment after turning having such light as there was upon his face the professor could see that macrae was fast asleep professor rudge knew the danger of awaking a sleep-walker and allowed him to go without further interference he felt that he had at last something tangible macrae had shown him that the martians method was somnambulism that made much clear to him that he had been unable to understand before there was no longer the shadow of doubt but that macrae was under hypnotic influence and sugges- tion and was acting during sleep in obedience to another will there could be little doubt as to whose will that was still now that the professor knew what he had to fight against--knew the enemy's plan of action--the strain was relieved and he felt safe with the door locked there was secur- ity to-morrow he would report the occurrence and get advice he drew forward a deck chair and resumed his vigil how slowly the time passed once or twice feel- ing a drowsiness the reaction from the few minutes excitement he had experienced he rose and went to the outer door gazing at the wondrous pageant spread above him long he looked at many a familiar constellation jewelling the tropic night and at others southward not so familiar he watched their ordered ranks their silent ceaseless westward march it brought his thoughts to the mysterious voice that had come to him across the zodiac faint but clear like the sound of a silver bell from that silvery star soothed by his gaze into the infinite distances he went back again to await the remaining hours of the night the key has been taken from professor rudge's pocket he attacks macrae he sat in the silence thinking more or less co- herently of this and that his head nodding heavy with sleep all at once he started up wide awake not know- ing for the moment how or in fact why he found himself thus suddenly upon his feet he would have repudiated the suggestion that he had even for a moment lost consciousness that is a thing on which it is so easy to be mistaken it was now between three and four o'clock and except for the starlight still dark for a second he stood tensely listening then came a sound an unmistakable sound of some one in the signal-room his mind instantly turned to hughes as the only other person who had a key--but what could he be doing there now either he or his assistant in one or the other of their little apartments was sup- posed to be awake lest the gong of the call-signal should be sounded from one of the communicating stations but it certainly had not sounded the professor stretched out his arm to take the key from his jacket pocket he was delayed a mo- ment by the fact that it had by some means come off the peg and was lying on the floor he found it and searched for the key it was gone with one bound he was out into the lobby with a second into the signal-room the door of which was wide open and reached the signaller's seat to find macrae in it with the headpiece above his head just fitting the receiver over his ears to seize the headpiece with one hand and to hurl the lank figure of the somnambulist sprawling head- long on the floor with the other was the work of a moment he found that his own knees were shaking under him and the perspiration pouring from him he sank down heavily into the seat he had so lately emptied macrae lay for a second or two where he had fallen then he began to pull himself together and finally rose and stood lifting his hands to his head and looking round him with an air of fear and be- wilderment the little moan that escaped him in- stantly brought professor rudge to his assistance he had already realized that in the excitement of the moment action had preceded judgment he regretted the roughness he had displayed telling himself that to have seized the headpiece would have been enough  amazing stories macrae is awake an interview by the time he reached macrae's side the latter now thoroughly awake said how did i come here what is the meaning of this the professor noticed an air of rising nervous excitement about him he decided to make as little of the affair as possible you have been walking in your sleep my lad he said soothingly and the fall to the floor woke you rather suddenly you were in here when i found you there's no harm done i hope did you ever walk in your sleep before never sir and how do you feel now my head seems completely dazed i'll go back to bed perhaps i shall be better in the morning i shall be glad to leave this dreadful island he then added why i ever wished to come to it is a mystery the professor again noticed a slight rising in- flexion of excitement he therefore took macrae's arm and led him towards his room to walk in your sleep is no very uncommon ex- perience it is the shock of the sudden awakening that upsets you lie still now and get to sleep again the professor remained with him for some time still feeling rather conscience-stricken i might have killed him he thought and after all it was my fault after this i can never trust myself again while waiting until macrae should drop off he reflected on the powerful influence that had acted on him the second time that night and this second time to take the key from where the waking mac- rae had seen it placed he shuddered as finally he rose to leave the room noticing as he did so that dawn was beginning to break he decided to go at once back to the signal- room to redeem his promise and to place if pos- sible the affair in hands more competent than his own had proved as he took the headpiece in his hands again he experienced that uncomfortable shudder who would answer his call suppose-- no refusing to follow that train of thought and calling his courage to his aid he placed the receiv- ers are you there he asked a welcome voice from venus the interval of waiting was not longer than usual but it had never seemed so long then came the well-known welcome voice i am here what has happened the professor gave a full account of the night's experiences recounting them brought more vividly than anything else would have done his own remiss- ness he remembered that he had at a repeated special request promised to report at once anything that proved macrae to be under other influence and in his foolish feeling of security he had not done so as he related the events that proved he must have fallen asleep he felt utterly unworthy of his respon- sibility he was glad when the story was ended including his unnecessary violence to the sleeper he expected reproaches he was prepared to take with humility anything that might be addressed to him he waited the interval was longer in reality this time than he had ever known it six minutes passed ten minutes at last came the answer there were no reproaches write a note to the officer in charge requesting him not to disturb you for two hours in the signal- room place that outside the door and then re- main in the room locking the door on the inside remain with the headpiece on until called the professor did as he was ordered he sat patiently awaiting his further instructions at the end of a quarter of an hour a voice said are you there professor he replied and coloured when he found that no remark followed every quarter of an hour the question was repeated and every time in a tone that betrayed no resentment the professor replied i am here at about the seventh call the voice further said we have called a council as the matter is too serious for my sole decision we have come to a conclusion and i now ask you to place yourself in my hands entirely i wish you to yield your will to mine and to pass into the second or unconscious phase and fear no harm rest forward on your arms and yield to my suggestion to sleep i cannot succeed in spite of you but earnestly request you to assist banish all questionings and as it becomes possible all thoughts from your mind sleep the voice continued in quiet insistent monotone urging sleep at the first request professor rudge shrank back from the suggestion he wanted to ask questions he remained silent however while the voice continued finally he decided to acquiesce he yielded to the request made him put his head on his arms and tried to think of nothing but the sug- gestion made him by the being under whose influ- ence he already was very gradually consciousness faded entirely from him an apparently sleeping figure rested on the signal-table chapter xii the martian triumphant in telling professor rudge of the power of the martians to force their spiritual possession on beings of less strength than themselves the venerian had mentioned that it was within their the venerians power to effect this psychic ex- change with the assent of the other being concerned it was the overwhelming force of the martian en- abling him to dispense with such assent that gave him his terrible power for evil in the request and directions addressed by the venerian to professor rudge at the signal-table it was such an exchange that he intended that a foreign or outside spirit could possess or take possession of the personality of a human being was well kown to man long before the beginning of modern civilization a fact of which there is abund- ant scriptural and other warrant such foreign intruder might either impose itself on or cast out and replace the spirit in rightful possession when the two hours had expired lieutenant hughes went to see if there were any sign of pro- fessor rudge coming out there was no special need of the room for official use but hughes was curious he was also puzzled the whole affair was a mystery station x  the more he thought about it the more remark- able it seemed a man of eminence usefulness and known industry such as professor rudge would not be wasting his time at station x without some very important object surely it was not for the pur- pose of spending a short time each day in conversa- tion with another station if that had been the only purpose of his visit why was the engineer- operator brought if as it was natural to suppose the latter had come for the purpose of making some change in the system of wiring or in some other part of the apparatus under the professor's instruction why was there no sign of it if there were a mystery hughes had no inten- tion of trying to pry into it he was anxious to do nothing to obstruct but he asked himself why he was being kept so completely in the dark even if he could not assist such were the thoughts that occupied lieutenant hughes's mind as he waited for the door to be opened it is probable that even then the problem would not have occupied a minute of that easy-going young man's thoughts but for a short conversation that had just taken place with jones his assistant at the station the man told of a sound he had heard in the signal-room the previous night first a scuffle and then a moan afterwards voices he had put his ear to the wall and was prepared to swear they were the voices of the professor and macrae the story of a fight in the operating building you must have been dreaming said hughes what could they be doing there at that time had they a light there was no light from the window sir the place was in darkness that's a queer story jones why did you not go and see about it well sir i didn't care to go replied jones why not queried lieutenant hughes i didn't care to interfere when i heard that scuffle in the dark they do say there was a couple of men murdered here not long ago there were two deaths here certainly i don't know if it's true sir but there's a yarn on the sagitta that those two men killed each other but we were talking about it last night said hughes well sir i didn't care to interfere when i heard that scuffle and groan said jones with hesitation why talking now sir in broad daylight it sounds silly but last night i remembered reading in tales about murder scenes being acted all over again and- that will do jones i gave you credit for more sense i am sure now that it was only the two i said but i'll find out said jones how inquired hughes while off duty i'll go down for a bit of fishing and i'll ask macrae to come with me he seems to have nothing to do about this time i'll lead round to the subject when i get a chance there must be no cross-questioning warned hughes oh no sir if he seems unwilling but i'll be able to see with that they separated lieutenant hughes waited some time longer as the hour approached for the daily exchange of signals he decided to hint to the professor that the time asked for had more than expired before knocking he went over to a seat he often occupied just outside the window so placed that it commanded a view of the interior and made the hearing of a signal call certain from here he caught sight of the professor stand- ing in the middle of the room he was regarding everything in turn minutely the signalling appara- tus table chairs even the floor walls and ceiling as though he had never seen the place before more remarkable still he seemed to be even studying himself hang it all grumbled hughes the govern- ment service can't wait for this kind of thing and he went round to the door and knocked evidently the professor had reached it at the same moment for even as he knocked the key turned and the door opened the professor stood before him and for a second it seemed to hughes that he was being scrutinized in the same inquiring way but if so it was only momentarily professor rudge under martian influence on his part hughes now observed something un- familiar in the manner of professor rudge he noticed that the pupils of the eyes looking into his own were unusually dilated and that their quiet intense regard made him feel curiously uncomfort- able they seemed in some strange way to grasp and hold him mentally and bodily and he literally had to force himself to make the simple remark that he feared he must now take possession of the signal- room he noticed that in replying the professor seemed to fumble over his words as a man might who is speaking in a tongue he knows but has not used for years i am sorry if i have remained in it too long he said can you tell me where macrae is i think he has gone down to the beach with jones fishing said hughes yes he added there they are pointing to two figures half a mile distant just disappearing over the edge of the cliff the professor thanked him and as he caught his eye for a moment at parting hughes was again conscious of a queer sensation involuntarily he shivered whatever else was in that quiet but pene- trating look it conveyed to him the uncomfortable impression that not only were his words heard but his inmost thoughts read hughes went to the signal-table to give the call and the professor moved from the door allowing his eye to wander over the island as he slowly walked over its jagged rocky surface the intense blueness of the sky above seemed to claim his ad- miration he presently increased his pace and walked off toward the point of the cliff where the two men had disappeared having exchanged signals and iearned that there was nothing further required hughes came out of the room and taking a book sat on his accustomed seat so as to be within hearing of the signal call  amazing stories during the time that he was on duty soon he began to doze the two figures that hughes had seen disappear- ing in the distance and which he had informed professor rudge were jones and macrae were in fact jones and the attendant not having recov- ered from his shaking-up of the night before macrae had felt no inclination to join jones in his sport preferring to rest quietly on his bed where he almost at once dropped off to sleep presently he rose evidently not fully awake and walked past the sleeping hughes quietly and slowly he entered the signal-room and made direct for the instrument lieut hughes controlled by martian hypnotic influence when the supposed professor rudge came to the cliff edge and looked down on the sea and beach he saw no one it was evident the two men had walked round on the shingles one way or the other as either way would almost immediately take them out of sight round the curving cliff the question was which way as in the absence of footmarks there was nothing to guide him the pro- fessor promptly turned to the right but first glanced over the island as if to make sure neither of them was returning to the station he moved much more rapidly now as if already dissatisfied with the position and having gone some little way and seeing no sign of those he sought he turned not to retrace his steps but to ascend the cliff quickly at the place he then was and again looked over the island he was evidently determined that neither should return to the station without his knowledge seeing no one he walked quickly across without again descending to a point as far on the other side of the place of his descent and looking over the cliff at once saw the two young fellows he called to macrae hearing the call jones looked up saw the pro- fessor and supposing he must be short-sighted an- swered mr macrae is not with us sir we left him at the station the figure above instantly disappeared and if jones could have seen over the cliff edge he would have been astonished to see the burly figure of the professor making a pace for the station-house that he would not have given him credit for before the latter quite gained it he saw through the open door of the signal-room something that seemed further to lend him wings--some one sitting at the signal- table while hughes was sitting outside lieutenant hughes glanced up from his book at the sound of rapid footsteps saw the hurrying figure coming quickly toward him the peculiar something he had before noticed in the eyes again fixed on him was no longer a mere suggestion that left him uncertain if it were real or imaginary it blazed forth he literally shrank upon his chair as the other passed and at the words addressed to him sit where you are be powerless to rise until i give you permission at the sound of the words at that terrible glance all power and volition seemed to ooze from him he found he could not even will to get up from his seat the other had already entered the signal-room he crossed the room toward the signaller's chair macrae was removing the headpiece at the sight the professor paused while macrae rose from his chair as he put down the headpiece and swinging round in contrast to macrae's usual manner with a quick lithe movement instinct with energy come here he said indicating the chair from which he had just risen and speaking in a ringing level tone of assured command the figure before him did not move he looked up their eyes met a violent contest between the opposing powers-- hughes and macrae on the instant of the martian's recognizing his unexpected enemy and that a physical contest alone could decide the mastery his plan was laid it was to wear down his opponent in a fight neu- tralizing his greatly superior strength in one con- tinuous struggle while he was already short of breath through running and playing for all they were worth the points in his own favour youth and agility he sprang forward but was promptly knocked down scarcely seeming to touch the ground with panther-like elasticity he was up again and attack- ing there was no pause or respite in the ferocious struggle that followed it was a fight to kill to and fro the bodies swayed chairs and what- ever happened in the way were hurled aside and smashed the bungalow shook with the impacts of the two bodies the venerian saw his enemy's plan and its danger he regretted too late his race back from the cliff in such haste his endeavour to save the situation threatened now to be the means of his undoing he tried to use his superior physique to smash his opponent once for all while some breath remained but that opponent seemed on all sides of him at once he was like the spirit of a fury in a body of steel wire locked in a momentary hold they hurtled through the doorway past the terrified hughes and the fight was continued in the open the martian knew that he now fought in view of other witnesses his kin far off across the void he fought as a protagonist not for himself alone but for all his race whose existence also depended on the strength of his single arm the knowledge added to an energy already super-human with eyes bulging hughes powerless to inter- vene watched the contest it was the most frenzied duel that had ever been he felt almost physically sick at the sight of a fight where there were neither rules nor respite blows were fast and furious the venerian's hope of a quick decision faded gasping and sobbing for breath he felt the end was near the indomitable invading spirit that had seized macrae's body was driving it to victory but not without paying the price--a price that would have lain macrae himself helpless in the dust macrae wins in the end his science won his superior knowledge of the human frame how obtained who knows he got in a blow on the solar plexus evidently knowing the exact spot of that ganglion and man's champion was down his fight lost station x  the martian knelt over his prostrate opponent and whispering something to him while still in his agony forced his will at last presently the two rose together physically and psychically the conquerer and the conquered the venerian was taken to the wireless operator's chair and he put on the receivers to hughes the mystery of it was insoluble for some minutes he watched the form of the professor and noted how it bore itself erect and with an in- describable and in the circumstances wonderful calm and dignity even in defeat he looked at the dark inscrutable features of him standing over the chair like a tall sinister spirit of evil and for a moment caught a flash from those eyes then the scene quivered and faded before hughes sagging sideways in his seat he fainted a minute later the figure in the operator's chair also wilted seeming about to fall then pulling him- self together somewhat sat up but limply now professor rudge put up trembling hands to re- move the headpiece he found himself in the oper- ator's chair at station x he staggered to his feet and turning round looked into the eyes of the martian chapter xiii the sagitta arrives for one awful moment victory and despair gazed at each other the aura of the martian was rendering his victim powerless to oppose his will he motioned the professor to re-seat himself at the instrument he assisted to put the receivers on the head of the dazed and horror-struck man while doing so his hand faltered and he staggered at the same moment the professor felt as though a weight had been suddenly lifted from his mind as though a spring that had been pressing his will into subservience to another had suddenly snapped he looked up the martian's face was deathly white he tottered in another moment he col- lapsed on the floor the spirit might be dauntless but the human body it had invaded and by which alone it could act on the material plane had for the moment given way under its late ordeal and present burden and fainted the professor rose from his chair and for a mo- ment stood motionless then realizing what had happened hope once more re-asserted itself hughes he shouted come and help me bind this--er--madman before he recovers hughes jumped up with alacrity relieved to find himself free from the inexplicable influence that had bound him he ran for cord and in a few seconds returned the sailor and the scientist made a very thorough and complete job that looked as if it could safely be trusted to defy any efforts on the part of the martian to free himself they then carried him into macrae's room and deposited him on the floor i'll wait here until he comes to said the pro- fessor no doubt you wish to make your report of what has happened as soon as hughes had left the room professor rudge proceeded to gag the martian as effectually as he had bound him he had not made up his mind how much to tell hughes of the real state of affairs he wanted a quiet moment to think he waited until there were signs of returning consciousness they were to be felt as well as seen he then hastily withdrew locking the door behind him he passed into the signal-room and listened to the report hughes was making to the admiralty he made no attempt to interrupt or suggest in any way he wished it to be hughes report made from the view point of his present knowledge while giving half his attention to the report professor rudge was debating with himself how much or little of the true position he should tell hughes finally he decided to tell him all a wireless report to the admiralty in london rudge out of martian influence when hughes had finished sending his mes- sage the professor told him he had something to say he began at the beginning with macrae's first coming to the island and all that had step by step followed professor rudge was prepared for surprise from hughes even for his look of incredulity as he proceeded he saw the surprise heighten and the incredulity disappear when he had finished it was with great satisfac- tion that the professor heard hughes assurance that he would stand by him in any course he might have to adopt even the most drastic even the most drastic--for that was the way his thoughts were tending and now hughes rudge said the question of all others is--what are we to do next hughes was silent not venturing to make a sug- gestion i thought it best said professor rudge to let you make your report before explaining matters it had to be made and for you to have entered on the actual facts as now known to you would have been useless and undesirable the knowledge would have hampered you most certainly it would said hughes if it has to be gone into now said professor rudge it must be by me the question whether to do so or not is worrying me had i known all i know now said hughes i don't know how i should have been able to make a report at all i feel that time should not be lost said the pro- fessor i know what i consider ought to be done but as it entails what the courts would call murder i hesitate to assume the responsibility especially as the sagitta is due it's a good thing that captain evered knows so much about it said hughes he will be the bet- ter prepared for what has happened now i wish he were here said professor rudge i used to think with the venerian's warning ringing in my ears that once i knew the form of danger that threatened then my anxieties would be relieved i never anticipated a situation like this at all events we've got him trussed like a turkey said hughes we're safe for the present professor rudge's anxiety was not lightened by these words a live martian and safety were ideas  amazing stories that did not easily assimilate in the professor's mind i only hope to heaven he said that captain evered will listen to me when he does come and will kill that fiend he'll be sure to make his report first said hughes with conviction by heaven hughes you are right cried the professor if he goes first to the signal-room we are done for that decides me i'll take the bull by the horns and make my own report now if i can get the first lord at the other end he is already half prepared for what i have to tell him should macrae be killed he asked hughes to call up the admiralty and say that professor rudge at station x wished to speak at once to mr mansfield the first lord of the admiralty although the call came two hours before his usual hour for rising in one hour hughes was able to report that mr mansfield was waiting to hear pro- fessor rudge's communication rudge had passed this hour during which dark- ness had descended on station x with a restlessness he could not restrain he went more than once to the door of macrae's room and listened but there was no sound from within thinking this absolute silence might be only while he was listening he walked away and after an interval returned to the door noiselessly still profound silence was the martian dead the professor was not troubling himself about whether or no he had killed the martian the question with him was what was he doing if alive not for a moment did he believe his prisoner dead but although bound quite securely some movement on the floor was possible if he were struggling to be free and although gagged an inarticulate moan could be emitted but there was not a sound the professor once put his hand in his pocket for the key the action recalled the occasion when an- other hand had taken a key from that pocket the memory caused him to desist he went and stood at the star-lit entrance of the station-house he recalled the words of the vener- ian you are not nearly sufficiently in earnest professor rudge would he say the same thing now was the uncomfortable thought perhaps if the venerian were speaking to him now rudge knew in his heart what the advice would be he could in imagination almost hear the venetian's stern words kill kill after a time some impulse prompted him to re- turn and use that key some impulse for he had no clearly defined object in going to the room where the martian lay when macrae's hand had taken a key from that pocket it had been a moment of crisis indeed per- haps not greater than this one in its possibilities the hand was different but the directing mind was the same on the first occasion it had acted from afar now it was perilously near a few seconds later professor rudge was again at the entrance to the signal-room with white face seeking the company of hughes at that moment the message came through that the first lord was at the instrument the professor assumed the headpiece he gave a detailed account of all that had happened at sta- tion x from the time of his arrival down to the time of speaking he reminded mr mansfield of their conversation in london when he had requested per- mission to come with macrae to the station and made sure that the account he then gave of his interviews with macrae resulting in his complete assurance of the latter's bona fides was clearly re- membered by mr mansfield he found that the contents of macrae's diary and the evidence he had given before his examiners at the admiralty was better remembered than he had expected by the first lord professor rudge was satisfied so far and with the fact that mr mansfield seemed a good deal startled at the assertion that a martian was now at station x a being with powers of unknown extent but certainly vastly superhuman he answered a great many questions and ultimately himself asked the plain question if mr mansfield himself ac- cepted the fact of the venerian communication and his rudge's evidence as to the present position how the admiralty took the message the answer was disappointingly non-committal and some further conversation that ensued left professor rudge with the conviction that it would be worse than useless to ask authority for captain evered to hold an inquiry with plenary powers for the martian's execution should the evidence satisfy him of its necessity better make his appeal to captain evered with the question open than meet with a direct refusal binding evered's hands professor rudge left the instrument depressed with the feeling that he had done very little if any good for the ultimate decision had been that captain evered's confirmation and advice must now be awaited the real purpose of his going first to the instrument had not been accomplished mansfield was interested in what he had just heard and in the whole macrae affair as he called it and curious as to the denouement he had suffi- cient knowledge to see that the alleged communica- tion contradicted no law of science knowing that the etheric waves on which wireless depended would travel from the centre of propagation throughout space indefinitely he realized that the reception of a radio message from a neighboring planet was a mere question of the competence of the receiver to detect it as to its having been done in this in- stance he wished to keep an open mind this attitude was to professor rudge as useless as would have been entire incredulity those who were not with him were against him the martian peril had not sufficiently impressed mr mansfield to make him see the need for instant action he lacked the penetration of mind required sitting amid his comfortable surroundings in london he was in- capable of realizing that an event now happening on a remote islet of the pacific could constitute a menace to the whole world this attitude did not prevent him from speculat- ing as to captain evered's account of affairs when he arrived knowing that accident apart this must be within a very few hours he gave instructions before leaving the admiralty radio room that he station x  was to be called so soon as captain evered's arrival at station x was reported as the day passed and he received no call his curiosity deepened into concern by evening he felt the necessity of seeking further information and returned to make inquiries of station x as to the sagitia's whereabouts he knew that the vessel whether delayed or not must for the last twenty- four hours have been within radio signalling dis- tance of the island he gave instructions for station x to be called up after the space of a quarter of an hour he was informed that there was no reply meanwhile at station x as the night wore on neither professor rudge nor hughes could rest sometimes they talked together in the signal-room at others singly or together they paced up and down under the stars never had hours passed so slowly so anxiously as those preceding the arrival of the sagitta they were walking to and fro together outside when the professor said i think perhaps we are better and safer outside the place may not be healthy for us not healthy what do you mean sir said hughes by way of reply professor rudge began to speak on auras emanations of telepathic nature and kin- dred subjects where hughes could follow him only with difficulty the sagitta is at anchor off the island by way of showing you that the things i speak of are not only real but of practical importance for us to remember i will tell you of something i foolishly did while waiting for you to get through to mr mansfield i had been thinking on what the venerian would do if in my place i went to look at our bound enemy i have little doubt now where the thought emanated from i unlocked the door and went in by the starlight i could see the figure on the floor suddenly an influence assailed me attacking my power of will and resistance to impulse in an instant i realized where this must come from and its import only just in time i managed to get outside beyond its range apparently now listen this was the thing the thought if thought it can be called that assailed me in which my own volition in another moment would have been submerged-- if i had remained i should have unbound the martian hughes gasped this was uncanny beyond his weirdest dreams they were still speaking of it as they paced to and fro before the station-house when the signal bell rang it was the sagitta according to the instructions he had received hughes at once proceeded to report the late occur- rences on the island professor rudge then added considerably to the official statement so that by the time the sagitta was near the island captain evered knew everything when the cruiser had anchored captain evered sent a boat and radioed that professor rudge and hughes should come on board with jones and the attendant they at once left the signal-room and hughes gave the necessary orders as they were passing macrae's door their atten- tion was caught by sounds from within as of some- one tumbling violently about the room both had been convinced that no man living could free himself bound as they had left the martian but as they now exchanged a startled glance the same thought struck both--the martian was par- tially unbound they stood as though paralyzed crash the body was precipitated violently against the door at which they were standing panic seized them and they ran for the cliff calling loudly for jones and the attendant to follow them suddenly professor rudge stopped and darted back to the signal-room what he went to do was soon done and he was out again running after hughes when half the distance to the boat had been cov- ered the professor looked over his shoulder no one was visible not even the other two men unaware of the urgency of the call they had not obeyed it with alacrity a few minutes later the professor was tumbling into the boat and the order was given to shove off when near the sagitta a searchlight was thrown in their direction it illuminated their track and the point of the shore from which they had started a figure was plainly visible under its beam stand- ing on the cliff watching them the professor gave one glance it was the martian--free chapter xiv captain evered's decision when professor rudge reached the sa gitta'a deck he found captain evered eagerly awaiting him the professor knew that to convince captain evered of the full meaning of what had happened was of the greatest importance adequate precau- tions and prompt action were vital it was significant that when the searchlight showed up the figure of the martian standing on the cliff he gave orders that as soon as the boat was hoisted on board the sagitta should stand off from the island but the sight of that unbound figure had also suggested to him a flaw in the account he had re- ceived captain evered decided to hear the report of lieutenant hughes first he listened attentively and asked many questions as to the life and mutual harmony or otherwise between professor rudge and macrae while at the station he satisfied himself that there was nothing there that could in any way account for the conflict that had taken place he then sent and asked professor rudge and dr anderson to join them i am very sorry professor rudge he said for the way you have been served but glad that you bear your injuries with so little concern my dear evered said the professor i have no time to think about them no thought for any-  amazing stories thing so trivial in view of the urgency of the matter before us what's to be done asked captain evered i have heard all hughes can tell me you accept then said the professor my ac- count in general of what has happened and of where we now stand it would never occur to me said captain evered to doubt your sincerity or competence to judge of this matter better than any man alive it is a great relief said professor rudge to know that you are with me it was bccause i was certain of you that i first had the matter brought to your notice at first i set it all down as a delusion of macrae's but ander- son converted me are you convinced that it is within the power of these beings to force themselves on human beings and act for their destruction i can speak from experience said the professor that with mutual consent this is within the power of the venerians there is now alas proof that the martians can effect this transference without any such consent of their victim telling the captain of the sagitta the story you mean that it has happened in macrae's case and that his body is now animated by a martian spirit undoubtedly said the professor why asked the captain have they not made us all their victims  because said the professor the first part of the procedure appears to be something in the nature of hypnotism to establish the necessary rapport some channel of communication with the victim must exist in the case of these powerful beings the sound of their voice even on the telephone wire- less or otherwise is sufficient still said captain evered i do not under- stand- i see your point said the professor our secur- ity is this in the normal state our sense of hearing is not acute enough to enable their voice to reach us it is rendered so only in the abnormal state of receptivity set up by previous rapport exist- ing between the speaker and listener and this rapport was established between the martian and macrae- in some way said the professor through the venerian even to his surprise the explanation of that lies far outside our present knowledge of the subject while the method is a mystery we have this isolated instance to prove that one mind can be made a sort of stepping-stone between two others at least when one of them is a martian you consider then said captain evered that this difficulty of initial communication which ap- pears to be our only safeguard is in consequence of the inter-planetary distance only no doubt was the reply you maintain said captain evered that at this moment there is a martian within two or three miles of us and in command of the greatest radio station existing i am glad said professor rudge that you have seen this it is convincing proof that you appre- ciate our peril if the martian were in absolute control of the station x installation we should not now be sitting here after hughes and i had already started to make a bolt thither it flashed across my mind that running would be useless so i rushed back to the signal-room and detached the vacuum tubes from both instruments--and there they are disabling the sending set the professor produced from his pocket the two vacuum tubes and put them on the table they are he added at once indispensable and irreplaceable from any material on the island captain evered looked at rudge with frank ad- miration then after a pause he said i am not going to attempt any communication with station x we'll leave it alone i hope to god its present occupant will leave us alone i think he'll have to said professor rudge well as to that i rely on you said captain evered you remember professor rudge said dr an- derson what the venerian said--that the martian's performance always surpasses anticipation yes said the professor gravely there is no knowing what the martian may be able to do in the way of replacing the lost tubes his chemistry may be capable of transmuting the elements suppose said anderson our wireless operator received a call from station x captain evered looked swiftly from anderson to professor rudge just now said the professor to captain evered you referred to taking measures for the martian's extermination would you take those measures now would you advise a landing party asked cap- tain evered no said the professor the risk is too great the venerian warned me that compared with the martians we are as children further there is this that we have to reckon with there are three men on the island and any one of these may now be the martian the professor's words seemed to bring vividly to his hearers minds the tremendous power and sub- tlety of the enemy but continued the professor you have good guns on board he looked at captain evered they would scarcely do our business so far as the martian is concerned was the reply one of the reasons why this island was chosen is that owing to its contour nothing but the surrounding cliff is visible from the sea perhaps if we had an obser- vation balloon--but we haven't is that your solu- tion professor the guns yes was the reply suppose the martian can replace the missing tubes our only hope is to blow the whole installation to atoms the suggestion seemed rather to stagger the two men for a few seconds captain evered looked at professor rudge without speaking evidently re- volving the idea in his mind well he said at length so far as i am con- cerned i have crossed the rubicon they say one may as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb having taken the responsibility of acting without official authority the only logical course is to follow where- station x  ever it leads after a full minute's silence he added and i'll do it he then left the cabin when he had gone rudge heaved an immense sigh of relief danger still imminent i think anderson he said the world has you to thank for captain evered's present attitude it is due to your having taken advantage of your opportunities that we have not now to convince him of the danger i hope he'll act on your suggestion said ander- son it would be a great relief i don't feel a bit safe as to the martian repairing the damage yes i should be the last said rudge to underrate his powers but without vacuum tubes and i have taken all there can be no radio this is no ordi- nary installation its efficacy consists in the bal- ance of two elements in the vacuum tubes of mutu- ally opposing force mercury and arsenic these and tantalum for the detector tube are abso- lutely indispensable for this instrument which by the way is my own invention neither of the three elements exists on the island so that unless he can create them by transmutation overnight he is powerless yes said anderson again but his tone did not indicate any great conviction so soon as the light of dawn was sufficient the sagitta took up a position off the island to enable her to shell the signal-house and installation gen- erally when her -inch guns had done speaking nothing but the ruin could have remained of the installation of station x while captain evered had been watching the working of the guns he was himself under the ob- servation of anderson who was standing on the cruiser's deck in company with professor rudge the doctor could read his superior's face like a book and note the signs slight as they were of the mental disturbance that the business in hand caused him presently anderson said to his companion the way the chief has risen to the occasion is splendid only one who knows him as well as i do can realize the wrench it must be he knows it must mean court-martial in all probability said professor rudge he will never be called to account for it at all why not asked anderson because if the world escapes the fate that threatens it will be because it accepts our reports and evidence and takes the necessary measures be- fore it's too late if it does not escape--and i am much afraid that is after all the most probable out- come--then there's an end to all of us do you really think that the chances are against us i am afraid they are was the grave reply but we have certainly a fighting chance yet i'm rather surprised at your view said the doctor last night it was i who was most afraid of him your fears said the professor were of what he might do on the material plane you thought he might reinstate wireless overnight i did not think so there are impossibilities even to a mar- tian we know the few material elements he has and that nothing short of transmutation would give him what he requires this reaction is beyond man's power with all the means we can command i did not think that even he could do it overnight in the circumstances you are right said anderson to succeed under such limitations is inconceivable you have however left out the principal limita- tion remarked the professor what the principal limitation queried the doctor discussing the contest to be waged with macrae now a martian time if he does succeed it will be through too much time being given him all depends on our being able to convince our fellow men of the danger that threatens before it is too late but it is on the psychic plane i fear him most if he can attack again there he wins we are powerless to hit back we have only escaped so far by a suc- cession of miracles we have certainly had wonderful luck said anderson yet mark this said the professor although missing his aim every time through some narrow chance he has on each occasion gained something first when macrae was in rapport and conversation with the venerian he reached out in that incom- prehensible way and almost grasped his victim although thrown off he implanted an order that served its purpose later secondly when he actually seized macrae only to meet the venerian he by doing the apparently impossible came face to face with me here again although he just missed suc- cess through physical collapse he progressed he has gained the island and it is we who are turned out he has at last a pied-a-terre where he will be difficult to deal with one more such failure and our ruin will be certain a few minutes after the noise of the guns had ceased captain evered went below without giving the expected sailing orders almost immediately word was brought to professor rudge that he was wanted in the captain's cabin as he entered captain evered said i have done what i have done because i believe the cir- cumstances required it i do not profess that it has been easy if i had had to do with an enemy more--what shall i call it--more obvious and got back shot for shot i should be quite content but this is different i congratulate you on having done a finer thing said professor rudge you have risked every- thing for what you felt to be your duty if we succeed against our terrible enemy humanity will owe its escape and thanks to you at all events said captain evered one step outside precedent appears to call for another i want your approval of what i now propose having done what will be certain to end in a court-martial i want to make for the nearest point where i can report is there any objection to this i thought of it last night said the professor while we were waiting for daylight i knew what continued on page  a columbus of space by  garrett p serviss continued we saw but beyond the fact that the objects were aerial he could learn nothing definite a language of colors of the spectrum as we approached the coast we saw other air- ships heading toward us from various direc- tions we guessed at once that some kind of a greeting was in preparation for the returning ex- plorers but we could never have imagined the mag- nificence which the reception would assume it was not long before our eyes were opened when we were perhaps ten miles off the coast a vast flock of airships seemed to rise like birds from the land in a little while they became in- numerable and it is impossible to depict the beauty of the spectacle which they presented the aerial vessels of our little fleet were all of one type and while they were excellent travelers they were quite unpretending in their build and ornamentation but those that were approaching showed a hundred different shapes and sizes chi- nese kites could not for an instant be compared with some of them in grotesqueness many soared in vast circles at a great height sweeping around and over us like eagles others flanked us on either side and timed their progress with ours still others probably a hundred in num- ber advanced to meet us in a great semicircle where each kept its place with the precision of marching soldiers suddenly at a signal apparently the air was filled with fluttering colors to this day i have never been able to understand how that effect was produced the colors were not on or in the air- ships only but in the atmosphere all about they were exquisite beyond all description it was as if the air had suddenly turned to crystal with a thousand rainbows playing through it their arches constantly shifting and interchang- ing presently from the craft that carried us an- swering shafts of color were shot out then i began to notice that there was a remarkable rhythm in the swift changes i do not know how to describe the impression better than by saying that it was as if a piano or organ should send forth from its keys harmonic vibrations consisting not of concordant sounds but of even more delicately related waves of color the permutations and combinations of the chromatic scale was marvelous the shades of color seemed infinite in their variety and the effect was magical it thrilled us with awe and wonder a threatened collision averted by killing a venustian air pilot that is a language cried edmund they are conversing in this way they have the whole gamut of the spectrum of light at their com- mand and every varying shade speaks to them as musical notes do to us only the meaning conveyed to their minds is as definite as that of spoken words but that cannot be possible i objected it is perfectly possible he replied it simply shows how far they exceed us in the delicacy of their nervous organization soon we were all convinced that edmund was right and that we were looking upon a display of aerial telegraphy more wonderful than that of marconi after a while the fluttering colors ceased to play the communication was evidently ended for the time being most of the airships now turned and circled toward the land escorting us but half a dozen continued to approach and in a few minutes one of them which had got very near and which was moving at great speed sud- denly turned directly upon us i expected to see it come to rest but it kept bearing down with un- diminished velocity by heavens said jack that fellow is going to run us down there was no doubt of it on came the ponderous vessel its prow aimed straight for us and a long projecting beam threatening to rake our little ves- sel like the tongue of a runaway fire-engine there was a momentary excitement among our people surrounded by a fleet of airplanes ala gave an order and a quick attempt was made to alter our course but it was too late ala had advanced near the bow and the projecting beam seemed about to strike her we turned pale with excitement and my heart quailed a tall handsome fellow stood near the prow of the approaching craft and seemed to be making terrible efforts to manage some machinery blank the fool said edmund will he never get out of the way an instant more and a cracking report broke upon the air edmund had fired his automatic rifle the effect was amazing the prow of the ap- proaching airship swerved instantly to one side the threatening beam grazed the shrinking form of ala and she narrowly escaped being thrown over- board but the danger was over in a flash and the craft that had seemed certain to run us down shot harmlessly past our quarter for a few minutes none of us could speak we could hardly think so imminent had been the peril and so instantaneous the deliverance from it at last i found voice edmund i said how in heaven's name did you do it he was as pale as the rest of us but his self- command was perfect to my astonishment there was a tone of deep regret in his voice as he replied  a columbus of space  have i come here only to kill look i have slain another innocent creature it was true for the fellow i have spoken of had dropped at the shot at the very instant when his craft swerved from its course i had to do it edmund continued mastering his emotion he would not get out of the way what do you mean by that cannot you understand-- he began with a little impatience and then added but of course you know nothing about it i knew from my ex- amination of the machinery of this craft that the only way to prevent a collision was to burst a large safety-valve which was directly behind that fellow that would cause the airship to lose way and swerve from its course he ought to have man- aged it himself but he was too stupid or too ex- cited there was nothing for me to do but to send a shot through him into the machinery heaven knows i had to do it or she would have been killed and all of us would probably have gone to the bottom so intense had been the excitement and fear among our companions on account of the impending collision that the report of edmund's shot did not produce the effect that it would otherwise have had but as it echoed up from the sea and reverberated in the sky the other airships hurried in great alarm toward us and soon we were the center of a fluttering crowd which filled the atmosphere like a multitude of butterflies scared up from a roadside puddle then the prismatic language broke forth again and the air for a while was like a crazy-quilt whip- ping in the wind when everything had quieted again there came a great surprise for us it was in some respects the most disheartening episode that had yet oc- curred edmund as you will have understood from what i have just related had unquestionably saved ala and probably all the rest from instant destruction in doing so he had killed a man--for these people can only be spoken of as men and women generally superior in physical beauty to those of the earth but we thought that it should have been evident to everybody that his act was imposed by the neces- sity of the situation one of the terrestial visitants is made prisoner yet instead of thanking him they made him a prisoner on the spot the thing was done so quickly and so unex- pectedly that there was no chance to interfere and before we knew it jack henry and i were sprawl- ing on the floor of the airship each borne down by half a dozen stout fellows any one of whom would have been a match for us in single combat jack tried to draw his pistol the rifle having fallen in the sudden onslaught but it was knocked from his hand before henry and i could attempt to resist edmund called out to us don't try to shoot that's not the way to get out of this depend on me a pretty pickle you've got us into with your wonderful people who are not given to fighting growled jack keep cool edmund replied he was perfectly cool himself although almost choked by those who held him i tell you that we'll get out of this all right but conceal your pistols the rifles they took but i thanked heaven that they didn't know what to do with them i observed edmund smile in his quiet way when he added a moment later addressing jack what's the good of changing your tune so quick a little while ago you were thanking me for bring- ing you here you'll have occasion to thank me again i doubt it grumbled jack henry after his manner said nothing but his thoughts were on his face and i whispered to him for pity's sake remember how these people read us don't look as if you were scared out of your wits brace up and trust to edmund he's brought us out of tighter fixes than this to be continued in the september issue

remaining slab served as the cathode and then mr fosdick calmly locked up the shop and departed for home for a much-needed rest sad state of all the subjects of mr fosdick's experiment it was noon before mr fosdick awoke quickly making up a bundle of soap and towels he has- tened back to the tinshop where he arrived just in time to see the martyr to science slowly crawl out of the plating bath

end station x by  g mcleod winsor continued your wish would be i want you to stay here my action said captain evered has been largely owing to my faith in you i don't see what more i can do here at present but in an affair of this kind i recognize you are the best judge i have reasoned it this way said professor rudge as soon as they find at the admiralty that station x is for some unknown reason cut off and there is no news of the sagitta they will send a cruiser the nearest available to investigate that is to say straight to station x if she gets here all that has been done has been done in vain by the lord harry yes said captain evered but do you see where that leads to it leads to the necessity of our taking counter measures said rudge in other words said captain evered to await that boat's arrival and prevent her if possible by physical force if necessary from carrying out her mission the height of mutiny professor rudge hesitated before replying he thought he detected a suggestion of hesitation in captain evered's tone he confessed to himself that it would be a terrible position for him he therefore decided to avoid if possible following that line of thought for his own part he knew it would be a thousand times justified to sink the whole navy if only by that means mastery was to be gained over this deadly enemy he could not for a mo- ment forget that the fate of the whole world was in the balance if we meet the vessel a considerable distance from the island we may be able to dissuade her com- mander from communicating with the station that gives us at least a chance which leaving now would lose us we cannot afford to lose any chances evered as to what to do if the commander is not amenable to reason we shall have a further oppor- tunity of discussing it we need not decide for the moment very well said captain evered at length so be it professor rudge heaved a sigh of relief thank god he muttered to be concluded in the september issue dr

him and stayed his hand from making an end --he would wait for my return some- how i would solve the problem speaking to the dead vinton he rose and led me to the labora- tory the banked apparatus lined the wall at one end was the figure from which wires and capillary wicks and tubes led outward he strode over and lifted the top of the head so that i saw the gray mass soft within i turned away the wax lid with its well-combed hair closed down i wiped my forehead which was cold and wet murtha put the speaking tube into my hand and i asked hoarsely vin- ton are you in pain what can i do for you the instrument chattered and murtha translated in a low voice thank god you have come he prom- ised to release me now this place is more terrible than you can know set me free kill me or let him kill me now now now now now now murtha's notebook was out and as he spoke he took down the words lat- er i learned that he had there every word the telegraph key had uttered-- the most cruel indictment any man ever wrote of himself he was a scientist still through all the strange workings which through habit he still regarded as his great experiment no emotion could shake him utterly out of his old self the whole thing stunned me i tried to imagine how it would seem to be a disembodied mind apart from the obedient creature of bone and muscle that served me i tried to understand the man whose passion for his work whose curious callousness whose in- herent cruelty--which was it--could let him use this boy so and keep him so it was too much he asks me for thought the ma- chine was saying how can i think he told me before he put me here that in my body i should suffer so that fancy would be impossible i am suf- fering i have suffered so i cannot think he is a devil let him kill me the letters ran together into mean- ingless rattle then i roused at last finish what you started i said kill him he raised his arms over his head as if to ward off my look i will--i will he cried but--that will be murder it was ten times murder to keep him there is it murder he stumbled across the room grasped a laboratory bottle raised the sleek cover of the head and poured the contents in the telegraph key fell silent we looked at each other he walked past me to the laboratory door and then fell into the chair beside the fire- place i followed slowly and sat a long time looking at the flames we were both relaxed he seemed visibly to grow larger stronger now that the fearful load was gone but when next he spoke it was in a whisper and i answered him the same way well--what are you going to do i don't know murtha of course you must be insane- no i'm not he interrupted angrily i should have gone crazy if i hadn't told you--but now i have it is all right i understand what that means--it is a familiar enough psycho- logical phenomenon no one can for- give himself--we have to have help even the strongest but now i am bet- ter i am as sane as you are he was in fact marvelously recovered but murtha--why in god's name did you keep him so long why did you wait for me i wanted a witness to science--a man who knew my work and would vouch for my notes i wanted you to  the talking

looked at me coldly then har- vey i'm not crazy when i did this thing i realized that i was risking my life putting myself on the wrong side of the law when i spoke to you just now i was frantic but i understood none-the-less that i was gambling again with the revenge the herd takes on those who offend its prejudices but if you were afraid to tell the others or to tell me how could i be your witness to science how could it ever be told sooner or later you must suffer for it i hoped you would wait until i die i hoped you would put your name to documents i may outlive you--i may grow greater than you are--but i am one man alone you think i will keep still while you know the rest would bring the law on you i reached across the table and opened his shakespeare to king john you demonstrated scientific- ally once murtha that i am very re- sponsive to appeals where do you suppose my sympathy is in this case but harvey haven't i suffered too haven't i been tormented you deserve it--vinton doesn't and his mother doesn't have you suf- fered more than those two together you are paying her for the boy you killed i wonder if she is pleased with her bargain you don't know what they mean--you have no children - but he was hopelessly hurt can't you understand i sat in silence what was the use of talk i might better go he was crouching over the fire wringing his hands rather horribly was it fear or some worthier anguish who can tell he spoke again is it nothing to you a scientist that i have proved once for all the na- ture of the neural current men a thousand years from now will look back to this work as the final word on the subject harvey- i rose and moved toward the door he was after me half kneeling claw- ing at me harvey--you won't take --any--action- i shook him off and went out the last i saw of him was a wild figure his whole body quivering in silhouette against the light of the open door the papers told how he was found next morning the end he used to belong to our crowd he's the only one of the old gang who made good that's bob thompson sales manager for fink amp snyder they say he makes  a year yet it hasn't been long since he wasn't making more than  a week i know because he used to belong to our crowd there were six of us and there was hardly a night that we didn't bowl or shoot pool or play cards together lots of times we would sit down and talk about earning more money but that's all it ever amounted to--talk bob was the only one who really did anything i'm through wasting my spare time like this he said one night i'm going to take up a course with the international correspondence schools and try to make something of myself before it is too late we didn't see much of bob after that--he'd al- ways laugh and say he was too busy
