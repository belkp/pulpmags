always stood or sat thus facing doors windows people vivid in his memory was the scene in jerry lewis's saloon deadwood gulch when wild bill hickok lay with his cheek in his own gore because for once wild bill had exposed his back to a door the rear-entrance of jerry's tom hallock had been a gangling kid then tending bar at rush time sweep- ing and doing odd jobs most of the time and the rest which he had to himself he spent in worshipping the tamer of abilene and practicing with a six- shooter he aspired to expert gunman- ship wild bill his pattern though the fact was unknown to hickok

one of his bullets wild bill hickok would remain his pattern until his first killing sent him forever on the dodge young tom hallock would count colt-speed king and choose for his saddlemates only those hellions who lived by the gun mastered the handling of one until he saw a man die from one of his bullets a center shot and a fair enough killing according to frontier code that is he gave his opponent an even break the dead man had been a half-baked des- perado and his demise was no loss to the community nor was that of his two friends whose toes the trigger-ex- pert youth turned up when they essayed an eye for an eye but the triple kill- ing had sent tom on the dodge regret- ting his notches rather than glorying in them he had anticipated a feeling of elation out-triggering men who lived by the gun and was disappointed trigger men born with gun-magic   two-gun western novels magazine conscience was a pestiferous thing but gradually it hardened and the number of his victims mounted and his guns became as much a part of him as his hands now at thirty he found him- self haunted with faces of the past some blurred by time but none of them missing from his mental gallery of necessity he lived where the law could not reach or was farcically represented derringer montana was a hotbed of desperadoism it had tamed down not a peg since it appeared on the time- tables of the northern pacific yet even in the midst of men as law-shy as himself hallock must be eternally vigi- lant for like a champion of whatever there were plenty who would kill him for the notoriety it would bring them there was an if as always--if they could get the edge and remembering the lesson taught by the passing of bill hickok he was ever alert in the pres- ence of his fellow men with one excep- tion the exception entered the elkhorn at that moment looking for hallock hallock who had not been tom for ten years but hair-trigger a two- handed gunfighter who had put the art in artillery and daily cursed the fame that would not let him act the normal man stranger just got off'n the west- bound an headin this way looks like he might be a law-dog no hardware showin thus spoke the exception otherwise reckless brule in the ear of hallock the northern pacific station was catty-cornered across the street from the elkhorn saloon and brule had been occupying a chair on the stoop of the latter whenever a train stopped or the old concord swung in from the back country passengers who alighted were accorded careful scrutiny by the gun- toting tribe of derringer the latest town marshal had joined his predeces- sors in boot hill but a week since-- though not by the hand of hallock-- and the minds of derringer's denizens were temporarily warped with unusual suspicion of unfamiliar faces any time the sheriff of missoula county might take it into his head to clean up either come himself or send a deputy therefore reckless brule was moved to warn his pal who had a longer rec- ord of killings than any derringer gun- slinger albeit cleaner killings standing together at the bar the two presented a strange contrast hallock taller by two inches than brule was wide-shouldered lean- flanked with frosty eyes aquiline nose and thin lips featuring a smooth- shaven face the color of redwood he was crowned by a grey stetson knocked into a denver poke the loose ends of the raw hide chin-strap dangling over the knot of his bandanna wore plain leather riding-cuffs thong-laced shirt and fringed leather chaps stood up in the inevitable cowboy boots crossed belts supported his ordnance two hol- stered colt's equalizers brule nick- named reckless by the man he had thrown in with because reckless of the hazard linked to the association was gorilla-like in form and so bow-legged he appeared to be hairpinning the bar- rel of a horse even when walking hair and beard were fiery red and of luxu- riant growth a battered short- brimmed stetson tilted over one ear his forearms were bare his greasy vest flapped open his trousers worn out- side his boots were rolled up several inches above the ankle a grotesque figure this brule but a cross-arm draw artist and steel-true to the man he called pal at brule's whispered information hallock nodded and his lips tightened the gorilla-man oozed away from his side and took spraddled stand near the when a texas town goes gun-crazy  door covering his purpose of watching by digging up a blackened briar and filling it other bad men were in the room lesser lights in the triggerfinger four hundred but only one paid par- ticular heed to brule's trip to the bar this hombre leaned on the mahogany ten paces from hallock he was a cow- puncher gone bad and no halfway about it the disease known as trigger- fingeritis had struck into his vitals and from drifting about tough camps and avoiding the open his once tanned vis- age had begotten a pallor which was the derivative of the name chalk gallatin chalk fostered the hope of being pointed out as the gunpacker who had cut a notch for hair-trigger hallock hair-trigger apparently did not no- tic when a quiet-looking stranger som- breroed and booted the one who had dropped off the northern pacific and made a bee-line for the elkhorn strode in and ranged himself suspiciously near the gunfighter hallock's eyes nar- rowed the newcomer nominated his pizen and when the bartender turned to the back-bar shot a glance to the left in which direction stood chalk gallatin presenting his profile clink- ing of bottle and glass as they slid across the bar drew the stranger's gaze to the front again the rotgut he poured between bearded lips made him shiver as he set down the glass he looked to the right realizing hallock was staring hard at him before the stranger could wink hair-trigger had conjured a blue-barreled gun against his ribs yuh lookin for anybody mister bluntly inquired hallock no replied the other visibly rat- tled and instantly raising hands shoul- der-high but he added after the briefest pause fascinated eyes on the muzzling gun i'd part with fifty bucks to know where the shootin-iron come from the trick's priceless replied hal- lock grimly if i sold it to yuh i might go to boot hill sooner'n i aim to stranger i'll hafta disbelieve you're not out gunnin till i've pawed yuh over hallock took no man's word but brule's and still holding the drop frisked the stranger's person seeking a weapon--and a badge in search of the latter he turned back the lapels of the man's coat pulled open outing shirt and undershirt button up hair-trigger grunted finally and holstering his six-shooter stepped back drink on me pilgrim to show there's no hard feelin's i can see i'm off my range consid- erable said the pilgrim hardly re- assured by the company he was in i won't linger after i've drank to yuhr health--an hired a hoss i meant to ask where i could get one ridin to look over the two bar ranch hallock mentioned a livery-stable on main street the stranger looked at the two-gun man over the rim of his glass then wheeled to de- part throwing a second glance at chalk gallatin whose face was still averted halfway across the saloon floor the prospective ranch-buyer was halted by the vibrant voice of hallock and turned nervously a word of advice pilgrim take it or leave it droned hair-trigger git heeled if yuh figger to reach the two bar healthy she's not a peaceful trail out thataway thanks just as much returned the other forcing a faint smile but i'm slow on the pull an i reckon i won't invite attack if it's apparent i'm not packing iron will show i've got nothin worth defendin for instance yuh wouldn't believed i wasn't on the shoot if yuh'd found a gun on me tell yuh friend those who live by the trigger--  two-gun western novels magazine but i wouldn't want yuh should get mad at me so i won't say no more a fool has got to go his pace an find declared hallock then under his breath as the stranger exited talks like a preacher not a rancher but hair-trigger was uncomfortably impressed to date the only law that he recognized was that which rests in a holster he lounged over to reckless brule who with his head out the door was watching to see that the stranger laid a course for the livery stable what yuh think o his sentiments reckless inquired hallock who val- ued the gorilla-man's opinion huh brule drew in his head and turned on hair-trigger jerking up his flaming beard with a one-sided facial twist betokening disgust hell too pure for this world a bebbe will hold him up some day--an buzzards pick his bones tain't tame enough for the gol'ding roole this montanny he snorted letting his beard fall neither saw the sneer on the face of chalk gallatin bad cowpuncher who was hoping the man bound for the two bar had a defective memory for faces i dunno reckless if yuh're right or not--an it's the first time said hair-trigger and retired to his corner at the end of the bar the redhead gazed after him so muddled and amazed that he opened his jaws and his pipe dropped no savvy he grunted and recovering his pipe went out and flopped in the chair on the stoop chalk gallatin swaggered very short- ly from the elkhorn and paused by brule's chair to ask sotto voce hair- trigger talked kinda queer didn't he losin his nerve yuh reckon i've heard tell gun-fighters do some-- looket here brule's eyes blazed up into the pale face of the ex-cow- boy yuh be damn shore he's lost it yuh dehorned spawn of a maverick afore yuh stand up to him he knows yuh're stalkin him that yuh'd like the glory o posin as his killer but don't make no fatal mistake he's got a mood on like he gits sometimes but his triggerfinger's iled yuh betche the twist of chalk's lips was a fail- ure as a smile he lifted his head at the clipclop of hoofs saw the stranger off the northern pacific riding down the street from the direction of the livery stable and promptly turned his back until the other had gone by brule glanced at chalk from under his shaggy red brows he made a mental note to tell hallock of the incident there goes a shorthorn what's due to impede a forty-five slug afore he's many weeks older brule made a bet with himself as chalk left the stoop and rolled up street scarcely did he realize how far-sighted he was--and at the same time short-sighted chapter ii he kills his pal deckless brule thought he would go to bed he sat on the edge of his bunk in the shack he occu- pied with hallock several doors above the elkhorn bar and listened to a harangue on laziness from the tall gun- man standing in front of him which yuh've done nothin but hold down a chair on the elkhorn stoop all day reckless declared hallock hook- ing thumbs in his belts cash is gettin low an we need ammunition for our stummicks if not our guns-- wal said brule with a grin why don'tcha go out an shoot somebody there's that gunnin job the ox bow foreman wanted yuh-- yuh think ag'in advised hair-trig- when a texas town goes gun-crazy  ger his brow darkening slightly yuh know that squatter on the ox bowland had a family an i ain't gunnin no family men uh course yuh ain't kiddin that's all but honest to hell trigger i'd ruther turn in than set in the five fellers that rode in at sun- down was the train robbers that held up the great northern two weeks back an they got rolls an want action for em so yuh told me repeatin yuhself trigger but i ain't gonna fall yuh hop along an clean em with the help o god an a few brains he had his vest off and his flannel shirt began to pull at his boots get ondressed in the dark then for revenge hallock blew out the lamp on the table yuh'll be jealous when yuh see my pockets bulgin tomorrer mornin fireface an yuh'll be hongry but i won't--yeh mebbe i'll start yuh to breakfast reckless yuhr too slow to grow fast hair-trigger was chuck- ling his nearest approach to a laugh as he opened the shack door a hearty so-long an luck followed him from the darkness as he shut the door an hour from the time he bought chips in the draw session at the elk- horn with the five train robbers hal- lock arose cleaned to his last dollar another man took his place and the crestfallen gun-fighter swallowed two fingers of whisky at the bar now pre- sided over by the owner himself sam brace and walked out as he emerged on the stoop the dim moving outline of a man almost abreast of the hitch- rack drove all thought of his flat state from his mind coming from the lamp glare of the elkhorn into the comparative darkness of the starlit out- doors hallock did not recognize the figure a word from either would have prevented tragedy but neither spoke it the man in the street forgetting that hallock's sight could trick him in the circumstances hallock saw the man's hand drop toward his waistline one of the notoriety-seekers possibly chalk gallatin who had not been in the saloon that evening flashed through the gun- fighter's brain and he acted simultane- ous with the thought throwing his right-hand gun with deadly accuracy the figure sank soundlessly the smoking tube in his hand hal- lock leaped off the stoop and warily approached the heap on the ground hardly expecting it to move for he knew about where the bullet had hit but cautious none the less eyes by now more accustomed to the semi-dark he stooped a wild curse escaped his lips cold sweat oozed from every pore --the still face turned up to the stars was that of his one and only friend reckless brule a hole drilled almost in the center of his forehead horror and revulsion gnawing at his heart for the first time in his life and realizing that nothing could be done that death was instantaneous hallock happened to glance at one out-flung arm of his dead pal and discovered clutched in the fingers a handkerchief was pullin his bandanna--an i reckoned he was mebbe gallatin aim- in to fan a gun on me  exclaimed hal- lock stricken deeper goddelmighty he must've changed his mind about sleepin an was cornin to help me clean the train robbers if he'd only spoke--or i hadn't been so damned quick old hand lifting the head of brule to his knee believe me i didn't know it was yuh i wish i was in yuhr boots this minit he pressed the head to his chest and rocked on his heels in silent agony then he lifted to his feet heaved the heavy lifeless body across his shoulder and carried it up the stoop and into the well-lighted elkhorn sam brace and  two-gun western novels magazine several loungers who had drifted to- ward the door as the shot boomed out drew back as hallock entered with his burden the card players had given no attention to the shot because gun- play was such a common occurrence in derringer as a rule no citizen moved any faster when one or more guns tuned up in main street unless he chanced to be in the line of fire it was a gun- toting town however the entrance of hair-trigger hallock muttering like a wild man drew even the gaze of the poker-playing train robbers and the groups at two other card tables hal- lock eased the body of reckless upon the bar-top directly in the rays of a lamp and tossing his hat on the floor as if its weight oppressed him faced the incredulous staring groups of men the card games were suspended he was the focus of all eyes that shot yuh heard killed reckless --i killed my pal hallock shouted beside himself with grief the slow-draw pilgrim which oozed in here to-day shy artillery was right --i'm the fool that had to go his pace an find if i wasn't always packin guns an bein so free with em trouble wouldn't be alia time campin on my trail makin me watch sharp day an night--i wouldn't have shot so quick an sayin nothin mistakin reckless in the dark for someun lookin to cut a notch for me reachin for his hanker he held up the bandanna an i thought it was a gun he was after chalk galla- tin i figgered it might be--he's been honin for my hair he paused to draw breath his eyes roving from face to face as if seeking relief his hands clenching and opening truly displaying more emotion than anyone would have imagined was in him he had been looked upon always as a ruthless silent nerveless man-killing machine to hell with hardware an gun-slingin he cried suddenly i'm done and with frenzied haste unbuckled his gun belts and piled them on the bar beside brule's remains instantly to an accompanying hiss of intaken breaths as his several ene- mies present realized the lion had shorn himself of teeth and claws hands darted to gun-grips hallock self-disarmed and likely to pay the penalty for an un- guarded moment did not cringe in- stead contempt and anger boiled up in him evident in the blaze of his eyes the puffing of his lips he shook a hard fist damn yuh for yellow-spined skulk- ers he roared you wouldn't dast make that handplay if i was packin iron they hesitated all but one with fin- gers resting on walnut butts that one blackfoot dixon quarter-breed side-kick of chalk gallatin had half drawn the colt from his holster but an invisible hand seemed to prevent him getting it clear of the leather his gun arm was rigid yuh blackfoot yuh aimin to cheat yuhr pal chalk o the glory o salivatin me why don'tcha draw injun hallock's tone should have precipitated action on the quarter- breeds part but it didn't and he was not alone in his frozen state hallock dominated them as much without his guns as with them one man display- ing a proper fearlessness may out-face several more easily than he can a single opponent hallock continued on a contemptu- ous note as furtive glances were ex- changed among the hesitant bidders for fame he was a man to tie to was reckless--of yuh all he was the only one would risk stickin by me an to think i give him his ticket it's a curse on me for the bloody record i've been settin up that's what it is an i hate to let reckless go on in the dark alone he'd never let me take any trail when a texas town goes gun-crazy  lonesome--always to hand joggin at my elbow ready to back me in whatever go ahead--shoot somebody yuh'll be savin me a hull lot o hell on earth if i'm with reckless i won't mind so much for i can tell him i made a damn fool mistake hallock surveyed them one after an- other with a taunting expression wait- ing for the shots he would welcome to come but they did not he was to be denied even the solace of forgetful death every tail curled he pronounced acidly not a thoroughbred among yuh with the guts to send me along o reckless here's your chance to join reck- less yuh don't have to ask me twice chalk gallatin stepped from the outer darkness into the saloon with the utter- ance his six-shooter lined from the hip it threw a long tongue of flame with a cannon-like noise as hallock turned toward the door the gunfighter stared with filming eyes at the evil leering face of chalk did not look at the smoking gun at all no sound passed his set lips as his knees gave way a moment he supported himself on outflung hands battling with the lead in his system then with a sigh stretched out on the floor well he asked for it didn't he chalk snarled at the stony-faced men annoyed at their silence when he had expected vociferous applause yeh he asked for it nodded black- foot dixon and he was the only one who spoke others had paralyzed bazoos black- foot observed chalk and with swag- ger more pronounced than ever ap- proached the bad he laid a hand on hallock's discarded forty-fives and belts bein i'm the only man had nerve enough to cash him boasted chalk half-turning toward the men i reckon i win the right to wear his flame-throwers-- take your hands off those guns a girl's voice issued the command chalk gallatin more startled than if a man had spoken jerked his head the other way none had noticed the en- trance by the door to a back room of sam brace's daughter sue almost twenty she was the amazon type not much under six feet splendidly pro- portioned her dark hair which she could sit upon when unconfined was parted in the middle and in thick plaits coiled around her head features irreg- ular and handsome rather than beauti- ful looks and build were her moth- er's a pioneer woman for her father was stocky but broad-shouldered she had the courage of both and was bal- ancing sam's sawed-off as expertly as any man in the bar-room chalk wilted at sight of her and not only because of the shot-gun trained on his heart if he was capable of loving anyone besides himself that other was sue brace sue said chalk yuh tells me to hands off an i obeys but nobody only yuh-- anybody with a grain of sand in his craw could back you down chalk gal- latin interrupted the girl scornfully you can shoot from behind and from cover and your talk is bigger than a dozen men but it's just noise--that's the size of you think of you facing hallock if he'd had a gun-- that moment hair-trigger stirred slightly and groaned chalk's hand flew to his pistol- holster not dead  he exclaimed stepping back and looking down at the gunfighter sue brace breathed something which sounded very much like thank god then lifted the shotgun for a fuller bead on the hell-bent puncher just you dare to draw she whipped forth  two-gun western novels magazine take a chance with this shotgun if you dare  chalk's lips curled back he had flushed through his white skin at her scathing arraignment now the pallor returned intensified not fear--though he knew she would execute her threat if he did not take heed--but white fury born of jealousy her defence of the helpless two-gun man would have been evidence enough to stake the fires of that poisonous emotion without chalk hearing in addition what she said un- der her breath the expression of his eyes was abysmal it looked for a mo- ment as if in spite of the twin barrels chalk would draw and extinguish that remaining spark in hallock but the ex-cowboy's passion did not overmaster him to the point of recklessness he loved his entirely worthless life first of all and relinquished his gun-grip dis- trustful of him even then sue brace maintained her drop and called to her father who had viewed her interference with a proud parental eye pa you heard hallock maybe doc bennison can do something for him take him up to my room while  keep this glory-hunter lined no sooner said than done sister sam brace moved quickly suiting ac- tion to his words hallock was a dead weight and no slight one but the sturdy saloonkeeper managed to shift him on his back and with the daughter cover- ing his retreat staggered to the stair- way at one end of the barroom when sam had passed up out of sight sue placed the sawed-off on the bar to show you chalk gallatin she said that i'm not afraid for myself only afraid you might finish the cow- ard's job you started before  could daylight you yuh'd shoot me--to save hallock gallatin's rage-inflamed eyes burned into hers in a minute she replied in a tone that admitted of no possible doubt her chin high if i'd had that gun handy when you stepped through the door you'd never have unhooked a shot at hallock hallock's shouting brought me out of the back room and while i was listening you-- don't you feel low- down chalk gallatin yuh--yuh sputtered chalk ad- vancing on her a step like that hal- lock like i love him sue amended unblushingly chalk had nothing to say the dec- laration had the effect of a gun-barrel smashing him between the eyes he shot the girl one sinister look then jingled to the bar and poured himself a drink and drink after drink sam brace came down the stairs and over to sue's side heart's beatin faint--but mighty faint he informed in a whisper that was loud enough for every ear in the silent barroom to catch you get doc bennison pa di- rected sue and i'll go and stay with hallock she gathered up hair-trig- ger's heavy belts with the dangling hol- sters supposin doc's jiggered hesitated sam and added he bought a quart o scotch s mornin you try him pa if you can't bring him i will the amazon started for the stairs clasping hallock's artillery to her breast sam wheeled and vanished through the front door chuckling that daugh- ter of his was a royal straight flush-- you met one of her kind in a lifetime all belly up commanded chalk gallatin who had not lifted his gaze from the bar while sue remained in the room ensued a concerted movement to- ward the mahogany the bottle slid from hand to hand no word was spo- when a texas town goes gun-crazy  ken ten minutes went by and in came sam brace followed by a big unkempt red-faced man in rusty clothes doc bennison whose medi- cal and surgical skill was only equaled by his appetite for whisky he would have been celebrated had he not sold john barleycorn his rights to a name just now he was in an unusual state-- sober upstairs doc--first room to the right sue's said sam going around behind the bar if yuh boys has killed off that quart by this time addressing the bar flies i'll just collect the price from yuh chalk and chalk thrust a bill at him with- out a murmur sam's shotgun lay handy the saloonkeeper made change saw chalk pocket it then watched through lowered lids while gallatin fished a horn-handled clasp knife from another pocket opened the blade and drawing his six-shooter deliberately cut a deep nick in the walnut grip of the gun bennison was upstairs more than an hour and all that time chalk gallatin hung against the bar neither drinking nor talking just so much liquor si- lenced him made him to a degree dan- gerous despite his yellow streak the others including blackfoot dixon played cards half-heartedly at two tables they were waiting chalk was waiting finally came the slovenly doctor carrying his worn medicine- case he got abreast of chalk and the cowboy put forth an arresting hand and broke his silence will he live doc bennison's whisky-red face deep- ened in its ruddy hue i think so certainly husky maverick i got the bullet out glanced off a rib smashed the rib but it saved his life don't mean to tell me you did it it's better yuh let him die doc was the way gallatin answered his sullen

the bed but you didn't mean to do it it was a sorry accident and guess as much brule's fault as yours i heard you tell about it that night she did not al- lude to her part in the violent drama  two-gun western novels magazine nor of course to her confession before the elkhorn's patrons i'm goin to live am i spite o chalk's bullet his question was fraught with no especial interest he was blind to the warmth in sue's fine eyes now as he had been blind all along preoccupied with his notches and the first law of nature to the exclusion almost of all else doc bennison says you'll be fine as split silk just as good as ever he removed the bullet but don't talk any more now trigger sleep if you can rest anyway all right though i wouldn't have a kick cornin if i cashed livin without

came back rapidly sam brace dropped in on him two or three times a day and smoked a pipe while hallock rolled his own say sam said the gunfighter propped up on pillows one afternoon a week from the time he began to con- valesce i'm runnin up some bills with yuh an the doc an i dunno how i'm goin to pay em i'm done with gun-slingin that's one shore thing an it's the only business i ever follered how to make some honest coin is pes- terin-- yuh let me an doc worry about money trigger sam interrupted an if yuh mention bills ag'in i'll knock your block off bein's yuh're helpless if i can't do my

i says son-in-law an yuh goes into the air like yuh'd set on prickly pears what's the matter don't yuh want sue--or what is it he was a trifle huffed why shore i want--but great guns i never reckoned-- then hallock sank back and was briefly silent i know now why she looks at me so--so funny sometimes funny huh so that's the way it struck yuh sam chuckled his anger fled trigger i know yuh're a dinger in a fight but suspicion yuh're a pore lover--huh uh-huh but sam i never tangled much with women tangled with one now all right yuh been nursed by sue more'n a week an didn't wise up

well mebbe yuh are excusable on them grounds but it's plumb fact yuh should've heard her tell that gal- latin right before blackfoot an the rest the night yuh kil--was gunned yessir to their faces an straight from the shoulder what'd she say sam relighted his pipe before answer- ing yuh ask her trigger it was shore plain enough an set chalk most crazy he's been hangin round her yuh savvy but couldn't p'int in anywheres seems yuh ain't knowin nothin about what happened that night when a texas town goes gun-crazy  after chalk plugged yuh it'll be in- terestin tellin and he related all the facts i feel different tonight sue re- marked the gunfighter that evening when his nurse brought supper on a large tray different worse she set the tray on a chair beside his bed and scanned him with anxious eyes no'm that is nothin's worse but my heart that is right bad she was instantly relieved by his quizzical expression and at the same time his words quickened the beat of her pulse it had been so like a game of blind-harry trying to show this iron- and-granite man she cared and to what extent she cared but the bandage seemed to have slipped off she came slowly closer lips parted hallock was sitting up he reached for and captured her hand drew her down beside him on the bed sue he said eye to eye with her forgive me for makin it so hard for yuh but what could yuh expect of a man whose mind was twisted with thinkin murder allatime--professional gunfightin is just that even when yuh give yuhr marked man a show like i always done i wasn't driven into my first gunnin like some--i did it delib- erate because i was crazy about guns an honed to imitate wild bill hickok who used to hang in a saloon where i worked down at deadwood had nat- ural ability i reckon an improved it with practice my first killin didn't make me feel like i thought it would high-chinned--but i'd made a begin- nin an had to go on an with the tough rep i've got now i couldn't figger that a girl like yuh-- but it's the truth his grip on her hand tightened yuh're the first girl i ever looked at twice seein yuh when i first hit this town i said to myself she's the woman i might've loved but she ain't for me with my blood-stained hands  you said that sue's face dropped closer listen trigger-- tom's my name he inserted though nobody's called me by it for a long time tom i want to say that i hate bloodshed as much as the next woman and killing for hire is one of the mean- est professions on the frontier--mur- der just as you said but a certain amount of killing not for money has been necessary to tame this west and i realize it and am not squeamish now that sounds strange perhaps coming from a woman but my mother crossed the plains in a covered wagon which was twice attacked by indians my father ran a saloon in nevada min- ing camps before he came here and in his younger days was reckoned handy with a shooter your blood-stained hands tom i don't approve of but-- i just don't see them  he marveled speechless if i'd half-guessed i'd spoken sooner sue he said at last leaning toward her which brought their faces very close together but what had-- what have i to offer yuh except a name for quick-gunnin-- is that all tom she smiled with provocative eyes provocative lips no he tensed not all i love yuh sue his kiss burned and lingered on her firm full mouth and she gave back with a passionateness that made him heady she struggled for release to get her breath his sinewy arms fell lax and he remarked i'm no great shakes of a lover sue but i reckon yuh know i mean it you don't realize your ferocity mister man she laughed i did once doubt i thought you could be nothing but a cold-blooded killing-machine you seemed to shun me you never more  two-gun western novels magazine than passed the time of day with me i thought you were too blind too cal- lous ever to see that i loved you--or that you didn't care and i couldn't throw myself straight at your head doubt gone he asked still struck with the wonder of woman entirely when i spoke the other day of brule having been one friend but not the only one what held you back tom didn't you understand thought i did but wasn't shore couldn't believe it just couldn't hardly can now wonderful sue i wanted to die last week hopin to catch up with reckless on the long trail an tell him i didn't do it a-purpose now i want to live--what man wouldn't knowin yuh loved him she beamed happily then sobered i know you loved reckless man and man it was a sad mistake she sym- pathized it cured me o gunfightin he vowed he turned half-around and pointed to the cartridge-belts and hol- stered guns hanging on the bedpost above him yuh can take those irons an junk em sue i'll never put em on ag'in never her gaze followed his pointing finger and for several moments she was silent the pause surprised him don'tcha want me to quit-- he asked certainly she interrupted hastily you must start all over put your past behind and live it down but listen tom while you're in this town you are practically surrounded by enemies not the least of them--though he is a coward--chalk gallatin he's jealous of your reputation he'd do any under- handed thing to be able to swagger and pose as the man who killed you and not only that he has made advances to me honorable enough but i've al- ways repulsed him detested him he knows that i love you for i told him-- hallock did not mention that her father had informed him previously--and it gives him two reasons for jealousy two killing reasons he's that kind you know it as well as i do hallock nodded and caressed his stubbly chin thoughtfully yuh think as long as i stay in derringer i got to pack my guns or he'll down me i know it leave as soon as you can--i don't mean run away--and i will go with you anytime anywhere could reckless brule have said more he couldn't it sounds like reck- less the gunfighter caught up one strong white hand and pressed it to his lips and tom said sue earnestly don't forget that gallatin isn't your only enemy he's the worst perhaps but blackfoot dixon is another and coldiron mcclintock--oh there must be a dozen more than that fellers that don't come into the elkhorn an i ain't over- lookin one of em replied hallock grimly an yuh're plumb correct sue--i got to tote iron much as i'm hatin to till we've shook the dust o derringer i wouldn't let myself get laid low for nothin now girl can't hardly believe my luck droppin my rope on yuh she tossed her head you can be- lieve a fact mister man her eyes fell on the tray there's your supper getting cold let me go now draw- ing away her hand and feed up she placed the tray across his knees in the act of lifting a cup of coffee he paused and set it down again un- tasted sue he said yuh won't mind if i ask yuh somethin no indeed what is it she won- dered his manner was so different why where at he proceeded slowly did yuh learn to sling language the way yuh do yuh're eddicated when a texas town goes gun-crazy  yuh don't talk none like other frontier girls leastways the ones i've seen oh she laughed mother had schooling and she taught me some then i went to a little log schoolhouse in nevada there's no great mystery about that--why hallock swung his head from side to side me a gun-throwin hellion no good whatever to nobody no looks no money never been inside a schoolhouse --an the likes o yuh takes to me that's the mystery girl but he added quickly i ain't goin to pry into it none chapter iv woman's skirts between two days later hallock was out of bed and able to walk within the confiines of sue's room when he tired of pacing up and down he would sit near the open window well back from it so that he could not be seen by anyone in the street yet could himself see from a certain angle it was by advice of sue brace that he took this precaution she argued the prud- ence of not letting his enemies know he was on his feet again until his strength had fully returned and his wound en- tirely healed and hallock readily acted upon this advice seeing that it was good the lips of sam brace and sue and doc bennison the only three who saw him were sealed regarding his progress toward recovery that night despite his caution dur- ing the day hallock was guilty of such negligence as nearly cost him his life after all when dusk descended on derringer he pulled down the window- shade and lighted the gas he had eaten but was reluctant to go back to bed his old vitality had reasserted it- self and he was doing nothing to use up the excess of energy therefore he glared at the bed which had befriended him in time of need and fell to walking from wall to wall incidentally passing so close to the window that his shadow was thrown upon the shade this fact he absent-mindedly overlooked he had drawn the shade for the purpose of cheating hostile eyes in main street but could not have exposed himself more dangerously had he left it rolled up his mind was traveling most plea- sant paths all revolving about sue brace when a colt banged in the street and ripping through the shade a forty- five slug burned across his forehead and smashed into the thin wall opposite the window hallock sprang backward startled dashing the sudden outpouring of blood from his eyes his wits collected in an instant he leaped toward the gas-jet and snapped off the light then spring- ing by the window spurred to haste by the thought that another bullet might be launched upon the heels of the first he slid a gun from one of the scabbards on the bed-post the familiar feel of the gun-grip caused his blood to surge with the old fighting lust notwith- standing his renouncement of gunplay he could not conquer in a moment an instinct he had catered to fostered to perfection for years sliding back to the window he dropped to his knees and lifted one side of the shade care- fully his view was much restricted seeing none on the visible section of sidewalk opposite--the height at which the bullet had passed through the shade had told him at a glance from whence it came--hallock crawled around to the other side and repeated the cir- cumspect performance of peeping but not the sign of a human being could he see to train his gun on scared he muttered figgered he'd missed when the light went out so  two-gun western novels magazine sudden near fooled myself to death that time forgot about my shadder he turned at the swift opening of the door to his darkened room it was sue a light in the hall revealed mak- ing out his form crouched down by the window she imagined with a cold thrill of horror that the shot from the street had accomplished its treacherous pur- pose my god she exclaimed for once in her life on the verge of fainting oh i ain't hurt none sue hal- lock's voice revived her sinking senses that is he amended laughing as he got up and crossed to the unsteady figure i got my eyebrows singed an was lucky at that why yuh're tremb- lin sue one arm was around her  tain't like yuh girl to bust up over a li'l thing like that but--but she stammered pretty close to tears from the reaction i thought they had got you born to be a bridegroom yet he reassured her and kissed her cool cheek she noticed a suspicious mois- ture on her face from contact with his you said your eyebrows were singed that one of your jokes tom let me see them come over here un- der the light away from that window how did they come to see you you know i warned-- yes yes but i slipped up he told her how while following her to the dther side of the room when by gaslight she saw his en- saguined visage sue was stricken again with apprehension but when she had brought a basin of water and washed away the blood found to her relief that a strip of courtplaster would answer as a bandage yuh got any idea sue who the shootin galoot was hair-trigger asked while she was applying the court-plaster i make a guess it was chalk but wouldn't bet high on it there bein others like him it wasn't chalk he was at the bar when the shot was fired she replied i ran out of the back room when i heard it and there he was just pouring himself a drink so that lets him out but blackfoot dixon wasn't there nor coldiron mcclintock -- take your choice an i could guess len roper an a few more names mebbe before i hit it pa must have thought your window was the target for he was over by the front door he called as i came in i don't see anyone better go upstairs i was already heading that way here's pa now pa she half-turned as sam brace admitted himself this man of mine nearly scared the wits out of me but he's all right barring a scratch sam chuckled as he came forward bet trigger ain't never been so babied be- fore in his life how about it trigger i like it doggone it hallock swiftly defended his nurse and him- self sam yuh'd enjoy gettin hurt if yuh was younger an somebody like sue-- shore i'd enjoy it don't blame yuh a-tall sam looked at his punc- tured window-shade and the identity of the would-be slayer was discussed don't make no difference who said hallock to end the discussion he plumb failed but it shows how careful i gotta be as sue said shore is a pack o wolves in this camp--an i was as curly as any up to a few days ago but his enemies were not content with failure it seemed to hallock that his eyes had barely closed that night when voices penetrated his dreamless sleep he sat up the voices--sue's and chalk's--were in the narrow hall- way right outside his door sue was when a texas town goes gun-crazy  saying i can get you through the heart first pull chalk and i will if you move another step and gallatin replied believe yuh could an would dammit hair-trigger's battle spirit soared he flung out of bed pulled on shirt and trousers and reached up in the dark for his guns the belts and holsters were hanging in place but the latter were empty so sans hardware or weapon of any sort hallock barefooted over to the door and swung it wide suddenly the low- burning gas-jet threw light upon a most significant tableau there were four figures one opposing the other three and all of them poised tensely sue stood nearest the door presenting her back to hallock she gripped his miss- ing six-guns in rock-steady hands covering the precious trio halfway down the hall chalk gallatin foremost blackfoot dixon and coldiron mcclin- tock flanking him chalk's right hand grasped his belt near his holster and the fingers twitched nervously with re- pressed eagerness to complete the move to draw as hair-trigger stepped out of his room coldiron mcclintock a six-foot angular villian and no second- rate artillerist huskily exclaimed there he is hallock was in plain view of the men but sue had to depend on sense of hearing the merest side- glance would give chalk and pals their chance this in fact was the critical moment for chalk sharp-spurred by twofold jealous hatred of the man who loomed grimly just beyond went so far as to unclasp fingers from his belt and fasten them on his colt-butt the wooden grip still boasted the notch he had carved for hallock and resolved that it should never be removed know- ing hallock would out-trigger him in straight-up fight if allowed to fully re- cover chalk had slipped upstairs with his two closest companions while sam brace was in the back room his office the telltale shadow on the shade had warned gallatin when informed of it by the author of the close shot black- foot dixon that hallock was getting dangerously well would soon be his old self and now or never was the time to act but though the men had negotiated the stair-fiight undetected they had not reckoned on sue brace she came out of the convalescent's room just as the three desperados reached the top of the stairs and needing no more than a sight of them to grasp their design she flew back into the room and out again lugging hallock's guns chalk said sue when gallatin changed the position of his hand i'm watching and i can't miss your so- called heart at this range not talking to hear myself either dixon on a sharper note catch- ing the quarter-breed inching behind gallatin to conceal his purpose of stak- ing the issue on a quick grab for his holster stand away from chalk you can't put over any indian slickness on me sue broke in hallock at her back pass me the guns an i'll fog em to a finish tom she replied evenly you'll oblige me by going back in your room i'm a corking good shot and they all know it they're going to about-face and head downstairs again clear this hall by the count of three or they won't be able to go down at all and she stubbornly refused to give up the shooting-irons though hallock all but bent his knees to her at the same time he thrilled over her grit and deft handling of the situation one counted sue and chalk visibly started he perceived that she was going to be as good as her word hidin behind a woman's skirts  two-gun western novels magazine i taunted chalk glaring past sue at hal- lock and taking malignant delight in the red rage that distorted the gun- fighter's features instantly if yuh live long enough yuh'll swallow that lie gallatin rasped hair-trigger taking a step forward one side of sue sue won't yuh please as yuh love me gimme them guns but she shook her head and counted an ominous two and chalk turned dixon and mcclintock had started sooner desiring no more than gallatin himself to brave the fire of sue's bor- rowed artillery in the narrow hallway and as three was uttered the des- peradoes spurs clinking were descend- ing the stairs chapter v hallock lifts trail i'll thank yuh to send for doc bennison sue remarked hair- trigger next morning after breakfast something the matter she asked though hardly believing there could be he looked like the hallock of the days before reckless brule's passing no'm feelin fine i want to ask him somethin he paused and when he spoke again it was deliberately as if he were carefully choosing his words don't mind it sue if i--well i'd like to see him alone although she shook her head and feigned indifference she was a little hurt that he should want to keep any- thing from her but she saw to it that bennison was summoned doc said hallock when the booze- fighting physician had lurched into one of the two chairs in the room how soon can i fight bennison arched his eyebrows then smiled with one side of his face un- usual question hallock you're com- ing around fine best specimen i've ever treated soon why i can't let a girl go on protectin me rejoined hair-trigger enigmati- cally chalk's taunt rankled deep he perceived the doctor was in the dark and explained that's twice she's stood chalk off--can't let it happen ag'in the doctor nodded know how you feel hallock but it's childish for anybody to accuse you of skulking back of a woman and he added bluntly childish for you to let it rile you hallock started to snort then abrupt- ly subsided doc yuh can say that to me an get away with it reckon it's true mebbe--but hereafter i'm aimin to do my own fightin an interval of silence then she's a mighty fine girl she is readily agreed the doctor an say she loves me proudly de- clared the gunfighter congrats bennison extended a hand still steady despite the number of years his system had been absorbing whiskey i'm only half-shot this morn- ing hallock so i know what i'm talk- ing about and am sincere uh-huh well yuh ain't answered my question doc how soon i feel fit right now to lift a corner o hell let me see that wound hallock stripped off outing shirt and undershirt and bennison made careful examination sore he asked press- ing the healed spot no fight when you're ready then take em one at a time you're not in shape for a free-for-all yet keno chalk's my ticular meat others can wait awhile now doc yuhr bill-- shut up said bennison crisply when a texas town goes gun-crazy  or i'll be the first man you'll have to lick fists because i'm a rotten shot be damn hard for yuh to coax a fight out o me laughed hallock tell sam i'd like to see him when yuh go down will yuh when the saloonkeeper came up he found hallock cleaning his guns chalk downstairs queried hair- trigger abruptly no answered sam dropping on the edge of the bed and viewing hal- lock's occupation curiously what the hell yuh up to trigger  aiming to settle my score with chalk yuh heard about last night-- the second time sue said she'd caught chalk black- foot an coldiron on the second floor they sneaked when i wasn't in the barroom yeh an she

chance in a hundred an he's wise he may figger to win by a trick--he's a crafty coyote--but i'll have my wits workin an my eyes open uncomfortably the saloon- keeper consented all right i'll go along

the duel brace poked his head in hallock's room shove along here trigger sue's gone to the store an the coast is clear for a few minutes say yuh're lookin prime  hallock was the old hallock from hat to spurred boots and excepting his chaps wore his low-slung guns with the old careless grace his confinement had not lasted long enough to pale his  two-gun western novels magazine tan and he was hardly any thinner now than he was before his confinement for he had been well fed like a couple of mischievous boys fearful of encountering sue the gun- fighter and his second slipped out the back door of the saloon and walking along the outskirts of town came in five minutes to the stockade corrals in the rear of the stage-station there was a clearing north of the corrals which had been used many times in the past as a duelling-ground by those who had not settled their differences summarily in main street or the saloons and dance halls there's happy hoofs whistlin to yuh smiled sam as a pinto thrust its head over the pickets of the high corral and shrilly welcomed the approaching hallock happy hoofs the gunfighter's sad- dle mare and pet boarded with the stage horses the station-keeper cale halpin was a friend of hallock's there- fore ignored the stage company's rules regarding horses other than those be- longing to the line cale put in an ap- pearance at the back door of the station while hair-trigger was fondling the mare's handsome head  lo trigger glad to see yuh lookin so pert cale came down to the cor- rals with his hand out had a siege didn't yuh say do you know that paint gal needs exercise a lot--an-- uh--brule's cayuse too are you go- in to ride the mare not now exchanging lead with chalk gallatin here in a few minutes stick around and see the smoke said hallock staring hard into space at the mention of reckless's name chalk gal--where'n hell did he get the nerve to fight yuh the station- man couldn't make it out of a bottle i reckon--or mebbe he's stayin sober an dependin on his tricky wits they lounged against the corral waiting when the hour was up chalk had not appeared still they waited hallock remarked that he could excuse chalk for not being punctual at his own funeral not until fifteen twenty minutes had passed did doubt arise in his mind shared equally by brace and halpin reckon he's comin said sam the first to voice the question in the minds of all if he don't i'm goin after him even if sue sees me hallock rejoined his eyes deadly behind half-closed lids neither hide nor hair of chalk at the end of a half hour so hair-trigger and the saloonkeeper left cale chewing a speculative cud and headed around into main street they had not pro- ceeded far when sam grasped hallock's arm say taint hoss sense to go canterin round in full bloom this way trigger he might be hidin anywheres an it's just struck me what's his likeliest game to lay for you in the elkhorn savvy yuh mean said the gunfighter he'd figger on me gettin tired waitin at the corrals an goin back to the elk- horn an when i drifted in the front door he'd bang me off just that good head sam and yuh're right we'll checkmate im--go in the back way turn down here heading in be- tween two shacks he may have spies lookin for us to show up on main street an warn him we're cornin they entered the elkhorn by the rear door and hallock pushed ahead into the barroom expecting to catch chalk off guard but chalk was not there only a few minor characters in the turgid life of derringer these men manifested surprise at the sudden looming of hair-trigger panoplied for war and wearing his fighting face and when a texas town goes gun-crazy  so dearly was it genuine surprise that the gunfighter surmised chalk had not spread word of the challenge issued by the man he packed a notch for anybody seen chalk hallock asked standing behind the bar and sweeping his glance around to receive negative replies from every quarter the bartender on duty hadn't laid eyes on chalk since the latter talked with his boss hair-trigger turned away from the bar and confronted sam brace who was leaning against the back-bar cud- dling his sawed-off reckon he jump- ed the town the gunfighter asked dunno what to think--he's cheatin somehow yuh can put yuhr gilt on that just then a deering the store- keeper scrambled over the elkhorn stoop and staggered rather than walked into the barroom he had a handker- chief tied around his head and it was splotched with telltale red gimme a drink he gasped lurch- ing up to the bar and clinging there whisky -- no chaser he gulped down a drink tall enough to oil his organ of phonation and stiffen his wilt- ing legs then shot a forefinger at sam brace who jumped as if a gun had been stuck in his paunch yuh know where yuhr daughter is sam no yuh don't i don't need to ask or yuh wouldn't be standin there so ca'm well to make it short an snappy that lousy pup chalk gallatin's run off with her yep as sam leaped a foot off the floor and hallock called on his maker to damn the soul of chalk she was buyin stuff in my place half hour or more ago we was the only two in the store while sue was selectin some canned goods off a shelf i heard two hosses come up chalk was rid- ing one an leadin t other he stopped only a minute to sling a look in the door from the saddle then rode on around the corner down the alley tween my store an spokane harry's dance hall i didn't think much about it not even when chalk come walkin in the front door a few minutes after but it did make me take notice yuh betche when the son-of-a-gun shut the door an dropped the bar he had a gun out an told me not to move me nor sue either she gave him the scornful eye an i betche she'd give him somethin else if there'd been a weppin handy i know her spunk yuh ready to go ridin sue chalk says hard an she asks him if he's crazy yeh over yuh he says gettin closer to us all the time i was out from behind the counter an wonderin how i could turn the tables on the coyote when all of a sudden he jumps on me an hammers me on the head with his colt butt course my light goes plumb out an what happened to sue after it did is only guesswork far's i'm concerned when i come to i was tied up with clothesline from my own stock an stuff was scattered all over the floor showin what a fight sue had put up ag'in him say if he hadn't had a gun bet she could a licked him bare-handed well the door was still shut but unbarred for pretty soon a customer come in an found me an i-- hallock and brace were by this time going through the front door on fast feet the hangers-on in the barroom under urge of excitement rather than from any real desire to help piled after the gunfighter and sam but halted in close ranks when hallock wheeled on them and thundered this is a two-man posse don't want none o yuh scum taggin along not knowin how many of yuh might've been wise to the dirty game an kept yuhr lips buttoned and he would have perked his guns and killed them for rats only that he  two-gun western novels magazine anticipated need of all his cartridges and every second of time was precious both he and brace were so stunned by the abduction that they exchanged but few words as they hurried along the street i'll get my hoss an meet yuh back the stage station sam said suddenly directing his steps aside as they came abreast of the livery-stable hallock nodded wordless and pushed on half-running he kept his eyes open hoping to see one of chalk's side-kicks wondered if dixon and mc- clintock had quit town with him the thought of sue helpless in such a crowd almost maddened him he derived some relief from the reflection that chalk worthless as he was otherwise doubtless had real affection for sue and would protect her--unless her continual rebuffs and of him and his knowledge of her love for hallock had turned this regard to hate that was possible the gunfighter dashed into the stage station shouting at cale halpin i'm wantin happy hoofs damn pronto think i'm up in canady snorted cale putting fingers in his ears then as the full power of the blazing eyes shocked him into activity c'mon trigger right this way to yuhr hoss an saddle i shore ain't danglin nor askin questions when yuh looks like that he plunged out the back door with hallock on his heels and ran to the stable where the horses were quartered in winter from the harness-room he dragged forth hair-trigger's riding- gear while the gunfighter hastened over to the corral in which happy hoofs was impounded sound of her mas- ter's voice brought the eager pinto pounding up the instant hallock un- barred the gate he never had to use a rope on happy hoofs--and rarely spurs while he was deftly saddling hair-trigger told the palpitating station keeper enough to make him understand the situation when i see yuh ag'in sue will be ridin leg an leg with me hallock exclaimed springing astride and rolling the dust toward main street sam brace charging along the thoroughfare on his mettlesome nag almost collided with his prospective son-in-law where'n hell we goin to head sam barked ain't nobody seen em i reckon nless it was dixon or me- clintock an mebbe they was in the party s'pose we see if we can foller the trail from the alley by deerin's store hallock was on the point of agree- ing to tackle this uncertainty when his nervously roving eye descried a fami- liar figure on the board sidewalk in front of spokane harry's saloon and dance hall coldiron he roared see sam an he's lookin this way we'll find out what he knows happy hoofs was so crazy to run that all hallock had to do was slacken her reins a little and she was off at arrow-speed in a few jumps the gunfighter was alongside the angu- lar bad man mcclintock with sam slashing along in his dust--to be in at the death if there was one holding up the paint mare's head with a firm hand hallock leaned from the saddle mac i can see from the grin on yuhr ugly mush yuh know what's up i'd know yuh was lyin if yuh said yuh didn't where's chalk he ain't livin here no more trig- ger went over to pinecreek to get married an he ain't cornin back this coldiron said with a leer hands studiously held off from proximity to the guns he packed here's a cure for that grin o yuhrs mac hallock snarled and his fist lashed out as he stood up in the stirrups when a texas town goes gun-crazy  coldiron's head rocked backward and he staggered a few paces and fell his nose and mouth smashed to bloody pulp he lay with his head and should- ers in the hoof-marked street the rest of his body sprawled across the board- walk while hallock lifted the reins and charged away in swirling dust gone to pinecreek to get spliced he bellowed at brace as the latter spun his horse about and spurred it to keep pace with happy hoofs there's a sky pilot there thirty miles replied sam good thing our hosses is fresh a colt boomed behind them the bullet did not fall anywhere near but hallock turned for a brief glance rear- ward the bloody-visaged mcclintock swayed on his feet on the boardwalk a smoke-wisping gun in one hand on a chance hallock jerked loose a colt and fired back but the range was too long for close shooting at the pace happy hoofs was traveling the last hallock saw of coldiron he was still upright chapter vi the footpath way pound leather gritted hal- lock as they lopped off a mile of the thirty to pinecreek might be able to catch up this side if we don't pick no daisies how's that cayuse o yuhrs travel sam burns ground an will go till he drops though i reckon yuhr mare has a mite more bottom sam was thoroughly alive to happy hoof's fine points if i'd thought yuh could've hair- pinned reckless's hoss he wouldn't let the paint pass him but yuh'll hafta make out best yuh can don't hold in for me trigger if i drop any behind sue's the one we're thinkin of now they were sweeping mountainward across a plain tufted with bunch-grass yellow and dead-looking and scattered patches of sage-brush strike yuh odd that coldiron would tell us where chalk's headin for don't think he was shootin us off on the wrong trail do yuh brace called across to the grimfaced gunfighter no i reckon he talked straight opined hallock facing his companion he figgered chalk had start aplenty to beat us an aimed to keep his own hide whole--knew i'd ventilate him short order if he didn't come across he wouldn't get himself shot up to protect chalk ain't that much of a fool i shore hope yuhr dope's correct said brace grabbing at his hat as the wind got under the brim and threatened to lift it but hallock had erred somewhat in judging the reason for coldiron's will- ingness to talk in fact neither the gun- fighter nor brace had given chalk gal- latin due credit for the craftiness which existed behind his white mask of a face they knew he was tricky but-- what's that smoke ahead d'yuh reckon hallock pointed with his left hand they had covered the eight-mile sweep of plain and plunged into a val- ley of the cuddy paw mountains the lower slopes were thickly grown with tamarack red fir and yellow pine and the men were riding the high trail on the valley's rim above the timber but the smoke was not coming from the di- rection of the trees it plumed and writhed out and upward from the lean- ing wall of the valley right in their path when they should round a bulging shoulder trigger it might be anything burn- in observed the saloonkeeper tim-  two-gun western novels magazine ber's scarce this high up mostly noth- in but grass we only got a few yards to go an then we can see by god hallock swore suddenly his eyes flaming as the truth flashed home and striking his saddle-horn with his fist by god he repeated and showed brace his distorted face which awed the saloonkeeper accustomed as he was to the fiendish twists hallock could give to his features it's the bridge across the valley that's burn- in and he thrust in the spurs somewhat to the paint mare's anger for she was doing her best hallock reached the turn in the trail many yards in advance of sam brace and pulled up what he saw made him tremble with anger as the unnecessary spurring was making the pinto quiver with a like emotion the wooden bridge which spanned the val- ley at this point--fifty feet across was in flames the thick smoke drifted to- ward horse and rider enwrapping them happy hoofs shook her head and her eyes rolled with something akin to fear but hallock was grim and statuesque brace came along larruping his mount while the gunfighter sat thus yuh might say he turned on the appalled saloonkeeper speaking husk- ily for the smoke was not without its effect on his vocal cords that chalk burns his bridges behind him it was grim humor considering that the distance to pinecreek was seventy- five miles by any other trail and that haste was imperative the bridge tinder-dry as there had been no rain in that part of montana for a month or more had fallen easy prey to flame to start the fire hallock judged that chalk had piled sun-cured bunch-grass on the far end the flames had eaten more than halfway across to the side where they sat their horses and the middle sagging dangerously gave way of a sudden and dragging even the un- burned section from its moorings the whole smoking flame-shooting mass rattled and crashed seventy feet to the floor of the valley an the only other route is seventy- five miles half around the cuddy paws sam brace exclaimed w-hite- faced a burro couldn't make it down this side o the valley an yuh'd need wings to go up the other side chalk shore is a slick article con- ceded hallock easy to see now why coldiron talked--chalk told im what he was goin to do o course that injun dixon maybe with em too an he ain't lackin cunnin might've been his idea say sam he shook himself no use sittin here like a coupla bumps on a log we got to find another way across--no time to go down and around just take the lead an show me trigger i'm willin to try anything replied sam who was himself up a stump that bridge bein down cuts off the stage due s'evenin in derringer too hallock did not hear the last he had lifted happy hoof's reins and was ambling on around the winding trail which hugged the almost perpendicular valley wall what's that--another bridge hallock turned a surprise face back upon brace and pointed ahead when they had ridden a mile or more up the valley at that distance it certainly did look like another bridge spanning the chasm can't be--there was only the one sam was skeptical but kept his horse close at the tail-end of happy hoofs when they got nearer they saw it was the huge trunk of a tree the valley norrowed at this point to about forty feet but the drop below was just as great as down by the fallen bridge the log had not been placed in its present when a texas town goes gun-crazy  firm position by accident the side up- permost had been smoothed off with an ax making a footpath about four feet in width must've been used as a foot-bridge by the miners up this way before the gold veins pinched out hallock re- marked as they sat their saddle at gaze that other bridge was only built a coupla years wasn't it yeh said sam but i never knew about this one--never came up this far because when i went anywhere across the valley always took the reg'lar bridge miners was gone from these parts long before i hit derringer that was a minin camp one time yuh know looks as if it'd stood the weather pretty well hallock remarked his eye on the tree-bridge pretty narrow for a hoss but if any four-legged critter can go across it's happy hoofs the both of us are willin to try anything once eh girl patting the sleek neck an for sue we'd try it twice sam i'm startin i'd say a prayer if i knew any it was going to be a ticklish feat the gunfighter was well aware he had tested the paint mare's nerve frequently and always found it good but not in just this way before urged by her master's voice and rein-hand happy hoofs ambled to the tree then halted and tossed her head as if in misgiving now don't be shakin yuhr head girl rebuked hallock softly room enough for yuh to put yuhr hoofs if yuh do it dainty an careful i'm right with yuh even if yuh should slip-- which yuh ain't a-goin to amble girl we're wastin time one would have thought from the movement of the paint's ears that she understood every word her actions manifested her nervousness but so strong was the love for her rider and her confidence in him that happy hoofs held back no longer she stepped cautiously forward and with hallock talking to bolster up her courage covered ten feet or so then she hesi- tated the dizzy abyss swam under- neath not halfway yet girl spoke the gunfighter but if yuh want to rest go to it don't look down but straight across to where we're goin presently the paint moved slowly on again another ten feet and she stopped the tree was shaking in a way calculated to freeze the hearts of horse and rider there was no going back however forward was the only course hallock thought the motion of the precarious bridge resulted from the strain he and happy hoofs were putting on the middle partly that was the cause but there was another looking behind he saw sam brace guiding his horse across the saloon- keeper's face was white his mount was not doing even as well as happy hoofs it would stop every few feet and swing its head and sam evidently was al- most incapable of speech to urge it on he should have waited until hallock crossed before starting and the gun- fighter would have spoken to him had he not depended on sam's common sense two horsemen on the log foot- path simultaneously might be more pounds of bone and flesh than the sea- soned bridge could sustain but this was not the time nor place to remon- strate the thing to do was to go on as rapidly as possible and clear the way for brace and happy hoofs was suddenly averse to going another step she gazed into nothingness on either side of her and snorted a little that meant her nerve was failing hallock knew the signs stand still girl ordered hallock in his smoothest tone resolving sud- denly what was best to do clinging close to the animal's body and holding  two-gun western novels magazine her head up by short-reining he eased out of the saddle felt for the tree with one foot then placed the other beside it fortunately happy hoofs did not move hallock glanced back at the saloon- keeper whose mount had balked again and called in a steady voice better get off an walk sam choke the bridle too but if yuh feel his hoofs slippin let go an save yuhrself sam quavered an unintelligible reply and imitating hallock's method of dis- mounting as nearly as he could got down now take yuhr time sam it's shaky business but not so hard the gunfighter counseled to steady him then went to the head of happy hoofs and gripping the bridle short started to lead her the mare did not balk now where her master could go she could follow-- it was application of a bit of horse psychology on hallock's part--and the firm hand at the bridle heartened the paint closer and closer loomed safety ten feet--five--hallock and happy hoofs tood on terra firma but the gunfighter could not draw a long breath while sam was still en route he faced the log watching the slow and hesitant progress of man and mount with nerves strung taut up until today he had always imagined himself practically nerveless welcome to earth sam the gun- fighter exclaimed in a voice tinged with relief as sam and his horse stepped to safety foolish for yuh to start right after me but-- he hardly had the heart to be harsh with the man he was patently so near collaspe and now that the danger was past that was a nerve-tickler wasn't it huh when i die i want my boots to be off yessir  a wish which would never have been fulfilled had he continued to hell-pal- around with reckless brule for answer the saloonkeeper dropped his horse's reins and stretched him- self flat on the ground and closed his eyes hair-trigger accorded his silent sympathy his own nerves tingled un- comfortably at the remembrance of how the bottom of the valley looked from the middle of the bridge how out- of-reach firm ground seemed yuh're as white as chalk almost he addressed the shut-eyed brace an mebbe i ain't so nut-brown myself wish i had four fingers o xxx to start my heart pumpin ag'in said sam slowly systems full o floatin icebergs i ain't even sweatin hallock laughed and sat down on a rock take yuhr time but don't take too long sam opened his eyes and got up im- mediately sue needed him just as soon as he could reach her how could he have forgotten for a moment and ling- ered he was in the saddle ahead of hallock swiftly impatient to be off the gunfighter swung to happy hoofs and they headed back to the place where the far end of the bridge had rested way below them the saw the charred and broken timbers still smok- ing following the broad road around the valley wall which was used by the stage as well as horsemen they gradu- ally descended and flicked through a pass at the base of the cuddy paws they sailed into pinecreek at a thundering gallop drawing many an anxious female eye to curtained win- dows for it was not infrequently that desperadoes from derringer painted red their quiet neighbor town despis- ing its tendency to be law-abiding and pinecreek had had a very recent scare eagerly the eyes of the two-man posse sought among the horses hitched in the street for a glimpse of a hammer-headed bay that would be chalk gallatin's cay use hey pop where's yuhr preacher when a texas town goes gun-crazy  peg his hat hallock yelled at a long- whiskered party who was making a doughty stand in front of the general store while his cronies fled at the advent of the hardriding derringer man up there next to the church re- torted the old man pointing with his cane if yuh'd ride in decent once in awhile an git some gospel yuh wouldn't have to ask o course he'd be livin near the church--where else hallock said to brace half-grinning and ignoring the pinecreeker's broadside tell yuh the truth i'd forgot there was one--an that a church comes in the same pack- age with a preacher they reined toward the lowly par- sonage at the other end of pinecreek's main street adjoining the log-and- frame church but no horses were visible outside and sam's face showed deep disappointment if he's been here he's gone on-- that burned bridge broke the trail for us groaned brace who unaccustomed to much riding was already saddle- galled and almost pop-eyed with anxiety for his daughter's safety as ior hallock he was as full of energy as if he had never been sick and his late wound was entirely out of his mind he was prepared not to find sue and her abductor in pinecreek therefore did not experience the deep disappoint- ment that his companion did and if sue was mrs gallatin--a likelihood-- she would be a widow the minute he could get near enough to chalk to sling a gun determined to learn the worst at once and incidentally any other in- formation the preacher possessed which would aid pursuit hallock flung happy hoofs reins over her head and ap- proached the door of the parsonage stay in the saddle he called back over his shoulder as sam kicked off a stirrup we re only here a minute a thin pale woman responded to hallock's knuckle tattoo her pallor he devined was not natural but the outward sign of inward trepidation he imagined himself the cause at first well aware of his forbidding aspect i ain't meanin a mite o harm ma'am he reassured the lady i'm just aimin for to get a li'l information is the preacher about he's--he's inside she tremblingly replied i'm his wife it wasn't you who frightened me--it was the man who was hre awhile ago and -- and shot my husband no he isn't dead she hastened to say as hallock started suspecting he could give the killer a name wounded in the arm the doctor says he'll be all right was the feller who did it a tallish sorta cowboy cuss with a face as white as a hereford's--an was a strappin-- i mean ma'am a big dark-haired girl with him mrs saunders the preacher's wife answered affirmatively as he had scarcely doubted she would she looked him straight in the eye seemed on the point of saying something then hesitated fear struck him turning him cold anything the matter with the girl ma'am--she's my promised wife an it'd shore kill me tough as i am to have anything happen to her just speak out ma'am an lemme know the worst mrs saunders marveled that his hardlined face could express such anxiety over the welfare of another he looked like a man who would ride blithely through hell and bulldog the devil if necessary--all whalebone and rawhide and utterly careless of him- self but not a man who could feel genuine apprehension yet there it was stark in his steely eyes lady implored hallock lifting a hand when she did not reply immedi-  two-gun western novels magazine ately he mistaking the reason sam brace sitting near at hand and an agonized listener was ready to go through the motions of assault and battery if she didn't answer soon pardon me for staring apologized mrs saunders though hallock hadn't noticed she was the girl was--well she's quite large and strong you know and it looked to me as if she had fought the man strenuously and he had--ah-- beaten her with a quirt butt to subdue her there was blood on one side of her face she was black and blue and she seemed exhausted to the point where she could no longer resist and the man had to help her along he was bruised and scratched himself-- god almighty shouted hallock thereby horrifying mrs saunders yuh hearin-all this sam whirling and satisfied at once by the bloated ap- pearance of the father's face we're out for that wolf's pelt ma'am he panted turning again to the preacher's wife that's the girl's daddy hangin to his horn so yuhr husband didn't marry em none how come mrs saunders knew something was wrong of course as soon as he saw their condition especially the girl's the cowboy--beast i should say-- an yuh never spoke truer ma'am hallock was guilty of interrupting his eyes glittering ordered mr saunders to get his book continued the woman as if hal- lock had not spoken and the girl who was very near swooning declared she would not be married to him the man saw mr saunders was going to balk and drew his gun and commanded do as i say if you don't i'll kill you mr saunders told him to shoot and he did--but only in the arm bad enough of course and i fainted think- ing my husband had been killed when i came to they were gone then said hallock on a note of disappointment yuh dunno which way they headed mebbe though his gloom lifting a trifle some other pine- crackers saw-- my husband can tell you which direction they took he ran out after them wounded as he was and tried to get some men to pursue them but-- she paused flushing with sudden shame couldn't eh snarled hallock startling her by his vicious look and tone not a man with the guts to go huh say i'd admire to turn this snivellin burg topside derringer may not be so lily-white as pinecreek but it's got all the guts an gall--no ma'am parding but it ain't i was forgettin yuhr husband might i see him yuh hurry up hear me bawled the anguished sam brace after hallock as mrs saunders stood aside for him to enter my god think o that honey-girl o mine all beat up by that goddam son-- mrs saunders closed the door she led the hatless gunfighter into a dim little library where the preacher minus his coat and with bandaged arm in sling half reclined in an armchair i want said hallock giving the rev saunders his name when mrs saunders turned inquiringly to shake yuhr hand sir an tell yuh yuh've al- tered my idea o preachers which be- fore wasn't none flatterin yuh helped my girl best yuh could an i'm yuhr friend for life here's my hand mr hallock said the preacher raising his good one and i'm glad to have earned your good opinion sorry i couldn't stop the ab- duction--it was that wasn't it yes sir now reverend one thing more which way'd they head north thanks reverend get yuhrself in shape soon i'll be cornin back this when a texas town goes gun-crazy  way with the girl an she'll be plumb ready to say i do  he wheeled and almost ran from the house north he shouted at sam brace as he hit the saddle chapter vii hallock sees red show's we're on the right trail all right that's shore his bay hair-trigger up beside the inert carcass of a horse lying just off-trail its hind legs sticking from a clump of bushes the dead animal was equipped with all its leather gear hallock and brace were five miles out of pinecreek and had followed the main-traveled trail due north not cer- tain they were on the right track al- though the reverend saunders had seen chalk and sue depart in that direction until they encountered the body of gallatin's horse slipping quickly from happy hoofs and crashing into the brush hallock found on examination that the bay had broken its right fore- leg just above the fetlock stepped in a hole somewhere which resulted in its being shot that slows him up considerable said sam hopefully as hallock strode out of the bushes reporting his one hoss'll hafta carry double now it's a cinch blackfoot dixon didn't decamp with him or he'd been along o'chalk in pinecreek don't yuh think yeh nodded hallock absently he wasn't caring whether dixon--or a dozen of his breed--was ahead of him so long as he reached end of trail in the shortest time happy hoofs could carry him he was squatting over the trail looking for the hoofmarks of gallatin's remaining horse the one sue had been riding at the start hallock was not as good at trail-finding as he was squinting over a gunsight nor was brace any better his specialties being shotgun expertness and the mixing of drinks but it required little more than good eyesight to pick out the deeper in- dentations of shoes telltale of extra weight put upon the horse we can be shore sam said hal- lock rising and lifting foot to stirrup that we're on his track now trail's as open as print an he can't be so far away now they pointed out following the deep hoofmarks these led at a tangent from the road north finally circled and strung south he's doublin back hallock re- marked leaning over his horse's shoul- der as he galloped my guess is he's makin for the cuddy paws where he figgers to hole up only about a thou- sand places to hide in them mountains losin that hoss he had to change his plans can't reach em before night though slow as he's hittin it an we oughta catch him the heartening words however did not smooth the wrinkles of worry from sam's brow what the thwarted and desperate gallatin might do to sue was an uncertainty which kept his nerves strung to the breaking point i ain't used to callin on god except to damn me or my enemies said the saloon- keeper but i'm askin him to protect sue yuh sound religious as hell sam commented hallock and was serious they flung down a coulee with their horses at full stride sam's mount scampering at the tail of happy hoofs and emerging from the mouth of the dry ravine found themselves on the stage trail involuntarily hallock lifted his eyes from the ground glanc- ing south and fires of mingled hate and joy kindled in his heart he shouted no words just shouted and sam brace  two-gun western novels magazine seeking the cause of the outburst echoed him and got a head start of happy hoofs by a wicked plunge of the spurs in the next moment or two however hallock passed him leaning into the wind like a cyclone half a mile down the stage road the battered and bullet-scarred old concord preserved from early min- ing days in the region was halted the driver was leaning over his heat evi- dently arguing with chalk gallatin who stood just beneath him near the coach a horse with low-hanging head swayed on its last legs it fell over suddenly at the roadside sue sat upon a rock her head bowed upon her arms crossed on her knees while hallock and brace sped nearer and nearer chalk gallatin abruptedly pulled his gun and pointed it up at the driver who was evi- dently obstinate about something the driver's hands slowly arose to a level with his hat-brim whether chalk in- tended to pull trigger anyhow was problematical for at that instant he heard the charging horses and whirled the stage driver lowered his hands and stared hallock racing now far in advance of brace clung with his knees and yanked up both guns simultaneously the tubes threw bullets but the range was too great for anything but a high- powered rifle at the roar of the guns sue brace's head came up and she stood waving feebly but evidently the effort was too much for her snapped powers for she sank again upon the rock with the avenger closing in chalk gallatin realizing the futility of stand- ing up to him did the unexpected sheathing his gun he sprang suddenly over the coach wheel to the box and wrestling an instant with the driver taken entirely unawares by the cow- boy's maneuver burled the old man off the high seat to the ground chalk then seized the reins from the foot- board snatched the lash from the whip- socket and cracked the leaders into a sudden plunge the wheelers were jerked along and getting their feet imitated the pace set by the frightened team in front happy hoofs spurting valiantly shot by sue and the cursing stage driver as the latter was picking him- self from the dust a most amazed man to find no bones broken so intent was hallock on overtaking his quarry that he never looked sue's way as he passed her her father pounding up some minutes later was out of the saddle be- fore his mount had stopped running he dashed for the girl horrified by her appearance she arose took several faltering steps and was clasped in his arms hair-trigger drew near enough to the racing stagecoach to shoot chalk off his perch if he so desired chalk realized what an inviting target he was atop the stage and was leaning over as far as he could the reins wrapped around his arms high heels planted firmly against the foot-board but hal- lock's guns were suddenly stilled and gallatin wondered why--couldn't be the gunfighter had run out of ammuni- tion as a matter of fact hallock had changed his mind about the method of killing his enemy a bullet would be too ordinary too easy his bare hands must do the job to do this he must first get chalk alive in his hands which presented a problem the coach was whirling along a trail that stretched almost level for several miles toward the cuddy paw mountains chalk was high-lining the four-in-hand and really wasting energy for they had the bits in their teeth and would not have slowed up for a preci- pice in their path it occurred to hal- lock first of course to shoot the stage when a texas town goes gun-crazy  horses but this as a lover of horse- flesh and not from any reluctance to destroy property of the sundown stage company he hated to do except as a last resort happy hoofs grabbing ground as if she had not been run hard all afternoon thrust her nose past the coach window hallock pondering the problem of how to stop the stage and nail his quarry glanced involuntarily at the rapid-turning wheels his guns swinging from the loose grip of his hands against his legs came swiftly into position aimed low they began to roar a continuous volley hands that never missed were streaming those bullets and the spokes in the revolving rear wheels were split and broken by the hard-driven lead the felloes denied the support of most of the spokes slewed suddenly at a forty-five degree angle and the coach lurched to one side like a drunkard thrown off balance the ruined wheel lay down and the hub striking the ground dragged along it several yards before the four-in-hand gave up pulling but chalk gallatin was no longer on the driver's box puzzlement found place beside chalk's cold fear when hallock's colts began their incessant pounding which emptied both cylinders--what was the man shooting at he had never been known to waste lead--and then the question was answered by the sidewise lunge of the furiously driven concord chalk keyed up to take any chance even the slimmest swung down from the leaning coach on the offside a second or two before it completely stopped either side of the stage road was a steep embankment covered with brush the height of a man's shoulder and thick and tangled like jungle growth chalk without hesitation sprang from the edge of the road into this gray and brown and yellow maze and headed straight down he cared not where so long as he escaped his nemesis hallock saw chalk's figure whisk off the box but could not have shot at him if he would--he had shaken every load from his guns in demolishing the wheel he heard the crashing of the brush as the bad cowpuncher drove into it the gunfighter spilled the twelve empty shells on the ground shoved fresh cart- ridges into the chambers then swung off happy hoofs and headed around the end of the coach he was cautious about showing himself on the edge of the bank for the good reason that al- though it had taken him but a few seconds to reload the noise of gallatin's descent had abruptly ceased and it sug- gested that he was lying in wait for hallock's figure to loom above him finding the proverbial needle in the haystack would have been child's play compared to locating chalk on the brushy slope without exposing oneself hallock stood only a few minutes irresolute racking his brains to hit upon some scheme which would reduce the high degree of danger not that he was afraid but he would have deemed it a disgrace to be killed by chalk gal- latin especially with his vengeance un- satisfied but the horns of the dilemma retained their needle-point at the end of the five minutes and abandoning all attempt at caution which was useless anyway he charged yelling and brand- dishing his colts into the brush a six-shooter bellowed about thirty yards down hallock fell on his face not because he had been struck how- ever he had tripped over a boulder which lay well hidden in the thicket tangle he did not curse as he raised himself on his hands his fingers still twined about the gun-grips that rock possibly had been a providential stum- bling block in his path saved him a drilling--and something else this was  two-gun western novels magazine on second thought as he sat up and looked at the boulder it was fairly round likely it would roll consider- ing the pitch of the slope by ear alone had hallock located gallatin's position and it was far from being a reliable impression he had fallen ere he could glimpse the weapon's smoke which would have registered it exactly the thought that came to him as he looked at the boulder and noted its roundness he carried out immediately with one hand he gave it a good start down the slope in the general direction of the roaring gun it met with stout resist- ance from the underbrush but because of the start given it and its own weight was able to smash all obstacles hallock crawled after the rolling boulder keeping in the path it crushed confident that any noise he made would be drowned out by the snap and crunch and swish of twigs and branches chalk's gun suddenly boomed out again not ten feet away and hallock heard him curse he had fired at the boulder then discovered what he was shooting at and naturally felt foolish but the boulder had ac- complished all that hallock had ex- pected of it drawn chalk's fire and simultaneously covered hallock's ap- proach to the cowboy's vantage-point the gunfighter sprang up and ran those last ten feet trusting to luck that neither rocks nor roots would trip him this time the steepness of the slope caused him to descend in long stagger- ing leaps and he would be at a distinct disadvantage when he came upon the cowboy and tried to stop suddenly the next instant the white face of gallatin flashed upon hallock's vision the puncher was on his knees eyes fastened upon the point in the brush where he thought hallock would break through the gunfighter saw chalk's six-shooter swing up for the throw-down as he dashed upon him hallock's left hand gun spouted smoky flame and lead the bullet tearing the cowboy's gun from his fingers the gun with the notch for hallock hair-trigger ran several feet beyond the kneeling gallatin before he could stop himself he whirled and sprang back up the slope dropping his guns just as chalk was reaching with his left hand for the fallen iron the fingers of his right being momentarily para- lyzed from the shock of the bullet on the cylinder chalk didn't realize in the cold frenzy of the moment that his enemy's lead had jammed the cylinder and the colt was of no use except as a club armed with a dug against the vengeance-thirsting hallock--as well to stab him with a blade of grass but chalk's eager curving fingers never closed on that tantalizing colt- handle--a powerful tug at the back of his shirt collar lifted him from his knees then he was hurled flat on his back and hallock dropped astride him driving the breath from his body and seemingly crushing his ribs before he could regain his breath the gunfighter's steel fingers like the gouging talons of an eagle were fastened in his throat yuh woman-beater yuh damned skulkin coyote roared hallock in the tones of a temporary madman a bul- let was too good too quick to buck yuh out but these bare hands o mine shore fit yuhr scruvy neck i got a mind the terrible fingers tightened the eyes with the dancing devil in them drilled into the glazing glance of gallatin to tear yuhr windpipe plumb out the cowboy's hands instinctively but weakly futile pushed against hal- lock's heaving chest to the right wrist was slung chalk's quirt and the loaded end uppermost caught hair-trigger's eye it was coated a dark-brown the color of dried blood if possible hal- lock went madder than ever at the when a texas town goes gun-crazy  sight sue's blood he screamed--a hor- rible sound like the cry of a mortally wounded horse -- and he pounded chalk's head up and down on the ground then suddenly he took his hands from the cow'boy's throat and grew dangerously quiet chalk sucked in the life-giving air with mouth agape get yuhrself together yuh woman- rustier snarled the gunfighter bend- ing forward until their faces almost touched i'm a-goin to quirt-bust yuh like yuh did sue brace before i stop yuhr clock  when chalk's breathing became less labored--hallock sitting on his chest and watching the signs like a cruel-eyed eagle--the gunfighter tore the quirt from gallatin's wrist and heaved up on yuhr feet now he rasped take it standin like a man--no he snorted not like a man but stand up anyhow yuh lowflung woman-handlin hound chalk levered himself to a sitting posture with his hands spread w'ide on either side of him he knew that he must get up that there was no es- cape yet he had not the courage to gather his feet under him i said up bellowed the avenger well i'll shore help yuh then when gallatin still sat and stared speechless and with hand gripping the front of his shirt yanked chalk erect on his wob- bly legs damn swore hallock surveying the cringing figure if yuh ain't a sight to sicken a body he stepped backward to where he had let his guns fall and eyes never wavering from the face of the man he intended in the end to kill stooped and slid one colt in the holster on his left leg and with the other in his hand he walked over to his enemy yuhr iron said hallock shoving his own in chalk's empty bolster is smashed to hell i'm heelin yuh to see if yuh've got the guts to dig for can- non while i'm beatin yuh--an if yuh have well go for it an i'll show yuh but the fact that a sweet-shooting weapon had been put under his hand didn't hearten gallatin much he was barely able to stand from fear and weakness let alone rise to the supreme demands of the occasion yuh're sayin i beat sue brace quavered chalk not knowing what else to say his wits were so jumbled an eye of dread on the lash hallock was pull- ing slowly through his fingers in wicked anticipation but i didn't hallock i-- that's for lyin snarled hair-trig- ger and cut him across the face the course of the thongs marked in blood- red welts on the dead white skin in- voluntarily tears sprang to chalk's eyes he yelped that shore matches the scratches sue put on yuhr mush try- in to get away from yuh the avenger declared pleased with the result but i've only just started with all the vigor of his arm he at- tacked gallatin's head and shoulders the stinging biting rawhide trailed one long welt after another across the pale visage until it was no longer pale but had the appearance of fine-chopped meat chalk's hands and wrists were laid open his sleeves torn ragged from trying to shield his face pain-mad- dened at last to the point of forgetting his fear he suddenly dropped his arms and screaming curses to with a man grabbed for the colt hallock's red- rimmed eyes glinted--with what emo- tion it would have been hard to say possibly a fiendish joy that he had whipped his cowardly foe into showing resistance chalk had the gun almost clear of the open-mouther holster when hnllock shifting his grip on the quirt crashed the loaded end on the cowboy's head unprotected as his sombrero had  two-gun western novels magazine fallen off at the time the gunfighter threw and choked him a second time gallatin fell on his side arms outflung entirely relaxed the gun he had tried to draw stuck half out of the scabbard hallock bent jerked it up and thrust it in his own blood from the wound in- flicted by the butt-end blow coursed rapidly down chalk's countenance and dripped from his chin mrs saunders that gospel-sling- er's wife spoke o sue's face bein bloody yuh yellow cur hallock re- marked to the insensible man an so's yuhrs to play hunk he threw away the quirt and drew a sleeve across his sweating face feeling the effect of his strenuous session but he was not yet free from the spell of the ugly nightmare driving him to the consummation of his venge- ance chalk continued to lie without movement and hallock well knew that he was not shamming unconsciousness after a long moment the gunfighter reached down clamped iron fingers on one of chalk's wrists and dragged him like a sack of meal trudged up the slope along the trail blazed by the rolling boulder lugging his limp burden over the edge of the bank and around the end of the coach hallock propped the cow- boy in sitting position against the front wheel choking gallatin to death after trying it nearly to comple- tion had appealed to hallock as being as prosaic as shooting--and he recalled the killing of an indian horse thief which he had witnessed in his younger days around deadwood gulch a fit- ting death for chalk gallatin yellow- spined bully bushwacker and woman- stealer tool happy hoofs came walking toward her master whickering softly as if in- quiring the reason for his prolonged ab- sence but hallock had no affectionate pat or word for her now he was in the clutch of that temporary insanity which when proven sometimes means to a murderer the difference between a life sentence and the electric chair or hangman's noose unfastening his coiled lariat from the tie-straps on the saddle hallock returned to the side of his victim whose head hung forward and gong down on one knee fitted the hampen noose around his neck then he squatted on his heels in front of gallatin waiting for his senses to re- vive he would have assisted chalk out of his oblivious state but no water was handy nor had hallock a pocket flask well he could wait he had to bide his time until he got his hands on this damned coyote a few minutes longer wouldn't matter happy hoofs inquisitive missing her due caresses sidled up back of hallock and chewed his loosely knotted neckerchief then playfully nipped his ear but he did not respond which as well as anything manifested his mental state he just squatted there immobile all but his eyes like some grim demon presently chalk stirred groaned then he moved his head a little the rope did not exert anything like a throt- tling pressure but it was tight and the feel of it at his throat did more than a dash of cold water in the face to bring back consciousness his eyes snapped open--to stare into the satanic countenance of hair-trigger been waitin said hallock locani- cally he straightened both of chalk's hands went up to the tight hemp and he pulled at it shrieking rope good lord trigger yuh goin to hang me yuh'll only wish i was replied hallock i'm goin to--drag yuh chalk raved an i always was afeared o rope yuh're scared like a coyote pup at everything deep down ceptin mebbe when a texas town goes gun-crazy  women defenseless women that don't inclue sue brace yuh had to go some go the limit by god to get a-holt her that's why the way yuh treated her i'mb makin yuh die hard if twas only revenge for myself i'd put a bul- let in yuh an call it hunk chalk gallatin burst into unmanly tears his teeth clicking with nervous chill his head had stopped bleeding but the half-dried blood imparted to the sudden flood of tears its sanguine hue and the side of his face which had been decorated only with quirt-welts became streaked and crisscrossed ap- parently with fresh gore he was a spectacle such as might have aroused the sympathy a spark at least of most women and many men but not the tough-fibred hallock whose brute na- ture was so strongly developed noth- ing but disgust plus hatred had he for the wreck of a man against the wheel t rigger -- yuh -- yuh blubbered chalk tugging on the hondo to pull the noose loose yuh won't--shoot--me-- then hallock deemed it unnecessary to repeat that he wouldn't he had passed sentence he was judge and jury of this court all he said was no use jiggerin with that rope an gettin it loose i'll only put it on ag'in dunno any prayers do yuh gallatin trigger slavered chalk knowing that the prayer-stage meant the end if yuh won't shoot--gimme--a gun an i'll kill myself rather than the rope trigger--i'll do it yuh sneered hallock ain't got the nerve then he changed his mind dropped into his former position facing chalk it'd be better'n draggin yuh damned if it wouldn't to watch yuh work up that much guts try yuh-- it's yuhr last chance remember here  he slid a colt from one holster shov- ing the butt at the cowpuncher chalk clasped the handle and turned the blued steel muzzle against his fore- head the hammer lifted slowly as the finger on the trigger exerted slow pres- sure then the hammer gently low- ered chalk brought the muzzle down in range of his eyes and looked into it long visioning the burst of fire which would explode in his brain--an instant of terrible light and sound then com- plete darkness he shivered and drew an oath from hallock he thought then of the rope tearing at his neck his face being smashed by rocks his whole body mangled heart and brain active the while too long a while--and he jammed the cold ring again to his head the hammer rose the hammer fell--but he jerked the barrel up so that the bullet whined upward harmlessly he tossed the gun at hallock's feet with an ani- mal cry i can't--do it i ain't fit to die hallock filled the empty chamber he holstered the colt he got to his feet yuh ain't got the nerve to die yuh mean yuh'll never be fitter c'mon i'm done foolin the gunfighter reached over jerked the noose tight and chalk to his feet simultaneously hallock did not have to call happy hoofs she was right at his elbow a perplexed spectator keep- ing the rope on his victim's neck taut hallock hooked his left boot-toe in the stirrup and swung up the mare started at a lope as soon as she felt her master in the saddle and chalk grasp- ing the line with both hands to ease the strain on his neck ran behind hallock increased happy hoof's pace with a word at the same time paying out the lariat until he had only a few feet left on the home end which he twirled on the saddle-horn chalk was running now at top speed his feet scarcely seeming to touch the ground his eyes protruding happy hoofs galloped  two-gun western novels magazine gallatin was jerked off his legs and struck the trail asprawl and was dragged like a sled he uttered no sound though maddened with pain could not for the reason that his mouth was choked with earth and pebbles gradually his hold on the taut line which he had retained with desperation and despair for many hundred yards loosened and his arms jerked along lifelessly hallock was picking the roughest places in the road to ride over heading back to the spot where chalk had stopped the stage and then stolen it the distance was a mile or more hal- lock could see a horseman approaching sam brace no doubt despatched by his daughter to learn what was detaining the gunfighter far beyond sam hal- lock could see sue and the stage driver standing together in the road chapter viii thick of the fight as sam rode nearer hallock slack- ened the pace of happy hoofs so that's how yuh finished him huh said brace his eyes on the pitiful object at the end of the gun- fighter's rope wellit's a terrible death but he shore earned it hold up trig- ger for hallock was riding on he's dead ari yuh might's well unhitch him sue's stummick ain't weak but he ain't exactly a pretty sight hallock drew rein he climbed down and walked back to the bloody ragged wreck sam edged his horse in and was nauseated by what he saw say yuh didn't only drag him did yuh trigger he exclaimed i'm mighty glad i stopped yuh from drag- gin him up to sue say she'd bawl yuh aplenty for this hallock while freeing the noose which was deeply embedded in chalk's neck related the details of his encoun- ter with sue's abductor for every blow he give her i cut an slashed him twice i betche--an i ain't seen her yet the two-gun man declared pas- sionately rising and beginning to coil up his rope yuh're a devil when yuh get started trigger breathed sam i wouldn't want yuh should be campin on my trail yuh think i done wrong hallock demanded looking at the saloonkeeper squarely out of eyes that were still flecked with red she's yuhr daughter an yuh was just as hot as me to pull him down i ain't sayin yuh was wrong--that's yuhr way trigger replied sam calmly i'd a shot him--nless he got me first--that's what i'd done an left out the fancy work but the way yuh did it was yuhr way yuh was seein red--nough said is sue hurt much asked hallock brace nodded well yes--but not serious yuh savvy he knocked her plumb out once in the store after he'd socked deerin when she come to she was layin across his saddle said he'd let her ride the hoss he was leadin an leave her hands ontied if she'd promise to go peaceable she promised an kept it till she felt stronger then warned him she was goin to break it an fought im tooth'n nail but he was too strong for her strong as she is she didn't know nothin about the burnin o the bridge as they'd got past that before she got her senses back when they rode into pinecreek chalk threatened to kill her if she asked any body for help--an she says he'd done it too she was so weak she could hardly set in the saddle-- i'm damn glad struck in hallock vibrantly that gallatin lingered to when a texas town goes gun-crazy  know he was gettin killed a quick bul- let he didn't deserve yuh oughta be thankin me sam stead o findin fault mebbe mebbe said the saloon- keeper slowly nodding whatcha go- in to do with the body as the two- gun man strode to the pinto and tied up his coiled rope leave it to the buzzards barked hallock he tilted his head back and scanned the blue vault there he cried pointing to several wheeling objects is some a'ready sam shook his head when the gun- fighter mounted and lifted the reins sam followed him tom cried sue as he galloped up and flung down he did not speak at first gathered her in his arms held her close-- then at arm's length long he gazed upon the bruises and marks of the quirt- lash and the bloodstains which sue had not washed off because there was no water i paid chalk gallatin for all this he touched her cheek gently with one finger he dropped his hands from her shoulders and gave her his profile yuhr pa kicked some about it he didn't cotton to the way i killed him he told the manner of chalk's passing not tryin to excuse myself he de- clared at the end i got wild--there's more'n a li'l devil in my system sue i reckon i'm just a barber--yuh know what i mean girl barbarian yes you are one side of your nature is savage but there's an- other side the side you've shown to me the same that made you take off your guns after reckless--died and tom if it's in the wood i'm going to develop that better nature i do not love you for that killing instinct but in spite of it that love will cure me if anything he was facing her now his eyes no longer bloodshot the savageery eradi- cated now that i'm cooled off i feel --well not sorry exactly but-- he halted groping for the words to prop- erly express himself now when you're not blind with murderous rage you feel ashamed of your unnecessary cruelty for having tortured him like--well like blackfoot dixon who has indian blood would have done isn't that what you mean i reckon it is shore wonderful how yuh can read me she laid one hand on his shoulder and with the other pointed down-trail is that chalk lying there in the road must be of course for the buzzards are dropping down you meant to leave him for them--but don't you think bet- ter of it tom he nodded i'll bury him got no shovel or anything but a niche in the rocks somewheres an other rocks piled on top will cheat the buzzards an coyotes sit down sue an rest till i come back he turned to happy hoofs how about my hearse hallock spoke up the stage driver rafe sed- don who with sam brace had kept silence and in the background until this moment the old rattlebank looks broke down from here though it's a good ways i leaded up one wheel for yuh to trump the getaway hallock informed him reckon yuh'll hafta bring an- other wheel from pinecreek before yuh can finish yuhr run an the bridge is down across the valley yuh'll hafta drive around the cuddy paws till an- other's put up how did we--oh sam and me used that log foot-bridge you bet we ain't goin to cross it ag'in though not hossback anyway i'll be gosh-fried seddon ex- ploded sam he turned to the saloonkeeper loan me yuhr nag will  two-gun western novels magazine yuh till i go down an look the hearse over an roundup my hosses yuhr daughter can ride yuhrs then an yuh can fork one o mine--or hallock whichever be dark long before we hit pinecreek an i'll bring out that wheel to-morrer double damn that chalk gallatin--but he's dead an gone now dead as his hoss there know what he wanted me to do as brace got to the ground and tossed him the reins why take him an yuhr daughter as far as the cuddy paws cause his hoss had give out an he hankered to reach the mountains before dark what he was a-doin with her an her all battered up got me goin an i told him so plumb plain at which he sticks a gun onder my nose an warns me not to be too in- quirin then yuh fellers heaved along s'prised i didn't break my neck or my back when gallatin chucked me off the seat i was wonderin why he'd held yuh up rafe said hallock who had lin- gered to listen so was i chimed in brace but i forgot to ask hallock and seddon clattered off together not long after seddon returned with his horses mounted on one of the four hallock had left the rein-dangling happy hoofs at one side of the road and gone down the embank- ment carrying the mangled clay of chalk gallatin twenty minutes later he reappeared over the edge of the bank and loping back reported to the one women that gallatin was safe forever from scavengers he then insisted that she ride the paint mare while he be- strode one of the stage horses and with sam and seddon and the extra animals bringing up the rear hallock and sue set the pace pinecreek-ward arriving after dark hallock said to sue as he drew rein in front of the gen- eral store yuh're shore yuh feel all right to go through with it now her yes was vibrant then there's no use puttin it off if yuh're willin to take a chance on a cashless good-for-nothing like me who even has to borrow money for a wed- din ring from his father-inlaw-- he paused then added but i'll be able to pay him back for that soon's we get to derringger reckless--pore old reckless--won't never need his hoss an outfit ag'in an he'd want i should have what i can get for em it'll be enough shore to buy railroad tickets for two to some place where i ain't known an can start over--but what at i dunno nothin but gunfightin sue brace he had dismounted and stood at the head of happy hoofs looking up at the girl in the light streaming from the general store yuh're takin the longest chance-- she put fingers on his lips--and he seized the opportunity to kiss them a long chance perhaps but i'm willing oh very willing she said bending to- ward him where you will go i will go and have no doubt that you will find honorable employment something will turn up--it always does for the man who tries hard who won't give up and now be happy for tonight--it's our wedding night tom she laughed softly i won't look much like a bride but after i've washed my face and fixed my hair which i can do at the preacher's i'll feel like one hallock took the hand he had kissed in both his own he could only squeeze it speechless his wonder of woman had so multiplied that his mind was awhirl he felt himself groping help- lessly yet joyously ready girl to pick that ring he asked i'll corral these nags an meet yuh over to the preacher's folks called rafe seddon as sue gave herself into hallock's arms and hoof-clatter fol- lowed his words when a texas town goes gun-crazy  mr and mrs tom hallock rode side by side into derringer next morning they had spent the night by kind in- vitation at the parsonage and the saloonkeeper and seddon had put up at the hotel sam had elected to ac- company the driver back to the broken- down stage lending hallock his saddle- horse the couple had started at dawn and taken the long trail around the cuddy paw mountains and although it was after ten o'clock when they turned into main street the town that was run by bad men was just awakening a deering and his clerk were carrying out goods for display on the store stoop when they heard hoofbeats recog- nizing the riders deering let go an arm- ful and flat-footed out in the street to meet them his joy at learning of the death of chalk gallatin was only equaled by his delight at seeing sue brace alive and radiant notwithstand- ing the marks she bore of her recent experience and when told that they were man and wife deering pumped the hand of the gunfighter and ex- pressed a wish to kiss the bride-- which the bride did not deny him leaning from the saddle and presenting a cheek then they rode on past spo- kane harry's honkatonk in the wide doorway of which two dance-liall girls evidencing in disarrayed hair ghastly faces and soiled attire the wear and tear of the previous night stood arms about each other they blinked for the morning sunlight was painful to their eyes and flapped languid but friendly hands at the newly weds hal- lock had never frequented spokane harry's but he was something of a hero in the eyes of the women who lived on sensationalism and sue was even more popular because she treated them as sisters unfortunate but sisters just the same you're a pair to draw to called one mame for they had heard the con- versation with the storekeeper chalk was a damned nuisance luck you love-birds when they neared the unpainted frame building where doc ben- nison lived and had his office on the second floor over a blacksmith shop hallock remarked that his wife had better stop and have her scalp laid open by chalk's quirt-handle properly treated and bandaged he would ride on put up the horses and return for her hallock turned sam's saddler in at the livery stable forked happy hoofs and laid a course for the sundown stage-station he had ridden by the door of the elkhorn bar with danger farthest from his thoughts when a bul- let crashed through the saloon window and ricochetted from his saddlehorn stung to sudden fury by the treach- erous attack he did not even stop to dismount but whirling happy hoofs spurred her across the stoop and through the elkhorn's door throwing himself forward to escape the frame as the dancing hoofs rang on the bar- room floor a second shot thundered seeming to rock the walls which con- fined the sound the malignant bruised face of coldiron mcclintock peered through the smoke drifting ceilingward the bullet had carried away the lobe of hair-trigger's right ear the erratic motions of the paint mare who had never been in a saloon before saving her rider's life hallock had unhitched both guns as he charged in and from his perch in the saddle he swung one in line with his enemy coldiron bored through from chest to back by a forty- five slug tipped forward firing as he went down yuh'll be company for gallatin shouted hallock and saw other hands digging for iron it was quite a gather- ing of his enemies his work was cut  two-gun western novels magazine out for him sam's bartender while he could not be numbered an enemy could not be counted on for assistance as the first exchange of shots had driven him to cover under the bar hallock regretted riding into the saloon realizing his extreme disadvan- tage in being higher than the heads of his enemies a bull's eye for even poor marksmanship which was unknown in that gun-toting town and he set about at once to rectify the mistake he had made in a flurry of anger to dismount facing the foe and shooting simul- taneously was no small feat rendered more difficult by happy hoofs attack of skittishness she was ordinarily not gun-shy but the close quarters the deafening volume of sound the acrid choking smoke all combined to craze her and she wilded up at the critical moment hallock had withdrawn his feet from the stirups and was drawing up his right leg to clear the pommel when the iron-shod hoofs slipped on the none-too-clean floor -- though there were a half dozen brass cuspidors in different parts of the barroom--and the paint mare crashed down on her left side pegging one leg of her rider to the floor and his back against the bar the aim of three desperadoes was thereby spoiled and the bullets slammed into the side-wall of the saloon so close to- gether that they bored one large hole nothing daunted by the mishap hal- lock whanged away from the floor get- ting two of the ambitious artillerists in as many seconds get up girl get up he kept repeating and the paint mare recovering quickly from the shock of the fall struggled hard one black-bearded patane thinking to take advantage of hallock while he was down stole forward on the balls of his feet for a close shot the mare's move- ments in trying to rise being discon- certing patane imagined he was un- observed and had but two steps to go when one of the gunfighter's colts roared at him over happy hoof's shoul- der the dying bad man as he dropped face first struck the scrambling happy hoofs with his out-thrown hands which so startled the paint that she jumped snorting and heaved upright on her feet hallock mindful of his pet's danger even in the thick of the fight denied himself the protection her body might have afforded while he was get- ting up slapped her flank with a gun- barrel which drove the animal outside a bullet splintered the bar close to hallock's left ear his left leg was somewhat numb from the weight of the horse but he planted his right foot firmly and with back braced against the bar slid to nearly his full height crouched in characteristic fighting pose lew harney and sid cobb cattle thieves when they were working ready gun-fanners working or loafing found themselves in direct line with hair- trigger's leveled sixes harney al- ready had taken one shot at the two- gun man and missed and hallock knew it both waddies were standing near a poker table lew whirled like a flash upsetting the table and jerking cobb down as he threw himself behind it harney was just a fraction too slow to save himself a slug whined unerringly from one of hallock's guns and smashed between the rustler's eyes harney lifted to his feet with a short yell then fell against the barricade he had arrayedturning the table over on its top the legs plumb and exposing sid cobb fanning his triggerless colt that is striking the thumb of his left hand against the hammer sid un- limbered but one shot before hallock tucked a settler in his chest and he slid forward gasping beside his late partner in cattle raiding but four of hallock's enemies stood unhurt avid in spite of the destruction when a texas town goes gun-crazy  he had wrought and but for his torn ear his apparently scatheless condition to compass his defeat now or never kill or be killed they could never get to the door past hallock's guns in fact none of the four entertained a thought of escape they had reached a stage of desperation where death can be faced eye to eye without a conscious quiver len roper a long-haired sun-smoked old rawhide who had been a bad man for forty years advanced first on the bayed hallock tipping up hi holster to fire through the bottom he pulled trig- ger and so did hallock the shots roar- ing into one knowing the deadly style of roper's gunplay hallock had aimed to cripple his hand and thus deflect the bullet otherwise even with death tear- ing at his vitals old len might have the tenacity to send a bullet straight as his last act on earth bellowing his pain and rage the long-haired bad man-- who was no imitation though he did affect the lengthy locks which were so often an indication of the show-off a wild-looker who couldn't stand the acid--dangled his smashed paw then hand that for forty years had cut down good and bad alike according as their politics were at variance with mr roper's bang roared hallock's right- hand gun in the midst of len roper's lamentation cutting it short but len though old proved tougher than some of the younger ones who had gone down earlier with a bullet lodged some- where near his heart--hallock was cer- tain of that--the long-hair took several steps backward trying to steady him- self after the shock of the lead injec- tion his good hand flung out to aid him in regaining his balance struck a leg of the table overturned by messrs harney and cobb dying on his feet his brain seethed with one idea to re- taliate on the man who had broken his gun hand and given him his death wound and the contact of his hand with the table-leg seemed to suggest a way unable to utter a sound but with strength to spare for his final deed be- cause hate buoyed him len tore the leg loose and flourishing it has a club stag- gered at the man crouched back to bar hallock's blazing eyes at that in- stand were glancing over the sights at the three other desperadoes advancing on him as one man with intervals of a few feet between them to get him from in front and both sides at once as he threw down on the gun- packer sidling to the left len roper piled in oblivious to the spurting gun and took the bullet himself there was a loud thump roper had landed a blow with his club but not where he aimed for almost instant death from that second bullet shortening his reach instead of striking hallock on the head the table-leg smashed him on the chest yet with sufficient force to hurl him backward half across the bar len roper slumped floorward unaware that he had not achieved his end gasping for breath and flat on his back with legs hanging over the edge of the bar hallock heard a sudden rush of feet his last three enemies were closing in following up the advantage given them by the late mr roper over whose body one of them tripped--and cursing kicked it--in his blind eager- ness to finish the battling mr hallock while he was down mr hallock may have been down but he was by no means out he raised up as two of these desperadoes thrust guns within an inch of his body as he was employing one arm to lever himself upright the gun in that hand was temporarily so to speak spiked cannon but mr hallock had feet and he did not let them stay idle in this extremity the man he could not reach with a gun he kicked full in the face--and the face disap- peared thrusting the other gun into  two-gun western novels magazine the vest of the second bad man hal- lock tunnelled him the flame from the muzzle setting his shirt on fire the third man of the trio who had been delayed in reaching hallock by stumbling over len roper was the first object to loom on hallock's wavering vision as he slid off the bar he had forgotten that man he fired without aiming saw him fall and the smoke jerking from his gun-muzzle as he fell but hallock was sure he himself had not been hit for he felt all right except for dizziness on the floor a man moved accustomed to watching the hands of men their hands and their eyes hallock almost mechanically saw the hand of the man lift--and mechani- cally he shot wondering as he pressed trigger if there was an unused cartridge in the gun he pointed he had lost count of shots and men the roaring explosion and the thump of the man's head on the floor were both vaguely sat- isfying that man must be the last of them thought hallock as he gazed around seeming to look from another world upon the shambles he had created with his two hands lined with iron yes he was the last the fellow he had kicked in the face he remem- bered now he sheathed his guns and turned to the bar whisky he said in a monotonous voice though there was nobody in sight to take his order the bartender his face pasty crawled out from under he fumbled the bottle and glass he placed at hal- lock's hand nerves ain't so good huh the gunfighter sneered look here he stretched forth his right arm the fingers of his hand spread wide--steady as rock the bartender nodded shamefaced i ain't put together that way few is he sniffed somethin burnin powder suggested hallock sarcas tically somethin else too the bartender leaned over the mahogany there he exclaimed and pointed down wes ty's shirt's afire gettin cremated hallock glanced at the little blaze started by the pistol he had shoved in westy's vest and whipping off his som- brero beat it out then he poured and downed a short whisky why'n hell didn't yuh warn me about coldrion layin for me in here hallock demanded friend o his was yuh hadn't no idea he was up to nothin trigger replied the barman i don't think he was till he saw yuh ridin by spoke about yuh mashin his face an said he'd get yuh for it--but that was nothin new that crowd yuh just cleaned up always did have it in for yuh my god but yuh can fight thanks i am able to take care o myself some it's plumb lucky i didn't need no help about all i can thank yuh for yuh bar-swabber is keepin out of it the bar-swabber was silent hal- lock turned to go paused at the door and looked back there's one face in ticular i'm missin on that floor-- blackfoot dixon's know where he's at ain't seen him since last night hallock strode out of the front door --into the arms of his wife chapter ix hallock kicks i've been fightin ag'in declared the two-gun man idiotically hold- ing sue in close embrace behind her stood doc bennison so- ber again but shabby as ever his smile was expansive when i gave you when a texas town goes gun-crazy  permission to fight hallock i stipu- lated one man at a time and here you took on half the town not to men- tion he added the other capers your wife has told me about that so doc yuh did give me or- ders hallock loosened the hold of one arm about sue and scratched his head half-grinning danged if i didn't for- get em but with a full-throated laugh i feel all right in that case said the doctor i'd say we have no cause to worry but how about that ear hallock put up a quick hand to the mutilated member by golly i do re- member gettin hit but it was so long ago i'd plumb forgot coldiron did that--but coldiron ain't no more an i'll hear just as good come over to my office right away and i'll fix it up soon's i corral my happy hoofs doc say girl to sue lifting her face which all this while had been buried in his shirt yuh don't say nothin how come yuh can't exactly blame me for that fight coldiron fired at me through the front winder an i went in after him--an was jumped how many hallock interposed bennison well doc i just lost count they kept coinin so fast but both guns is empty an i didn't sling much idle lead replied the two-gun man then to his wife sue they was honin to down me an i shore thought they would-- she stopped his mouth with her hand why do you talk so foolishly tom blame you i never was so sea-- hallock cut in the doctor again i didn't think sue bra-- hallock could faint but she can did dead away when we ran down here to see what the cannonading meant i differed in opin- ion with your wife i was that confi- dent you'd win through--well i said to myself if you didn't smoke your way out i'd never touch another drop of liquor and that was a promise doc yuh shore must've had confi- dence hallock remarked quizzically i don't suppose said bennison that anybody needs my attention in there and he waved toward the bar- room no hallock shook his head then added  nless it's the barkeep yuh might prescribe him a nerve- tonic that fight in the elkhorn bar was a source of conversation in derringer years after hard-eyed old-timers who had survived the hectic days of the town related hair-trigger hallock's feat with pride and heartily cussed the law that only allowed shooting by man who wore badges there had been no gunplay paralleling that of hallock's since wild bill hickok armed with a rifle two six-shooters and two bowie knives shot and cut up the dreaded mccandlas outfit single-handed in kansas hallock did not realize that he had made history for montana but he did not know he had stirred up der- ringer considerably particularly when on entering spokane harry's honka- tonk that night he was approached by the frock-coated cat-footed proprietor evening trigger he said we don't often have a visit from you and while i want to make you welcome i hope at the same time you're not look- ing for anyone i'm not a cheap skate but the fixtures in this place cost me plenty and if any such gunplay as you staged in the elkhorn was pulled in here--i'd burst into tears spokane's poker face relaxed in as much of a smile as he ever permitted himself you sure messed up the elkhorn you and your playful friends promise me trigger if you're aimin to start some- thing you'll drag it out in the street first  two-gun western novels magazine hallock rolled a smoke licking the flap and striking a match be- fore replying i can't promise spo- kane because i'm gettin the bad habit o keepin my word i know i didn't clean up all the hard guys who'd like to get me an most of em hang up in here but i ain't huntin trouble ex- cept with one blackfoot dixon gal- latin's sidekicker he'll try to play hunk for chalk's toe-up from ambush an i'd just as leave see him first i would myself said spokane harry dryly but trigger he hasn't been in here tonight and spokane lied not that he had any regard for the hide of the quarterbreed but he feared that a meeting between the two would mean a repetition of the elk- horn bar shoot-up there were several able gunmen present he knew who only needed someone to take the initia- tive and they would jump hallock added to the grudge they already toted against him he had gunned friends of theirs that day hallock though he had no cause to doubt the honkatonk owner's word-- and did not--elected to circulate in spokane's joint for a spell as he put it blackfoot dixon was likely to am- ble in hallock had been on the look- out for him all day--but not a sign nodding to the many who spoke to him but avoiding conversation with anybody hallock was spectator in turn at the roulette wheel and the faro lay- out and in this way passed a half hour he took no notice of the venemous stares of certain colt-bristling gentle- men in the big hall though careful not to place his back toward them he de- cided suddenly that one of the gallery boxes fronting the small stake would be an ideal lookout safe from rear at- tack and obtaining a view of every cor- ner of the hall as well as the stage go- ing upstairs hallock entered the first box he came to closed the door behind him and pulling the curtains apart sat down at the table a waiter thrust his head in at the door and hallock ordered beer then turned his gaze on the crowded floor beneath to the come- dian in the limelight at that moment and convulsing most of the crowd with his jokes and antics the gunfighter paid no attention his eyes lifting from the vivid scene of noise and movement and color below ranged along the boxes on the gallery opposite--and stopped at the third one the curtains were pulled back a man his back toward hallock and a familiar figure crouched against the thin wall separating his box from the next one which had its curtains drawn together in an attitude of listen- ing blackfoot hallock swore and clenched his fist then spokane lied for dixon didn't come in after me i was watchin too close to miss him at the same time he thought it strange that the quarter-breed should have missed seeing him while he was circulating in the crowd on the floor the explanation as it seemed to him must be that dixon had other business on hand and so engrossing as to dwarf the importance of a meeting with hal- lock likely to be a life-and-death mat- ter it would have been of interest to the gunfighter to learn the nature of that other business even if he had none of his own to transact with mr dixon when the waiter returned with the bot- tled beer and glass the door of hal- lock's box stood open and he was gone hallock was not many minutes making his way across the thronged hall up the stairs and along the narrow gallery to the box in which he had seen blackfoot dixon the door was ajar plucking a gun from his belt and with his thumb slipped under the hammer he was about to jerk the door wide when a commotion started in when a texas town goes gun-crazy  the adjoining box scuffling bumping panting of hard-drawn breaths and low guttural curses these last in black foot dixon's voice not a doubt of it hal- lock strode forward and tried the door of the box from which the sounds of strife emanated it was locked he was going to call but on second thought closed his lips jammed the muzzle of his colt against the lock and pulled trigger once twice the fastening was smashed the door swung inward an inch or two without hallock touching a fin- ger to it the gunfighter was about to enter pushing his gun ahead of him and puzzled as to what it all meant when the door was jerked wide open and a heavy body catapulted into him knocking him down the man ran on down the gallery and hallock recog- nizing the figure as blackfoot dixon's as he scrambled up reached hurriedly for the six-shooter he had dropped leave it lay pardner drawled a man's voice near at hand and hallock looked for the first time into the box lighted by an oil lamp the owner of the voice was a tall lanky but broad- shouldered young fellow with curly hair and a not unhandsome good-natured face he wore semi-range garb and was training a sawed-off thirty-eight in hallock's direction a lazy but daunt- less blue eye back of the sight against the wall near the young man stood a dance-hall girl known as goldie her dark eyes mirroring fright one white hand at her laboring breast boy growled hallock as he rose flourishing his colt in utter and con- temptuous disregard of the young man's order i dunno who'n hell yuh are but yuh're a damn fool for one thing if that li'l pop-gun o yuhrs should go off an hit me anywheres i'd be real mad and he wheeled and plunged along the gallery in pursuit of blackfoot dixon the breed bad man was still in sight for the gallery was long and hallock had been detained but a min- ute or two long enough to pick him- self and his colt up and bare fangs at the timorous young man hallock had never yet shot a man in the back so he held fire as he ran after his quarry blackfoot threw a backward glance as he heard the thud and jingle of hal- lock's feet above the noise was making himself hallock wondered why he didn't shoot back--then reasoned that the breed must have lost his gun in the struggle with the curly-headed young- ster what haven blackfoot originally had in mind unless he meant to risk his neck by dropping from one of the unoccupied boxes to the floor below the gunfighter could not guess for the stairway was in the other direction dixon seemed to be running into a blind gulch at the end of the gal- lery was a window overlooking main street and the drop was considerable reaching the window which was open the breed desperado slung a leg across the sill and turned a snarl-twisted face toward the man rushing down the gal- lery running awkwardly on account of his high heels to blackfoot dixon it looked as if he was bayed hallock shouted gotcha injun from the street below came the thumping beat of galloping hoofs the unmistakable rattle bang and creak of the stage--rafe seddon accom- panied by sam brace was just getting in from his long drive around the cuddy paws blackfoot dixon turned his face from hallock and looked down into the street in a flash grasping the window- frame to steady himself he drew up both legs crouching on the sill hal- lock was almost near enough to put out a hand and touch him when blackfoot launched his slim body into the air in a pantherish leap hallock felt like a man left holding the proverbial sack he had been unprepared for the ma-  two-gun western novels magazine neuver not at first connecting the breed's desperate jump with the noise of the stagecoach subconsciously heard above the roar of the dance-hall activi- ties hallock was treated to a surprise when he looked out instead of lying below with a snapped neck or leg blackfoot dixon was riding away on the coach roof all asprawl just as he had landed he gathered himself to- gether even as hallock glimpsed him to meet the attack of sam brace who had risen on the seat beside seddon and was facing backward the driver roar- ing at his four-in-hand and sawing on the lines brought the concord to a standstill at an acute angle with the leaders prancing on the board sidewalk dixon and the saloonkeeper locked in- stantly in a mutual grizzly hug and lurched wildly back and forth prevent- ing hallock from attempting a snap- shot hold im sam lend a hand there rafe yelled hallock from the win- dow then drew in his head and retraced his steps at speed over the gallery he passed the box in which he had encoun- tered the reckless youth with the short- barreled thirty-eight the man and goldie were still there he noticed-- goldie was cursing the fellow he wheeled as he heard hallock going by called something which the gunfighter did not catch nor stop to have repeated hallock leaped down the stairway swinging his gun and the men and women nearest him scattered they had heard nothing of the set-to on the gallery as they were making more noise than had attended that fracas them- selves and they thought hallock was on the rampage and anybody likely to stop lead he did not have to clear a path to the front door it was cleared for him by willing enough feet he passed close to spokane harry whose inward trepidation did not show in his expressionless face you lied to me spokane rasped hallock grabbing the honkatonk own- er's arm and halting an instant i spose yuh thought blackfoot would get me from behind me believin what yuh-- i lied to keep the joint from being messed up interrupted spokane boldly fronting the gunfighter though he feared death i knew dixon was here and i tried to find him and per- suade him to get out where is he jumped out the front window onto the stage replied hallock failing to metion the queer game he had bucked on the gallery he was forced to be- lieve the proprietor's alleged reason for concealing the fact of dixon's presence and released him saying no fight with yuh then and ran on as he charged out of the front door spokane sighed in relief and with the other hand brushed the arm hallock had roughly gripped running toward the stage halted down the street not far from the honkatonk hallock was greeted by a shout from sam brace who was sitting on the coach roof he got away trigger hallock swore luridly which way i don't rightly know answered the saloonkeeper in the tone of one who feels his failure deeply twisted my gun away from me hit me between the eyes an dropped off an rafe he had his hands full with the hosses too bad trigger i did my best but he was a combination o steel spring an breased hog i reckon got away from me so i can't hardly say much to yuh for lettin him repeat wouldn't be sense to look for him up any dark alleys--he's got yuhr gun ain't he the two-gun man was standing by the stage now looking up at the saloonkeeper and saw him when a texas town goes gun-crazy  nod if these four-legged thunder- bolts-- rafe seddon who had the four-in-hand well under control after a stiff fight began to apologize never mind rafe said hallock i'll cut his trail ag'in--soon enough likely he was so doggone nervy about it i'm a'most willin to say he deserved to get away how's yuhr wheel rafe runnin on all four huh sam i had a dinger of a fight in yuhr place today the old barroom is cleaned up pretty fair now but it'll wear some o the scars long as it stands stay up there an let rafe put yuh down at the door as brace mightly intrigued by the news although still groggy from the blow delivered by the barrel of his own six-shooter crawled jerkily back to the driver's box intending to alight he hank down again at hallock's words and said i reckon yuh're right trigger legs wouldn't carry me this minute see yuh at the bar want a lift trigger invited sed- don more room than yuh can use thanks i'll walk hallock glanced at the crowd down in front of spokane harry's at the groups in the street who had witnessed blackfoot dixon's spectacular leap from the second floor of the dance hall the people began to disperse and go about their own busi- ness as seddon with a mighty yank got the leaders off the boardwalk and started in the right direction hallock left the street and jingled along the sidewalk toward the elkhorn bar his wire would be anxiously wait- ing it was a new and thrilling and al- together satisfying experience to have a woman waiting for a fellow with arm lips and soft arms and--real love then he thought with a sharp pain of regret of the pal who had died under his hand pore old reckless he muttered he shore would've been right in the thick o things that's been happening whang- in away with both hands he shore loved to fight the red-headed cuss he had visited the lone grave behind the shack he and brule had occupied for the first time that day and erected a rule headboard talking to the man under the sod as he worked engrossed in his thoughts hallock was nearing the elkhorn when on his right a figure grew suddenly out of the darkness stepping around the corner of the barber shop the light in the shop window reached just far enough to dimly reveal the dark indian features of blackfoot dixon and strike a dull plint from the long six-shooter with which he was covering the gunfighter now hallock yuh die snarled the breed by sam's gun too ain't that hell hallock though taken by surprise had his nerves well in hand his eyes nar- rowed dixon had a dead drop yuh killed chalk they been tellin me continued blackfoot an other pals o'mine--old len an coldiron an lew harney an them i wasn't in town or yuh'd been fightin me too glad i'm livin to get revenge for em hal- lock i hate yuhr guts if things had broke different if i had the time i'd roast yuh blackfoot style but  gotta be satisfied killin yuh ordinary hands to the buzzards an watch the ii'l hammer rise watch er close for when she falls yuh do i said hands up he repeated tensely yuh're too slick to be trusted with em down hallock had been steeling him- self for a supreme effort he was thankful for that light at his back dim as it was dixon stood within reach of hand or foot holding brace's gun low nearly on a line with his hip as if in obedience to dixon's rasping com- mand hallock's hands shot skyward and with the motion of lifting them he  two-gun western novels magazine kicked upward with his right foot the toe of his boot struck sharply the wrist of the desperado who was scarcely ex- pecting any movement from the region below hallock's belts and knocked the gun out of his hand dixon loosed a white man's oath hallock's hands dropped like a flash his right one to the belt sagging on the side and coming up with a gleam of steel yuhr turn to watch the hammer blackfoot the two-gun man hissed dixon did not cringe his beady eyes did not waver as he looked at the slow- lifting hammer go ahead an shoot an be damned hallock he said coolly i'm mostly white but there's enough blackfoot in me to make me take medicine like an indian hallock swiftly sheathed his colt stooped and recovered sam's iron which had fallen near his feet and ad- dressed the astonished breed dixon yuh may hate my guts as yuh say but i'm admirin yuhrs yuh shore ain't afraid an how yuh come to pal around with a yellow pup like chalk gallatin gets me plumb but that's nothin to do with us blackfoot it's in the cards that i'm to kill yuh--sometime--but not now can't do it after the way yuh just looked into that muzzle an not an eye flickerin we'll have to meet ag'in an finish it an likely i'm a fool for takin a chance on another time for yuh bein injun enough to die without whinin are also injun enough to think ambushin fair fightin now get the hell out the hatred had not died out of blackfoot's eye for all that his enemy had spared him as he turned and swiftly retreated up the alley in which he had waited for hallock to pass the gunfighter proceeded on his way to the elkhorn shaking his head he knew he was a fool for giving dixon another opportunity to get him but lion-hearted himself he could not break the temporary spell of admiration for similar courage displayed under test by the other had chalk gallatin's backbone stiffened at the time hallock faced him on the slope the bad cow- boy's death might have been less vio- lent--might have been for chalk had committed the unpardonable sin to the primitive mind especially the elemen- tal primitive mind of a man like hal- lock of manhandling a woman the woman he loved i'll tell sue about that dixon starin down death an paralyzin my trigger- finger for the first time he reflected an i won't tell nobody else he was but a few steps from the door of sam brace's saloon when he heard his name called hallock--wait the voice was somehow familiar he swung on his heel and saw a man run- ning toward him not until the man came up where the light from the open door of the elkhorn struck upon face and figure did hallock recognize him-- and then he did so with a start he had completely forgotten the young fellow in the gallery-box at spokane harry's with goldie the curly-headed young- ster who had had the presumption to point a sawed-off thirty-eight at hal- lock here he was smiling brazenly chapter x hallock opens a door yuh don't look a heap glad to see me mr hallock declared the young fellow with a west- ern drawl and in no tenderfoot tone as might have been expected yuh want to be careful how yuh go round pointin guns at folks replied hallock not knowing whether to be angry or otherwise some of em might not take it as a joke like i did when a texas town goes gun-crazy  studying the youth in a calmer mood especially the eyes and the firm chin the gunfighter decided there might be more iron in his system than appeared at first glance i wasn't meaning that as a joke hallock stated the young fellow boldly i made a mistake that was all thought yuh were a friend o dix- on's but the girl goldie told me dif- ferent an i called to yuh as yuh ran by the box that second time but yuh seemed in a hurry did yuh catch him who--blackfoot he's still foot- loose now brother before we swap any more talk i'll just break a rule o frontier etiket an ask yuh who an what a deputy sheriff's badge pinned in- side the youngster's vest gleamed in hallock's eyes an my label's billy edgelow sent up here by sheriff gran- ger to look--stop he exclaimed sharply lifting a palm in the oldtime peace sign of the plains to halt the downward sweep of hallock's hands i know who yuh are hair-trigger know yuhr record but i ain't after yuh hallock's suddenly tense body re- laxed again he even smiled a little yuhr rep as a gun-slinger ain't un- known to me either edgelow but i hadn't no idea yuh was so young my hat's off to yuh boy yuh've made a lot o cagey ones lay down an i notice now yuh're packin a reg'lar forty-five in a reg'lar belt where's the li'l thirty- eight inside my vest the place it

and he smiled engagingly i reckon yuh've been workin in the in- terest o law an order even if it was personal scores yuh were settlin f'r instance yuh finished the job the main job that brought me here in my pocket i got a useless warrant for mr chalk gallatin the hell yuh have hallock ex- ploded i mean he corrected him- self grimly he's in hell now an yuhr warrant shore is useless couldn't serve no paper there was it cause he ven- tilated the last town marshal derringer had that the law wanted him inquired hallock for one thing yeh nodded deputy edgelow but mainly for holdups on the sun canyon trail yuh remember several passengers were gunned in those holdups heard so i never figgered chalk was that lone bandit the stick-ups stopped about six months ago didn't they uh-huh well that's about the time chalk drifted in here how come yuh didn't nail him before then ques- tioned hallock lost track of him several weeks ago seth rawdon came up here to look over the two bar ranch when he returned to the county-seat he reported to the sheriff that he'd seen chalk in a saloon in this town he'd been a victim in one o chalk's holdups to the tune of a thousand dollars met yuh the same day in the same place recogniz- ing yuh from descriptions he'd heard said yuh could do sleight-o-hand with a gun i remember him hallock nodded slowly didn't know who he was an got suspicious he might be a deputy found he wasn't carryin a gun an when i told him it was tough country out to the two bar an he'd best get heeled he gimme a li'l sermon on livin by the trigger yuh bet i remember him--he was pretty near right name's rawdon eh came here to ask where he could hire a hoss did he buy the two bar  two-gun western novels magazine yeh last week he's there now an that dixon lifted--but i'll go on from the time rawdon vis- ited granger tellin chalk's where- abouts an how tough derringer was sheriff knew about the toughness an had meant for sometime to put the lid on up here as well as gun-totin hom- bres makin this town their headquar- ters an an honest man hardly safe in it cow rustlers an hoss thieves was raisin hell for the ranchers specially the two bar which was the reason the former owner was anxious to sell i was away in another part o the county when rawdon called but as soon as i came back sheriff started me on the trail ag'in i got here yesterday stopped at the two bar to see if raw- don had got hold of any more informa- tion that would help me he hadn't but he was in a terrible stew an his punchers too every last hoof had been rustled from the saddle-stock cor- ral they hadn't any hosses to follow a trail even if they could find one-- which they couldn't trail was pretty well covered an when i tell yuh that blackfoot dixon was one o the hoss thieves yuh'll understand why -- he used his injun tricks well i hunted round an hunted round an i struck it good bit luck although i've had a lotta experience trailin an learned more from the sheriff he's a wonder the trail led toward derringer an as i was cornin here anyways it suited me fine sighted the stolen hosses soon an the thieves two of em was careful not to let em see me though they took the hosses to a coulee about a mile south o this town a place where two men could stand off twenty easy count o the boulders around it i didn't tackle it one o the thieves when i got near enough i recognized as black- foot dixon mebbe yuh don't know it but blackfoot's wanted about as bad as chalk was -- year ago or more he roasted two placer miners at the stake an stole their dust on cougar creek that so well he expressed a heap o sorrow he wasn't in no position to give me a similar treat tickles the injun spots in him roastin hallock thought with a twinge of the manner of gallatin's deceasement and shut up abruptly the deputy picked up the narrative while i was watchin the coulee from a distance blackfoot rode off leavin his hoss stealin pardner with the broncs he headed for derringer an i trailed after it was gettin dark when we got here i saw him dodge into that honkytonk trailed in but couldn't see nothin of im so i hung around waitin for him to show up he must've spotted me while i was waitin shore he didn't see me when i was trackin him from the coulee as my badge was hid like it is now an i hadn't no idea blackfoot nor anybody in there knew me by sight never havin been up this way before i wasn't none cautious about paradin dance-hall girl the one yuh saw me with come up an asked me to buy her a drink not suspectin there was any plot afoot an not wantin to make any more enemies than neces- sary i treated then she suggested that we take a box an watch the show an have more drinks well she was kinda goodlookin but i don't care much for her kind an i wasn't on no pleasure trip but it struck me that she'd know about gallatin an likely could gimme a lotta useful information--if she would i'd try her i did i didn't drink much though she coaxed me makin me some suspicious an she didn't drink much which made me more suspicious couldn't guess her game though for she answered all my casual-like questions in a way i couldn't disbelieve told me yuh'd killed chalk after he'd run off with the girl yuh're now married to an about yuh downin when a texas town goes gun-crazy  eight-ten hard ones in the elkhorn by yuhr lonesome she didn't know where blackfoot was she said when i asked --an that's where she lied i know now he was listenin in the next box waitin for her signal i was lookin for him same time yuh was edgelow an saw him with his ears to the wall from a box across the hall i went right over know what that girl goldie's game was seein i wasn't goin to get drunk she pulled the curtains shut an come an set on my knees an started to get mushy i'm--well i'm human an i ain't an old man an she was pretty an soft like i say--soft on top she was but hard underneath that skirt while i was kissin her both arms around her slid one hand down an lifted my colt i felt it leavin the hol- ster tried to grab her arm but she jumps up an backward holdin it an calls blackfoot  sharp in he jumps gun in his fist lockin the door quick i made a dive for him as he turned from turnin the key we clinched in a mighty lovin clinch an i tore the gun away from him throwin it under the table goldie i'll say that for her didn't try to help him in the fight an she could've easy mebbe she was sorry she'd helped a breed ag'in her own race i dunno well we rassled all over that li'l box yuh betche an i was aim- in to get at that reserve thirty-eight in- side my vest the breed from bein pressed so close to me had felt it knew what i was tryin to do an tried to pre- vent it just about then yuh blowed the lock off the door dixon mebbe thought it was a good chance to escape or that somebody was gettin in to help me--i figgered it was somebody cornin to help him anyways he jerked himself loose as yuh smashed the lock an stam- peded right over yuh as yuh know even better than i do got my thirty-eight out but he was gone before i could fire then i lined yuh--an yuh walked off i reckon yuh're wiser now than yuh was before eh hallock keno how come yuh stayed in the box when i ran after blackfoot why goldie told me who yuh was --an she'd told me before that in speakin o gallatin that yuh an dixon was deadly enemies so i figured if any- body could corral blackfoot yuh could an then i had a few gentle words to pour in the lady's ear appertainin to her part in the game to colddeck me when i told her she was liable to arrest did she wilt like hell she called me some names i ain't never heard before an i thought i'd been dry behind the ears long enough to know em all course i didn't intend to arrest her-- i pity the pore devils--but i reckoned to throw a scare into her an keep her from tryin the game on somebody else but she didn't scare an inch sorry blackfoot got away he added when i went down to the street i heard some talk about him tryin to slope on the stage i looked for yuh knowin yuh'd know more about it than anybody an final i saw yuh walkin along here hallock nodded the injun's a devil-darin cuss jumped out the win- der o spokane's place onto the roof o the stage as it was passin by my father-in-law tried to hold him but couldn't an he beat it somewheres the gunfighter did not speak of the second meeting with blackfoot he stood thoughtfully a moment or two the deputy imitating him blackfoot's hoss gone from the hitchrack in front o spokane's that bein so mebbe he's rode out to join his pardner in that coulee i know where it is an what it's like--as yuh say a pretty good fort but they won't be stayin there long i reckon though before yuh come there wasn't any law hereabouts to bother em none aimin to drive em up to  two-gun western novels magazine the border an across into canada dontcha reckon yeh said edgelow take a sharp guy to get em by the mounties but blackfoot's sharp enough even if the other fellow ain't yuh want i should ride with yuh edgelow an help get the two bar hosses back if there's a way to do it we'll find the way the efficient deputy clapped a hand on his shoulder hallock i've been hopin yuh'd offer yuhr help ready to go hallock glanced toward the open saloon door yeh he said sud- denly i'll see my wife after we come back know where the sundown stage station is yuh must've rode past-- righto meet yuh at the corrals my hoss is there ten minutes later they were riding south on the moonlit plain deputy sheriff edgelow had been talking ever since they threw the town behind    an the reward money for chalk dead or alive is yuhrs o course one thousand offered by the county another thousand by wells fargo i'll have the sheriff send yuh a check soon's i get back well said hallock i ain't yet reached the stage where i'll turn down cold cash in fact i'm needin it more now than i ever did shore yuh are though i can't say from experience not bein hitched an that's all the more reason hallock why you should consider serious that pro- position to swear yuh in as a deputy o granger's he wants yuh man said he didn't believe yuh was half as black as painted-- i was though interrupted the two- gun man severely honest till the girl who's my wife took me in hand pretty wild yes edgelow but she's goin to gentle me to the bridle in time yuh see i don't like the deputy idea cause it'll mean i've got to keep on packin guns--an since i killed a pal by mis- take-- he paused and coughed to re- lieve the sudden tightness in his throat at the recollection of old reckless lying in his grave i know about that goldie told me the deputy's tone was sympa- thetic goldie said hallock in a minute or two shore must've poured her brains out of her mouth well then yuh know my reasons for wantin to discard guns i'm married an--the other thing yeh nodded the deputy yet was undeterred but hallock yuhr repu- tation is big enough for yuh to rest on it blackfoot dixon i reckon is about the last of yuhr real haters an we'll mebbe get him tonight it ain't likely that many will want a run-in with yuh knowin what mean lead yuh serve why hallock i'd be willin to bet any- thing almost that yuh won't have to pull a gun half a dozen times while yuh're in office the bad men rustlers an all of em will take a sneak out o yuhr part o missoula county--it wouldn't surprise me an if yuh do have to shoot why it'll be in the name o the law wearin a nickel badge an killin a man don't make no difference in the fact that yuh've killed him observed hal- lock with a logic that stunned but did not convince the younger man not that i'm gettin ree-ligious added the gunfighter with a short laugh though i've lately scrambled acquaintance with a preacher who rings the bell yuh ain't got any other job in mind have yuh young edgelow asked feeling that here was a clincher no said hallock an it's that fact only that keeps me from turnin yuhr deputy sheriffin offer down flat but all i know is how to play opry on when a texas town goes gun-crazy  colonel colt's harp-distributers an i got a wife to support i'll se what she says edgelow an of it's yes yuh can pin yuhr shiny badge on-- the thutting crack of a - finished for him the bullet plunked in the hard ground in front of them ahead lay the rockgrit coulee at once hallock swung down and backed happy hoofs well out of range leaving her standing with the reins hanging that's about as far as that win- chester'll throw em--where the bullet hit remarked hallock expertly judg- ing the distance to the coulee but bring yuhr hoss here alongside mine an he'll shore be safe hoss thief's got the edge on us grumbled the deputy as he followed hallock's advice i never thought to bring a rifle nor me said hallock but even if we had one i don't reckon it'd be much good feller's forted fine an he won't expose enough o himself for us to nick --not in this moon light daylight mebbe wonder if it's blackfoot-- though i never seen him handle any- thing but six-shooters--or the unknown guy by his lonesome seein two ridin toward him he knew even as far as we are from his fort that we wasn't friends if either one of us now--but mebbe black foot's joined him a'ready he's had time enough they squatted on their heels in silence the winchester in the coulee was also silent say hallock exclaimed suddenly i think i savvy how to get him i'll keep him busy in front here--or both of em whichever it is--an yuh crawl around to the other side o the coulee an get em in the flank how are yuh on snake imitatin good at snakin replied deputy edgelow without boast i'd thought o rear-attackin myself but we've been seen they know there's two of us an if one goes he'll be missed don't yuh believe it boy smiled hallock who could not forget edge- low's youthful appearance though there was not five year's difference in their ages i'll make em think we're both here on this spot an anxious to waste lead yuh recollect the old-time scout trick o shiftin base with each shot and at edgelow's quick nod he finished well start crawlin an i'll start shootin hallock stretched himself on his stomach in the bunch-grass a gun in each fist he fired with the right-hand weapon aiming in the direction of the coulee though for all the damage it would do he might just as well have fired straight up in the air the win- chester replied to the roar of the colt the lead thumping two or three yards away hallock rolled over rolled sev- eral feet and he did it so quickly that the detonation of the first shot had not died before it was caught up and pro- longed by the throbbing boom of a second belching from the left-hand gun meanwhile belly to the ground deputy billy edgelow was hitching his long slim body with painful slowness but steady progress over the sea of bunch-grass describing a wide semi- circle he could have wished for a moonless night for such work and blessed every cloud which for a mo- ment or two or longer swam across the face of the beaming satellite the gun fighter stuck to his guns literally for over a half hour he fired and rolled fired and rolled left to right and back again giving as good as imita- tion of two men shooting from different positions a few feet apart as two men could have done his cartridge belts were getting lighter he was glad he had two to keep up the bombardment young edgelow was a long time mak- ing the trip to the coulee but of course  two-gun western novels magazine he had to be careful that buckaroo soliloquized hal- lock as time ran on certain there was but one man coupla lulus slingin away all this good lead he ain't so strong on brains himself he remarked on second thought tryin to make that rifle carry the few extra yards it won't reach he's dumber than i am i reckon cause i don't expect to get no- wheres if that angel-face deputy-- the distant rumbling of a colt in the direction whence heretofore had sounded only the staccato voice of the winchester then silence hallock leaped up whooping jammed his smok- ing guns in their scabbards and ran to the horses hair-pinning the paint mare and with the reins of the deputy's mount bunched in his left hand he scudded across the plain as he gal- loped within hail of the coulee the tall lanky form of billy edgelow appeared in the moonlight running along the rim and waving triumphant arms got him he yelled to hallock one man but it wasn't blackfoot all the two bar hosses is down there twenty-five or thirty of em mrs tom hallock said yes in the matter of her husband wearing a deputy sheriff's badge for seventy-five dollar a month thereby astonishing billy edgelow whose hopes had gone a-glimmering when hallock left the decision up to his wife edge- low thought he knew something about women--and maybe he did something --but he had never before met the kind of a woman sue hallock was sue's reason for giving her consent were her own she knew you couldn't cure a drunkard by cutting off his liquor sup- ply all at once--you had to diminish it gradually her husband was in simi- lar case and would require similar treatment his killing impulse couldn't be uprooted suddenly but must be weeded by degrees the responsibili- ties of the deputy's office would teach him self-control hallock having sold the horse and effects of his late partner brule turned up at the northern pacific depot one morning the day after billy edgelow departed for the county-seat and ordered two tickets to deadwood ain't leaving us are you hallock the agent asked arching his brows i thought you were going to be a deputy sheriff around these parts am nodded hallock smiling don't lose no time gettin around news don't but i'm goin on my honeymoon first be gone about two weeks an when i come back the sheriff will be up here to swear me in ain't seen deadwood he added reminis- cently since i was pretty much of a kid got my bad start there but i've a hankerin to see the place ag'in specially jerry lewis's saloon where i used to serve drinks to wild bill hickok an calamity jane too will be interesting said the agent who did not seem at all interested in what hallock was saying but in some thought of his own say he spoke abruptly and leaned in the ticket win- dow close to the gunfighter have you been talking around about this trip to deadwood well i haven't hollered it from any roofs but it's been no secret why you never found blackfoot dixon no ain't laid eyes on him since the night he jumped out the honkytonk winder i suspect he's hidin close to town an his friends what's left of em uh-huh this may be a good tip or not hallock but pat brand--used to be a friend of len roper's and none of yours--was here yesterday and bought three sections to deadwood on the same train you're taking what do you think of that maybe blackfoot's one of the six when a texas town goes gun-crazy  mebbe he is hallock's smile did not weaken mebbe it's an exo-dus like i heard a preacher say once the boys don't like the idea o me deputy sheriffin knowin i'll make em behave i reckon or mebbe his lips tighten- ing they figger to down me on the train when i ain't lookin i'll watch sharp an thank yuh for tellin me that night when hallock and his bride boarded the eastbound six undesirable citizens of derringer got on too thinking themselves un- observed sam brace and cale hal- pin who were at the depot to see the couple off did not remark then nor did sue but hallock did for he was watching and noted that they climbed into the smoker he smiled grimly he had kept the agent's information to himself i reckon i'll take a smoke while our bunks is bein made up sue hallock remarked about an hour later as they were roaring across the bunch-grass plains sue suspected nothing though she had wondered a bit why he wore his guns as usual under his coat hallock made his way to the smoker the instant he entered the car a shot rang out from the other end it was so unexpected that he could have done nothing voluntarily to save himself but as the gun spouted the train tore round a curve jerking hallock off his feet he went almost to his knees then straightened and sweeping back his coat and pulling his guns in two flash- ing motions he covered the locality of his half dozen enemies in seats close together blackfoot was the one who had fired he was kneeling on a seat facing hallock his gun arm resting on the back of it striding down the aisle six-shooters leveled hallock called to the other disturbed passengers this ain't a holdup friends just hold yuhr seats an duck yuhr nuts lay plumb low there's six gents in this car that wants to get off an i'm invitin em to step into the aisle and mosey out to the platform before lead starts singin blackfoot yuh can keep that gun--but not in yuhr hand blackfoot holstered it caught un- der hallock's drop the six gunmen stepped into the aisle as directed and filed to the vestibule hallock thrust one gun in its scabbard closed behind them the door into the car then pushed by pat brand and blackfoot and the rest and opened the vestibule door one at a time gents purred hal- lock it's take a chance or stand an take it pat brand first in line sprang out as hallock's gun prodded him they heard no sound but the roaring of the train blackfoot dixon next cursed the gunfighter savagely--in the white tongue--and hurled himself outward to be engulfed by the darkness an- other man leaped a scream floated back to the men on the platform three waiting apprehensively to follow the man who had cried out the fourth in merciless mood again inexorable as the last man jumped hallock slammed shut the vestibule door sheathed his other gun and re-entered the smoker some passengers just got off he said when he stood beside his wife but--we didn't stop at any sta- tion her eyes widened in surprise they choosed just the same to get off persisted hallock blackfoot dixon an pat brand an friends six of em oh comprehension filled her fine eyes she detected now the dying red flicker in his she put a hand on his shoulder tom do you realize this is our honymoon and hallock unable to fathom her expression wondered if she were re- proving him he unbuckled his gun belts one after the other no manbreakers wanted by  w h b kent beyond the brimstone border these two hard-bitten badmen could test their deadly gunswift against ranger john stark the human colt-arsenal from arizona the girl stared speechless horrified lean dark hawk-faced john stark of the rangers arizona terri- tory sat on the counter of the sacatone trading company sacatone city he rolled the rowels of his straight shanked spurs up and down the boards below and reached into the sugar barrel for a lump of brown sugar the sugar disappeared into a wide thin-lipped mouth and he cocked a dark eye at his friend the clerk well fat he asked what you been doing the clerk short fat and intensely serious answered john i been think- ing stark brought up another lump of sugar and told the clerk that won't get you nowhere fat the clerk stopped to look over his glasses suspiciously he asked what  no manbreakers wanted  won't get me nowheres stark said thinking the clerk said hump in an ex- asperated voice then stark said don't tell me they bought cartridges canteens and canned tomatoes the clerk stopped wandering around and looked at the ranger he asked they who then he added thoughtfully there was only one of them there was a lightning gleam in the ranger's eyes he asked stranger slim middle height light eye- brows the clerk looked surprised and asked how'd you know stark said i didn't know i was just hoping then he asked you didn't see the horse the clerk answered regretfully no i didn't john then he said but he bought two canteens and enough stuff for two stark nodded to that guess he's what i'm looking for they robbed the bank in tucson three of them they shot the cashier but somebody got one of them as they was getting out of town i lost them up in the foothills in the dark and thought i'd make a try for here one of em was wounded the fat clerk's eyes had opened wide as he asked you don't say and shot the cashier how much did they get away with stark said i didn't wait to find out then he asked how long ago and which way did he head fat told him early this morning and he pulled out for the river he spoke thoughtfully canteens and tomatoes and there's water between here and the mexican border he thrust a fat finger at the ranger and pronounced they're heading for the desert first stark nodded to that and slid off the counter he said get me some to- matoes fat the clerk nodded and walked around behind the counter muttering my my and shot the cashier the ranger spoke seriously just the same fat some of these ginks you tip off to me are going to get wise some- day and then where'll you be fat said hump me in a vindic- tive voice reached under the counter and brought out a double barreled sawed off shot gun he said take a look stark spoke in mock seriousness but don't put the butt against your stomach fat when you let fly both barrels the clerk ignored that to suddenly shout but my my i forgot listen john old turkey tracks that old pros- pector and his granddaughter they left for the desert yesterday was go- ing to fill their burro kegs at the river and hit the desert last night the ranger's quizzical eyes sobered he shook his head muttering softly that cooks it they're two tough hombres bad ones he started for the door throwing over his shoulder adois fat i'll come and tell you about it the clerk spoke comfortably sure you will john stark of the rangers pushed open the screen door and his slitted eyes fought the searing glare of the sun of southern arizona a great bay horse at the hitch rail lifted a splendid head to look at him and nickered softly the horse walked along the one dusty street of sacatone city tossing his head rolling the curb wheel over his tongue men dragging spurs along the uneven board walk looked at the big bay horse and the hawk-faced ranger some waved calling out jovially hi  two-gun western novels magazine john others whispered to each other who the hell's he after now they went past the cool caverns of the livery barn turned to the left and rode up a long slope short grey green live oaks stood around in the short brown grass up to the right the tumbled foothills of the cholla range rose up to be the gaunt ribs of the great peak of the chollas far up blackish juniper bushes ran up into the pinon belt and then the black band of the pines was drawn like a shawl around the throat of the ancient fire tortured peak stark talked to the horse softly this will be four times we chased somebody out into that damn desert mebbeso our luck will hold a little later he spoke again we've known old turkey tracks for years but i don't savvy the granddaughter but mebbeso we did hear about a daughter tucked away somewhere the big bay flicked his little pointed ears and stepped out briskly they came to the crest of the long slope and looked down on the mesquite flats of the rio sacatone and over a thin string of green leaved walnuts to the desert for mile on mile the desert rolled away to the horizon red and brown with leperous white patches of alholi the heat waves shimmered and shifted and the desert seemed to roll and heave like some treacherous re- pulsive sea away off at the end of the world a blue line lay between desert and sky the faraway hills stark was thinking little water only enough for a few head of horses the horse went on down the tuscon road into the mesquite flats along the river every footfall lifted little balls of white dust that hung in the air they turned off the road into a trail that wound around through the mesquite and catclaw and over to the river there was water there a shallow stream that sparkled in the sunlight across the river stark slid off the horse and began to hunt signs he quickly found the place where turkey tracks the old prospector had stopped for awhile the mark of the water kegs was plain where they had been filled four burros he told himself and fol- lowed the trail a little way old tur- key tracks on foot and the girl riding the old fool dragging his grand- daughter into the desert then he grinned and thought if she looks like old turkey tracks she might as well be in the desert as anywhere he came back to the river bank and began casting about for the tracks of two horses he thought i know these horse tracks followed them far enough to it was sometime before he found where two horses had come out of the river his lean dark face lightened with pleasure then darkened in disap- pointment they were not the same horses he thought they could have got fresh horses out of the an pasture after a little he shook his head mut- tering but i've got to be sure he found where a man had squatted on his heels by the river perhaps to fill canteens he followed that back into the brush there he found what he wanted in the dust under a mesquite bush was the clear print of the back of a man a man had laid there at full length on his back waiting for the man at the river what brought the gleam of delight to stark's eyes was that the man's left hand rear pocket had been half torn down the mask of the torn pocket was quite clear stark walked briskly back to the big bay that's him he told the horse that's the wounded one i saw that torn pocket in the dirt yes- terday afternoon no manbreakers wanted  stark slid up unto the horse rode up out of the brush through a thicket of ocatilla cactus and the desert was before him he was thinking they haven't water enough to reach the far- away hills neither have i but mebbeso they don't know it old turkey tracks has enough though then he thought of the grand- daughter out there on the desert--and those two waterless killers coming on her with slitted eyes the manhunter rode out onto the desert out in the desert two men riding westward hard-eyed men with mean tight mouth a heavy-set man with a week's beard on a beefy face rode tilted over in the saddle he had rigged a rope sling that ran from the saddle horn down under his left knee holding it up he held to the saddle horn with both hands his face was drawn with pain the other was younger slim with light hair and eyes his eyebrows were so light as to be unnoticeable giving the light eyes a curiously snakelike look a bundle in a grain sack was tied securely behind the saddle the heavy one felt gingerly of his wounded leg cursed and complained i'm thinking we'd a done better to have hit it for the border this ain't no good the younger one snarled and cursed oh lay off me this is the way we planned it ain't it that damned ranger has hightailed it for the border we figured that all out didn't we the wounded man grumbled again what'd you want to beef that cashier for slim that'l get us in trouble yet slim cursed and pulled up his horse to stare with mad unblinking eyes will you shut your yawp or will i shut it for you the wounded man groaned and tried to ease his leg after a little he said what say we take a little water slim yelled at him no i done told you we ain't drinking till night and damn little then the wounded man mopped his dirty sweaty pain drawn face and mumbled something then he looked back over his shoulder when slim saw the wounded man look back over his shoulder he too looked back the wounded man mumbled do you reckon we ditched that damn ranger slim said sure but there was no conviction in his voice they plodded on into desert the sun dropped lower and lower ahead of them sending its searing heat into their red faces they rode up short rocky slopes and down the other side they rode around clumps of ocatills and pickly pear and past the whitish groups of the poisonous cholla red lizards ran on hot red rocks and stared at them from beady little eyes they skirted while alholi sinks and the white dust burned cracked lips and their red in- flamed eyes were painful the horses traveled with lowered listless heads black streaks of wet sweat ran down from under the saddle blankets the wounded man grumbled again his mouth twisting with pain by gawd this leg hurts then he said if you hadn't acted like a crazy fool and gone to shooting we'd a got twice what we did and we wouldn't a lost joe and i wouldn't a got this leg slim snarled go on go on keep yawping suddenly the wounded man pulled up his horse his voice was hoarse as he shouted by gawd i can't stand it i gotta have water and i'm going to he unslung the canteen from his sad- dle horn held it up by his ear and shook it he said gawd an began to drink he drank thirstily deeply  two-gun western novels magazine drew a great sigh of relief and drank again slim had quit shouting he hissed at him now go on go on go on and drink it up then see what hap- pens to you he eyed the wounded man hating him telling him and if you think you gets a whack at my can- teen you're a damn fool the wounded man held the empty canteen to his ear and shook it he turned it up to his mouth again waiting to see if more water ran out con- vinced it was empty he took it away from cracked lips and looked around he saw only the empty desert and a hot red sun sinking in the horizon his bloodshot eyes came back to slim his eyes came away from slim's glaring eyes quickly and slid down to the canteen hanging on slims saddle he muttered i'm wounded and i'm going to need water slim snarled at him jeering sure you're going to need water and try and get it they kicked up their listless horses and plodded on into the sunset from time to time they looked back over their shoulders they rode down a rocky slope and crossed a wide sandy wash the wounded man said there's been water here sometime slim said yeah mebbeso year be- fore last and mebbeso year after next why don't you wait here the wounded one muttered damn you they started up the farther slope and the wounded one said you ride ahead slim my horse'll travel easier if you give him a lead slim snarled me ride ahead of you and get shot in the back the other man said aw now slim what's the good of talking that way we're in this fix together ain't we slim said it's you that's in the fix i ain't in no fix the wounded one said well damn you they went over the crest into the sun and slim half yelled look the wounded one crowded his horse up close to look down at a string of burro tracks slim said burros he rode along the trail peering intently four burros he said fresh a little later he pronounced and a man on foot some old desert rat of a pros- pector the two men looked at each other delight and hope growing in bloodshot eyes the wounded one half whispered there'll be water on them burros slim said surest thing you know without another word they started trailing the burros even the horses seemed to have taken heart from some- thing on occasional level stretches they trotted the wounded man asked how far you think he is ahead of us slim slim said can't be far them is fresh tracks and burros travel slow they kicked at their horses and got a little speed out of them just under the crest of a ridge they went slowly edging up to the top slowly looking ahead intently the sun had dropped into the head haze and seemed to hang here blood red enorm- ous the wounded one cursed the sun bitterly for being there blinding their eyes to what they hoped to see up on the ridge they sat their horses and peered from hand shaded eyes into the sunset searching the desert looking for a little string of four plodding burros slim said we better ride follow the trail long as we can see afore dark the other nodded and turned his head to look back to the east relieved at turning his smarting eyes away from no manbreakers wanted  the sun he started to turn his eyes away and then held them staring out over the back trail a long time slim snarled what's eating you come on the other muttered i seen some- thing he kept on staring and then spoke more firmly there tis slim brought his horse up to the other asking impatiently where's what the other pointed a dirty finger see he said jest below that little red mesa can't you see it moving now it's gone wait slim spoke impatiently oh hell come on you're seeing things the other pointed again his voice animated there look quick you got him against that white ledge slim looked a long time then un- der his breath he said i git it it's a man horseback the other spoke their common thought it couldn't be that damn ranger slim said hell no we didn't come that way we came from off to the left that man ain't trailing us more'n likely he's somebody like us on the dodge the other said yes we did too that's jest the way we come they looked at each other then the wounded one said that damned ranger is on our trail they turned their horses then to fol- low the burro trail slim said we gotta get that desert rat's water with plenty a water we can lay out and am- bush that damn ranger with him gone and plenty water we are sitting pretty the wounded one pleaded now we're going to have water slim give me a mite of yourn slim snarled at him no we ain't got that water yet and i ain't aiming to take no chances he kicked up his horse spurring him cruelly carefully looking back to watch the wounded one snarling at him hit some life in that plug can't you going to be dark di- rectly on another ridge they looked back again into the dusky twilight shadows the blood red sun after seeming to hang a long time stationary above the horizon had dropped beyond the dim line of the faraway hills the long black shadows of sunset went out too and a grey silent dusky lay over the desolate land the wounded one said mebbe he'll lose our trail in the night slim spurred his horse again sav- agely snarling come on damn that ranger he won't lose nothing--cept his life two hours after sunrise old turkey tracks and his granddaughter made camp a ledge of red sandstone promised shade for all day the little white haired old prospector stumped around busily unpacking four mouse colored burros he placed two water kegs carefully in the shade talking more to himself than to the girl hell now ann he said which kag did we use of last gotta keep em even the girl smiled saying can't you talk at all granddad without saying hell the old desert rat answered quite seriously hell yes the girl threw up her lovely head and laughed the old man looked at her for a minute then chuckled the girl was dressed in blue jeans and heavy shoes a blue jean jumper covered a flannel shirt she swept off a wide brimmed black hat and the desert sun warmed her hair to spun copper she busied herself unsaddling her saddle burro then walked around after wood she came back with an armful of dead ocatilla stalks remark-  two-gun western novels magazine ing those hills look just as far away as ever the old desert rat chuckled hell yes he said that's the way it is in the desert but we'll pull out late this afternoon and we'll be in them faraway hills come noon tomorrow he went on you throw some grub together ann while i look after the burros as he walked away he stopped and told her you can have all the water you want now ann plenty to last us through from here hell yes the girl made a fire and fixed bacon and coffee and biscuits in a dutch oven when it was ready she rested it began to seem a long time that the old man had gone she put the breakfast close to dying fire and walked around to the end of the red ledge the sun struck her a hot blow the four mouse-colored burros stood half on a little hillside completely in- different to the world they were so used to she called out granddad there was not even an echo her voice seemed to fall flat dead as if she had never spoken suddenly she realized the vastness the desolation the loneliness of the desert she walked hurriedly back to the little bed of white ashes after a moment of uncertainty she pulled her grand- fathers short - winchester from the scabboard on her saddle and stood it up against a rock then she smiled saying stupid he'll be here in a minute she stood listening intently then she heard a rock roll and smiled with relief she laid out tin plates and cups and heard more rocks roll she heard horses but had no time to sort out the noises a horse snorted and she whirled wide eyed to see a man on a horse the man's lips were cracked and his bloodshot eyes were fastened on the water kegs he croaked gawd he began to climb off the half dead horse looking at the girl without seeing her he croaked water damn you water the girl continued to stare horrified then her face flushed with quick sym- pathy she said yes yes there's plenty of water she picked up a small pail and filled it hurriedly from a keg but not too much she warned the girl watched the man drink drink avidly drunkenly tipping the little pail higher and higher the water ran around his mouth and down over his chin she took hold of the pail warning him that's enough wait a while the man took the pail from his mouth his light eyes went insane with rage and he struck the girl savagely then he put the pail back to his mouth the girl stood back her face an angry red she put her hand up to her cheek where she had been struck and her blue eyes turned purple then she thought the poor man he's crazy another horse came on stumbling feet and a heavy set man with his leg tied to the saddle horn was struggling with the rope he slid off the horse his wounded leg collasped and he fell at full length he got painfully to his hands and knees staring bleary eyed up at the man drinking he croaked give me that water slim then he began fumbling for his six-shooter and pointed it unsteadily at slim slim took the empty pail from his face and drew a deep breath he looked at the man on the ground yelled you would would you and kicked the man's six-shooter from his hand then he brutally kicked the poor man in the face slim held the pail out to the girl ordering her fill it no manbreakers wanted  the girl pale-faced looked at slim with growing fear and loathing she filled the pail again ignoring slim and walked over to the man on the ground she helped him to his knees and then held the pail to his gasping lips after a long drink she took it away and the man reached for it roughly he pulled it away from the girl spilling half of it and began drinking again in great gasping gulps the girl picked up the six-shooter the heavy colt gave her assurance slim looked at her with a crooked grin then his eyes began to take her in he noticed the long legs the swelling breasts under the blue jumper he leered at her asking where'd you come into this the girl faced him my grand- father will be here in a minute slim leered at her asking will he the girl was suddenly filled with in- tolerable fear the man's voice carried an assurance that her grandfather would not come back would never come back slim stepped over to the wounded man and yanked the pail away he held it out to the girl ordering her fill it the girl said i won't and lifted the pistol like a flash slim was on her wrenching the gun from her hand twisting her arms up behind her back until she gasped with pain then yanked her back to his horse undid the rope and tied her hands tripped her up and tied her feet she set up and heard the wounded one say i seen him back there did you plug him slim answered casually naw i slugged him but he'll croak out there in the sun the girl struggled with her faintness and horror they watered their horses and had to fight them brutally to keep them from drinking themselves to death they looked at the breakfast waiting by the bed of ashes slim said we'll have a big feed afterward we got to git busy now the wounded one hobbled around groaning he said that water done me a lot of good it ain't so bad then he asked what we going to do with the gal slim answered we ain't going to do nothing he snarled the gal goes with me the other man half closed his blood- shot eyes asking yeah slim said yeah slim dropped that to say i ought to ave dragged that old rat off our trail now we'll have to go out beyond him to waylay that damn ranger if he's still looking for us they moved over to their horses the girl heard them and a great hope came to her she heard them say ranger and that they were going to waylay the ranger and kill him she closed her eyes and prayed for the ranger a rock rolled and like a flash the men were behind their horses six- shooters ready snarling like trapped coyotes the girl opened her eyes and saw her grandfather coming around the end of the ledge coming on stumbling feet groping in the hot sunlight his white hair was black with dried blood he was mumbling ann ann annie girl the wounded robber sniggered well look who's here we got com- pany ain't we then he snarled thought you croaked him this time we'll make it stick the girl struggled frantically with the ropes that held her she was frantic with fear and horror not believing that such horrible things could really hap- pen she yelled at the outlaws you'll  two-gun western novels magazine pay for this you let him alone you let him alone i tell you the old man paid no attention to the outlaws he hardly seemed to see them he came struggling on his eyes wavering around in search of the girl he passed close to slim slim raised his six-shooter a crazy light in his whitish eyes the girl screamed and a cold voice snapped out of the air to say drop it with incredible swiftness slim whirl- ed and shot from the hip and shot again the wounded one sank to one knee shooting out from under his horse the horse reared and jumped and came down with both fore feet on the man knocking him down slim was crouching shooting at a tall dark hawk-faced man who came forward with a gun in each hand the roar of the shots echoed against the ledge and a little stream of sand poured down over the edge the man knocked flat by the horse got to his knees again and began groping around for his gun the wild sound of the shots cleared old turkey tracks brain and he grabbed up his rifle from where the girl had left it as the wounded man re- covered his gun and began to lift it old turkey tracks dropped him neatly turkey tracks turned the rifle on slim and then lowered it slim had dropped his gun he stood there his hands at his side looking profoundly astonished as though some incredible thing had happened to him he was dead before he hit the ground old turkey tracks let out a croaked yell dropping the rifle to grab at the man hell he yelled it's stark john stark of the rangers they talked it over all day long in the shade of the ledge old turkey tracks with a bandage around his white head john stark with his dark eyes following the girl the girl with demure eyes sometimes letting him see her thoughts no old turkey tracks pro- nounced we're going on there's water enough to git us to the faraway hills and git you back to the sacatone hell i've got something good this time he boasted the ranger and the girl looked at each other and smiled these old prospectors always had something good they packed and saddled at sunset to go their own ways in the cool of the night john stark asked old turkey tracks when will you be in tucson again the old desert rat started to scratch his head and remembered his wound hell he said reckon we'll have to come in after grub in about a month john stark was up on the big bay looking down at the girl he told old turkey tracks you report at head- quarters when you get in he kept his eyes on the girl's eyes as he said those are orders old turkey tracks chuckled hell he said why not the girl flushed and her eyes clung to his she nodded her head as though agreeing to something yet unspoken i'll see that he does she said empty saddles mean war by  morse chandler author of when a colt-loose kid hits leather etc the kid had been an outlaw only four hours and his heart and his gunhand hadn't had a chance to harden the pursuit was hammering hard on his trail the soldado mountains were safe only for those outside the pale of the law a kind of hole in the wall of new mexico this thought was uppermost in the mind of kid mccord as standing beside his red roan in the shelter of a rocky out- crop he watched the covered wagon crawl up the steep grade the team straining valiantly in response to whip and shout neither the outfit nor its driver a timeworn stetson-crowned individual had for mccord more than passing interest what had magnetized his attention rowelled his curiosity was the slim girlish figure occupying the other half of the wagon-box the soldados haven of cattle rustler road   two-gun western novels magazine agent and killer were no place for women especially one with such a face as the girl beside the old-timer had as the wagon reached the top of the grade and rolled out upon the level the old man whoa-ed loudly and let the reins fall

shaggy brows the fine-figured horseman whose cowpunch garb in such a neighborhood meant nothing he might be a rustler road agent anything however the old man's scrutiny was rather satisfy- ing particularly of the mccord level eyes and firm mouth no hint of guile or cruelty in either he wore but one gun and that untied and a rawhide riata neatly coiled in the tie-straps he didn't look by any means deadly and this was a domain of lawless men replied the kid almost unconscious of the inspection by reason of a back- thrown sunbonnet which disclosed masses highly piled of corn-colored hair

some more sun's goin down what say we camp yonder by that crick an sorta talk things over he quailed in his heart to think what might befall a girl of june earp's appearance far back in the range where rustlers and train robbers and hombres of like outlaw professions had their camps earp himself could take chances but it wasn't fair to allow the girl to do the same the kid had been an outlaw only four hours and his conscience hadn't had a chance to toughen--nor his heart earp agreed to the suggestion that they camp darkness found the three of them gathered around a small fire the girl did the cooking and it was mighty eatable thought the kid he watched her constantly his wide stetson brim disguising the fact and empty saddles mean war  wondered if her reticence meant that she had taken a dislike to him if he had killed so had her father earp waxed talkative over his pipe while june was clearing up crime of any kind was evidently new to him and he was glad to have a kindred ear in which to pour the details feller ranchin near me in cactus valley tried to make up to june there i always thought he was a snake an bjected warned him to let her alone she didn't like him no mor'n i did but he kep cornin to see her now an then final i told him i'd shoot if he set foot on my premises ag'in he didn't say nothin when he went away that time it ought've warned me but my skull was too thick he waited till i was off on the range s mornin come to my place an put his dirty paws on my june tried to carry her off by god well by luck she got a-hold o a gun an drove him away he han- dled her so rough she fainted after he'd gone an that's the way i found her she didn't want to tell me what'd hap- pened knowin i'd swore to kill--but it was an easy guess for me an i oiled up my shooter went right after the polecat over to his ranch havin first some leetle difficulty shakin off june-- for my sake not t'other feller's i found gant at his place an i looked at him through the smoke then i rode back an got my wagon an june an hit the trail for here the kid was looking at him with a puzzled expression as he finished his narrative gant you said the hom- bre's name was--joe gant yeh joe gant know him some what time you kill him earp hooked the pipe out of his mouth staring in turn what time why well about three hours ago joe gant the kid leaned for- ward why earp i hung that galoot to the cottonwood front of his house easy four hours ago not joe gant you didn't earp shook his head positively i know-- what's that he broke off as a great clamor arose down by the pass that gave entrance to the soldados both earp and the kid cocked their ears numerous hoofs were beating on the flinty trail coming up and toward them hossmen said earp an cattle added the kid rus- tlers drivin in swiped stock that hap- pens right along in these mountains they're safe from the sheriff once they're through that pass ain't it a danged shame began earp himself a ranchman in a small way and then thought of his own loss of honest citizenship on the range his descent to the level or below of these cattle-lifters approaching he became suddenly silent and dropped his head june standing by and comprehend- ing swiftly stooped and laid a com- radely hand on his shoulder she would share his exile she who had been the indirect cause of it earp lifted his head at her touch his eyes warming with affection the kid witness to this brief bit of heart-play half rose to his feet as the trampling of the cattle punctuated by the lighter staccato of swift-footed ponies drew nearer they'll pass by on the trail but they can see over here plumb plain he crisped best they shouldn't know you're hereabouts miss earp at the kid's words her father started up mccord's right jump in the wagon june that'll sure hide you she turned to comply slowly as if she did not share the apprehension of the men she didn't thought the kid because she did not realize the gravity of her position here in this stronghold of lawless men as the girl disappeared  two-gun western novels magazine through the rear opening in the wagon cover the hooking lowing herd crowded past on the rock trail fifty yards or so from the camp of the earps and mccord the kid and old ezra were hunched over the fire apparently conversing but in reality listening and hoping that none of the horsemen convoying the herd would take it into their heads to ride over ordinarily the earp-mc- cord camp would not have been both- ered it was an unwritten law of the lawless who lived in the soldados that none of the many camps distributed through the mountains should molest or interfere in any way with one an- other one camp might be that of cat- tle rustlers another road agents an- other smugglers all engaged in separate criminal callings but all living to- gether as in one great rock fort for mutual protection but one member of this particular stock-stealing gang re- turning from a raid was a curious in- dividual a minder of other people's business the covered wagon caught his eye as he was riding by at the tail of the herd it looked like newcomers to the stronghold of the hunted a wagon was an uncommon sight here he wondered what was in it once his curiosity was aroused he must some- way satisfy it he spurred from his position in the drag out among the boulders to the open space where the fire burned the kid and ezra earp turned their heads as the horseman slashed in with a strident howdy he pulled up got down his glance trailing rapidly over the two faces that were unfamiliar to him then resting a long moment on the wagon beyond the fire just get in said the rustler push- ing back his mexican sombrero gun- runnin jerking his head toward the wagon well snakes as he spat the exclamation he bent over his eyes lighting fastened on something beside the fire to the left of earp earp and the kid shifted their eyes following his glance a sun-bonnet-- june's she'd dropped it and they hadn't noticed the kid could have kicked himself--and ezra where had their eyes been the mexican-hatted waddy squatted down mightily interested he was a white man though he affected greaser gear even to chihuahua spurs so he said in an oily voice you're bring- in a moharrie in eh where's she at don't be stingy hombres let's see-- that was as far as he got he was next to the kid who suddenly lifted with a growl deep in his throat and falling on the rustler beat him flat and insensible with the barrel of his quickly drawn pistol you see said mccord standing above the senseless form what would happen to your girl earp if you shoved on into the mountains you-- from out of the darkness uptrail the direction taken by the cattle thieves a voice bawled hey brazos you cornin what's keepin you a streak of fortune thought the kid who had acted on hot impulse that the other tail-rider had not seen his com- rade struck down mccord was quick witted he foresaw dire calamity to the earps--to june earp--if brazos did not rejoin his gang immediately instantly the kid called i'm cornin in the best imitation of brazo's voice he could muster not a good imitation by any means but passable on account of the noise made by the cattle blun- dering along in the dark stooping mccord snatched the big sombrero from the fallen man tossed his own hat at earp's feet and hissed take it my hoss an your girl an yourself an quit these mountains pronto an stay out if you got any empty saddles mean war  love for her an i reckon you have hide somewheres near the pass an i'll join you later he stood up then brazos conical bullion-trimmed hat down about his ears and jumped for the waddy's horse swung up and rode for the main trail leaving a much perturbed and marvel- ing earp squatting by the fire chapter ii the kid could have made a get- away aided by the darkness and the confusion attending the drive over the rough dark trail at almost any moment after he quit earp but he didn't try he would be chased and the only way out of the soldados by the pass led past the late scene of his impulsive knockdown he wanted the earps to have ample time to clear the dangerous neighborhood and hoped old ezra would have the sense to tie up brazos before leaving the campsite the outlaw would not have remained unconscious very long doing his part and more kid mc- cord hung on as drag-rider of the stolen herd through semi-darkness that some- times led up and sometimes down but seldom straightaway there was a full moon but little of its light reached the twisting trail steep walls on either hand for more than half the distance to the waddy rendezvous were respon- sible for this blocking of the moon- light but the rock formation was in another way an assistance to the gang keeping the cattle from scattering the cows go only forward or backward and the rustlers prodded them steadily for- ward in less than an hour lights flashed ahead it was a little rockbound side valley flooded with moonlight into which the herd emerged there were two or three shacks in the open doors and windows of which the lights gleamed and several large stockade corrals into these latter the cattle were punched and penned up they filled two of the corrals and the kid a top hand when he was working at his regular business estimated their num- ber at three or four hundred quite a bunch at one swipe some rancher back in cactus valley was sore that night he'd bet on it the kid because of the strenuous saddlework required en route to the waddy camp had been able to avoid conversation or contact with his com- panion in the drag a foul-mouthed hombre who had gone about his work with oaths and obscenity dripping con- tinually off his chin now in camp and the cattle safely impounded prob- ably to await alteration of their brands on the morrow the rustlers would gather together and the kid's thin dis- guise would be penetrated his eyes sought the dark avenue by which he had entered this side valley he might have made a dash for it but several riders were in between anyhow a sudden dash might not be the best way to go about it he hadn't a doubt that the mounted men carried rifles in their saddle boots and a bullet from a win- chester would be more effective in head- ing him off than horsemen across his path only a novice could have missed in the strong moonlight so the kid debated with a cool brain he'd have to sidle nearer to the out trail before he ran now the men were getting off their horses which behooved him to think and act quickly if he didn't dismount too they'd get suspicious but he must stick to the horse if he hoped to escape he was riding by one of the shacks while his mind churned over the situation and a man standing in the doorway drew the kid's atten- tion  two-gun western novels magazine  lo brazos called the man see you made a pretty fair gatherin point over here i want to see you the kid was in for it but he mo- mentarily forgot the pressing peril when he glanced at the speaker the voice had sounded somehow familiar a glance in its direction well nigh stunned him the light from the shack revealed the owner of the voice as joe gant ranchman of cactus valley the same man the kid had treated to a strangulation jig that afternoon the man ezra earp declared he had drilled with a six-shooter there was no mis- take--joe gant as large as life and in perfect health apparently when two men could have sworn on a stack of bibles that they had put him over the jump you hear me brazos or you got mud in your ears shouted gant an- grily for the kid was riding on the kid made no reply--in words he acted slid down apache-style on the far side of his horse hanging by hand and toe and struck into a gallop in the hand he wasn't using to hold on he gripped his colt and he fired under the horse's neck but missed it would take practice to shoot accurately in this unaccustomed position and before he could launch a second shot gant moved hurriedly away from the door realizing what a fine target he made from inside the shack gant shouted at the top of his leather lungs after him boys if that's brazos he's gone loco but i reckon it ain't brazos some- body else wearin his hat the hat in question had dropped from the kid's head as he swung down it was much too big and he didn't need it any longer what he wanted was room and he proceeded to get it for himself by firing at the two rustlers back in their saddles at the first shot who now tried to bar his way he must have hit the right-hand rider for the fellow doubled up in the saddle the other swerved and the kid pounded by shooting again under the horse's neck the upright waddy was swing- ing his gun as the kid sped on trying to locate some portion of the flying horseman's anatomy where he might place a bullet by the time he had decided to shoot the horse first and its rider afterward both had vanished through the dark outlet down the high- walled trail but the vanishing of the kid didn't end it nobody had an idea who he was except that he must be an enemy somebody masquerading in brazos slayden's hat every man had remounted one or two had had the saddles off their cayuses they slapped them on again gant ran down to the horse-corral and got himself a horse the pursuit strung out of the rockbound side valley and one two three up to a dozen along the trail traveled by the kid on his part the kid was exulting the hard job had been getting out with them behind him he had a plan for jacking up the pursuit had no in- tention of leading them through the pass near which he had told earp to seek concealment so when the pur- suing hoofs were striking sparks from the rocks uncomfortably close in his wake the kid executed his stunt he dismounted with his horse going at full speed drove it down a draw and let the pursuit sweep after it while he himself proceeded on foot toward the pass it was about two hours from the time he quit the waddy camp on the run that mccord more than a little footsore from walking rock in high heels arrived at the pass into--also out of--the soldados passing the for- mer camp-site of the earps and him- self--he had seen from the trail that they were gone--and quitting the empty saddles mean war  mountains he set about locating them earp had very craftily secreted him- self in a hollow at the foot of the soldados to the right of the pass the kid found the camp because he was looking for it because he knew earp must be somewhere nearby otherwise he never would have suspected that three human beings three horses and a wagon were in the vicinity earp had had the sense not to light a fire not even his pipe the hollow was deep and easily accommodated humans ani- mals and outfit the blanket of night made it the most secure of retreats provided an enemy was not forewarned of their presence and a thick fringe of trees and brush on the rim rendered it an excellent covert by day as earp could scarcely have known of the place beforehand the kid complimented his careful selection of a hideout as he finally fell on it himself and pushed among the trees and brush mccord hissed a voice in the black darkness ahead sure replied the kid good you made a noise cornin in said earp's voice again nearer this time for i had a finger on the trigger an i'd a crooked er if you'd come sneakin well you made out--or-- you wouldn't be here skin o my teeth declared the kid perceiving now the darker bulk of earp against a dark background you hadn't no trouble bueno what about brazos he's down there in the holler re- plied earp turning as the kid brushed him and falling into step showed signs o cornin to just after you rode off so i slammed him ag'in with a gun an then hobbled him with his sash an hanker he's got up all mexican yet he ain't one they scrambled and slid now to the bottom of the hollow where the white cover of the wagon somewhat relieved the blackness the voice of june earp greeted the kid from somewhere near it the first time she had addressed him directly i'm--we're awfully glad you're back it was mighty brave o you to do what you did i hadn't any idea mr mccord how the outlaws in there would act toward me i knew--when i heard that brazos talkin yeh he was--is--a sample kid please miss earp said mr mccord june then said miss earp of all fool things droppin my sunbonnet if i hadn't-- i might not've learned somethin the kid was guilty of interrupting fac- ing the dim white oval that was the girl's face i found joe gant in there at the rustlers camp yes sir   as earp at his side started to explode joe gant live an kickin--or his dou- ble an i reckon the lord had the hoss sense not to make only one o his kind i'm makin no mistake earp he spoke to me as brazos an i saw him plain in lamp light what do you figger earp i just don't replied the old man i shot plumb straight i'll take oath an the bullet was made o lead by grab i seen him fall an lay on the floor o his office plumb still an he had stopped kickin said the kid when i rode away from the tree he was lookin up--a hour before you shot him earp our trails is crossed a heap an that's whatever we both is sure we killed gant an yet he's alive that reminds me said earp that you didn't say what for you'd--uh-- hung him you want to sure said the kid it was jus- tice in a way though not as strong as your case i'd been punchin for him a month liked him well enough  two-gun western novels magazine an the outfit too thinkin em straight as string foreman complained o rus- tlin so did the men but gant though he seemed worried sometimes didn't say nothin sheriff mckell at fair- chance was keen to grab somebody for it but all trails led to these here solda- dos an after they went in it left him hands up well s mornin i was ridin up the north end o cactus valley where the forty mile river makes the big bend a lot o cattle jg's had gone down the trail between the cut banks to drink noticed a consider- able heap o bawlin goin on an lo- cated a calf out in midstream fightin the swift current which was slow but sure carryin it away an it's mammy makin most o the noise while tryin to reach the pore li'l critter well i seen the calf was losin so unstrapped my rawhide left the roan top o the cut bank an avalanched down i wouldn't trust my boss legs on that trail judged forty feet would just about make the youngster an slung er out an snaked the li'l feller inshore the of lady follerin an tryin to gore me for helpin the kid i went up the cut bank a hanged sight faster'n i come down but by golly i forgot that cow critter's ingratitude when i looked over to where i'd left the roan standin stead o the roan a grey cayuse that i never remembered seein on the jg was trailing its reins an all sweatin an fagged bug-eyed i tracked over an looked it up an down it sure had traveled plenty hard an i noticed the rope was missin off the saddle just about that time i heard a bunch o hoofs an lookin back at the buttes there came riders hellbent around the edge sheriff mckell headin em natcherel i just stood still an let em come up but what you think says the sheriff stem so you're one o the waddies huh mccord i told him he's locoed till he cut me short sayin him an the rest had caught me an a mexican brand-blottin in the bresh an chased us that the color o my hoss an its condition gimme away even though they hadn't seen my face we got you says mckell an the greaser what you parted from we'll get later an he got down an was gettin out the come-alongs when i told him to listen an i told him so hard he did listen an the others too i showed him my wet rope told him what i'd been doin told him how i'd been ridin a roan an found the grey hoss when i come up the bank but he wouldn't believe me none of em an theft along come joe gant ridin around the buttes like the possay had forkin my red roan gant bold as brass wanted to know what's goin on when he rode up an after he'd heard the sheriff's yarn an my yarn he turned on me savage so you're one that's been wolfin my stock i he shouts usin a tone i'd never heard before you been with me just a month an you didn't bring no recom- mend just yourself an ridin-gear an a ton o alkali you'd picked up footin it ought've knowed better'n to sign on a plumb stranger but i'm soft- hearted this'll cure me i wondered why you rode the grey this mornin when i found the roan you usually fork in the corral the grey's faster an you figgered you might have to travel fast so you caught him red- handed eh he says to mckell well take him but the sheriff didn't i thought it queer gant should be brand-blottin his own stock but the whole danged deal was queer--an i knowed gant was a crook an tryin to put the blame on me he was sittin his hoss right close i dogged sudden jumped up behind him punched my gun into him an promised to shoot if the sheriff moved i'd noticed there was no rifles in the crowd so ordered gant to back the roan when we'd empty saddles mean war  covered about two hundred feet that- away an the colts was useless i ordered gant to swing around an dug in the spurs we went skimmin around the buttes after us come slashin the possay soon seen if i wanted to get away i'd have to dump gant which i did i'd a shot him then but wanted to bump him off the way he'd figgered for me--by the rope i played hide- an find me with that possay on the jg range for nigh two hours an they didn't find me i worked around to the ranch-house when i'd lost em for good meanin to hide there an get gant when he come in but i didn't have to wait none he was there what do you think the yella dawg tried to make out he didn't know what i was talkin about when i stepped into his office holdin a drop i took a rope off the wall havin too much respect for my rawhide to hang such a kiote with it an put it round his big bull neck an drove him out under the cot- tonwood well as he detected a little gasp from june earp i won't go into no more details but i left him dan- glin he'd branded me a cattle thief an i might's well go the whole hog you done right earp declared in vindictive key by grab that's a remarkable yarn puts anything i ever heard plumb in the shade ain't so june sure is agreed june and do you think kid--mccord's blood raced a little faster--maybe the mexi- can the sheriff spoke of was brazos there was a pause before the kid replied that's headwork i'd tell a man he exclaimed no i hadn't thought of it june but i bet you're right where you got brazos tied i'll--no i'll wait  mornin an ques- tion him some folks if we work careful we're just about goin

valley boss rustler in the sol- dados hell's bells  think we'd better risk goin back to town questioned earp if gant's alive-- we'll stay here till mornin any- ways said the kid we'll need a big batch o proof mebbe gant will come out o the mountains alone if he does well wait an see if he does chapter iii at dawn the campers in the hol- low under the soldados were astir they did not have to go far for water earp had a two-gallon keg slung under the wagon the kid risked building a tiny fire of the driest brush he could find and june got out the coffee pot and frying pan while the girl was getting the breakfast the kid walked over to the prisoner who was hatless and sitting on the ground with his back against a rear wheel of the wagon to which he was tied  lo brazos the kid greeted the gaudy figure how's all the rio trim- min's this mornin say boy i got some questions to ask you after we've e't you heard us talkin last-- try n get me to tell you any- thing growled the rustler fixing the cowpuncher with an evil stare i will nodded the kid an if i don't make out the first time i'll try ag'in that's me a tryin hombre hey kid called earp from the other side of the wagon you want your hoss unsaddled i never thought o doin it last night an the pore critter-- never thought of it myself by golly the kid exclaimed sure i  two-gun western novels magazine want the leather off him i'll do it earp he left brazos and hurried around the end of the wagon earp was watering the picketed horses from a bucket the kid af- fectionately greeted the jg roan which whickered and nuzzled him as he stripped away the gear come and get it came from june over by the fire that's me chuckled earp hugely sniffing the fragrant coffee smell in just a minute the kid swung his saddle on his shoulder and retraced his steps to the wagon he was a couple of paces from it when brazos slayden entirely free of bonds sprang around the end of the vehicle swinging a nine-inch bowie the kid was taken by surprise of course he couldn't readily get at his sun because it hung on his right hip and the heavy saddle gear was weight- ing his right shoulder before he could drop the saddle and draw brazo's knife would be exploring his vitals from the ugly gleam of triumph in his eyes the waddy knew his advantage he crouched for a leap that would carry him to the kid's side as the latter paused his knife arm held low against his leg for an upward thrust at the abdomen greaser to the core huh brazos exclaimed the kid and with the words as slayden launched his body hurled the saddle which he was gripping by the horn the forty-pound gear of leather wood and steel smashed into the waddy as his feet left the ground and slayden fell flat on his back the kid figured on him being a trifle stunned from the solid impact as he jumped forward but brazos slayden wasn't he was of tough fibre he still gripped the knife- handle and scrambling up throwing the saddle off his chest was already rising from his knees when the kid forked him horsewise and crushed him down nothing would have been easier than for mccord to draw and shoot but he had use for brazos alive yet striving to save the waddy for a future grilling the kid cheated his own pur- pose his sudden forceful landing on slayden's back drove the waddy down on the blade of his knife--his choking cry appraised the kid of what had oc- curred instantly mccord pulled to his feet and turned the man over but too late the bowie had bitten in up to the handle right over the heart earp came running and june they knew from sight of the still prostrate form and the kid's crestfallen attitude standing over it that death had visited the camp in the hollow but they thought the kid had killed the prisoner thought you wanted to ask him things--or couldn't you help givin him his come-up-with thus spoke earp while his daughter stood with pale cheeks looking down accident tough luck replied the chagrined cowboy when i jumped an smashed him down his bowie must've been pointin up didn't you search him earp or is that your knife nope an i sure searched him his boots nope earp looked sheepish that's where he packed it o course hell now how'd you reckon he got loose the kid stepped around to the wheel to which slayden had been trussed he pointed as earp and june followed to a bandanna with two loops in it on the ground a sash cut in several pieces and a slashed rope the last hav- ing been passed around the late pris- oner's chest and through the spokes of the wheel there's your explanation said the kid worked his hands out o the empty saddles mean war  bandanna dug the knife outa his boot an used it on the sash an rope bet he had his hands free when i was talkin to him well we'll have to do without him they ate breakfast though june's appetite suffered somewhat from the knifing incident and the kid and earp buried the man they knew as brazos about half an hour afterwards they heard hoofbeats out on the plain and the two men crept up over the rim of the hollow and through the screening brush peered out mckell  the kid exclaimed and earp echoed him gutturally for at the head of the five riders swinging across the level evidently following a trail by the frequent glances cast ground- ward rode the lithe-figured iron gray sheriff from fairchance what had brought the posse to the foot of the soldado mountains was not a hard guess for the kid though ezra earp opened bearded lips to question what-- he began then the kid laid a hand on his arm listen he hissed mckell hol- lerin the posse had stopped suddenly and wrath fully the sheriff's voice was raised the while he shook a clenched fist just like always the trail goes on into the soldados your cows bar- ton is lost just like everybody's else's can't get em back nless the gov'ment will lend us a regiment an a couple machine guns well what the hell bawled bar- ton the ranchman who had owned the four hundred steers pushing his horse up beside the sheriff's no other way mac nless we could catch some of em outside that's right enough boomed mc- kell i'd stake my hope to reelection next fall that lots o the gangs in them mount'ns come to fairchance an mingle with us drink with us play cards but--if we dunno who they are how can we lay em by the heels you can't agreed barton well goodby cows he flapped a disgusted hand at the pass before them the impulse to break cover and in- form the posse of the identity of at least one of the badmen of the soldados seized earp and mccord simultane- ously for they turned and stared at each other questioningly we're fugitives our own selves said the kid slowly i reckon we'd better not chance it i reckon not agreed earp and sank back so they remained silent and hidden from sight while the posse riders turned about and hit the back trail slowly and in savage humor it's funny said the kid as he and earp dropped down into the hollow again that mckell don't think o hidin a bunch of men near the pass an watch for outlaws to go in or out--like we're doin you oughta be sheriff earp de- clared you shore got more head than the one in office though mac's a good enough feller if you ain't done nothin near noon when they were begin- ning to think of food again men's voices and the measured click-click of loping horses on rock drew the kid and earp up into the brush again if that's gant hissed the kid as they hustled to the edge of the brush he ain't alone if the odds-- he forgot to finish for his eyes were doing duty now and what he saw scuttled his hopes the pass was spewing horsemen two and two abreast and continued until six had loped forth one of the van riders on the side nearest the hol- low caused mccord and earp to face each other an instant  two-gun western novels magazine that's the man i hung said the kid a half humorous twist to his mouth it's the kiote i shot said earp his brow wrinkled then they turned to look again the six rustlers taking their time pointed away from the mountains over the trail recently traveled by the disappointed posse hitch up your team earp the kid cried sliding backward we can't cut him out while he's with his gang but mebbe if we foller we'll catch him by his lonesome betcha they're ridin to town chapter iv the kid's words were prophetic to fairchance cow town the earp-mccord party trailed joe gant and his riders june on the wagon box with her father and the kid astride the roan on the right the kid set the pace one that kept them well in the rear of the rustlers whom they glimpsed only once or twice ahead for that matter the wagon loaded with all the personal and household belongings that earp could cram into it along with provisions could not have made the trip much faster even had it been necessary or desirable earp had an- ticipated being absent from his ranch home a long long time and had taken everything he could lug or lay his hands on quickly they approached fairchance up a long draw the town was located on the dge of the hills the kid suggested a plan of action en route and earp having no better to offer and agreeing to all particulars the cowboy left them at the head of the draw and paced smartly townward alone he kept a wary eye out for the sheriff while seek- ing the mounts of the sextette along the hitch rails that fronted the two saloons and several stores of fair- chance thought it most likely the saloon racks were where he would find them--and he was correct the howling coyote got the rustler trade for there were the broncs switching flies a buckskin a bay a pinto two sorrels and--where was the dun joe gant had been riding a dun and it was not there strung along with the rest he turned off the trail somewheres the kid decided as he jogged over to the howling coyote last time i seen em was half a mile from town an all was together like's not gant went around to his ranch now le's see these five jiggers come first how to capture them single-handed the kid was a fair revolver shot but had never had much practice on human targets rattlers horned toads rocks even whiskey bottles had served as such while he was trying to attain speed and accuracy it was in the use of the riata that he excelled not only at work but at play rodeos stampedes and roundups he could make his rawhide riata talk his glance now fell on the neat coil in the tie-straps and brightened just the weapon to use more effective than a pair of shooting irons in his hands but how was he going to get the enemy bunched so that a single throw would do the trick if he missed one that one would be enough to put a hole in him and jack up the game he couldn't just walk into the barroom and chuck a loop at them even if they were the only customers at the bar which the five horses at the hitchrack seemed to indicate for he would be seen and they would have ample time to dodge one or more anyway his wandering gaze returned to the five broncs and down from the saddle he swung smiling he had seen nothing of the sheriff and at this blazing hot hour fairchancers empty saddles mean war  were taking more or less of a siesta which cleared the stage for the kid's act he first untied his rawhide slipped it over his arm went up on the stoop and walking beside the hitchrack deftly pulled loose the knotted reins of all five cayuses then he spread a wide noose jerked his gun and fired close to the head of the nearest untied horse which was out of range of the doorway the animal reared at the sudden blast so close to its ears and plunged away from the rack with a snort of fright the four others hardly less startled dragging reins in its dust the kid had slapped the gun back in his holster the instant after he fired and standing about five paces from the open door of the saloon was whirling the huge loop he heard curses and a stampede of jingling feet and as the five rustlers squeezed pellmell through the doorway the big noose sang out and dropped encircling them the kid braced back digging high heels into the boards of the stoop he had practically duplicated a stunt that had won him applause and a trophy at more than one frontier day exhibition the roping of five horsemen at one throw whoa buckaroos he yelped as the men began to struggle against the rawhide trying to get their guns out the kid pulled his own to quiet them the first jigger-- he began what's to pay kid mccord de- manded a gruff voice not far away the kid flashed a look the sheriff unnoticed had ridden up was sit- ting his horse by the stoop and regard- ing the scene with a wondering eye he gave the kid a baleful look the cattle thief from the jg who had out- witted mckell made him laughing stock almost i'd tell a man whooped the kid mac you're just the hombre i want to see i'm catchin these buckos as a present for you hold your guns on em will you an i'll frisk their hard- ware it's straight goods mac they're rustlers hot out o the soldados he spoke so earnestly the sheriff was compelled to believe him and the fact that the peace officer didn't know the faces of the five--hard faces enough-- added weight in the kid's favor mc- kell pulled his shooters as he swung out of the saddle to the stoop but you're a cattle stealer yourself mccord he growled edging up to the five roped men furtive-eyed when they saw his guns lining them turnin on your pals not any shortly retorted the kid jingling close to the captives and whip- ping off the rawhide he fell to lift- ing irons from holsters right and left pushing the low-cursing men apart when they unconsciously hung togeth- er paralyzed to find themselves in such a fix there said the kid heaping the guns with a triumphant gesture at the feet of the sheriff all yours mac the guns an the owners i was hidin out near the soldado pass s mornin when you come along trailin barton's cattle i heard you ravin you an barton an you said you bet the wad- dies come into town an played around right under your nose but not knowin who they was you couldn't nab em well i waited there near the pass an these fellers come out--an one other --an i follered em they're some o the gang that stole barton's cattle an who do you think's the leader ten guesses you wouldn't guess it so i'll tell you--joe gant so hangin him didn't work--an i'm glad you can wipe that off my record an i'll prove be- fore i'm through mac that gant changed hosses with me on the range yesterday an that i'm no cow thief i  two-gun western novels magazine what's that you said about hangin gant the sheriff was evidently mys- tified but did not let it interfere with his vigilance over the rustler crew and the rustlers knew it and were passive as sheepherders well i tried to hang him for the dirt he done me but-- the kid paused he saw the sheriff had no idea what he was talking about proving that gant had said nothing regarding the lynching that patently had failed the kid might tell mckell later might not but just now he had other press- ing business elsewhere where is gant if he was with these fellers asked the sheriff thinking something queer about the way the cow- boy had choked off out to his ranch i reckon replied the kid busy coiling his rawhide an that's where i'm goin mac to get him an bring him back to you--alive i'd tell a man i am and before mckell could remon- strate--if he would--the lithe figure was in the saddle and galloping away bent over and fastening the faithful rope in its proper place on the saddle the kid raced back to the draw where he had left the earps and after a few hurried words rode out again with the covered wagon creaking after him he might have ascertained without question the direction taken by joe gant when he cast loose from his five men had he cared to backtrack but the kid didn't want to waste the time he was eager to corner gant and would have bet anything he owned that the renegade ranchman had returned to the jg it would be about time for him to turn up there else his foreman and punchers whom the kid was sure were ignorant of their employer's dual character would wax suspicions un- less they were accustomed to him stay- ing away for long periods on some lying pretext maybe they were the kid hoped as he rode with the wagon rattling close behind that the jg cow- boys would not be around headquar- ters if they were and he couldn't con- vince them of joe gant's crookedness there'd be a tangle but earp was along earp who had shot gant and apparently missed and june on whom gant had laid hands the punchers would believe the girl but his fears were groundless he dis- covered on arriving scouting ahead of the wagon he left his horse by the cottonwood where he had tried to swing gant into eternity and stole toward the ranch-house he heard voices very similar voices so much alike in fact that before he peered around the door which stood open he got the idea that joe gant was talk- ing loudly and angrily to himself the kid was looking into the office which was occupied by two men one sitting --to be exact tied down in a chair-- the other standing facing the evident prisoner the profiles of both were toward the kid and their likeness was so remarkable that but for the fact that the man standing was dusty from hat to boots mccord would as readily have picked the prisoner for joe gant yet tiie prisoner was now addressing joe as jim if you've set your mind on killin me jim you'll do it so there's no use me makin a holler in all your devil- ment stealin from me as quick as you would from others since you come down from zuni county i've stood by you as i thought a brother oughta seems now i'd done better if i'd given you up to the sheriff well mebbe grunted the other but he prett near had me yesterday an if that puncher mccord's roan hadn't been handy to swap the grey for i'd been caught shore an say joe i think mccord's hidin in the empty saddles mean war  soldados since he thinks he broke your neck and he told of the pseudo- brazos in the mountain camp the pre- vious night and of the unknown's clever getaway must've been him damn shame he was a good feller an a top rope remarked the tied man you're shore got a lotta hell on your shoulders jim botherin me too it is jim vent- ed a nasty laugh then wheeled at the sound of a tinkling step on the thresh- hold kid mccord had taken his rope from the saddle when he left it mean- ing to take joe gant alive if it were at all possible the rawhide began to get busy on the person of the standing man manipulated by a master hand his movement toward his belt-holster was arrested by the swoop of the noose jerking tight about his arms and hold- ing them immovable the rawhide rip- pled and jim gant's bull neck was caught in a half-hitch ripping again and yet again each time noosing a wrist of gant the lively rope drew his hands together the kid now stood but ten feet from gant holding what was left of the forty feet of rawhide and grinning widely i reckon that'll do said the kid while the man in the chair muttered admiration of the feat i'm chokin to death snarled the kid's prisoner good thing if he was but he ain't remarked the man in the chair but he will sometime who're you demanded mccord looking over at him joe gant your employer kid an who's this the kid turned a thumb at the other man jim gant my twin brother an a bad egg declared joe gant kid there's been a lot o trouble account of us lookin alike an-- wait a minute the kid inter- rupted and he turned to go to the door oh there you are come in folks he called as earp and his daughter came up the porch steps and as they entered the office of the jg wide-eyed at the scene and particu- larly the two editions of gant the kid requested june look em both over careful will you an tell me which one was chasin after you june stepped slowly forward and re- garded each of the men in turn silently and intently it was a difficult question to decide but her woman's intuition aided her this man she pointed at jim gant standing sullenly is the one kid you'd hardly notice it unless you look close real close but there's a little difference--the eyes mostly is he the man you shot too earp said the kid turning to the old man whose jaw was hanging down damned if i know replied earp his gaze roving from joe to jim and back again you bet he shot mel snarled jim suddenly an my watch saved me shock o the bullet knocked me down an the watch was junk afterward so that's the reason exclaimed the kid and earp echoed him old timer you shot at the right one after all was he pesterin round you miss earp asked joe gant from the chair he couldn't leave and at her nod he continued well that's like him he always was a hotcake with the women called himself joe gant i s'pose makin out to be me because he couldn't appear as his real self bein a no-count thief an a citizen o the soldados folks i can explain things that's no doubt been puzzlin you a heap i heard you talkin when i come to the door said the kid before that i thought there was only one gant  two-gun western novels magazine --you mr joe an all the time you was straight an your brother was doin things that you got blamed for was he goin to kill you seems like-- yes said joe gant he was after i'd shielded him for months an stood for him stealin from me to boot kid you tried to lynch the wrong man bet you've been racking your brains over that it was jim the sheriff chased yesterday an he swapped horses with you while you was down on the forty mile bank snakin that calf out then he rode in a circle an come up around the buttes while the sheriff was talkin to you he's told me about it when you come to the ranch afterward an jumped me i didn't sabe what the hell was wrong but you wouldn't listen an you was like a tiger no wonder but my neck's pretty thick an tough--an jim's too an i reckon mckell will be testin it soon--an the limb o the cottonwood you hung me on broke just after you'd rode off that's what saved me jim came along right after it broke an carried me into the house thought i was near gone an hoped so an put me in the cellar to finish it but i didn't die as you see jim was still here when earp came over to gun him for annoyin his daughter an that's the how o that remarkable exploded old ezra i'm a free man ag'in june who had stepped back to her father's side hugged his arm in ecstasy why said the kid did jim want to kill you mr joe when you hadn't give him away hanker to get hold of the ranch an all yep it's a good payin ranch as you know an he was tired o livin just a jump or two ahead o the sheriff well he won't have to do but one more dance an that'll be on air grunted the kid ominously and facing scowling jim gant soldado citizen an i left the five other hombres he quit the mountains with with mckell at fairchance say burst out jim was you the feller wearin brazos slayden's mex hat that got away from our camp sure was me n the earps was in the mountains hidin an your brazos got too friendly an i knocked him out an joined your outfit that was drivin barton's cattle where's brazos at oh said the kid with a grin he got tangled up with his own knife he's buried in a holler foot o the sol- dados c'mon james you an me will go see the sheriff where's your dun hoss will somebody oblige by cuttin me loose requested joe gant with a laugh earp stepped quickly to his side and began to work on the knots jim had about decided to sift a bullet under my skin kid seem i didn't die from the bite o your rope--or rather the bite o my rope say i'm plumb sorry bout that but you know it was a mistake mr gant the kid was contrite sure i know replied joe gant as he rose unsteadily assisted by earp go ahead kid take that misfit out o my sight an when you come back from fairchance you can start right in ridin ag'in the kid did not immediately an- swer he turned to catch june earp's gaze full of promise upon him the blood pounded in his temples well thanks--mebbe mr

pond surface was sunbaked mud cracked and curling rem stopped in the short shade west of the house and made a cigarette he was lighting it when a girl rode around the corner of the place rem straightened regarding her with the somber respect of the man whose acquaintance with girls had been scan- ty she seemed a friendly little person with a freckle-speckled nose bronze toned hair tucked under a man's j b and a generous mouth rem's owlis wary attitude caused her to smile the kid from damnation valley  why hello there she greeted i was riding from asia lane's and cut into the road behind you but you wouldn't know asia you're a stranger else you wouldn't have come here for water or food i followed you to tell you there's water in a hole down there in crow creek she raised her arm a quirt dangling from her wrist and pointed to a distant line of cottonwood trees and bank wil- lows unversed in the proprieties all rem knew to do was thank her and start for the creek the girl put her horse in motion beside his she was without artifice her act was a neigh- borly one he knew this's the old naslet place she said just to make talk the bank at sageburg was robbed more than twenty years ago the small outfits like nas- lel lane gordons and rep jones never have gotten back on their feet but naslet was the only one to leave rem stared straight ahead cursing a blow that laid

always meet his payroll gurt kruss of bar  might put you on i could speak to-- before the girl could finish trouble took to them with stomach-emptying abruptness a rifle rang flatly from somewhere along the creek ahead the bullet sounded like a gigantic wasp passing well above them that shot rem knew had been a warning an- other one might not be come on rem cried he can easy see us out in the open he ran his horse ahead of the girl toward the creekside timber as he reached the dry rocky creekbed a rider dashed off of a liveoak flat beyond rem glimpsed a fluttering yellow neckerchief and a big white hat as the man disappeared around a point of brush did you see him the girl didn't seem frightened only worried as she reined up beside rem he gave her a sidewise look he had a hunch she'd also glimpsed the man and probably knew him barely glimpsed him rem told her but it's plain why he tried to scare us back he rode across the creek and looked down at a cow on the ground beneath a liveoak she'd been looped by a foreleg pitchpoled her neck broken rem turned his gaze to smoke coming through dust hastily kicked over a small fire a calf came out of the brush it bawled of pain of the leaning lx brand just burned on its flank as it nosed the cow the dead animal bore old jock hargish's jh con- nected brand rem lifted his gaze inquiringly the girl had a harsh lost expression on her face the brand on the calf leaning lx is asia lane's she choked asia's in town today makes no difference because i know he didn't do this no other pool man did either if you know who did it all you got to do is tell who rem advised you don't understand she mut- tered there's been so much trouble --and now this i was just thinking i don't believe it would be a good idea for you to strike gurt kruss for a job couldn't you just ride on and forget what you see here i can keep still about this he ten- tatively agreed but how about them he nodded at the dead cow and the mavericked calf for answer  two-gun western novels magazine she extended one hand saying give me your knife why he acted as he did rem couldn't say he did know it was kicking dynamite around--especially for a son of satan king i'll cut the brand off the cow he said getting down you haze the calf back into the brush he opened his knife and set to work he straightened with a square of bloody hide in hand just toss er up to me an keep your hands still the chill words spoken from the willows behind rem were ac- companied by the tap of a gunbarrel on a saddlehorn the girl cried jock hargish as she wheeled her horse rem turned slowly staring at the lined bitter face of the gray-haired man hargish seemed perplexed let down as he glanced at the girl his eyes glinted evilly when he looked back at rem the sound of the shot that killed my row brought me here hargish growled you're a stranger didn't know how sound carries around here i never thought the pool'd got to the point they'd call in a thing as low as a cow-killing mavericker he sighed and said to the girl miss kay it just don't seem you could be mixed up in anything like this i'm not mixed up in anything she answered i was showing this stranger the way to the waterhole when that shot was taken at us to warn us back i'm positive no pool man did this and to keep down trouble i asked this man to cut out that brand you'd go a long way to stop trouble miss kay hargish admitted reckon though i'll just take that hunk of hide an this jasper here on to lane's an have a li'l talk asia's in town she said as for this man--why i don't even know his name  who are you feller hargish mo- tioned with his cocked gun rem steeled himself groaning in- wardly my name's king king hargish snarled the same name as the black devil that robbed the bank that time i hear he sired a couple of whelps that was aptly nough called romulus an remus an sure was bein raised up by wolves king bigod you couldn't be-- i'm rem king rem said quietly bracing himself against the shock of a bullet from the rancher's gun but hargish seemed either too stunned or too enraged to command his trigger finger it was the girl who made a move against him she rode forward crying rem king and i asked you for help she raised the quirt that hung from her wrist slashed him across the face put the spurs to her horse and raced away stunned rem raised his hand and touched the welt the quirt had caused he looked up at hargish as though for explanation hargish motioned with his gun snarling fork your hoss guess you ain't guilty of this lane'd never hire no whelp of the wolf that wrecked this range an give younk fraly control of things just the same you're goin along when i show that piece of hide to lane an maybe you can explain what damn skunk's plan brought you down

her father mace fraly was killed in that bank robbery battle in sagebrush seven months before li'l kay was born rem gasped hargish grunted kay's mama never lived long damn you the rancher snarled she's been dependent on younk who's goin to see her married to gurt kruss or i miss my guess a blue hopeless funk possessed rem king blamed for his mother's weak- ness hated by buck honor despised by his brother now blamed for a range being ruined a girl's mother and father being dead and that girl in some diffi- culties now what would it be like then after rom came down from the deser- tions and set his guns and gun-wolves on them rem was on the point of telling jock hargish of that danger then withheld the words a look at hargish convinced rem that a warning could serve no good purpose at the present time when they reached sagebrush hargish stopped before the bank the squatty sandstone building still bore the bullet marks of the now his- toric bloody battle when the bank was robbed the rancher nodded at an old wagon and a team in wired patched harness asia lane's he grunted an speakin of the devil hargish motioned to rem as he slid down and confronted a stooped man in faded patched overalls he raised his head and said howdy jock in a questioning manner it's this hargish spat holding out the grisly hunk of cowhide this out- law whelp of satan king rem king here cut it off of a jh

one hand near the pocket of his old jumper that sagged with the weight of a gun rem looked beyond the two men was glad that hargish hadn't taken his smokepole away from him a spidery red-faced bleached cuss stepped out of the bank a big small-eyed tallow- padded man stopped in the bank door- way nervously mouthing a cold cigar rem glimpsed kay fraly on inside the bank then turned to hargish this mister lane he ain't the man that run down there on the creek rem declared no hargish panted hell you are in with lane you dirty king you're lyin for him if you never done it an lane never-- rem

man's right shoulder lifted his eyelids nar- rowed you accusin me he spat yeah you accusin gurt kruss hargish demanded now the girl's reason for telling him to ride on and not hit kruss for a job was plain to rem plain too was the fact that the bar  ramrod had faced this witness in order to discredit him or gun him out never knew you was gurt kruss an i ain't accused you of nothin rem  two-gun western novels magazine stated staring at the man how do you know there's anything to be ac- cused of rem softly inquired kruss twitched like someone had slapped him you sneakin outlaw pup he rasped who sent for you anyhow nobody sent for him the man in the doorway said quickly quiet younk kruss snapped i'm askin him outlaw did you come on your own or did somebody call you to cause trouble by sayin i done somethin damn you answer me hold on hargish inserted kruss it's funny you'd yap about bein ac- cused when you wasn't told nothin or pointed out there's too many cats hoppin around this king rubbish you an lane i mean i figger i can settle this miss kay vou was with king if he saw kruss you must've too i don't figger you'll lie was kruss the man or is this outlaw lyin in his teeth kay saw nothin younk fraly said holding the doorway younk i'm not askin you har- gish almost yelled kay everyone stared past younk fraly at his niece rem's nerves tightened his stomach crawled he sensed that younk and kruss were close kay fraly wouldn't turn against her uncle or the man she was according to har- gish apt to marry she wouldn't side one of the tribe that had caused her father's

was headed toward hell riding hobson's choice color left kay fraly's face rem felt sorry for her and his expression showed it hargish was making it damned hard for kay she looked at her uncle at kruss then at rem draw- ing a long breath she said i won't answer your question jock younk fraly bit through his cigar kruss sprang backward like a mon- goose baiting a snake you double- crossers  he cried as he pulled his gun bending it on rem who kruss figured was the swiftest of the lot rem winced as kruss's bullet ripped his ribs his own gun leaping in his hand as the double explosion echoed along the street kruss had sacrificed ac- curacy for all out speed and thereby made a sacrifice of everything rem's lead knocked an explosive breath out of the man turned him halfway around kruss dropped his gun and pressed his hands to his chest his right knee bent slowly pulling him back around twist- ing he fell face downward rem stepped back his wide-opened sickness-revealing eyes shuttling to lane who had his hand in his jumper pocket to jock hargish who let his gun slide back into the leather under the menace of rem's colt younk fraly had started to finger a  der- ringer from his vest pocket he jerked his hand away and stepped close to his niece when rem looked at him you murdered gurt fraly wheezed gurt wasn't guilty kay's answer of no answer was an- swer he was said hargish which don't mean i'm pattin this outlaw on the back what i want to know is what'd kruss mean by callin out double-crossers   hargish younk the downed man gasped they recoiled staring down at kruss the walk beneath him was stained with his blood and blood wetted his lips despite the bullet in his chest some- thing drove him on to cling to a few more moments of life younk kruss gasped hitching himself forward come close some- thin i got--to say--to you come the kid from damnation valley  closer younk fraly came a step nearer he screamed and leaped backward as kruss reached out and scooped up his fallen shooting-iron he rested on his left el- bow and fired almost point-blank at fraly fraly fell backward his scream chopped short his big body came down heavily he rolled and kicked clawing at the gaping wound in his throat blood pumped between his fingers as his life ran out he tried to sit up fell back and moved no more men and a few women along the street moved up warily kay gripped the doorframe and looked away shaking her head at a woman who came toward her kruss grinned redly hellishly get me a drink an hold me up he gurgled i want to talk an i ain't got long lane raised kruss to a sitting posi- tion against his knee someone else held a bottle to kruss's lips he looked at rem as he gulped then rasped younk sent for you of course not rem was puzzled why should he listen all you fools i gotta talk fast kruss gasped it started with younk wantin his brother's gal kay's mother he wanted to squeeze the ranchers too an mace his brother who was over him in the bank set down on it younk somehow knew a young killer named big mitch an got him to join up with satan king an talk up robbin the bank down here kruss paused lane gave him an- other drink kruss continued it was a trap me an two others-- who happened to later be killed--was ready younk had gold on top of bags of iron washers bills outside packages of paper that was what he put in satan's gunnysack an satan thought it was cash i when i shot satan outta his saddle big mitch run to him like he was tryin to save his life we was careful not to hit mitch he lit out with the sack then got his horse down in a flooded creek he lost the sack so nobody'd know it wasn't full of money you ranchers never knowed that i reckon king never knew the sack didn't hold money i never knew i only know big mitch was tolerated because it was thought he tried to save satan's life rem muttered dazedly anyhow younk bad the bank money hisself i had it on him an he made me the seemin owner of bar  when he took it from hargish younk hated me but was afraid to try any- thing that's why that big mitch got outta several pen sentences too it was younk supplied the money secretly ahhh hargish groaned i lost bar  i was a heavy holder in the bank an i've stripped myself these years payin back what i could to some of them that lost an-- an crowdin us li'l fellers when younk through kruss crowded you asia lane pointedly reminded hargish the loan younk pretended to get from a city bank after he took over kruss said was the money satan was supposed to have stolen younk was worried lately afraid you fellows would come out enough he couldn't bleed you for so much interest or grab your range he sent big mitch word to get a king whelp to come an raise hell an had me startin trouble to split you all so it would be easier i heard big mitch aimed to work it so he'd be the big he- coon of the outlaw diggin's when this was over with kruss's head jerked i still think --younk sent--for you he gasped at rem his eyes rolled and he slumped away from lane stunned silence prevailed asia lane cleared his throat and said well har- gish considerin the money you put in  two-gun western novels magazine an all you lost reckon this puts you in the bankin business an gives you back bar  i hope you remember how it is to be in a tight i can remember--though that ain't uncrowdin the range hargish turned to rem as for you he said there ain't a doubt you're the devil kruss meant you served a good purpose you never aimed to because things went haywire but because of that i'll let you off with your life you ain't stayin here to point the way to wholesale rustlin kill- in an robbery though i it was my brother kruss meant rem protested that's another rea- son i come here--to warn you hellfire was cornin i-- get out hargish roared you lead a wolf pack back here an i'll see to you myself i don't want any of your advice to trick me or mess me up rem looked at kay fraly she'd given in to grief and was sobbing piti- fully terribly anyhow she wouldn't want him here she probably blamed him for the swift turn of events that had caused her so much grief a wom- an stepped up and led the girl away you won't take my warnin rem said to hargish yet you'll blame me if anything happens that's one hell of a note y'darn shoutin asia lane sided in i can see right now hargish ain't goin to make things easy for us li'l ones king i had a bad minute to- wards you but you spoke up in my favor i seen enough i'm convinced you're fit to ride the river with an that you might be needed around you come along home with me i warn you hargish began and got no further lane's self-control snapped like a rotten cinch his fist hit hargish's jaw and hargish hit the dust he sat up emotions of bewil- derment pain and rage conflicting within him you see he cried more trouble already lane-- hell with you you stiff-necked op devu lane snarled come on king let's get goin rem followed lane's creaking wagon out of town the color was draining from his face a mile from town lane called ride up so we can talk he looked around gasped stopped and leaped from the wagon and ran back rem had fallen out of the saddle he sprawled in the road the left side of his shirt and jumper soaked with blood    chapter four ravaged range weakened by loss of blood his side inflamed and swollen where kruss's slug bad fur- rowed over his ribs rem didn't take to the saddle the next day after get- ting rem home and in mrs lane's care last night asia had taken word to other pool members this morning they met at the lane place and went to town together to attend younk fra- ly's burial out of respect to kay and check with hargish on the new order of things to be lane was in a sour mood when he returned home that evening as he unhooked his team he told rem har- gish is genin mighty a'ready called a meetin for tomorrow at the bank his range is way overstocked an while hargish is honest he ain't fair it's in him to be a range tyrant an to hell with us little spreads he say anything about me rem inquired plenty cussed me too his sore the kid from damnation valley  jaw made him tempery lane let the team into the lot then said kay fraly asked about you wants to see you as soon as you're able to ride me see me rem blurted but what about don't know what about rem do know kay's liable to need heavy help though before her affairs is all straight- ened out early the following morning with- out waiting for lane or the others rem saddled up and rode to town a dark- ening line on the horizon showed thun- derheads banking hot puffs of wind blew up dust clouds maybe the range would get the rain it so badly needed rem had learned that kay occupied a small house of her own in sagebrush he went straight there dismounting outside a picket fence and walking up a path rimmed with dying flowers and shrubs they made rem think of the water and trees and green grass up in damnation valley he knocked on the door wondering why his heart knocked on his throbbing side kay fraly came around the side of the house why hello there she greeted him just as she had at the old naslet place --a moment that now seemed years ago i didn't expect you so soon kay said stepping up onto the porch how is your side fine he lied but would you mind if we sit down here he sat down on the edge of the porch and she followed suit an awkward silence fell between them finally kay said i wish to apologize to you rem for hitting you with my quirt why forget it he told her reckon you was in a bad spot an all an had a right to be edgy i--i was sorry ior you i saw that on your face there be- fore the bank kay's voice was vi- brantly low your expression told me a lot of things i want to be friends rem friends with me he mumbled but my father-- my uncle was as much guilty of my father's death as your father or his men rem she interrupted younk was a far worse man than your father was in his way i never knew until day-before-yesterday though how real- ly bad younk fraly was it's a terrible thing for a brother to kill or have killed a brother yeah he agreed twisting his hat in his hands without knowing why he did it he began to tell her of his life why his mother couldn't leave damnation valley and about his brother rom kay was silent for a long time after he'd finished then she laid a warm little hand on one of his i know what it is to be lonely and feel unwanted she said in a whispery voice i feel sorry for you rem even to the names given you and your brother the pattern seems laid against you two i remember the origin of the names romulus and his twin brother remus were infants thrown into the river tiber they were rescued and nursed by a she-wolf romulus was founder and first king of rome remus jumped the walls of the city and romu- lus killed him    whoever gave you those names estelle phil said it showed the crazy consistency of the inconsistent phil was a funny jasper an the only real friend i ever had i often wish i could see him again he rode off one time an never come back what do you intend doing now kay inquired she drew back then staring at him in amazement rem had risen his  two-gun western novels magazine face gone suddenly bleak his attitude grim and quiet as the steel of a six- shooter is quiet he looked off down the road to where it widened and be- came the main street i'm goin an have a talk with the three men that just come up an left their horses in front of the sagebrush bar across from the bank rem said in a hell-hollow voice buck honor big mitch an my brother roml wait rem kay cried clinging to his arm get help no maybe this can be settled with- out another pitched fight with inno- cent folks gettin killed an wounded an you stay here he shook her off and strode down the path mounted and rode down the street without once looking back at the girl he reined up and got down two doors from the saloon pausing to glance at jock hargish and three of his riders as they came in up at the feed corral maybe hargish expected trouble with the pool members today loosening his iron in the leather then rem drew in a steady long breath stepped quickly down to the sagebrush bar and inside three long strides took him to the bar close to buck honor big mitch stood next then rom the trio tensed mouths wide open as rem faced them kind of early for you gents to be out ain't it he asked wait honor forestalled rom's move as his shoulders hunched well mister king an your pleasure the swamper and morning bartender inquired i was just start- in to tell these gents about the gunfight across the street funny but y'know i'd swear i'd seen the two on this end some'ere's before an the other'n too --unless i saw somebody looked like him a long time ago seems as we heard about that ol fight rom snarled get away not this fight you never heard about rem told him he meant the fight a couple days ago when younk fraly an gurt kruss was killed wh--whatl big mitch blurted and honor gave him a keen glance in the backbar mirror yeah i shot kruss an he killed fraly as he was dyin but he talked mitch kruss told a lot of things    hold er damn you rem rested his hand on the butt of his gun rom don'cha draw let's hear this story honor growled y'see mitch was powerful set on lookin things over alone i de- cided we'd leave the boys outta town an me'n rom'd ride along with him we sure never reckoned to find you here--an folks callin you mister go on  rem moved out a step and poured out the story it's a lie big mitch snarled it's nothin but a trick to mess things up this lard-mouthed-- i don't think it is a trick mitch honor broke in harshly i always wondered about the hot lead reception that time an the way your hoss went down in that creck stand aside buck rom rasped gimme room to move i aim to blow mitch's guts out then dump this but- tin-in rem's innards hold er honor grunted some- body's openin the bank an them three gun-packin rannies loungin around don't look good no-- hell yes rom raged leaped out and went for his gun the ensuing scene was a blur of motion rem freed his gun and jumped aside he could have gunned rom in that moment but something stronger than his own neces- sity stayed his trigger finger rom's gun roared big mitch pulled a trigger and jarred up against the bar by the shock of a bullet buck honor's gun the kid from damnation valley  added to the thunderous din big mitch was hammered off his feet and was dead before he hit the floor honor yelled at rom run for er and grabbed at him rom screeched an oath and fired at rem who stepping backward felt the slug fan his face as he tripped and fell over a chair ah damn you i'll teach you  an- other bullet ripped into the floor beside rem's body honor shoved rom yelled at him again managed to make him savvy they had to run they belted through the doorway and hit their horses hargish's riders went for their guns but a yell from their boss in the bank's doorway stopped them it might be some sorta trick hargish yelled stay where you are rom and honor pounded up the street as they turned the corner they almost piled up on lane and the other pool men the pair raced on ran out of sight over a rise and were gone rem came out of the bar as lane and the rest ran down and got off their horses big mitch's in the saloon plumb dead rem called that was honor an my brother run out get back on your broncs they got a bunch out of town an we got to keep them a-runnin rom's so crazy mad there's no tellin what he might do no kay fraly cried running up and planting herself in front of rem let hargish and the others go don't ride after your brother-- he ain't goin to nobody ain't hargish snarled motioning to his men i notice he never stopped them in the bar well we ain't ridin after them decoys leavin the bank easy to be robbed by the rest of that bunch king you're stayin right here you're a fool rem said quietly have it your way damn right now some of you men get that outlaw outta the bar so i can have a drink before we call the meet- in at the bank move him yourself lane barked who the hell you think you're givin orders to move him boys hargish snapped at his men he presented lane and the others a stubborn angry expression givin orders too you'll mighty soon be findin out i-- he stopped speaking with his mouth open his eyes getting larger and larger then hargish made a croaking sound and pointed out toward the range they--they've set fire to the range hargish screamed stunned the group watched a grow- ing smoke cloud filled with flying ashes whip into the darkening sky now the roar of the wind-driven flames in pow- der-dry grass grew in their ears at other points fire sprang up as rom and his followers ran setting their fires on the way no human could stop that fire lane croaked an you're the one hargish that wouldn't let us chase them keep em goin the street was suddenly alive with townfolks as the sky became darker and ashes began raining down into sage- burg the roar of the fire was loud growing then fading in the distance lane in the group before the bank offered up thanks thank god he cried our families an homes will be safe there ain't enough grass back in the badlands to carry the fire across the ravines an cut canyons a red-eyed smoke-blackened cow- puncher raced down the street hey jock he called out to hargish bar  house is goin an everything at jh connected is gone a lot of beef bein baked but not as many as you'd figger they're stampedin into the bads  two-gun western novels magazine baked or starved -- what's the

folks somethin maybe that'll pay up i understand lane nodded damnation valley but the outlaws will fight-- there ain't many there now more will leave after what took place down here rem interrupted the fight'll be with rom an buck honor we'll tend to that if you lead us in lane avowed no you're married young gor- don's got a mother an sister to think of the others have dependents too it's up to me to claim part of my own heritage maybe rom'll listen to rea- son y'know he won't rep jones growled me i got nobody dependin on me i'm traipsin along for the ride rest of us'll bunch the cattle an start them movin lane muttered if anything happens i mean if we don't go into the mountains we got to move along anyhow but before i go-- his fist hit hargish's jaw and har- the kid from damnation valley  gish hit the floor outside kay caught up with rem and drew him aside while rep went after a pack of grub rem the girl muttered  don't know what to say i can't ask you not to do this because it is the only chance the others have but you don't owe us this you've done so much already if you go there you'll have to kill your brother or like the other remus who jumped the wall he'll kill you if it's the first way you'll never be the same again you wouldn't want a wife or children to have to tell that you killed rom i know it he groaned but no matter what happens rem i'll pray while you're going to make a place for our herd if you care--i'll be waiting she sobbed rose on her toes and kissed him and ran rem carried that kiss with him on the way into the mountains it was in his mind the morning he and rep jones came through slot pass unchal- lenged and part of the valley's spread lay before them to think of this layin up here with only outlaws usin it rep jones gasped rem--hell it's heaven we'll see if it is rem answered soberly the tracks show honor an rom ain't been far ahead slowed down because honor was packin mitch's lead i reckon    wait a rider hazed a packhorse toward them he pulled up saying howdy rem some of us figgered you'd be along most of the boys have hauled er the few down there won't side rom after he went frothin mad an set fire to that range such things ain't no good an most've us have been cowhands one time or another y'see honor's pretty bad shot an since they rode in last night late rom's been drinkin plannin against you runnin ever'body outta owlhoot house you try takin this valley it'll mean fights to come rem but not today not today they rode on then dismounting in the timber rem told rep you stay outside if i'm downed ride an tell lane an the others what to expect of this place an tell kay i loved her rep you're the boss an i hope you can tell her yourself rep mumbled i never will if i ain't downed i'll have the cain brand that's one iron that can't be blotted rep rem drew in a great breath of the crisp piney air and went toward owl- hoot house when he rounded a cor- ner rep jones drew a gun and moved to a window where he could look in as he paused at the door his hand on the latch rem could hear rom's voice inside honor you ain't goin to croak he snarled you'll live to see me kill that cowardly rem an make the whole west run when they hear the name of king sit up buck rom i got mine i just hung an rattled to get here to die buck honor groaned rom i maybe see things clearer now maybe our way ain't the way to carry the king name on shut that upl rom yelled and in that instant rem went in honor sat with his back against the wall his face ashen there was a bot- tle on the table before him rom sat on the counter a half-emptied bottle by his side running the gamut of emotions at rem's appearance rendered rom speechless at first he gulped lifted his bottle and drank then hurled it straight at rem rem ducked and the bottle crashed against the wall rom slid off the counter shaking his head rem was the first to speak wait rom he begged listen to me i've as much right here as you  two-gun western novels magazine the poor devils you burned out down below have a right to this valley for their cattle and homes after the years they suffered on account of the trick of a king it's up to us-- hush damn you rom bellowed didn't they trick satan you damn right one of them did anyhow an you throw in with them go against your own kind down there you think i'd step out an see them come in here into a valley satan king found cuss the name of king eh hell they ain't even started havin reason to cuss rom settled his feet apart as his mad rage ran hotter i'm startin with you-- wait rom old buck honor cried rom's gun was flashing up every nerve and fiber in rem cried out for speed yet he was slow held back by the damning fact that this was his brother he faced rom buck honor screamed and his gun thundered and echoed in owl- hoot house the barrel rested back on the table top then the gun slid out of his hand rom king raised both elbows stood on his toes his gun thumped the floor a ragged sigh passed his lips then and he went down limply rem didn't couldn't realize what had happened his eyes wide mouth agape he shook his head slowly and stared down at rom buck honor gave a despairing croak pushed to his feet he staggered the distance to rom and dropped down beside him he pulled rom's head up on his lap rom boy honor sobbed tears streaming down his grayish seamed face rom listen you died easy not like sufferin with a bullet in the belly not like bein caged up before they took you out to hang you up an it'd been like that boy maybe the name of king ain't stood for what it ought maybe satan'll savvy rom it all come clear to me the best way to make the name a proud one was to let rem pack it on like he's started rom you can forgive me rem you reckon rom'll under- stand honor begged he'll know why i done er won't he rem old buck honor shuddered and bent slowly forward so he died his head on rom's body a smile on his lips the three outlaws standing beside the graves weren't thinking of the dead they were wondering how long it would take them to get out of damna- tion valley rem patted the last piece of sod down on the mound above buck honor he stood up swallowing a lump in his throat he said i reckon they're both better off an they never died without leavin somethin good behind this valley an its tributaries ain't goin to be crowded for a long time we'll see it ain't after we get in a road we'll build a little town around owlhoot house along ripple river we'll have just about all we want or need down there yeah rep jones agreed an what'll you call the town kingville satan some name like that why no rem answered we'll name it after a man who thought enough of another man's name an memory he tore his heart out for it a man who killed the thing he loved above all else in order that at last that name would rightly carry on honor worshipped satan an rom sa- tan's crown prince meant more to honor than life itself honor that's what we'll name the place honor he moved down the slope toward owlhoot house to get his horse and ride down to love then back to honor where it would be fine to obey the dis- tates of happiness    borrowed bullets by  ralph berard author of colt-wise--or plumb loco etc cutting sign on a notch-hunter of the jack rabbit kid's calibre any range city son but race gordon would have thought first of the two thousand dollar reward offered for the bandit dead or alive race's weapon had spoken again the body was sprawled face down in the dust arms out- stretched blood stained the dead man's shirt the stiff whitness of the clutching hands in the early sun- light told young race gordon even be- fore he dismounted that the man was dead his horse a nervous-looking high-bred grey mare grazed some fifty feet from the short-cut trail to range city race hesitated a moment standing there looking down at the still form he finally stooped and turned the body over then stepped back startled a wild scatter of disconnected thoughts chasing through his brain anyone living within a hundred miles of range city would have recog- nized the jack rabbit kid from the reward posters stuck up all over the country most anyone except race gordon would have thought first of the two thousand dollar reward offered for the bandit dead or alive but race thought of something else of the kid's reputation of how the jack rabbit kid had fought and killed every man within a thousand miles was afraid of the jack rabbit kid   two-gun western novels magazine all of his nineteen years race had wanted to be feared and respected like that and in the last four years he had had a specially good reason when race had been only fifteen he'd heard his father tell how gatz blemming and three hired killers had seized control of range city and started to drive the small ranchers out of the valley even then race had sometimes brooded over the thought of riding to range city and shooting it out with gatz blemming but he'd known of course how foolish and im- possible it was and the best he could do was to borrow his dad's gunbelt without his permission and sneak to a draw in the hills where he practiced his draw and his aim his dad hear- ing the shots one day had ridden out and surprised him there who're ya planning to kill jake gordon had asked sternly race had drawn his skinny six feet up an extra inch and swelled out the strong frame of his sinewy thin chest and said when i grow up i'll kill anyone who steals from you or mom or ritzy you're mighty young for guns his dad had said but it's a hard country don't reckon ya can learn your shoot- ing any younger jake gordon had swung his horse and ridden slowly away without looking back race had stared after him for a moment then had re- turned resolutely to his practicing that same evening jake gordon had given the lad the guns and the belt and his blessing now it had been just two years since cal fetters the loyal foreman of jake gordon's four bar spread who had stuck by them through a long siege of drouth and rustling had found the hon- est old rancher's bullet-ridden body far out on the north range and the full re- sponsibility of the four bar had been thrust suddenly on race's youthful shoulders fetters had told race i know it was gatz blemming's men who killed your dad we saw the whole thing but it wouldn't be no use me claiming that i'd likely just get killed for my trouble race had understood how things were and he hadn't blamed fetters for not talking but as long as jake gor- don was alive the range city bank which gatz blemming had also got con- trol of had pretended leniency in re- gard to a past due payment of fifteen hundred dollars against the four bar hardly however had race's father been buried before the bank filed fore- closure notice it means we'll lose everything race's grief-stricken mother had said and when he looked at her haggard face he had felt a hot dagger of passion- ate hate stab him deeply he'd watched his kid sister ritzy trying to comfort his mother and he'd sworn in tight- lipped silence that he'd settle with gatz blemming regardless of what happened to himself he had started this day for range city to make what he knew would be a last futile appeal to the bank then he would try guns blemming's hired gunmen drag shanto kale bletsin or jake fundy might kill him but some- how it hadn't seemed to matter he'd looked into his mother's anguish-filled eyes and seen the pleading hopelessness in his little sister's face and nothing much seemed to matter except the need to satisfy a kind of blind madness like a red burning passion that spurred him on and augmented the reckless deter- mination of his youth and increased his deep faith in the rightness of his cause race recalled as he looked down at the jack rabbit kid how his father had once said as long as the jack rabbit kid lives us small ranch- borrowed bullets  ers has got a chance the kid ain't really against what's right even if he is on the owlhoot if ya notice right close ya'll see his depredations is against them what got their positions by robbing and killing they say the kid's dad owned a ranch that was lost almighty mysterious-like when his old man died just like me race gordon thought now as he looked at the corpse then he let his bridle strap drop and he kneeled by the kid's body it was still warm the kid hadn't been dead very long race straightened the legs and the arms so that when the body was cold it could still be put on a horse a sort of wild scheme was finding shape in his mind he gave up the useless idea of talking with blemming's banker again race unbuckled the kid's guns a pair of perfectly matched pearl-handled weapons he unbuckled his own then took off his trousers and shirt it was a dank unpleasant business this strip- ping the outer clothes from a corpse and putting them on he folded his own things neatly and laid them on the ground then he tucked them under the kid's head so they wouldn't blow away and so they'd be there when he came back he grinned at himself mockingly when he came back what he meant was if he came back he straightened and practiced a couple of times drawing those guns of the kid's they balanced in his long fingers and leveled out fine race grinned a hard chiseled grin like men sometimes wear when they die he clamped his teeth tightly together and walked with slow determined steps to where the kid's grey horse was graz- ing the mare raised her head and moved her ears forward race spoke to her softly and it seemed odd how calm and even his own voice sounded it was like he'd always been a killer as if he knew the horse would stand still and welcome his weight in the kid's empty saddle he mounted then and rode toward range city leaving his own horse graz- ing nearby he fashioned a mask for his eyes from a black cloth he found in the kid's pocket the kid was a tall skinny fellow like himself    and men were afraid of the kid it was noon when race gordon rode into range city with the black mask over his eyes he sat straight in the saddle and kept his face forward the horse kicked up grey dust that lay in the street and it drifted heavy in the hot air like a thick ominous cloud fore- casting a storm the few townspeople who were about ducked out of sight because they thought race gordon was the jack rabbit kid race rode to the wildcat saloon and dismounted it seemed to him as if there wasn't much air in the town and he moved along easily as if walking in a subconscious dream the batwing doors seemed so light he strode through hardly knowing he'd pushed them inside it was dark and suddenly cool it occurred to him then that may- be he'd seen the last of the sunshine but he still kept a grin on his face down under the mask and he looked a lot like the jack rabbit kid there was the long bar on the right with blemming's spying white-sleeved barkeep behind it empty chairs and tables cluttered the place perhaps a dozen men were sitting about bletsin and fundy sat at a far corner table he didn't see blemming or shanto any place about race knew that every eye was on him and he vaguely wondered why he'd even forgotten the mask on his face and didn't realize now that men who peeked in from the crack of the  two-gun western novels magazine men wanted earn money easy with great new tailoring line sensational payment

graveyard at night race kept looking for gatz blem- ming but the man he'd come to kill for dry-gulching his father was not there race moved forward with measured steps and stopped by the bar then turned his back hooking his el- bows on the hardwood unmindful of the pale-faced taut-lipped barkeeper behind him but he heard the faint click of metal and knew it was the hammer of a gun being cocked instinctively he whirled on his toes a shot sounded and lead whistled close only his sudden movement had saved him from the barkeeper's lead when he had tried to shoot race in the back so he could claim the reward for the jack rabbit kid one of the ivory-handled guns came into race's hand as fundy jumped up from his chair with a weapon raised fundy's gun blazed as race leaped and rolled over the counter he pumped lead into the barkeeper's stomach as he dropped to the floor he had drawn his second gun in the same movement he fired fundy stared gulped and pitched forward bledsin's gun kept flashing lead thudded into the counter the bar- keeper rolled over and was still race saw blood on the front of the shirt he was wearing but the blood was dry it was the blood of the jack rabbit kid race had sprung from the floor and rolled over the counter in the same jack rabbit movement that had made the kid famous the set grin was still on his face and he hadn't been hit he hunkered along behind the coun- ter now the shooting stopped bled- sin couldn't see him then race stood erect got bledsin squarely lined in his borrowed bullets  sights and fired he fired again bled- sin clutched at his waist his gun spun in the air as he fell new bullets hailed across the bar now glass from the mirror and from broken bottles showered down men crouched behind overturned tables all who weren't cowards were trying to kill the jack rabbit kid and claim the reward race hunkered along toward the rear he reached a rear window and felt a bullet burn through the flesh of his hip as he toppled through in a shower of glass he came to his feet in the alley and found himself laugh- ing crazily laughing and running he'd done for two of the men that he wanted he'd have to come back for the others a shower of late lead whistled around the corner of the building as race got safely around it he holstered his guns ran along the far side and stopped at the corner he stood there a split sec- ond to straighten his mask a dozen men came running yelling wildly after the reward for the jack rabbit kid perhaps they thought they had winged him race held the kid's guns firmly one in each hand he stepped around the corner and faced them with the guns leveled deadly taken by surprise the men stopped as if they'd run into a wall the first man t level a weapon dies said race gordon he appraised them a moment with calm deliberation and knew they were afraid sheriff ballard wasn't among them and race was glad of that because he didn't want to mix with the law or kill any inno- cent person he

delay--do it now in the first ravine that would hide himself and the horse he drew up his wound was only a scratch and had al- most stopped bleeding but it made him feel stiff and it pained still he was grinning and what he had done didn't seem anything great race waited there in the ravine he kept thinking of his mother and of his kid sister and of how his job was only half finished he wasn't much afraid of a posse because it seemed the sheriff had been out of town if anyone did follow him they'd never expect him to stop this close to town just after dusk he spurred the horse out of the ravine and rode back to range city it was pitch dark when he tied the grey mare behind an aban- doned building on the outskirts of town he ran eagerly to the rear of the wild- cat and found as he'd expected that the window he had leaped through had not been repaired peering through the broken glass he saw that the place had been cleaned up there was a larger crowd inside than there had been at noon a new barkeeper was serving the drinks race could only see behind the coun- ter and a little past the end of it out- side the building he was in shadow and there was little chance of them seeing him suddenly he realized some men were sitting at a table to his right he couldn't see them but he could hear their words you weren't here during the fight at noon still ya got a bullet wound an authoritative voice accused how'd it happen i tell yuh boss i shot it out with the jack rabbit kid just before day- light race strained closer held his ear to a glass next to the one which was broken you've always boasted shanto borrowed bullets  about getting the jack rabbit kid suppose you killed him this time a low satirical laugh followed the words then race's teeth snapped together and his right hand clutched a gun han- dle he recognized gatz blemming's voice don't guess i killed him shanto was saying but he swayed a lot in the saddle and he didn't follow  he spurred out o range mighty pronto blemming's mocking laugh rose louder ya slipped shanto ya al- most admitted he didn't follow when ya ran away the jack rabbit kid's guns came into race's hands again their ivory handles feeling warm and friendly in his grasp their long barrels crashed the remaining glass of the window he stepped inside and faced the men at the table shanto's coal black eyes flashed mixed hatred and fear he saw the black mask he recognized the jack rabbit kid's guns the roomful of men stood watching tense eager but hesitant gatz blemming was watching his hand near his gun but making no effort to raise it race let a quick glance sweep the room he saw the crowd standing si- lent motionless like tintype pictures of men sheriff ballard stepped suddenly out from the others and began to move forward race swung around to face the law- man he let the muzzles of his guns drop down dropped the weapons them- selves back to their holsters he felt the cold crease of his grin come back on his face as a plan came to his mind and he watched with the tail of his eye to see shanto slowly snaking out his gun he felt rather than saw gatz blemming shift in his chair the sher- iff was still a dozen paces away

the sound of horse's hoofs came from in front of the wildcat race didn't spur the horse into flight he held it in check and let it pick slow steps between the dark buildings that cast no shadows in the absolute black- ness the little sound his horse made was lost in the greater noise of the sheriff's hastily organized posse race was a mile away before the posse was ready and then they didn't know which way to follow because of the darkness dut the first streaks of dawn found the posse close on his trail in day- light it wasn't a hard trail to follow the tracks of his horse led along the short cut to the four bar ranch streaks of blood marked the way they were less than half way when sheriff ballard halted his party two horsemen were riding toward them as they came nearer they saw that one man was slumped and stiff he was dead his body tied to the saddle of the grey horse a thin tall youth on a cowpony came leading the grey the youth looked familiar to ballard and a moment

weakly had quite a fight sheriff but i killed the jack rabbit kid i'm claimin the reward ballard's eyes narrowed yeah he said doubtfully he rode up to race and yanked his guns from his holsters then he drew alongside the dead man's mount drew the ivory handled guns from the kid's belt and frowned then he fingered curiously the red ribbons of the jack rabbit kid's torn left shirt sleeve and raised clear honest eyes to meet race's you were wearin the kid's clothes when you got yer hand busted up he accused but race's eyes had fluttered shut he reeled in the saddle and a deputy whose horse stood nearest barely kept him from falling he got back his senses on the way into town he was riding in front of somebody's saddle and that was about all he could tell the jerking of the horse jarred his head and he couldn't get coherence into his thinking pretty soon he passed out again then he was sitting in old doc reyn- old's office and someone was sponging his face sheriff ballard sat beside him he felt pain in his hand in his arm down in his leg and in his hip you're not going to die the doc- tor said race tried to grin he thought vaguely about billy the kid and the luck that went with fighting for a good cause didn't figure i would he said then turned toward the sheriff did you send word to my folks i sent a deputy ballard said they ought to get here after a little race raised on his elbow he was weak but he felt a little excited i killed the jack rabbit kid sheriff i shot him in the right side under the arm you'll find a hole in his shirt where there isn't one in my body i took his clothes and rode into town and i killed four men that every honest man in town borrowed bullets  wanted killed and i never killed one of them till he shot at me first the sheriff's face was stern you impersonated an outlaw which gave em a right to shoot you on sight they had their rights race grinned only they're dead and i ain't i'm still claiming the reward i've got to have fifteen hundred dollars down to the bank by tonight to save the four bar for mother and ritzy doc reynolds put a kind hand on the lad's shoulder son he said sheriff ballard asked me to examine the jack rabbit kid and say how long he's been dead i haven't told him yet but i just came across the street and i saw people standing in little groups and i heard them talking they're saying lad that the outlaw was the best friend this town ever had they're planning to give him a mighty fine fu- neral they think the shooting you did was done by the jack rabbit kid it's better i think that they shouldn't know any different you could have killed the kid after he did his shooting here that way you'd be entitled to the reward and folks couldn't stay mad at you long for killing an outlaw with a price on his head the old saw- bones sighed deeply and turned to bal- lard sheriff he said no doctor can tell exactly how long a man's been dead if race gordon here says he killed the kid i don't see how you can prove that he didn't the kid was killed with a  bullet and that's the caliber of race's guns ballard smiled slightly and nodded his understanding guess maybe you're right doc race ought t have the reward race lay back then with a little sigh of relief he had a feeling as if the jack rabbit kid were there in the room saying it sounds all right to me part- ner it's the way i'd want it to be amazing new
