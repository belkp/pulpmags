friend whom we hadn't seen for years strolled into our office he had just returned from india and as he sat chatting with us he dangled a small strangely shaped charm on the end of his watch chain-- a woman's body with the head of a snake when we remarked on it he told us this story    some years ago in bombay he said there lived an english family mr and mrs featherstone and their son john one night they had as a dinner guest major littlejohn of the indian army he had with him this charm you see here it was supposed to have the power of granting wishes--three wishes when mrs featherstone admired the bauble major littlejohn presented it to her saying jokingly that she'd better be careful about making her wishes but as the days went by mr and mrs featherstone found that their minds dwelt more and more on the powers of the little idol wouldn't it be wonderful they thought if it were really true they amused themselves by discussing what they would wish and finally they agreed that above all things they wanted their son john to be made foreman of the iron plant--with the attendant raise in pay which would enable them to have so many more of the comforts of life finally mr featherstone determined to try it what harm can it do he asked the thing won't work anyway nevertheless he solemnly repeated the mystic incantation by which the charm was invoked and asked that his wish be granted they went to bed laughing at each other and promptly forgot the whole thing when later the next day john called from the factory bursting with pride in the fact that he had been made head fore- man they were astounded and almost overcome with joy and yet--they caught themselves looking at each other strange- ly--for each was thinking of the price  disturb not the dead they might he called upon to pay at six o'clock the telephone rang for a few seconds the old couple stared at it then mr featherstone almost against his will lifted the receiver his shocked look of horror told its own story their beloved son john had fallen into one of the iron presses and been in- stantly killed his body horribly mutilated beyond recognition one thought was in mrs feather- stone's head she rushed to the mantle- piece and caught up the evil charm in a trembling fearful voice she took the sec- ond wish--she begged for the return of her son the old couple sat before the door far into the night waiting hoping--yet not daring to hope and then--mrs feather- stone her ears sharpened by a mother's love heard it first a slow dreadful scraping noise--like a heavy body drearily inching its way along then they both heard the gasping breath and little whim- pering sighs of something--human or otherwise--in awful soul-rending agony they both leaped at the same time-- mrs featherstone to the door to fling it open--and mr featherstone toward the mantlepiece--and mr featherstone won he clutched the little charm with shaking hands and as fast as he could say the words he prayed to the evil bauble to take back whatever it was that choked and groaned on their veranda mrs featherstone's hand jerked open the door and she stared spell-bound into the blank empty darkness and yet there was something--a single shot of blood abruptly our friend stopped his story and we asked how he got the charm i happened to be present when they pulled mrs featherstone's body out of the river this was in her hand we couldn't repress a shudder and we didn't feel comfortable until the charm and the old friend were out of the office --for good we hope the editors unemployed men and women hail this

grisly thing could have hap- pened i knew not i knew only that the next victim to the bloody gods of these mad hellions was to be-- the girl i loved the precursors of horror are sometimes strangely innocu- ous just a string of dancing dolls was the thing that brought the cold fire to kill five of our friends and send helen behind madhouse bars paper dolls such as children scis- sor out of folded newspapers    none of us had expected to meet death  arms of the flame goddess mystery and bizarre horror in a feature-length novel that day when we went out for a late afternoon stroll in the woods around monmouth mountain just a summer day's jaunt--but it was an outing that was to lead us into the valley of hell after rambling for an hour or so laugh- ing and chatting the six of us came out of the trees on to the crest of a little knoll and then at the sight which sud- denly leaped at us we came to a standstill   dime mystery magazine and i for one felt my very spine go cold fifty yards away a man stood with whips of thorns in his hands save for a dirty rag twisted about his loins he was stark naked he was lashing himself with the whips the blows brought rivulets of blood trickling over his pipestem limbs and at each stroke he leaped high in the air foam spattered his face and his eyes blazed with a maniacal glare he was muttering some unintelligible gibberish under his breath what he seemed to be saying in a hoarse hysteri- cal croak was blood blood and fire to wash me from sin it was a revolting spectacle we had all heard that this remote region of moun- tain valleys was a hotbed of the peni- tentes a cult of self-torturers who had imported their weird beliefs from mexico --religious fanatics who sought hope of forgiveness of sins through punishment of the body here upon earth but this was the first evidence we had had that the tales contained an element of truth we all stood spellbound an instant and then i broke away from the others anger at sight of such human beastliness needled me i rushed up to him gripped him by a naked sweat-glistening shoulder and spun him around you fool i yelled what are you doing he whirled to snarl through bared teeth he brought his thorn whip slashing across my face as i stumbled away he jerked from my clutch and went galloping into the bushes the others came up and we all ran after him there was no sane reason for this for we knew the danger of meddling in the affairs of the clannish and hate-ridden folk of these valleys it was some urge of horrified curiosity that sent us beating through the underbrush on his heels a dip in the ground shut him from our view a moment later we came into the open again at the edge of a little glade we rushed a step forward and then froze in our tracks ed bradshaw's voice came in gagged husking great god what is that the man we had been chasing lay motionless on the ground in the midst of the grassy plot he was dead but as we stole forward we knew that it wasn't the flogging that had killed him he had been burned to death his body was charred to a blackened husk crusted over with a queer hard shell that flaked off in crackling fragments as ed poked at it with his foot for a long instant then there wasn't a sound save the eerie croon of the wind in the trees and our tightened breathings this was incredible two minutes before we had seen him running--and now his carcass lay charred to a cinder as though it had been exposed to the blast of a holo- caust  helen--my wife--slid her hand into mine it was a hand of ice george thorn- ton's voice came thick with bewilderment he's done to a crisp but there isn't any fire the grass around him isn't even burned we stared from the dead man to one another's whitened faces no human hand it seemed could have killed him only a power conjured from sorcery's depths he had burned to death there where he lay--but the grass stems around him were still waving and green in vain i told myself that i was a fool tried to use reason to convince myself that it was some kind of a grisly hoax educated man though i was i couldn't for this was beyond reason it was the voice of nathalie thornton's wife that snapped us out of our horrified staring and brought us wheeling around nathalie was a care-free and jolly sort buxom blue-eyed and always laughing but now she stood queerly white staring arms of the flame goddess  down at the ground fear was in her face look oh look at that she cried it was because they were so small that in our excitement we hadn't noticed the line of figures half buried in weeds and grass we saw now that they were dancing dolls long strings of six-inch high cut-outs linked arm in arm from their nests of green stems they peered up with the pert impish faces of sprites evoked from the nether world such things as evil-minded children might have scissored and left to enclose the form of the dead man in a magic ring but no children had been here--no one had been here mary bradshaw let out a cry her voice reedily thin and unnatural don let's go let's get out of here i'm afraid  we were all afraid horror rode on the cold that flowed out of the mountain caves to tingle at the roots of our spines yes we'll go i muttered i slid my arm around helen's slim waist started to turn her away and then stiffened for the undergrowth around us had suddenly come alive hunched squatting forms could be seen with gnome-like faces as though a vent from hell had poured a horde of its denizens up onto the earth their hands clutched sticks and clubs the bushes rustled as they crept forward still sheer terror held us transfixed till a cry suddenly tocsinned kill kill burn them to death we turned then and fled--fled from the picture of a dead man inside a ring of paper dolls from the yells of those who wanted to do likewise to us i don't know how we managed to keep ahead of them through the half mile of wood road out to the place where we had parked our car on the highway for terror of nightmare seemed rooting our feet to the ground the last hundred yards i snatched helen up into my arms and carried her and thornton and bradshaw did the same with their wives the sun was close to setting as we dashed out to see the machine standing at the edge of the road yet there was light enough to show us the addition that had been made to it since we had left it there--a string of paper dolls looped across the front of the windshield i yanked the things off and flung them on to the ground we piled into the car without a word sweat clammed the palm of my shaking hand as i fumbled the key into the lock of the ignition i tramped on the gas and sent the car lurching and skidding around the sharp turns of the narrow road fast as i drove it wasn't swiftly enough to shake us free of the terror that raced at our sides that seemed to snatch at us from the shadow blots rolling down from the hills like swollen carcasses of octopi we were returning to the house of one of the natives where we had engaged ac- commodations for the week or so that we had expected to be here the business that had brought us to monmouth valley had started when helen and i had been induced to join the other four friends who were with ue in buying as a speculation a large tract of woodland property that had been some years before i knew that the timber standing on our land was of considerable value but i had opposed their suggestions to cut and market it i knew this region hereabouts and i hated the dark solitudes of the ridges and gloomy ravines i feared the ignorance and sullen cruelty of its natives but when there came to us a report of an engineer that signs of oil were ap- parent in several places the importunities of my wife and the others became too insistent to stand against my first sug- gestion had been for the other two men to come with me to investigate the truth of the reports but the girls vetoed the idea of being left out i'm an owner as much as you are and i'm going too  dime mystery magazine helen had exclaimed her eyes sparkling that was like helen petite brown- eyed and vivacious she was a live-wire of eager vitality for the five years of our marriage she had been my partner in everything--mind soul and body i loved her with respect for her fine brain de- votion to her loyalty and a hunger for her lush perfect womanhood that held still a lover's ardent heat the other wives too had insisted on coming and so we had made up the party we had arrived three days before and from the information we had so far gath- ered the prediction of buried riches seemed to have something it looked as though we might be in for a clean-up but i couldn't be easy in mind the natives hated us strangers coming to dis- turb the vice-ridden isolation in which they delighted in the squalid little village which formed their metropolis something foul and obscene seemed to breathe in the very air when i saw the sin-bitten countenances and piggy eyes of its in- habitants fastened on helen i would have given a million if she hadn't come and now the dead man in the woods and the paper dolls and those dolls too across the front of our car    what sense in that macabre mingling of childish toys and hideous death it was the re- volting prank of a ghoul i looked down to meet helen's eyes turned up to mine and i knew that the smile i strove to make reassuring was twisted and white the house to which we were returning was the home of frank leadbetter and his wife who had been recommended by our only friend in town lawyer emery paave supper was ready when we had garaged the car in the barn and gone into the house with our two hosts await- ing our arrival in the kitchen leadbetter was a gangling bean-pole of a countryman with tallow-white face that sloped chinless into the open neck of his faded blue shirt he had a shock of slicked-down red hair and pale blue parrot eyes above a hooked beak of a nose big as he was he was dominated into cringing subservience by his acid- tongued little shrew of a wife maria leadbetter could have served as a pattern of womanhood at its most repellent--a face dark and forbidding as a tomahawk with rodent black eyes under greasy tangles of hair that looked as though it had never known the ministrations of a comb we ate without much conversation for the memory of what had happened lay like something dead in our stomachs finally i leaned toward the farmer and suddenly asked did you ever hear of a man being burned to death without any fire the man's fork dropped clattering to the table he shot me a glassy-eyed stare he lifted a big white hand matted with reddish hairs to paw at the wattled flesh under his gullet he didn't pay up he managed to mutter at last they hexed him to burn whom didn't he pay i exclaimed pay what for a long moment while leadbetter stared at me there wasn't a word spoken bradshaw sat motionless his square heavy face with the mop of black hair tensely alert thornton's lean intellectual counte- nance with the brilliant blue eyes was sharp as a hound's on the scent whether the farmer would have told us more i do not know but his wife standing behind at the stove half turned to rasp out a cry discordant as a raven's croak leadbetter flinched as though he had been lashed by a whip and after that he wouldn't utter another word the meal was finished in silence rising from the table i left the house and went out on the piazza i wanted a chance to try to focus my thoughts to try to figure some sense out of these fantasies in a arms of the flame goddess  moment helen joined me to wrap both of her arms around one of mine and hud- dle against me it might have been five or six minutes that we stood there staring at the black wall of the forest only a short distance away and then i heard my wife's breath in a swift indrawing as her grip tightened around my arm out there among the trees lights were moving pale will-o-the-wisps that flitted through the gloom like torches of etherial fire and then came something more in- credible yet for the fire seemed to take on the shapes of girls dancing--linked hand in hand like the paper dolls slim nude shapes that swayed in spectral minuet and now they seemed to be beckoning to me luring taunting with an invitation of circe-like wantonness foul unclean things were whispering i felt their snaky crawling across my brain for i was aware of an amazing emotion a longing to go there to those girls i knew a cold clutching of incredulous fear i as an educated man couldn't believe in any rot of supernatural powers such as was driving the leadbetters cold with fear but what could have happened to me to make me so unlike myself to make me sweat with unnatural desire to clutch those naked girls in my clasp it was as though the hex sign of the dolls on my car despite my disbelief in them had distilled a subtle poison into my soul what dreadful thing might have taken place the next instant i don't dare to think i was tugging impatiently at helen's hands to free myself when steps sounded behind and bradshaw's voice came in a gagging shout from the door- way what he husked out in terror was collier come in here for god's sake come into the house his voice sounded insane devoid of meaning it rose from a strangled sobbing to lash the air in dull iterations chapter two they kill without hands a scream tocsinned from inside as we turned to run after him it came from a room up at the head of the stairs we saw mary bradshaw's face peering down over her husband's shoulder and the next moment we were up on the land- ing too a few minutes before it seemed thorn- ton had excused himself to come up here wondering what had kept him when he didn't return nathalie had come to see she had found--what we saw there in the middle of the floor we knew that it must be thornton the platinum wrist watch on his arm told us that but the face that looked up at us wasn't his it wasn't--human it was a jet cinder a shrunken and blackened skull burned hard as iron with rows of white teeth in sardonic grinning between what was left of the lips the rest of him hadn't been touched his clothes were un- scorched and no fire had been there for the bare boards around him weren't even singed i stood there with my fingernails biting into my palms and i wanted to yell out my horror helen's mouth opened to speak but the rasped croakings that came from it conveyed nothing save utter ter- ror she threw herself into my arms shaking hysterically her hands clawing my shoulders oh what did it what killed him like that without anyone's hearing she finally managed to gasp i didn't answer her i was just a com- mon man as well informed as the average as open to reason but this--i put it out of my mind i wouldn't allow myself to think what i would have to if i thought at all steps became audible on the stairs and the face of maria leadbetter showed in  dime mystery magazine the doorway her huge husband scuffed dog-like at her heels he took one look at what lay on the floor and went green his mouth made gulping motions like those of a fish and then he gasped it's them they've been here been in the house-- his wife didn't utter a word she shot a glance at thornton and then she whirled and went clattering down stairs she was muttering some unintelligible farrago un- der her breath what she seemed to be croaking was a rigamarole of disjointed phrases over and over like a charm i pulled helen out of the room and then they were all getting out of there we didn't even lift thornton to lay him on the bed none of us could endure the thought of touching that twisted thing that we knew would squirm and crackle under our touch there was only one thing to be done now and we all knew what it was but helen voiced it first she moaned don take me away from here get me out of this place i looked at bradshaw he said i'll get one of the cars you folks get busy and pack what you will need for overnight he hurried down stairs i stayed with the girls while helen and mary packed for themselves and nathalie too thorn- ton's wife was on the verge of a crack-up she sagged down on the edge of mary's bed and sat swaying to and fro racking out those horrible tearless sobs tt took helen maybe two minutes to fling a few necessaries into a couple of bags when the suitcases were ready i picked them up and preceded the girls down stairs the front door was open maria leadbetter was outside working feverishly with a shovel she was digging a hole in front of the step just as we came into sight she dropped into it a freshly killed chicken and with it was silver--a handful of trinkets and cheap jewelry--and a wisp of hairs from the tail of a horse what are those for i said she looked up at me face contorted wild-eyed the hexes can't git over em she panted i'm a-goin to put some more at the back door an lay knives on the winder sills the spot of cold on my spine slid to my scalp where were we  in twentieth century america or back in the dark ages there wasn't long to think about that for suddenly bradshaw appeared around the side of the house he barged up to the door and stood gripping its frame face sweat-beaded and whiter than wax we can't make it he gasped they've ruined the cars tires slashed ignition ripped out gas tanks split open-- it will take hours in a repair shop to get them rolling for an instant no word was spoken something sightless and cold seemed to pass over us the shadow of death then mary bradshaw screamed we're too late they're going to kill us we're all going to burn to death finally we hauled ourselves around back into the house and into the grubby little sitting room we stood there and tried to think what to do walking was out of the question we were twenty miles from the nearest town there was only one man in the place to whom we could appeal--lawyer emery paave and he was down in the village a couple of miles away finally it was decided that one of us --it chanced to be me who was picked by the fall of a coin--should try to get there and see him and also the sheriff it was agreed that the three girls and brad- shaw should all sit together down stairs and that he should have leadbetter's loaded shotgun arms of the flame goddess  we didn't know how much time we had--if we had any time no one knew how thornton had burned but if he had died why not brad or mary--or helen any one of us at any moment now turn- ing black the way he had somehow i felt i think we all knew that whatever we did would be helpless and futile how could we with puny human means thwart the unseen menace of those who had twice killed with a power that must come from hell i took helen into my arms to kiss her goodbye and my soul was cold the village houses were like skulls of long-dead colossi with blinking yellow eyes lining the road a brighter cluster of illumination marked the location of the store through dust-grimed windows i saw the place half filled with a motley crowd worm-eaten boards creaked un- der my feet and then i swung open the door and paused on the threshold looking around for a moment none of the score of slouched figures seemed to have noticed my entrance in that instant before a word was said i noticed again a fact that had puzzled me more than once before that many of them wore in the lapels of their coats small buttons as though marking membership in some order the design of the emblem was a face of scarlet against a black background and what a face a miniature replica of a satan with beady green eyes and sprouting horns i raised my voice can anyone tell me where to find emery paave a few heads turned to cast black glances back at me but save for that my inquiry elicited no response one pimply- faced youth stood slouched against a wall eyeing me i approached him money dis- played in my half-opened hand want to make five dollars i said the lad's eyes lighted greedily as he pocketed the bill doin what  he said in a high treble i'm after a little information i stepped closer and lowered my voice did you ever hear of men that go around in the woods with whips flogging people the paucky-looking youth stiffened his eyes narrowed to wary slits his mumbling reply was too ready too facile me i never heard of em i reached out to touch the devil button in his coat what's that i said some society that you belong to  his eyes flickered sidewise a vulpine look came over his face he mumbled hit's nawthin jest suthin i found i ought to have known that i had said enough for the others had turned to come flocking around us a duster of pale men- acing eyes a wizened old ruffian with trickles of tobacco juice leaking from the angles of his toothless gums shoved up to me and rasped in a strident falsetto you ever hear o folk gettin into trouble by askin questions that didn't con- cern em git out o here and go along o your own business common sense should have told me my danger then and warned me to clear out while they would still let me go but fool- hardily i asked one more thing for i thought that some one might let go of a hint to indicate who was behind the out- rages that were taking place and i still didn't really believe that they would dare harm me what i said was i found a man dead in the woods this afternoon he must have been burned to death by children for there were paper dolls-- the moment those words left my lips i knew i had done it hunger for murder had lain like a mine in that crowd only awaiting a spark to set it off and my re- mark was the spark an animal growl rasped around the ring i saw upraised hands gripping clubs hunched figures surged toward me a circle of hate-twisted  dime mystery magazine faces hatred founded on the primitive unreasoning ignorance of beasts terror snatched at me then i started backing away from them toward the door i had just managed to get outside when some one threw a stone a shower of missiles pelted me and the next moment i was pinned in the center of a cursing and milling pack for an instant it was slug smash and punch with my fear-needled muscles en- dowed with a strength that wasn't my own i had been a middle-weight boxer in college and for a short time i held my ground with them my jabs drove them back holding their jaws and clutching their stomachs they surged closer and i grunted grim relish as i felt faces cave under my full swings but this couldn't last they yammered fury and came on afresh i knew stabbing agony as their sticks bludgeoned my skull some one tripped me and i was down they were using their feet on me now with insensate cruelty of a wolf-pack rending a fallen one they pounded my head and my vitals i rolled on to my face and tried to protect my brain with my folded arms their blows ripped them away the most terrible of all sounds upon earth the death roar of a mob rolled over me while shrill voices sky- rocketed  kill the damned rich un pound the damned spy to death only feebly now could i strive to cover myself for my numbed muscles were al- most done i knew they were killing me i sobbed prayers for mercy and i heard them laughing in mockery as my senses slipped into oblivion chapter three the punished of god i came back from unconsciousness-- from death as i at first thought in my dazed bewilderment--to find myself lying on a couch with a huge figure standing and looking down at me in the light of an oil lamp my forehead was wet and the raw taste of whisky burned my lips i blinked grunted and pushed myself up to sitting seeing me at last coming around the big man set the lamp down on a table and with a sigh of relief pulled a chair up to my side he was the man i had come to see lawyer paave a moun- tainous dutchman with a mane of yellow hair and a face round and red as a balloon you haf had a narrow esgape my friendt collier a fery narrow esgape he said in his thickened guttural those maniacs out there would haf gilled you if i had not come along yust in time and driven them off what happened--from de beginning i told him the story commencing with the flogging man in the woods and ending with thornton's death and the crippling of our cars he shook his head as i fin- ished deeply troubled his voice rumbled back it iss even worse than i feared i do nod need to tell you of the dreadful ignor- ance and superstitions of de people in this valley how they are believers in witch- craft this may seem ingoncievable in these days of progress but you haf only to read in de newspapers to know of de hex murders that take place around here but this iss nod all there are de penitentes those fools who haf gone mad pondering on their sins they commit horrible deeds to gain salvation through punishment of de flesh and it iss believed --though no one iss sure--that the man who is at de head of de penitentes is also de hex boss who through his supposed power to cast charms and bewitch his enemies forces efery man woman and child to obey his gommands he plays a double part from time to time he kills some one in a terrible way to terrify de others and keep them obedient and he has goot reason for wanting you out of de arms of the flame goddess  way if you find oil it will mean the com- ing of business of progress everything which will end his gontrol which iss based on fear and ignorance have you any idea how he does it i said how he kills them without any fire paave got out a silk handkerchief and mopped the sweat from his bald head he looked at me strangely hexes he muttered they are be- witched he puts a charm on them so that they burn i stared at him you believe that too i exclaimed you an educated man-- when i first came here i would haf said the same as you the blue-eyed giant muttered but now my friendt collier i haf seen--gott knows what i haf seen i got myself up from the bed to pace the floor the fear of this unimaginative dutchman his acceptance as fact of the things that i had tried to tell myself were sheer madness frightened me more ac- tually than thornton's death and the thing in the woods who is this man i said after a mo- ment where can i find him  his name iss hans ludlam he iss another dutchman paave answered he lives in a shack in de woods i'm going to see him i said i'm going to have the truth out of him will you take me--or are you afraid paave knocked the ashes out of his long pipe and rose slowly he said heavily i am nod afraid of him but you must nod go there--nod now he held up his hand listen out there to the mob the town iss crazy tonight with hate against you and yours when i wass bringing you in here i heard them talking about going out to get the rest of your friends you haf a lovely wife and-- the big man's voice dropped to a fear- tightened husking but it iss nod those out there with the clubs whom you should fear most for they kill only the body it iss the others who slay body and soul too with their fires--fires from hell kindled without human hands the grip of his powerful fingers bit into my arm this afternoon they put the hex on you--and her too no one who has ever received that has lived not ever one if you have one little chance to see her alive before dot burning come to her-- still talking rapidly he steered me across the room toward a door go by the back way out and get home to her go as fast as you can and then faster i will go to the sheriff he and i will get ludlam and the two of us will take him to leadbetter's you can talk with him and then we still stay with you the rest of the night i gripped his hand silently through the moment's silence voices in the street rose in hubbub of curses lantern lights glinted on waving clubs joy hodges in new movie gives star performance joy hodges highlights the universal picture

and ever-ready razors star blades  for   dime mystery magazine come on let's go and get them the gathering cry rang paave pushed me swiftly out of the room and pointed my way along a dark- ened rear passage i followed it to a back door opening into a yard outside i halted an instant to listen to the growl that rolled over the housetops and then i started to run the two miles of rutty mud-plastered going seemed long as eternity i raced through patches of forest and then between overhanging cliffs where the wind came freighted with cold and voices of things unseen crooned from the rock crannies my panting breaths tugged my lungs out by the roots while terror gibbering at my heels flogged me faster and faster still if god would only let me find helen there find her alive   when at last i pounded into the yard i took one look at the house and my heart dropped like a lump of lead into my stomach the front door sagged awry on shattered hinges the windows gaped with splintered panes the mud in the yard was chewed into quagmire by milling of many feet i raced up to the door and there i stood rigid an instant before i could move or speak at last i wet my lips and managed to gasp helen  helen where are you  there was no answer a ribboned win- dow shade slatted back and forth a va- grant wind was wandering through the dark hallways it swayed the flame of the single candle that stood on a table as though tugging at it with spectral fingers somewhere a dog howled i stumbled in over the threshold and caught up the candle from room to room i stormed i cast wild-eyed glances into dark corners from time to time i halted to sob out her name and then suddenly i heard her answer a far-away shrilling don don i'm here i beat my way toward that wailing my hands pawing the dark as though they would tear open a passage through which i could fly to her as i rounded a corner there was a pattering of feet and a slim little figure rushed to throw itself into my arms she clung to me in hysterical re- action and i could feel her body throb in the tremors that racked it she lifted her tear-streaked face to mine and i couldn't stop kissing her what happened i whispered at last was it the mob from the village no--some of those men that we saw in the woods with the whips they broke down the door i ran up into the attic and hid under a bed and the others i said thornton and brad and mary-- her answer came in sobbed moaning they got them they took them away not the leadbetter's though they ran into the woods my heart beats checked with a sudden sick feeling all our friends gone and only god's mercy that helen too    i blew out the candle and for a long minute we stood motionless clinging to one another and listening outside the night was alive with noises whisperings and clickings and rustlings whether those ghouls had departed or were still hanging around there was no way to tell if those noises out there were men they would realize that there was one whom they hadn't got and return then little by little a small wooden sound became audible rhythmic persist- ent like tapping of spectral drumsticks out of the night's immensity i listened a moment longer and then i slid my arm around helen while i laughed shakily that's the loose spoke in paave's buggy i said he and the sheriff are coming and the boss of the penitentes a couple of minutes later the ancient horse-drawn vehicle turned into the yard paave and the big flaxen-haired arms of the flame goddess  sheriff got out and came forward helen and i met them on the steps and i told them what had taken place they've got all of our friends i con- cluded savagely and if that man there is hans ludlam he knows where they are paave turned to the figure which up to this time had stood half concealed in the shadows dere iss hans ludlam he said i stepped closer to ludlam big as paave was the boss of the penitentes loomed shoulders above him a huge white beard rippling like burnished silver from the blue intensely penetrating eyes clear to the man's wrist gave him a pa- triarchal appearance he had a swelling dome of a bald head over high corrugated forehead a nose massive and rapacious as a hawk's beak the mouth under the bushy moustache was a pair of lips thin white incredibly cruel is it true that you are the leader of a sect known as the punished of god  i asked the big shining head nodded indif- ferently i am the pastor of those of us who are aware of the power of sin a deep voice rumbled sonorously and your adherents torture themselves and one another by voluntary floggings i continued christ was flogged with a whip of thorns before he died on the cross the patriarch intoned can we wretched mor- tals do less than accept punishment for our sins in the same way and you practice witchcraft as a side line i went on you keep this valley of ignorant people in slavery by working on their superstitions you kill men and women to keep them subservient to you the man's voice came with the bellow of an angry bull that is a lie i do not deny that such things go on but they are the doings of --others we are just a company of poor struggling souls trying to purify ourselves so that in the day of judgment we may be received at the heavenly gates we harm no others and what we do among our- selves is our own affair my friends and i saw a man flogging himself in the woods this afternoon i retorted when we got to him he had been burned to death but no fire was near him men with whips--some of your men--were there and chased us there was a hex sign of paper dolls there and one on our car later one of our party was killed in this house in the same way those men of yours did it all they took our friends away an hour ago where are they now for a long moment the man stared at me in such frozen silence that i thought he had not understood what i said then suddenly he leaped at me clubbed fists beating like pile drivers they came down on my shoulders and one smash of them beat me to my knees i tried to jump backward but they found me again they pounded my head and the back of my neck their blows rang on my cranium till they filled it with shooting stars paave and the sheriff were after him now he drove his great knotted hands into their faces like rocks at the ends of piston-rods they staggered back gasp- ing through spurting blood they rallied and charged him again and he beat them like puppets they were gone now taken to flight and he whirled to where i was just stag- gering up to my feet he blasted me down again his fists were hammers of thor beating the life out of a squirming pigmy of mortal man who twisted and grovelled this way and that to escape from their punishment finally he paused to get breath like a mouse fleeing a torturing cat i dragged  dime mystery magazine myself half crawling half running into some bushes he didn't follow me i heard him muttering under his breath as he turned and went stamping out of the yard and off down the road i got myself up on my feet and stood leaning against a tree panting and spitting blood i felt as though i had been pum- meled by the hoofs of a horse i wiped tears and sweat from my eyes and looked around for paave and the sheriff i couldn't see either of them or the buggy and then the spine-tingling realization came that they had fled terrified at lud- lam's berserker onslaught they had left helen and me to his mercy helen--what had become of her i looked wildly around gasped her name footsteps sounded and she was there shivering against my side i slid my arm around her yielding softness and i thanked god for one mercy that she was alive she clung to me she sobbed through chattering teeth what are we going to do now don where can we go try to get back to town i guess i said get to paave's he's a coward but he'll take us in i thought that then--i dreamed that in this night of fear there could be one place of safety for us helen and i groped our way to the road for five or ten minutes we plodded along clinging to one another's hands and not talking the darkness was thronged with armies of shadows that scuttled forward skipped sidewise rolled backward again shadows of rocks and trees or    we couldn't tell we slid past them cringing and the leaping of their swart arms at us brought showers of gooseflesh tingling our spines and little by little i was convinced that they weren't shadows of inanimate things the croaking of frogs in the marshes had been the only sounds for a while then from behind came rustlings and grittings squshing of feet rumble of gutteral whis- pers the roadway was clogged with a jumble of forms whose whiplashes zig- zagged against the stars there they are they're coming for us helen's cry spurted and then we were running stumbling and tripping slewing through mud racing as we had never fled before i pulled helen along by one hand and visions of thornton's cindered face and the circle of paper dolls twisted an iron hand in my vitals how long or how far we ran i wouldn't know finally came the time when i knew it was over for we couldn't go any more helen's knees had melted beneath her i had swept her up into my arms now i too was winded retching for breath and spitting blood her voice came half strangled from where her face was crushed into my shoul- der kill me don  kill me now with your pocket knife don't let them get me she sobbed not to die the way thorn- ton did do it now quickly while i am kissing you chapter four fingers of doom with my free hand i fumbled for the knife in my pocket she was right better death at my loving hands than the tortures of those sadist beasts and that was somehing for which the almighy would forgive me on judgment day wildly i groaned as i kissed her i would have done it the next instant had i not suddenly caught sight of a light in a house window and perhaps even so it would have been better perhaps she would be happier now perhaps i would be spared the nightmares that are slowly driving me mad if i had opened a vein in her little white throat but the house was there just a short distance ahead and i flogged my legs in arms of the flame goddess  a frantic sprint sagging piazza boards creaked under my weight as i rushed up to the door i didn't pause to knock i pawed for the latch burst open the door and threw myself over the threshold be- fore looking to see who was there or ex- plain to them i spun around to find the bolt and throw it across i set helen down on her feet white fires where searing my inwards and for a long minute i sprawled against the wall gasping before i could utter a sound the floggers are after us i finally managed to pant there were two of them in the poverty- bare kitchen a woman and man the poorest type of the most ignorant in- habitants of the valley ill-clad ill-nour- ished vacant-eyed at my words the woman let out a moan the man's jaw went limp they--ye say they're out there his voice rasped in a scream they'll git me they've come to kill me we'll fight them off i said haven't you got something a gun or an axe or some clubs anything we can fight with he shook his head wouldn't do no good i didn't pay in didn't hev no money to pay you didn't have money to pay what i said he looked at me curiously you're strange in these parts ain't ye we couldn't pay fer our button they come high--twenty dollars and now-- he turned to point at one of the win- dows against the outside of the glass had been pasted a string of the dancing dolls his finger jerked with his trem-

others horror stories april-may out now  dime mystery magazine i stared at him it couldn't actually be true that in these modern days i was watching a man gibbering in terror be- cause some one had pasted paper dolls on his window pane yet when i re- membered those other two men my heart seemed to turn over explain it or not call those fears madness of fools that pair had died in a way that no sophistry of the effete civilized world could begin to account for something hideous and stark and primitive was here who is this man you say hexes you because you didn't buy one of his but- tons i said at last the farmer shook his head i dunno nobody does he never shows up himself jest sends around one of the boys that works for him some of the men tried stringin up one of them boys to make him talk he didn't--but every last one in the crowd that did it was dead inside of a month burned to death i understood now the meaning of those emblems that i had seen in the village some mind with a hellish genius that cast that of a new york racketeer into eclipse had figured out this way to capital- ize the superstitions of these besotted country folk and wax fat on their sacri- fices if they bought a button and wore it--paid for protection--they weren't bewitched if they didn't    anyhow it's all nonsense i gripped the man's arm and shook him to jolt his bovine mind out of its daze there is no such thing as witchcraft it's all a-- he wasn't listening he was staring past me at something over my shoulder i saw his jaw drop and then a strange light that i can only describe as hunger stab through the apathy of his eyes his lips grew slack and wet and a gurgling sound broke from his throat i turned to follow his gaze i heard helen's gasp and then i felt my own pulses spurt with amazement a window opened from the kitchen onto the piazza and through this against the awful blackness of the night a figure was visible it was that of a young girl utterly nude save for a gauzy scarf around her slim loins she was of a witch- ing circe-like beauty her gaze fastened on us--on both of us men--and i for one couldn't withdraw my eyes her look held a pagan allure knowledge of age- old power of things beyond words of the stark and primitive instincts that call from woman to man she stepped back from the window so that her whole figure was visible her arms rose over her head her slender body taut and standing on tip-toe she seemed to be reaching to draw down the tide of white light to her bosom like a naiad of ethereal and inhuman beauty she stood there quivering breasts hardened and throbbing--a thing not of this world thrilling to the call of something born of the night and the moon's radiance her arms dropped lascivious ripplings passed through her writhings of a cat in throes of desire she lifted her breasts in her cupped hands holding them toward us a choked cry burst from the farmer and then i saw him rush past me to claw at the bolt securing the door sweat stood on his face it was the passion-gripped face of an animal his wife let out a scream she ran after him to pound at his hands trying to beat them down from the latch failing in that she flung her- self on him battling with all her frenzied strength to drive him away he shoved her angrily one side he shot back the bolt wrenched the door open and dashed out and i ran behind him i didn't at that time understand what prompted me to do that if i had used any reason at all to account for my action i would have told myself that i wanted to find out what was happening who was behind it for arms of the flame goddess  those who had been chasing us were no longer in evidence they seemed to have been drawn elsewhere to a fresh victim i would have told myself that but my eyes had devoured the seduction of that naked girl and heat fired my brain again that strange impulse that i had felt once before was urging me too in pursuit of the evasive figure that eluded the farmer's wild rush and went pirouetting across the yard she didn't pause for him to overtake her she ran swiftly to the opening of a path that led into the woods down this she sped a lambent white flame in the darkness and behind her lumbered the un- gainly form of the rustic i turned in there to rush after them but helen had had enough she brought me back to my sense with a stinging slap in the face what are you doing don  she cried what is the matter with you  i halted blinked and passed my hand over my eyes i had a queerly dazed feel- ing i don't know i muttered i must have been bewitched i had said that not of course meaning it literally but as a thoughtless form of words to convey that something had taken place which i couldn't explain and then my voice broke as a cold hand leaped to the back of my neck the farmer claimed to have been bewitched and i had scoffed at the notion but some unholy compul- sion had drawn him from his wife's side to follow the girl to what he must have realized would be his death and for the second time tonight i too had known that same unearthly almost uncontrollable temptation i groaned and swept helen into my arms hexes witchcraft -- phantoms whose power lives only in the minds of the damned those slaves of fear or vital forces of evil in that moment of terror i didn't know for i had lost the faculty of reasoning i only knew that i had just experienced an invisible magnetism of sin against which no will power could strug- gle if helen had not been here to save me    sweat stood on the palms of my hands as we turned and started back toward the road still we saw nothing of our late pursuers they had gone into the woods where the girl had been leading the farmer from deep in the forest came cracking of whips and a tocsin of agony a voice rose in gagged screechings to lash the dead air a sudden light flared briefly and died wafting of breeze brought aroma of roasting flesh i grabbed helen's arm and husked through clenched teeth come on let's run let's get out of this we came to the highway and started once more in the direction of town for perhaps ten minutes we plodded along when we were overtaken by a buggy which came lurching over the road at a gallop it drew down to a halt and the face that peered from around the side cur- tains was that of lawyer paave he waited for us and exclaimed as we came up i haf been looking eferywhere for you ludlam knocked me out senseless into some bushes that must be the reason you did not see me the horse took fright at de fighting and ran away and then de sheriff is scared too and he goes after you two haf left i come to my senses back i catch de horse half a mile down the road and start to search for you he made room on the seat get in i take you back to my house where you will be safe de sheriff is out with a possee looking for ludlam in de morning everything will be all right there was nothing else to be done i dreaded going back to the village i feared to stay in paave's house for his story of that last half hour sounded fishy be- tween him and ludlam i had seemed to  dime mystery magazine sense some unspoken understanding sup- pose he himself were in with the bearded giant--was the boss of the hex business but we had to go somewhere the law- yer's house seemed the only hope if i had realized then that there was no hope--not any at all paave arrived at his back door by side streets avoiding the crowd that still milled in the main thoroughfare the first faces i saw when we got inside were those of leadbetter and his wife they came here to get taken care of too paave explained i went up to my erstwhile host and said have you got one of those buttons he stared at me for an instant as though tempted to say he didn't know what i meant then his face twisted as he said no i hain't got one maria won't let me says it's all nonsense to pay twenty dollars fer a hunk o glass i said are you afraid--really afraid  he licked his parched lips he darted a look back at his wife her narrow face alive with a vulpine ferocity i'll say i'm afeared he husked maria wants fer me to git killed that's why she won't give me no money fer to pay up she wants em to hex me the farmer produced a flask from his hip pocket and held it out the liquor was the vilest of rot-gut but its raw scorching against the walls of my stomach gave me a synthetic courage that i badly needed i took two drinks long ones it was late long after midnight paave came proffering beds but i declined for helen and myself this was one night that i didn't dare close my eyes the leadbetters however accepted and de- parted to leave helen and me alone in the small sitting room she stretched out on a couch while i pulled a big chair up to her side hands linked we listened to the buzz of excite- ment now dying away in the village the place seemed to be quieting down yet i couldn't relax visions of terror rocketed through my brain thornton's face with the grinning white teeth--the demoniacal power that radiated from that patriarch of sin hans ludlam--our four friends gone where suffering what god only knew we two had so far escaped but would they leave us in peace now  was paave himself the boss of the hexers and had he brought us under his roof to make the rest of it easy to arrange  minutes dragged into eternities while terror sat the night watches with me chapter five love of the damned t don't know when it was that i closed my eyes and allowed slumber to over- take me--that night of all nights when with hell meshing closer i should have fought off the demons of weariness and kept awake at no matter what cost then presently i was conscious again lying sprawled in a stupor of half waking half sleeping the moon was higher now spilling a rectangle of misty light through a window i watched it trying to focus my thoughts the picture of those two dead men the circle of paper dolls the elfin forms of the dancing girls in the woods    was i mad or had uncanny and supernatural things really been taking place around me tonight my eyes slid away from the spot of light in the effort to shake off those be- wildering thoughts they moved toward the window and there they stopped my breath caught in my lungs a strange in- credulous terror prickled me with icy needlings there in the moonlight was the girl she wore only the same diapha- nous scarf about her lithe hips and her arms of the flame goddess  hair was a tossed mass of gold above the ivory mask of her face her eyes deep with that knowledge of unnamable time- less things clung fixedly to mine for a second she stood there in suddenly ar- rested motion and then she was gliding toward me she halted at the side of the chair stooping over me and her perfect body was an alabaster white statute sculptured from moonlight her hands reached down to glide over my face cool firm fingers stroked my temples there was a tingling passion in the touch of those fingertips that thrilled me over my whole body she smiled slowly languorously her voice came like an echo from far away what she was whispering i couldn't tell but the cadence of her voice vibrated answering strings in my brain half conscious half stupified i groped to seize those pale hands and crush them against my lips she trilled a laugh and moved swiftly out of my reach then i was conscious of rising to my feet and stumbling toward her my throat seemed to be bursting with the hammering of my heart which had flown up to lodge there and the fear that gripped me sprang from my knowl- edge that it had happened to me now as it had to those others having be- witched me with longing for her beauty she came to claim me to make me an- other one of her victims and yet for all that terror i was glad with a fiercely reckless exulting that dried my mouth and brought sweat to the palms of my hands i was a damned soul cursed by her beauty to follow her to my death in the fire yet the blood hissed on my ear drums as i mumbled wildly wait for me i'm coming i'm com- ing  i rushed another step toward her she pirouetted away and stood in the moon- light close to the window she waited there smiling she lifted her breasts in her cupped hands and held them toward me a maddening offering i started to run to her and then some deep-buried and almost forgotten memory prompted me to halt and direct a glance toward the couch where helen had been one faint tugging of loyalty to her still alive in the quicksand that was sucking me down again i looked and a cry broke from my lungs she wasn't there helen was gone while i had forgotten her in swin- ish sleep they had come and taken her for an instant longer i stood there transfixed while grief-stricken terror rolled over me in a flood that made me oblivious to the girl and her temptings i turned my back on her and rushed out of the room through the house i went storming shouting helen's name only echoes beat my cries back to me for she wasn't there paave the leadbetters--no one was in the house at last i found myself out of doors i must have been half demented for the triangles of the hills hunched over me like squatting beasts and the wind from their caves brought voices of night and bottom- less sin i stood there alone with the stars and my agony and then at last i was aware of the girl again she stood near me swaying slightly a wind-blown lily against the dark waiting and beckoning her call surged over me once more with a longing that obliterated all other thoughts fires swept through my parched throat and filled my brain i dashed after her arms straining god forgive me with my wife carried away to torture and death i raced after that naked woman and choked cries burst from me implor- ing her to come to me to wait till i could catch up she didn't pause she ran scarcely seeming to touch the ground with her twinkling white feet by deserted back  dime mystery magazine roads she led me out of the village and now she had turned into another narrow way into the woods down this she sped whirling spinning gyrating her nude body like a woodland sylph in the moon- light no words can possibly portray the weird uncanny loveliness of that spec- tacle her slim white body against the dark boles of the pines her blood-red hair spreading and billowing till it seemed an aureole of fire against which her torso and limbs stood outlined in gleaming ivory then suddenly she vanished-- rather she seemed to turn wholly into a flame for her body disappeared and there was only a fire an errant pointed flame that flitted in ghostly dippings against the black tree trunks whether that fire was human or ani- mal material or only a hallucination of my maddened brain i didn't know it was a will-o-the-wisp that led me sweating and panting through bogs and across fall- en trees gasping incoherent cries while i fought to get near enough to clutch its flickerings into my arms stark terror twisted my soul but i couldn't help my- self honor my duty to helen my love for her all seemed windy words without meaning the only thing that mattered was that leaping gyrating figure of pas- sion incarnate--passion whose attainment would bring my death as thornton had died    suddenly the girl vanished completely blotted out as though by a veil of envel- oping gloom and the fire too i came to a sudden standstill and stood breathless staring while my figure went rigid as stone as my eyes focused to take in my sur- roundings i became aware that i stood at one side of an open space among tower- ing trees the area was half filled with raggedly clad figures--some in mexican costumes--clutching whips the flames of a bonfire in the midst of the circle etched their faces in crimson and black countenances inhuman in fanatical cruelty they could have been imps of hell cavort- ing around a fumace-mouth in its infernal depths but those furies weren't alone there my horrified eyes counted other faces-- bradshaw and mary nathalie thornton and helen    brad and his wife and nathalie they had stripped naked and tied to stakes the penitentes pranced around them in a march bearing whips pointed with steel barbs they whooped in glee as they laid on the flagellations garment by garment they ripped off their own clothes till they were stark naked they lashed themselves too they leaped high in the air at the pain grotesque plunging figures that seemed to have been whelped from earth's hidden horrors the rout grew frenetic their shrieks held wild ecstasy of devotees approaching ultimate frenzy of pain-rapture i tried to identify some of the faces for i told my- self that if ever i got out of this alive i would invoke the help of the governor to wipe out this unspeakable cult in the uncertain firelight i couldn't be sure of only one individual was i positive of a huge white bearded form that i suddenly spied standing behind a screen of bushes and watching proceedings--hans lud- lam my hand groped over the ground seek- ing a club if i could find a weapon and creep around in the rear of this satan i would strike one blow to bring an end to his racket with the dashing out of his brains i hadn't crawled more than a few steps in my search when i froze to crouch star- ing into the circle a curse sprang to my lips for they had taken helen down from her stake and brought her into the ring she was still clothed and for an in- stant they contented themselves with dis- robing her i had to kneel there helpless  arms of the flame goddess and watch that fingers hooked into the neck of her dress a rip shredded it to the waist bringing her white shoulders and arms into view then they went after her underclothes in a moment it was all over before those gibbering satyrs she stood utterly nude they fell in behind her and drove her around and around while their whips rose and fell crooked red fingers leaped in zigzaggings over her skin her face in the firelight was a twisted white cameo chiseled from torture i felt every one of those whip strokes as though it were falling on my naked skin i cursed in meaningless snarlings my fingers clawed at the ground as i went scrambling on all fours still in search of a club i stopped to spin around as helen's moans rang again some one had brought a bridle and jammed the steel bar between her teeth they forced her down on her hands and knees and they were driving her like a horse flogging her and sawing the reins till the foam on her lips dripped crimson i lunged up to my feet and the yell that burst from my throat was a sound wholly animal i hadn't been able to find any weapon but i couldn't wait any longer the way i felt then i could tear them all limb from limb with my naked hands i surged a step forward and then to a standstill again at an incredible sight the gang had suddenly wheeled from helen to flock in a group around nathalie still tied to her high stake exactly what happened--whether they did anything at all to her or not--i couldn't tell but sud- denly her body seemed to burst into flame a spurting glare of yellowish-pink light it was an outlashing of heat terrific in its intensity for it sent the crowd spilling backward and even there where i stood i could feel its torrid wave in my eyes the fire went out as swiftly as it had come it had been in fact more of an explosion than a flame as it ebbed away i saw nathalie's body glowing all over red as a great coal drawn from a furnace swiftly it cooled to a black cinder it twisted in spasmodic convulsions of mus- cular reflexes i stood there spellbound while goose- flesh of an unspeakable horror rolled on my spine in my smug assurance of twelve hours before i had mocked at witchcraft and all its works but now i had stood and watched that girl burned to death when no fire was within yards of her what hope did i have what hope could there ever be of saving helen from those who killed with a power that could only be evoked from hell does your laxative make you sick in the stomach the first

blackened things gro- tesque and curled-up as foetuses snatched in untimely birth that crackled with thin gritting noises as they swayed in the breeze mary bradshaw was next one of the penitentes seemed to throw something in- visible toward her the light sprang in a blinding surge and then the breeze brought the stench of roasting meat all this time i hadn't moved sheer fas- cination of horror rooted me to the ground and then came the thing which blew the fuse in my brain as in a moving picture of doom i saw them seizing helen and dragging her toward another stake as yet untenanted their shouts rang the next she is the next the fire- god wants a new bride i saw them hustle her up there tie her by her uplifted arms to the vertical shaft saw her white nudeness against the pines her eyes upturned to her maker while before her the pack stood motionless wait- ing    chapter six damnation's picnic i had no weapon of any kind only my naked hands as i smashed through the undergrowth into the open neither had i any real hope of fighting off that mob single handed and rescuing her i was only a berserker primate who had slid backward ten milleniums in evolution in as many seconds in whose brain just one red emotion surged--to get to her side and gouge and rip and tear to kill as many of them as a man fighting by the side of his woman may kill before he him- self dies it was the fury of my unexpected on- slaught that took them off balance and scattered them for an instant i fell upon the ring from behind and i had dropped four of them with smashes to the nerve- centers of their necks before they were aware of my presence two who halted to spin around at me i felled with club- bings that broke their jaws and then i was through and running to helen i had got out my pocket knife as i ran i had thought to cut her down at least get her away from that stake where death leaped out of nothing but there wasn't time they came swarming over me drag- ging me back pinned inside of a ring i lashed at them with loathing of terror giving me a maniac's strength i used my fists and my feet on them then my finger- nails and my teeth and suddenly then the ring parted to let through another figure i saw a leather-brown face contorted and foam-spattered with glaring black eyes of a maniac long hair tossing against the stars told me that i had to do with a woman but no qualms of chivalry need have kept me from slugging her for she fought with the ferocity of a she- panther with a screech she flung herself on me her hands equipped with fanged claws lashed at my face long dirt-clogged nails dug into my eyeballs horror-thrilled i recoiled from her fury such a face as hers could have been whelped from no mortal mother only from womb of witches and midnight hags some one tripped me with a kick from behind and i was down she caterwauled and came flying knees first medusa locks streaming i retched with nausea at the smash in my vitals while she knelt there ripping and scratching she was killing me tearing my face into ribbons needled by pain my hand lashed out it caught her in the front of her dress rending it to the waist and bear- ing her withered brown breasts i jolted arms of the flame goddess  another blow to her face as i got my breath and lunged up to sitting she yowled like a rabid cat and drove her thumbs into my eyeballs all compunction swept away now i drove out a short jab that took her flush on her scrawny throat she slumped onto hands and knees gag- ging her larnyx shattered somewhere in the maelstrom that seethed around me helen screamed i gathered myself for a leap back to my feet but the mob surged in and their clubs beat me down again i was crawling on hands and knees while their whips found me helen sobbed again and the sound of that tortured wailing seemed to burst something inside of me god i had to get to my feet and go to her before there came another puff of that pink fire and her body swung there a blackened pendulum but i couldn't rise they were too many for me i clenched my teeth through bleeding lips and dug my fingers into the ground as i clawed myself forward suddenly i stumbled over something that impeded my progress it was a wooden box half filled with a greyish powder in frenzy i snatched it up and whirled to throw its contents over my shoulder into the faces and eyes of my tormentors it blinded them for an instant and as they stumbled back i attained my objec- tive the edge of the bonfire long heavy sticks only partially burned projected around its rim i snatched up one of them and with the thing in my hands i leaped to my feet armed now i rushed at them with the blazing end of the brand i belabored their bodies and faces and suddenly some- thing took place which caused me to let fall the stick and stand gaping in amaze- ment where sparks flew from the stick to light upon the irregular patches in which the powder had landed on the men and adhered there burst out those ex- plosions of incredible heat some with faces half burned away others with cindered cavities where eyes had been still others wearing jagged black shawls draped over their chests they shrank from me to throw themselves on the ground and lie rolling and shriek- ing in agony the foul horrible smell of burning flesh filled my nostrils and a fierce tumultous joy swept me at last my friends were being avenged i left them yammering there and stumbled around to the stake from which helen's choked screams were coming i didn't wait to get out my knife with bare hands i wrenched at the cords that pinioned her crossed wrists they parted and her limp figure came tumbling down into my arms i clutched her in the crook of one arm and wheeled back to face the pack for i hadn't disposed of all of them there were still enough of them left to do their will on us teeth bared like an ape i gripped the end of my club and stood waiting they didn't come and when my blurred vision cleared so that i could see again i stared transfixed with amaze- ment for another battle was in progress there now a second group of men armed with long flails had come dashing out of the trees they fell upon those of the tor- turers whom i hadn't disposed of and were engaged in bashing their brains in with their six-foot wagon stakes the leader of the new-comers was the white- bearded boss of the penitentes hans lud- lam  and at his side bellowing ven- geance stormed lawyer emery paave a sound of sobbing brought my eyes back to helen she hung limp in my clasp her eyes lifted to meet mine but she didn't recognize me through the blood-flecked foam on her lips she was moaning dull toneless screams over and over and over i groaned with agony drawn from my own tortured soul fast  dime mystery magazine as i had tried to come it hadn't been soon enough the pain and terror had been too much for her gentle mind she had gone mad i was still holding her crushed to me kissing her poor twisted face and begging her to speak when feet sounded at my side the fight was over paave and ludlam paused an instant and then with- out speaking strode forward to shaft the light of a lantern into the face of the woman i had hit in the throat and of the man lying next to her his face half oblit- erated by the strange burning the revela- tion of their features didn't tell me any- thing new for already i had divined that they were frank leadbetter and his wife it was those two who was doing it paave's voice rumbled at last they was the ones who have been collecting twenty dollars for buttons from eferyone on pain of hexing and death they fixed up t'ings to make it look like de penitentes so that ludlam would get the blame i myself thought he was doing it--till he came to me an hour ago and asked for my help their men with whips was all fakes those men you saw in the woods the first time was some of theirs ludlam and his people never hurt anyone they yust whipped one another and minded their own business the leadbetters did not want you here because they knew that sooner or later it would mean the end of their business they must have collected thousands of dollars they must have been terrible rich t stared at him and even now that i understood i was cold with the horror of it all what a racket and one possible only in a community whose mem- bers believed so implicitly in the power of witchcraft that they never questioned the genuineness of the things that seemed to be taking place and the girl who led the men into the woods to their deaths i said at last she wass my little ella my niece who keeps house for me the big dutchman groaned i did not know it i had no sus- picions the leadbetter woman got her to do that she must haf given her money --and drugs many times i haf seen her acting not herself and i haf wondered what iss wrong those other girls that you saw from the house dancing are probably more that she used in the same way the men on whom the leadbetters put the sign of the dancing dolls--without the victims knowing it some of their men must have got them to eat or drink some- thing containing a drug that made them insanely sex-hungry ludlam went on as paave halted overcome by grief and then when the naked girls came they could not help themselves the instinct was too strong they would follow them any- where even to death believing all the time that they had been bewitched leadbetter gave me a drink of whiskey in your house paave i exclaimed that was how he got me and the first time back at the house it was in the food when i thought that i saw the girls turn- ing into flames it was hallucinations brought on by the drug when the girl came to you you could not help from following her ludlam said but when you arrived at the place where they were torturing your wife you came to your senses the drug had not been strong enough the big man took a turn up and down but what i do not yet understand he muttered after a moment is how they did it with the burning how one could be burned without any fire i can explain that now i said i re- membered the box of grey powder which i had hurled into the men's faces and which had later burst into flame there is a certain chemical--thermite--which can be ignited with a match and burns with a terrifically hot fire hot enough to melt arms of the flame goddess  iron it is used for welding together broken pieces of metal if this thermite were mixed with a little grease to make it adhere and the paste smeared over a per- son's body it could be set going with just a match and he would roast to a crisp in five seconds paave and ludlam both stared at me open-mouthed then that is the way it was done came the deep voice of the bearded giant in some way leadbetter ignorant as he was learned of that chemical and got a supply of it those men you saw in the woods had already spread the body of the self-flogging one with it before he started whipping himself during the few mo- ments when he was out of your sight they set him on fire and then placed the circle of paper dolls around his body the man who died in your house-- leadbetter did that himself i ex- claimed he must have got thornton up stairs alone knocked him senseless with a club and then in only a few seconds spread the stuff over his head and touched it off for another long moment nobody spoke now that we knew the truth of the horrors it didn't seem to make them any less dreadful rather more soul-sicken- ing and the sight of helen's nude body dribbling blood while those meaningless noises rasped from her throat i picked her up in my arms and car- ried her out of there while the two big men were tieing up the leadbetters who by this time had recovered consciousness buggies were waiting in the highway at the end of the wood road some one brought blankets to wrap around helen and we started the twenty mile drive to the nearest town where there was a doc- tor it was noon of the next day before i finally got her into a hospital she was there for two months before she knew me again and they said it would be better for her to go away somewhere with me that was two years ago there wasn't any oil on our property in monmouth valley i sold the timber right to a syn- dicate and tried to forget it all little by little those memories are fading from helen too but when the flame of a lighted match suddenly spurting in her eyes sends her to fly shivering into my arms i know that she is seeing again the form of nathalie thornton bursting into red fire--and hearing the croon of whips hissing against her naked skin the

bartlett had to die--betrayed by the girl who loved him the fog was growing thicker dimming the rays of the headlights into a sickly yellow that didn't show more than five feet of the muddy road ahead of the car wheels spawned by the river bottoms the heavy grey vapor coiled about us like the miasmic breath of a monster from another world my teeth were pressed tightly together to keep them from chattering then a spasm shook me and i trembled so violently that the car almost swung into the ditch that bordered the road by main strength i pulled it back glanced at chloe who sat beside me she had not noticed she was leaning forward with a strange intent look on her lovely face her eyes were wide and dark her nostrils flared slightly as if she were waiting for something to appear out of the writhing mist and she didn't know what it might be don't misunderstand me it wasn't fear that made my palms slippery with sweat made my muscles jump uncontrol- lably  or was it sometimes you can't distinguish between cause and effect at least i hadn't felt anything like fear when we left boston two days before i had been gay excited then and chloe had been even more so the trip down to south carolina was to be a fore-taste of our honeymoon she hadn't been home in over ten years after her parents death she had been sent up north by her uncle and had stayed there when we had writ- ten to him announcing our marriage plans and he had invited us to come  chains of dread desire  down and stay at the old duquesne home it had seemed like a wonderful idea i wanted a chance to meet this last remain- ing relative of hers see the place where she had been born then that morning just coming into south carolina this feeling had come over me a dull heaviness a sense of fore- boding a cold chill would sweep over me and i would have to knot my muscles to keep from trembling a touch of fever you say born of the damp low lying land through which we were driving per- haps but it was more like the sudden unaccountable prickling that contracts your skin when you say you felt as if someone had walked over your grave t said nothing to chloe about the strange leaden feeling in my heart somehow she seemed to have changed from the girl i had known in boston she had lost her clipped finishing school dic- tion her speech had become soft and slurring she was sinking back into her heritage of the deep south making me feel like an invader an intruder i glanced sideways at her she was still staring ahead as if she could see through the fog wreathed darkness her nostrils were distended as if she were filling her lungs with the dank odor of rotting vegetation i knew we were close to her old home she had said it was only twelve miles from the last town yet when she suddenly sat erect put her hand on my arm and said wait i started it was she who pulled on the brake switched off the motor her eyes were glowing queerly what   i began then i heard it a strange murmuring chant sounding through the murk i couldn't get the words but i didn't need to it was filled with hopelessness and despair yet it seethed with an under-level of hate it was primitive abysmal yet i knew it was a part of this land to which i was for- eign with a quick movement chloe pushed open the door wait there she called over her shoul- der then she had run across the road and disappeared into the swirling dark- ness i continued to sit there for a split second open-mouthed where had she gone why with a curse i threw open my door leaped out also chloe i called chloe no sound but the low throbbing of the chant an- swered me i leaped the ditch beside the road started to run stumbling through the darkness tough grasses twisted around my ankles branches slapped damply across my face the chant was growing louder now it swelled up to a chorus of misery then ceased and in the flat silence that followed i heard a sound that brought me up short heart pounding it was a faint choked moan- ing and clank of heavy chains the crack of a whip i stood there waiting listening the short hairs prickling up the back of my neck the dim eerie glow of a lantern appeared about forty feet ahead of me it was held by a man a white man i could not see his face a broad-brimmed hat shadowed it but his costume was that worn three centuries ago i gaped at the high leather jack-boots the long-tailed brass-buttoned coat in- voluntarily i closed my eyes tried to steady my quivering nerves when i looked again he was still there and plod- ding slowly before him silhouetted against the faint glow of his lantern flogged on- ward by the whip in his hand was a file of black figures with chains linking their necks together i tried to move but i could not con- victs i told myself a road gang    yet i knew they weren't there were women in that fetter-yoked column and they don't put women on chain gangs  dime mystery magazine besides what trick of dim light and shift- ing fog could make those figures seem to glow with a faint phosphorescent radi- ance those were slaves i saw being led to the auction block by a beast in human form    and there are no more slaves in america a curt order and the clanking heavily plodding shapes halted opposite the lan- tern now was a young slim negress she was naked except for a loin cloth i could see the profile of her small erect breasts the burnished gleam of her cop- pery thighs the lantern lifted slightly illuminating her face and i gasped call me mad but i tell you she looked like chloe chloe's skin is a warm ivory that  of the almost nude girl was bronze yet even with the wide metal collar around her neck the heavy chain linking her to the shadowy shapes before and behind her she carried herself as chloe did there was the same tilt to her head the same half shy half seductive twist to her full lips the man with the lantern put out his hand ran it slowly down over the swell of her breasts i still could not see his face but i could sense his lust in the tenseness of his body the girl half turned her body swayed toward him and then she was locked in his em- brace a faint stir rippled along the line of chain-linked blacks slowly stealthily they began to move the two ends of the line swung outward then together so that they had formed a circle with the man and the girl in the center one end of the line dipped under the other continued to move outward so that there was now a loop in the center of the heavy chain it began to get smaller drew tighter then as she pulled her lips away dropped her head down the lethal links passed harmlessly over her and tightened crushingly around his neck he screamed once tried to pull away but with wild animal laughter the girl held him a score of black bodies bent lunged in opposite directions the lan- tern fell went out then as fog-laced blackness blotted out that hellish scene of primitive vengeance as the man's screams died away into a choking bub- bling sound i heard his bones crunching under the constricting pressure of the tightening chain a moment longer i stood there my body cold with the sweat of terror my stomach churning the girl's shrill tri- umphant laughter still rang in my ears then almost unconsciously i ran for- ward stop i screamed in god's name  water splashed around my feet there was a deep ditch between me and those ghostly figures i turned to the right ran along its bank my feet struck a plank by the way it lay it must bridge the ditch i ran across its swaying length toward the spot where i had just witnessed that soul-shaking scene all was silence the only moving thing was the curtain of the swamp born fog some- how i knew that what i had seen was not murder but retribution that if ever a man deserved to die it was that cadaverous figure in mouldering antique garb yet i could not help myself he was white they were black and    something hard and round rolled un- der my foot i went down on the clammy clay i sprawled full length for the space of a heart beat listening still nothing if those spectral figures had really been there if i had not imagined them they were gone now with a trembling hand i struck a match a skull leered sight- lessly at me from the muck that had been what i stumbled over beside it was an ancient crazily leaning tombstone by the feeble match glow i could make out the almost obliterated name on it it said    john bartlett chains of dread desire  my scream was the despairing wail of a lost soul you see nothing terrible in that my name is john bartlett instinct led me back to the plank across it and up to the road i did not run i plodded slowly mechanically like a man in a nightmare of doom chloe was standing beside the car when i reached it she was so excited she did not notice my condition that chant--it's an old tribal one she explained only our field hands sing it when i heard it i just had to run out and see them had she seen them had she seen what i had had even i seen it actually or was it the ghostly re-enactment of some scene from the abysses of the past i did not know and i did not ask what- ever else might have been illusory that tombstone with my name on it had been real that and the sickening dread which now filled my being i might be feverish i probably was but now i knew that i could not attribute to fever alone the terror that had gripped me as we drew near to chloe's ancestral home i started the car and under her direc- tion went on down the road and turned in at a driveway i stopped when the tall white pillars of the house appeared in the watery glow of the headlights i got an impression of a huge rambling structure looming over us lowering at us with the sightless eyes of dark win- dows then the door opened and three figures stood there silhouetted against the lamplight from within one was a white man chloe's uncle walter he was tall spare dressed in dark broadcloth she got out of the car ran to embrace him i got out more slow- ly looking at the two who stood behind him chloe had told me about them they were the negro servants stephen the butler and mammy mallie his wife they were no longer young but stephen carried his grizzled white head erect his huge body was still powerful and mammy mallie's shapeless body and lined black face yet showed signs of an earlier beauty i shook walter duquesne's hand so this is john he said to chloe his narrow dark eyes searched my face and i could also feel the impact of the two negroes stares i'm very happy to meet you i know you've had your sup- per but we must have a drink together he gave instructions to stephen about taking care of our bags and chloe and i followed him into the house it had a dank musty smell as if the sun never penetrated the heavy drapes that covered the windows he led us into a large room whose darkness the lamp he carried could only partially lessen i sat in a moth-eaten chair while chloe flitted about the room examining this piece of furni- ture remembering that one then she ran out into the hall and up the stairs to look at our rooms leaving me alone with her uncle i was sitting with every muscle locked tight to keep the tremors that rippled through my body from showing yet i was filled with a hopelessness that did not per- mit me to stir from that dark and gloomy house he glanced at me curiously aren't you feeling well i had to bite my lips to keep from screaming with mad laughter feeling well after    a bit chilled i managed to get out he came over felt my head his hand felt hot dry hmm probably a touch of swamp fever i could give you some quinine but it's best not to take it at night a drink's what you need that and a good night's sleep i nodded hardly listening to what he said a thousand questions were trem- bling on my lips questions about what i had seen about the graveyard about the tombstone with my name on it i  dime mystrey magazine moistened my lips then froze faintly there came to my ears that throbbing chant that wailing hymn of despair and hate that i had heard the spectral slave shapes sing but a short time before i must have blanched for duquesne gave me an odd look nothing to be afraid of just the field hands down in their quarters singing an old slave song i glanced at my wristwatch eleven- thirty at this hour he shrugged i've known negroes all my life and i still don't pretend to understand them he took a step toward me they knew you were coming to- night when i was sure you wouldn't get here till tomorrow and stephen has told me other things about you that you may not even know yourself what    what things  i didn't want to ask the words slipped out of their own accord you come of boston stock seafaring folk i nodded did you know that one of your ancestors was a slaver a slaver one of those who traded in human flesh captured blacks in africa and sold them here like cattle no i whispered no and yet    there was a gap in our geneology there was a great-grandfather whose name i did not even know he nodded they say so they even know the name of his ship i can't re- member it but  it was the monadnock said a deep booming voice i turned it was stephen the butler who spoke he set down a tray with glasses and bottles on it how    how do you know  i asked unsteadily my ancestors were brought over from guinea on it he said slowly they were kings there here they became slaves but that was john bartlett's last trip john    bartlett i re- peated thickly the slaver's name was the same as yours it is said he died here it is said he is buried in the cemetery on the other side of the compound and it is said  stephen a voice hissed out of the darkness of the hall slowly i swung around mammy mallie i could just make out her face her eyes that were filled with hate stephen bowed his griz- zled head good night he said softly to us and followed his wife out into the darkness john bartlett    died here    was it possible that what i had seen or thought i had seen but a short time before was an atavistic memory a warning or a promise of     here said duquesne you look as if you could use this he handed me a stiff drink of bour- bon my hands were shaking so that i spilled some but i gulped it down i could feel it spreading through my vitals but there was an icy lump in my chest it could not reach let me have another i rasped hold- ing out my glass and one for me said chloe coming in from the hall whiskey isn't a lady's drink said her uncle reprovingly he filled my glass again poured out some port for her whiskey's not for ladies  said chloe merrily well it's never too late to learn her uncle looked at her strangely then at me sometimes he said cryptically it is i tossed off my glass not listening to his words but afterwards    by the way uncle said chloe how has stephen been lately i was starting to feel better with the alcohol coursing through my veins what's the matter with him  i asked chains of dread desire  well when i was a child sometimes we thought that  she tapped her head it was his daughter louise when she was about sixteen she discovered she was lighter than the other negroes that her hair and eyes were different and    she realized that she had white blood in her finished duquesne and she committed suicide stephen took it hard he shrugged it may have been dormant in her parents veins for generations perhaps his eyes had a peculiar look since the time they were brought over to this country it happens more often than you'd think down here a white child cropping up in a black family    or a black child in a white i've heard said chloe that you can't always tell a girl looks white and  you can tell said her uncle if you know where to look certain parts of the body he glanced at the bosom of chloe's dress and the nails if the little half moons at the base are dark there's negro blood present chloe held up her hands laughing her nails were covered with a bright red polish you could never tell with me her uncle shook his head sombrely you'd better take that polish off down here anyone that paints their nails is suspected of   he left the sentence unfinished i lay alone in the darkness of the strange room  the bed was dank hard the blankets seemed to give me no warmth only hold in the cold that stabbed me to the marrow of my bones how much of the chill that gripped me was fever how much was the terror that swept over me when chloe had kissed me good-night gone to her own room i could not tell god knows my terror was no longer formless now that spec- tral scene in the graveyard  it had a basis in fact that tombstone with my name on it or that of an ancestor the underlying hate in stephen's voice in mammy mallie's glance it had been my great-grandfather who had brought their ancestors here made them slaves and now    i stiffened listening for the third time that night the eerie wailing slave- chant sounded through the darkness from the field hands quarters it swelled loud- er rising and falling in a slow insistent rhythm others might hear the despair of a downtrodden people in it i could hear only the underlying menace i con- tinued to lie there for a moment listen- ing then suddenly i realized what my position was i was lying on my back feet close together hands crossed on my chest    in a posture of a corpse laid out in a coffin with a choked cry that was half sob i leaped out of bed my temples were throbbing my heart pounding my limbs wet with the poison dew of terror i could stand no more if i stayed one more hour in this gloomy house where my every thought led toward death toward a heritage of hate and vengeance i would go mad i had to get away far away barefoot i ran across the room opened the door the corridor outside was dark my hands fumbled along the dank walls feeling for the door to chloe's room she must come away with me at once my fingers brushed the knob i turned it opened the door and stumbled into her room a wan greyness that was neither light nor darkness filtered through the win- dows by it i could make out the bed    and it was empty my throat cord- ed then i saw her the slave-chant was louder on this side of the house throb- bing with a soft recurrent beat and standing next to the window her whole  dime mystery magazine body jerking to its primitive rhythm was chloe she was clad only in a sheer nightdress through the thin silk i could see the twitching of the muscles in her thighs the sway of her hips she was breathing deeply her breasts swelling tight against the soft fabric her eyes were half closed her face intent i went uncertainly toward her chloe i husked in god's name   she did not turn around i know she whispered but i can't help it it gets into my blood calls to me like    my groan of abject horror cut her short i was staring with wide eyes at her bosom one of her hands lay across it under her fingers i could see her young breasts    and their roundness was circled by dark rings but that was not all she had removed the polish from her nails they showed pink in the ghostly light    all except the half moons at their base they were dark brown too her eyes went down also and her whole body seemed to turn to stone then with a sobbing cry she ran out of the room and into the darkness of the corridor i continued to stand there eyes dilated mouth open the slave chant from the field hands quarters was fading but sounding in my ears was walter duquesne's words  more often than you'd think  a black child in a white family  can tell if you know where to look  if the half moons at the base of the nails are dark  chloe had negro blood in her i had sensed that she was somehow changing on the drive down from boston her slurring speech the way she had re- sponded to the negroes singing it had been like calling to like i had loved her we were to be mar- ried but now if we had children would they be white or  a tearing sob racked me i stumbled toward the door i must get away i must    then i halted again where had she gone  when stephen's daughter louise had discovered that she was neither white nor black she had taken her own life would chloe     i started running madly down the hall i must find her a door opened ahead of me a hand seized my arm her uncle where are you going he asked what     babbling almost incoherently i told him i could feel his fingers tighten you can't go out like that barefoot he said with your fever you'll be dead by morning he ran down the hall with me fumbled in the darkness and opened a cupboard here put these on he handed me trousers boots a coat hands shaking i put them on somehow i realized that he had known that that was what he had meant when he said sometimes we learn too late then i was pounding down the stairs and he was calling after me get the field hands up i'll join you there we'll find her if   fog wreathed blackness outside si- lence except for the moisture dripping from the lush vegetation the sucking sound of the sodden ground under my boot soles the night air was cold on my sweat damp body my throat was dry parched i stumbled into the narrow path ran down it the field hands would chloe be in their quarters or would they know where she had fled to blood call- ing to dark blood had they sensed the kinship was that why their chant had affected her so strangely in the darkness the darker shapes of their crude huts loomed up before me there was something gripped in my hand something duquesne had thrust toward me with the clothes a stick no a heavily loaded whip like a madman i beat on doors windows with it chains of dread desire  up i yelled get up get up faint sounds inside the huts doors opening cautiously glow of candles hasti- ly lit white rimmed eyes peered out at me then there was a low moan bwana murmured many voices bwana makuba bwana makuba that was african the swahili dialect it meant master great master i looked down and then it seemed as if a skeleton hand had clutched my heart crushed it in a bony grip i was wearing the jackboots the long skirted coat that the spectral shape of my ancestor had worn in the graveyard earlier that evening his blood in my veins his whip in my hand his clothes on my back his name my name i was he reborn there was a faint hissing sound from the negroes a sound no longer of superstitious dread but of primitive and abysmal hate a john bartlett had made them slaves a john bartlett stood before them now my muscles were jerking uncontrol- lably my breath held till it seared my lungs slowly i started to back away from those glaring eyes then i turned and ran i did not know where i was fleeing i only knew i had to get away the night reeled past me john bartlett dead three hundred years john bartlett about to die hate that had lived for centuries the cry of vengeance from the grave my brain was seething in my skull all feel- ing of being all consciousness of person- ality streamed out with my sobbing breath i stumbled over something square and hard sank to one knee then a shrill maniacal laugh bubbled from my lips i was back in the cemetery i was back at the grave of my ancestor back at the tombstone that bore my name i knelt there in the clammy clay the charnel odor of death and decay in my nostrils my whole body shaking with mad hopeless merriment the mist swirled around me enveloping me in ghostly coils it seemed to grow thicker then a figure materialized out of it chloe the lunatic laughter died on my lips i stared at her she was still clad only in her sheer nightdress the dampness made it cling to the swelling curves of her body her dark hair was disheveled her eyes glow- ing with a wild light and there was a strange smile on her lips somehow all the veneer had cracked away she had slipped back a thousand years she was completely pagan animal her lips swayed as she moved toward me ex- tended her arms john she murmured softly caressing- ly i could not move but my heart was beginning to thud quicker my blood to pour hot through my veins she came closer i could fell the warmth of her body the soft pressure of her thinly cov- ered breasts against my chest i    i've wanted you for so long she whispered i was willing to wait until after we were married but now that i know there'll be no marriage so take me now her lithely curving body surged forward against me almost unconsciously my arms went around her crushing her to me my lips sought hers fastened there as if to draw out her very soul her hips swayed in welding themselves to my flesh her pas- sionate abandon blotted out all else for me there was only the yielding firm- ness of her body her desire whipping mine on to animal excesses i bent her back- wards    then froze that way soul shak- ing terror congealing the blood in my veins under the sound of her hoarse pant- ing i could hear the soft jangling of heavy chains of slave chains i lifted my head looked wildly around black shackle-yoked figures surrounded us hate-filled eyes  dime mystery magazine glared at me already there was a loop in the chain that linked the black shapes together and it was starting to tighten  with a hoarse scream i tried to flee but could not chloe was holding me she twisted her legs about mine clamped my arms to my side and in her eyes was hate as black as that in the eyes of the negroes good god she was one of them their vengeance was hers she had come to this place of death to seduce me with her body hold me till they could exact the same blood expiation from me as was exacted from my ancestor who had enslaved them with a cry of triumph chloe bent her head the heavy loop of chain brushed harmlessly over her dark hair coiled around my neck and still she held me she wanted to hold my body close while it writhed in agony feel my hot blood spurt over her the cold links tightened dug into my straining flesh i could no longer breathe my mouth gaped open my eyes bulged vaguely i could make out a huge shape that looked like stephen an- other figure near him in a broad brimmed black hat the first john bartlett waiting for me to join him blood welled up in my mouth i could feel my windpipe giving my lungs beating like wings of fire then  stop screamed a voice i could not see her but dimly i knew it was mammy mallie you fool stephen it's not his fault that louise is dead she waddled forward out of the darkness it's his and her finger stabbed at the lean figure in the broad brimmed black hat walter duquesne damn you he snarled i'll he was louise's father not you mammy went on inexorably it was his white blood that made her take her own life he is her murderer the sound that came from stephen's throat was more animal than human there was a jerk that pulled me off my feet then the chain loosened around my neck and the air i gulped seemed to sear my lungs it sickened me made the world reel but even as i fell forward i saw step- hen eyes blazing raise a length of chain like a ponderous flail and bring it down on duquesne's head i heard his skull crush like an eggshell then darkness over- whelmed me cool hands on my forehead the mur-  mur of soft voices slowly i opened my eyes i was lying in bed i blinked looked around with the sunlight stream- ing in the windows i hardly recognized my room in the durquesne house stand- ing next to the bed were chloe and mammy mallie they both looked care- worn exhausted i blinked again dazedly what     you had a bad touch of swamp fever said chloe hesitantly we brought you in here from the cemetery and    the look of horror on my face stopped her i remembered now the cemetery she holding me while    mammy mallie pushed her aside glowering down at me you pore white trash she raged how dare you even think mah chloe got black blood in her  this yere's what make her do it and she handed me a small box with a white powder in it do what  i asked dully act so crazy her uncle he put that in the wine he give her i looked at the lettering on the box nembutal it said my pulses leaped nembutal i remember i said ex- citedly it's a new drug they're just ex- perimenting with it slows up the heart action that would make the venous blood collect in the capillaries especially in the extremities like the finger tips it would turn them and most of the body darker that was what    oh darling can you forgive me for believing    i believed it also she said quietly uncle walter wanted me to when i chains of dread desire  ran out of my room he was waiting for me he took me into his room and talked to me i was still there when you came after me and he gave you those clothes sent you down to the field hands quarters i felt queer and somehow everything he said sounded reasonable i nodded that's another action of nembutal it makes the subject very sug- gestible easy to influence but you mean to say your uncle was behind all this yes she answered with mammy's help i pieced the whole thing together when she was young and attractive uncle walter forced her to become his mistress when she discovered she was about to have a child she married stephen stephen thought the child was his and later when the child louise discovered she was part white and committed suicide stephen became a little touched then uncle walter heard we were coming down here counting on the fact that if you were of new england stock you'd have sea- faring folk among your ancestors he told stephen that completely fabricated story about how your great-grandfather had brought his people over from africa stephen believed him believed it was your fictitious ancestor's blood that had cropped out in louise and that therefore you in a sense were responsible for her death and what stephen believed he could make the more ignorant field hands be- lieve eh  i exclaimed then the tomb- stone the scene at the cemetery were all arranged for my benefit  yes i didn't see it i went to the field hands quarters when i got out of the car i think i understand everything now i said except why he should do it i've been looking at the account books and i know the explanation for that too said chloe the estate here is mine he was just running it for me he used to send accountings to me of the cotton he sold on the open market but actually he was selling more than half the crop to a textile mill near here and pocketing the money if i married you you would probably discover his deception but if you thought i was partly black if you were frightened away   i see i said meditatively then a thought struck me what about stephen  mammy mallie's dark face twitched he kill massa duquesne he don wanta rot in jail he rather die his own way he went off into the swamp and he never cornin back her eyes brimmed with tears now i'se all alone got no chick nor child left i was holding chloe close to me but i disengaged one hand long enough to grasp mammy mallie's gnarled fingers you have us mammy mallie i said softly wherever we go you'll go and as to a child  i looked at chloe she flushed and snuggled closer to me america's biggest cigar value manufactured at smallest profit cremo cream o them all now  for c express to hell by  julius long it was the insanely impossible plan hatched out of a mad genius thirst for revenge--but the gods must have applauded when it resulted in a train-wreck--on the high seas the four men groped cautiously through the fog guided only by the faint lights of the yacht which lay alongside the pier from time to time they stumbled as their shoes caught in railroad tracks set in the planking as if we didn't have enough trou- ble muttered benson a frail little man who trailed behind the others a two- hundred-thousand-dollar train wreck all the newspapers and politicians on our necks and now we have to waste time with a lunatic denmead whose stocky figure led the group snarled impatiently maybe you think i like it enden may be a lunatic but he also happens to be an important stockholder that we can't afford to antagonize at this time so stop your whining benson continued to mutter but for- sythe and coleman who trudged ahead of him remained silent directors in the railroad line of which denmead was president they were uneasy the recent catastrophe with its attendant publicity had made them jittery and they were suspicious of the multi-millionaire eccen- tric's motive for asking them to come aboard his yacht resignedly the four men approached the yacht started as a figure stirred in the shadows mr denmead and party a voice  express to hell  asked the tones were soft and low denmead unaccustomed to answering questions demanded tersely are you the captain of the sibyl the man's smile was barely percep- tible in the fog no sir i am steward roberts satisfied as to the identity of the four men he trained a hand flash on the gang- plank denmead ascended and like sheep the others followed as they reached the deck benson halted fear- fully timidly asked enden doesn't mean to leave the pier does he  of course not denmead cut him short i give him credit for having more brains than to sail in this fog he turned to the steward where's enden below sir please follow me the steward led the four men to a companionway to starboard there he halted you will find mr enden below sir denmead peered down the dimly light- ed companionway and shot an uneasy glance at the steward then he boldly descended and the others followed at the foot of the steps they stopped short in astonishment they stood on a railroad platform be- side the platform was a pullman car it was enden's private car the sibyl like the yacht it was named after his wife a wed by the incongruity of an eighty- ton pullman car within the hull of a yacht the four men regarded it dumbly as the platform was level with the car's floor and flush with its side it was im- possible to tell whether it rested on its trucks or had been blocked up what- ever the case the spectacle was sufficient- ly fantastic to appall these men it was denmead who expressed their thoughts who but enden he asked could be responsible for this i've always thought him mad now i'm sure he's crazy good evening gentlemen the four men whirled enden ap- proached them from the car's entrance they immediately noticed a change in both his appearance and his manner a powerful man well over six feet and proportionately broad of shoulder he had never possessed the demeanor of a big man a child-like dreaminess in his eyes had betrayed an indifference to ac- tuality that others had been quick to take advantage of that dreaminess was gone from his eyes now it had been replaced by a colorless stare that was hard and unyielding as enden came close even denmead made a movement that was very close to a wince certain his re- mark had been overheard he said quick- ly a most unusual thing you have here but as i was just saying it's beyond me what is the idea anyway enden's brittle stare did not alter if you will come aboard i will try to satisfy your curiosity turning on his heel he walked to the car's entrance his guests hesitated then followed enden led them into a pullman drawing room their gaze was arrested by an oil por- trait hung in the blank center section of one wall its subject was enden's wife it was impossible for anyone immedi- ately to remove his gaze from the blonde beauty of sibyl enden every stroke of the painter's brush had caught the lucid simplicity of her soul testified to the artist's keen appreciation of her charm is mrs enden aboard coleman asked hopefully enden did not regard him as he an- swered  no drawing their eyes reluctantly from the portrait the men noticed another de- tail of the car's interior the thick panes of glass in the windows were translucent but not transparent it was impossible to  dime mystery magazine see out the thick glass panes mocked them denmead turned concernedly ad- dressed enden what's the idea of the thick-- his words were shaken back into his throat by a violent jerk of the car the others maintained their balance with diffi- culty listened to the clatter of couplings what--what happened  demanded benson the car's been coupled forsythe cried excitedly that's what's hap- pened he turned to enden we're being shunted out of the yacht aren't we  no enden told him the car is not leaving the yacht but its next movement belied his as- surance slowly in rhythmic jerks it seemed to move aft listening closely the railroad men heard the muffled chug- ging of a light yard engine the click of wheels over rail joints all eyes shifted to the windows but as they afforded no vision the gaze of each director turned to enden denmead almost angrily ex- claimed  dammit enden you can't fool me we've been shunted out onto the pier tracks listen    the occupants of the car felt the jar- ring of wheels over switch frogs den- mead eyed enden triumphantly did you think you could fool an old railroader like me enden's smile was mocking i had hardly hoped to but it is grati- fying to know that i have for we are not as you seem so sure on a pier track as a matter of fact we are not even on rails listening to the metallic rumble of the trucks beneath the four men ex- changed incredulous glances the car's wheels rest on rollers en- den explained the rollers are powered by electric motors that's absurd denmead scoffed do you think i don't recognize the sound of wheels passing over rail joints and switch frogs and i distinctly hear the chugging of a locomotive enden seemed gratified the clicking that you mistake for that caused by rail joints is caused by slots which appear in the rollers at every thir- tieth turn at more infrequent and less regular intervals larger slots reproduce the clatter of switch and crossing frogs as for the chugging of the locomotive that is merely a sound effect supplied by a phonograph record denmead was still unconvinced there's one way to find out he said he strode from the drawing room and walked to the rear of the car the oth- ers followed a moment later they re- turned to the room they wore an al- most comical look of awe now that you are convinced said enden that you are aboard my yacht won't you be seated a little dazedly the four men occupied lounging chairs enden pressed a but- ton and a negro porter appeared with cigarettes they were eagerly accepted and the smokers settling back in their chairs tried to feel at ease they failed it was difficult to believe themselves aboard a yacht absurd to feel that they were passengers in a private car it's amazing exclaimed denmead even now i'd swear we were moving i can't understand how i could be so easily fooled i think i can coleman mused aloud i've been fooled before haven't you ever been on a train that seemed to be pulling out of the depot leaving an idle train on an adjacent track suddenly when the other train is gone you dis- cover that it's your own train that's left standing in the depot mr coleman understands the psy- express to hell  chology perfectly enden said it was an experience such as he has described that gave me my idea you haven't yet explained den- mead pointed out what your idea is enden seemed astonished i thought you would guess the fact that i have gone to such lengths to dupli- cate travel by rail aboard my yacht would indicate that i do not enjoy travel by sea however yachting was one of my wife's pleasures the installation of my private car in the sibyl was my challenge to the dilemma my wife enjoyed her yachting and by dwelling in aboard my car listening to its wheels as they turned at a speed of seventy miles an hour instead of a few paltry knots i managed to eliminate the appaling ennui of travel by sea the wheels of the pullman slowed ceased to turn enden's guests sat very quietly trying not to reveal their thoughts that enden was an eccentric they had always known now their per- fectly normal altogether conventional minds drew inevitably to the same con- clusion they were the guests of a mad- man as the car's wheels began to turn again they became increasingly distrust- ful of their host's unpredictable ingen- uity each wished to end the visit as soon as possible i'm glad you asked us to come here said denmead with a suave air of final- ity i'm grateful for a chance to see your most unusual-- thank you enden cut him short but i did not invite you here to demon- strate my artificial travel by rail i had another reason--the southern express the eyes of the four men widened the southern express was the train that had been wrecked a few days before its first section had been disabled in the path of the second which had traveled only a few hundred yards behind unable to stop the trailing locomotive had tele- scoped the observation car killing nine persons mutilating one beyond recogni- tion i think i understand your interest said denmead you've been unduly dis- turbed by the fuss the newspapers have made let me assure you that the acci- dent will not affect the value of your stock the southern express is again running on schedule and the whole affair will soon blow over the public will forget your assurance is very comfort- ing said enden coolly it in- dicates that you have a clear conscience with respect to the tragedy the news- papers have placed the blame rather squarely on your shoulders have they not denmead shrugged my conscience is clear and i'm sure the directors feel the same way he looked to them and they nodded then the allegations of the newspa- pers are untrue  i mean the charge that the first section of the southern express was disabled because its locomotive was obsolete and taxed beyond its limit and the charge that the road's safety equip- ment is so inadequate that it is not safe to run trains in two sections it was pointed out that there are many places on the line where the visibility is so bad that if anything happened to the leading section the trailing section could not pos- sibly stop denmead squirmed uncomfortably look here enden we're among our- selves and there's no use beating around the bush as president and directors of the road it's our duty to protect our stockholders they come first we couldn't pay dividends if we threw away a lot of money on new-fangled equip- ment  dime mystery magazine then said enden a trifle pale the charges of the press are true denmead shrugged our consciences are clear we've paid off every claim no one has any legal cause of action against us one of the victims was unidentified enden pointed out a woman the newspapers said though she was so hor- ribly mangled that one physician refused to commit himself what about her denmead threw up his hands we've done everything in our power to identify her but there hasn't been a clue nobody has reported a missing person we'll probably never know who she was on the contrary said enden you will denmead arched his brows you mean you--you-- yes said enden steadily she was my wife the four men sat frozen denmead uttered a strangled exclamation managed to ask but--but are you sure there can be no doubt enden an- swered hollowly i bade her goodbye at the station saw her enter the observa- tion car that was telescoped a half-hour later the four men sat wordless there was nothing they could say too much talking had been done already slowly irresistibly their eyes were drawn to the portrait of sibyl enden an unutterable feeling of abject self-revulsion pervaded to the marrow of their bones made them shrink within their clothes but this emotion gave way to one of increasing apprehension as they felt enden's cold eyes upon them a suspicion a fearful foreboding found a foothold on their con- science-stricken minds the car's wheels turned at a high speed now creating a metallic rumble punctuated by clicks that might have been made by rail joints and switch frogs the continuous motion of the wheels combined with the swaying and bumping of the car had dinned so persistently into the consciousness of the four men that they could no longer shake off the feeling that they rode upon rails benson unable to suppress his fears jumped to his feet cried hysterically we're no longer in the yacht we're-- nonsense denmead cut him off trying to reassure himself as much as the others he commented i can be fooled once but not twice we're still in the yacht beside the pier no said enden casually we are not the four men started drilled him with their eyes where--where are we then the sibyl is moving out into the bay denmead leaped to his feet what in this fog you mad fool we might be rammed i demand that you order the captain to put back at once enden laughed in his face it is you who talk of safety now denmead tried to speak calmly where are we bound for why are we-- a deafening clatter interrupted him it was a familiar clatter the thwack made by the crack of the air as two speeding trains meet and pass on parallel tracks it continued many seconds then ended as suddenly as it had begun only the steady rumble of the pullman's trucks remained enden asked mockingly the sound effects are realistic don't you think no one answered each wondered if it was possible to duplicate that familiar clatter so realistically coleman sudden- ly exclaimed express to hell  we can't be afloat i know we can't i get sea-sick the minute a boat leaves the pier i always do i consider that a compliment to my ingenuity enden told him i have often wondered if my artificial train ride would fool a poor sailor but coleman now grown pale was insistent i tell you denmead we can't be at sea i know for the first time in his life the rail- road president looked at the director as if he respected his opinion we can very soon find out he said and he walked across the room but the drawing room door refused to yield den- mead twisted its knob shook it the door did not budge it was locked the others stared helplessly as den- mead his face red from the exertion turned and faced them try the other door you fools they obeyed it required only a mo- ment to discover that the other door too was locked all eyes were focused on enden denmead hoarsely demanded  dammit enden what's your game why are these doors locked because enden told him with a cold stare i want to watch four guilty con- sciences at close quarters denmead returned his stare a moment then had an idea moving to a window he attempted to lift it it's no use trying that said enden the windows are fixed in place ignoring him denmead lifted with all his middle-aged might the window stayed fast the directors tried the other windows finally gave up benson began to whimper i told you we shouldn't have come here  we'll all be-- denmead snarled him down shut up you fool that's what en- den wants to see us do he wants us to grovel he turned addressed enden with his old-time executive manner if you don't unlock these doors and let us out of this car we'll break them down in that case said enden coolly you will find that you have underestimated the thickness of their steel panels denmead's reaction was to seize a chair but it was immovable try- ing one piece of furniture after another the men discovered that everything in the room had been securely fastened there was no object that might be used to bat- ter the solid doors or the thick panes of glass in the windows benson grasped at a straw he pressed the button that had brought the porter there is no porter on this car en- der told him we are quite alone benson continued hopefully to press the button but there was no response at last he gave up turned helplessly to the others they listened to the long blast of a whistle up ahead  dime mystery magazine you gentlemen are being absurd enden told them i can't help feeling flattered that you have been so thorough- ly deceived but i'm sorry to find you so distrustful upon my word of honor we are still aboard my yacht by this time we must be well out into the bay a remote clatter seemed to mock his statement the clatter drew rapidly closer and the car jarred as both trucks in quick succession rattled over two dis- tinct sets of crossing frogs the b amp o tracks coleman ex- claimed it's the only double-track cross-over within miles that's what the whistle signaled for the others said nothing they listened to the long blast of another whistle which seemed to sound from farther away and from behind see coleman cried there's another train following us it's whistled for the cross-over denmead uttered an exclamation reached for his watch he studied it carefully then very pale faced enden i understand now he said with a voice unlike his own you've had this car coupled to the southern express instantly the others consulted their own watches saw that the time checked perfectly aghast they realized the sig- nificance of the whistle that had sounded at the rear they were coupled to the first section the second section of the southern express followed behind looking into the four frightened faces enden laughed your imagination is running away with you he said why would i couple this car to the southern express the devil only knows said den- mead but the others were beginning to guess convinced that they were trapped in a speeding car by a madman bent on a terrible revenge they slowly grasped the outline of a diabolical plot don't you see what he's going to do coleman demanded of denmead he's going to make us die the same death his wife died something's going to hap- pen to the train and it will stop in front of the second section struggling to control his voice the executive turned to enden tell us the truth why have you locked us in this car enden laughed you refuse to believe the truth why should i waste my breath telling you again that you are in a yacht at sea where i can watch your wormy shriveled con- sciences writhe in a hell of their own making the four men stared silently they were aware that the rumble of the car's trucks had lessened it seemed that the train had slowed and a moment later they understood why a hollow sound reached their ears endured for several seconds then the rumble of the trucks sounded as before and it seemed the train had picked up speed again spring creek trestle forsythe breathed familiar with the road and all its land- marks the four men were now convinced beyond the shadow of a doubt enden had lied to them trapped them in this car to meet a horrible death why that had been its very purpose in the yacht what fools they had been to believe his cock- and-bull story in explanation of its in- stallation there exchanging expressive glances the men reached a common understanding it was necessary to act at once they must free themselves from this car for death might come at any second if you don't unlock the doors den- mead told enden firmly we'll take the keys from you but i don't have the keys said en- den and you couldn't take them from express to hell  me if i did  whether the four middle-aged execu- tives could have overpowered enden was a matter never to be decided suddenly without warning the shock came the passengers of the car went sprawling as it jerked to a violent halt air brakes hissed as its wheels came to a dead stop groping dazedly to their feet its occupants rubbed their bruises enden's four guests stared dumbly at one another overwhelmed by the eerie un- reality of the sudden quiet the quiet ended as a train whistle sounded very close and drew even closer as it con- tinued to blast frantically the passengers in the doomed car re- acted variously benson knelt to his knees and commenced to pray forsythe rushed to a window tried to break its glass with his fists which he beat to pulp denmead hurled his stocky figure against one of the steel doors battered it again and again with futile effort the plight of coleman was most pa- thetic he became sea-sick sea-sick be- lieving that he was about to die in a train wreck enden alone remained calm his laughter sounded above the blast of the locomotive whistle and the screech of sliding wheels on steel but it was drowned in the rending crash of crum- bling metal as a terriffic impact split the car wide open ground its passengers into meat enden who lay a mangled mass in the wreckage regained consciousness for a split-second of confused uncomprehend- ing wonder remembered dazedly the screech of wheels and the whistle's blast then lapsed

nothing to me--hansen was too common a name for me to connect it with my friend the doctor your brother is the husband of caro- line sheridan i exclaimed well i'll be glad to meet him hm he said he looked at me in un- certainty i knew he was thinking about the fact that caroline sheridan and i had once been in love--but that was long ago practically forgotten by us both and now every ounce of my feeling of that sort was centered on her good friend amy deane to whom i was engaged i laughed are you thinking about that boy-and-girl affair caroline and i had years ago no he said that's not it he was not looking at me he was looking at the woods with a peculiar expression on his face almost uneasiness the wall of wood- land pressing so close about us seemed to be listening--listening splotched le- prously black and white by the moon with misshapen tendrils of fog wandering through it like witches fingers it was lonely in that station i felt it sud- denly like a spot of chill the doctor's angular face looked at me sharply i was thinking about the effect of this place upon you upon me yes there's something about this place--something queer i can't understand it--can't lay my finger on it i've been here several days--it's affected everyone here i glanced at him it was something about his tone he was not scoffing he seemed to gauge my huge shoulders my scarred and menacing expression without doing so directly do you know why i came down to the station he said abruptly it was--because i was thinking of going away going away yes he broke off looking again at i am the beast  the wood at that moment i saw beads of sweat on his neck you've heard the story of course he said of the beast in the sheridan family--the monstrosity that was born here--and never seen con- cealed by the old uncle who left caroline her fortune but that's nonsense i said the beads of sweat on his neck on the neck of this penetrating man of science were affecting me more than the peculiar atmosphere of the wood which was begin- ning to seep into us in a chilling inde- finable way his eyes veered to me again i was thinking of the effect on you he said of the combination of this atmosphere and your old feeling for caroline what do you mean  i exclaimed just then there was the sound of rapid feet and joyce sheridan caroline's sister came running across the platform toward us look muttered dr hansen in a quick undertone i spoke of the effects of the atmosphere--look at her and judge for yourself joyce ran directly up to me her face was flushed she was hatless in her light summer dress running to us this way out of the darkness she looked like some touseled nymph disgorged from the mys- terious wood here you are she exclaimed amy couldn't come to meet you--i ran all the way--i was so afraid i'd miss you you ran from the house yes--through the woods she took my hand with a sparkling smile she was a lovely girl fully as lovely as her sister she and caroline were the only two of the sheridan family remaining there was absolutely nothing the matter with her that i could see she was the picture of flushed radiant welcome the doctor has been telling me bogey stories i laughed i looked at the doctor in smiling challenge his face had not re- laxed from its compressed and narrow look you should not have run alone through the woods he said sharply come i have the car to drive us back we walked to a town car behind the station and the chauffeur opened the tonneau joyce and i talking lightly the doctor as though out of sympathy with our mood got in front with the chaf- feur we drove down a narrow winding road overhung with trees wisps of fog parted before the car as if reluctant to let us pass joyce and i talked gaily of a hundred things she told me what fun they had had putting the old house to rights after awhile she paused and became seri- ous do you know the real purpose of the house-party  she asked no to kill once for all that legend about the beast she burst out intensely the famous beast of tine sheridans the mon- strosity that uncle was supposed to have kept here--that was supposed to have been his link with the powers of evil the beast that was so misshapen and ugly and-- she glanced at me and stopped you know they do say she went on in a lighter tone that uncle delved into sorcery and had a compact with the devil and that that accounted for his fortune and that the beast was bom into the family as a tangible reminder to him of his com- pact and that his compact was that the rest of his descendants should die she laughed merrily how refreshing it sounded that healthy girlish laughter how gruesome in the light of what fol- lowed  the beast must be no bigger than a cricket she said because we've looked in every cranny and cupboard and can't find him i laughed with her and you feel no effects of the atmosphere  dime mystery magazine atmosphere she exclaimed she took a deep breath raising one hand as if to help expand her lungs it's gorgeous as i chuckled i happened to glance at her hand the laughing railing girl with her thumb between her fingers was making the sign of the evil one something froze in me joyce i exclaimed what's the matter she asked nothing will ever strike me with such sudden horror as what happened then she was still looking at me her face full of carefree laughter and suddenly before my very eyes her face was transformed into a mask of bestiality the eyes nar- rowed in a leer that was indescribable her lips flattened drawing back from her teeth a drool of fine spittle leaked from the corners from those twisted lips is- sued a horrible sound it resembled that horrible gurgle a medium makes in the midst of a trance it rose deepened into a voice it was not her voice--it seemed a voice no human being could utter--roll- ing and guttural like a voice from the abyss of sin i am the beast it said i speak to you bruce trent i will project my soul into your body exactly as at this moment i project my soul into the body of this girl in your body bruce trent i shall kill the descendants of the house of sheridan as was the compact with satan i sat riveted with the sweat starting on me and my body like a block of ice i could not move i could not take my eyes from the horrible convulsed face of the girl before me dimly i sensed a jolt--the car stopping--dr hansen and the chauf- feur looking horror-stricken from in front for me they did not exist nothing ex- isted but those writhing foaming lips and that demoniac voice it stopped then i saw a spasm convulse joyce like one in agony she clutched at her breast tore the flimsy fabric of her sum- mer dress free from her slim shoulders her lips were bubbling i could see only her eye-whites her breasts came into view her panting throbbing white stom- ach  she continued in a rending paroxysm to tear off her clothes with hands clawing maniacally as if to free herself from some- thing internal and terrible joyce was a beautiful woman totally nude she swayed before me her face like a tortured mask the beast she cried--in her own voice but such a voice of agony and sheer horror i have never heard then with a scream like a maniac she plunged out the car door into the woods i plunged after her i was shouting i stumbled i dashed through the massive moss-hung trees her nude form flitted ahead revealed in stark ivory by the moon- light one moment steeped in shadow the next she was still screaming the creepers and boughs seemed to reach out to engulf her then i lost her i was plunging head- long through a glade something sudden and inexplicable happened to me--as though i had been cut off in mid-air--as though i had run into an invisible wire the very breath leaped out of my throat i whirled into blackness but even as i fell there seemed to appear before me a face--lewd and unutterable as a congo witch-mask again i heard that voice-- the voice i had heard in the car--but not in my ears in the very fastness of my soul i am the beast now i enter into your spirit bruce trent and you shall do my will i fell face forward like a blind man chapter two the devil's kiss i came to my senses as though from a terrible nightmare my head was throb- bing and i felt nausea deep within me a i am the beast  hand was shaking my shoulder a voice was crying in my ear are you all right  are you all right sir  it was the chauffeur his face panting wide-eyed was peering into mine yes--yes i muttered and struggled erect i was in a glade--the same glade i recognized in which i had lost joyce though the blobs of moonlight and shadow seemed to have changed at my feet tangled with moss was a twisted tree-root that made the very outline of the face i had seen    my senses seemed confused the chauffeur called behind him  here he is i have found him sir out of the blackness with a crashing of branches ran dr hansen thank god he exclaimed you at least where is joyce--did you find her no i muttered gazing into his horror-stricken eyes for some reason i dropped my own i felt somehow different there was a peculiar desire in me not to discuss with him anything that had hap- pened it was as a hand laid on my soul prohibiting me my god bruce what happened to you he cried i must have fallen over this tree-root and been knocked unconscious i said i saw him staring at my hand it looked unnaturally dark purely reflexively i put it in my pocket are you hurt i must have cut myself as i fell we must get back he insisted if she hasn't run to the house we've got to get the others to help search we went back to the car inside i glanced at my watch i stared at it in amazement held it to my ear glanced at the doctor what time is it  nine-thirty i felt a shock all through me nine- thirty  it was shortly after seven when we left the station good god--how long did you search for me i exclaimed upwards of an hour my lips felt dry upwards of an hour-- i had been lying in that glade it came to me with a sick sense stabbing through the unnatural calm that held me as if for the first time i was coming awake in that hour--what had happened to me what was this blood on my hand the great house rambling and ablaze with light suddenly flashed before us a group of people were on the verandah they thronged about us there was a babble of incoherent talk and salutations bruce trent doctor have you seen caroline  caroline no i recognized frank jameson the blairs lyle scott and his wife grey harning i saw neither caroline my hostess nor amy my fiancee i saw several people who did not know me make a start of in- voluntary horror which at sight of me they could not suppress is joyce here demanded the doctor here no--she went to meet bruce at the station don't tell me she's gone too ex- slaimed frank jameson too repeated the doctor who else is missing caroline the name came from several at once in the expression of their faces i would see this was the reason for their uneasy gathering she's been missing for the last hour no one seems to know where she's gone where's amy i demanded she and ralph hansen are making an- other search of the attic it's ridiculous because we've ransacked it once already see here this is serious said grey  harning you say joyce is gone too yes said dr hansen she--she ran from the car he said obviously in some uncertainty how to put it we looked for  dime mystery magazine her everywhere but couldn't find her we thought she had come here ran from the car exclaimed frank why  wasn't she with you  i spoke up she took a short cut tow- ard the servants lodge because she thought she saw caroline the doctor looked at me thunderstruck why bruce she did not what are you saying  i knew it was a lie as soon as i opened my mouth they all stared at me with my sweating contorted face my disheveled hair my clothes covered with moss and brambles i made a strange appearance what's the matter bruce are you hurt you don't look well he's had a nasty fall said the doctor yes i mumbled if you'll excuse me-- show mr trent to his room said frank to the butler yes sir the butler took me sym- pathetically by the shoulder and led me into the house and upstairs to the room that had been apointed for me i got rid of him as soon as i could i wanted to be alone particularly above everything else i did not want to see amy the thought of her sweet face her inno- cent and trusting eyes filled me with a strange aversion was it because i did not want her to see the unnerved confusion i was in i could not take time to analyze my thoughts too many things were press- ing on me i sat down on the bed and cautiously like a thief examining some- thing he has stolen examined my hand it was covered with blood--palm and back even between the fingers--matted and clotted with blood stuck with wisps of moss i felt myself swallowing convulsively i got up felt myself over examining my face in the mirror there was no cut on me not so much as a scratch i was un- hurt yet i had lain senseless in the glade for upwards of an hour--why why during that time had something hap- pened to joyce my god--was this--was this her blood a horrible tumult began in me yet through it all part of me remained calm as if unmoved and watchful it was that part of me that led me to the washbowl where i quickly and thoroughly washed my hands even as i dried them i came up with a start why in god's name was i doing these things  why had i lied downstairs there why had i not wanted to talk to the doctor sweat broke out again on me i walked swiftly up and down the room the beast the beast confused im- pressions crowded upon me--the glade-- the guttural voice--that unspeakable face --joyce's paroxysm was it really possible that some horrible being had taken pos- session of me something intangible and utterly non-human that was using my soul to do its will i mopped my face i was trembling with ague i stopped with a vio- lent gesture no this was the twentieth century--it was utterly preposterous i had fallen over the root i had been stun- ned and everything was simply a phan- tasmagoria of my confused brain but how account for the actions of joyce in the car and the voice she had spoken i had heard the voice i had seen her face those things had happened before i was stunned i happened to glance into the mirror my face with its sinister lowering look met my eyes not torn with suffering but look- ing at me with a smile she looked like caroline i heard my- self say a sea of horror swept over me as i real- ized what i had said yet even then i saw my own eyes looking back at me reflect- ing no anguish but gleaming with a light of satisfaction there was a knock at the door i am the beast  with a swift movement like a cat i got softly into bed just when the door opened and a woman in a black silk dress came in she was carrying a small tray with a glass i'm the housekeeper she said smiling i brought you a bromide to soothe you there's nothing the matter with me i muttered in confusion she came over and set the tray on the bed-table with a graceful movement she leaned down to draw over me the light quilt which i had disarranged as she leaned down i saw that if anyone ever had what in medieval days they termed the evil eye this woman had it her eyes were black exotic and long- lashed with smiling languorous yet bale- ful depths that seemed of themselves to reach out and search to bottom of my soul i saw too that she was beautiful her white face perfect in every feature had not one hint of color--no more than there was in her superbly molded arms and shoulders of pale ivory she wore a dress cut very low and yet with a sug- gestion in its snug tailored fit of a uni- form which accentuated the voluptuous curves of her slim body let me arrange your pillow she said after a little while she gently raised my head and as she did so i saw almost completely revealed her smooth breasts i was flooded with a subtle and exotic perfume a combination of aversion and attrac- tion moved strongely within me with another graceful movement she sat down by me on the bed leaning over me one hand resting lightly on my knee above the coverlet honeyed tempting provocative was her smile you wish to ask me something she said it was not so much what she said it was the way she said it as if we shared somehow some sinister knowledge with an effort to throw this off i asked how long have you been here in this house yes she did not take her eyes from me they probed me fondled me soothed me yet there was something malevolent deep deep within them a good many years she said perhaps you can tell me i said with an affectation of casualness something about this monstrosity the legends speak about she looked at me but did not speak in- stead she bent lower over me until her face was directly above my own i could feel the touch of her soft breath on my cheeks why should i tell you she breathed when you know her red lips were parted her baleful exotic eyes holding me like a cobra's for that instant i felt utterly unable to move whether it was the shock--the significance of her words--something chilling and malignant in her eyes spread over me like some miasmatic net you must not think of me as your enemy but as your friend she said her voice fell to a very wisp of sound a ca- ressing ghost of a whisper more than a friend if you will    because i know what happened in that hour--and i am here to help you she leaned down and pressed her lips full luscious quivering to mine it was a kiss shot through and throbbing with a dark ecstasy such as i had never known her lithe arms with a sinuous move- ment like snakes moved over my body her solid breasts crushed against me there was the sharp crash of the door opening bruce cried a voice that stabbed me like a knife  dime mystery magazine chapter three prints of bloody hands i saw amy her golden hair gleaming one hand to her lovely cheek horror unbelief shock struggled in her stricken eyes oh no oh how could you she cried and turning on her heel she rushed from the room i rose like a drunken man i ran out after her she was gone the dark stairway was deserted i pulled up in the hall some- thing within me told me i did not par- ticularly care my blood was warm throb- bing with the sensuous exotic charm of the marvelous body that had been in my arms a few guests were still on the verandah i could hear them shouting to others in the distance a search was going on in the wood a man crossed from the verandah into the living room and encountered me he was walking with a quick nervous step his brows were knitted his mouth grim he stopped at sight of me his eyes flashing in surprise shock and checked aversion you are bruce trent he asked i am i am ralph hansen so this was caroline's husband i saw at once he did not like me not so much my appearance as--well it might have been the recollection of what i had once been to caroline without offering his hand he moved close to me as though to engage me in quiet conversation my brother has told me he said of what happened in the car of what happened in the car i re- peated coolly what happened in the car he frowned i mean when joyce ran away oh yes i said have they found her yet no nor caroline he was looking steadily at me you were the last to see joyce alive alive i exclaimed do you mean to say she is dead he did not speak immediately he drew the tip of his tongue across his lips like a man striving to control himself what happened to you in the woods he said my brother told me you were gone for an hour violent rage blazed in me what are you accusing me of i de- manded he flushed he was a handsome man in an angular sharp-cut way and that very handsomeness fanned my anger you are my guest he said coldly i am not accusing you of anything i am merely asking you what happened to you in the woods i raised my shoulders expanding my great chest with a suck of air and knotting my fists i raised an impulse to smash this handsome face before me to pulp i was unconscious i said and if you hanker for more explanations think up your own his set face twitched with a sharp effort at control mastering himself he said calm- ly since you were the last person to see her you should be out there directing the search you are the only one who knows where she disappeared i shall i said and shoved by him i did not pass him gently i was hoping he would make some move some trifling answering gesture that would give me an excuse to let loose my rage upon him but apparently he restrained himself i plunged out through the door ignoring the people on the verandah striding on down the stairs into the night my feet seemed to go of themselves the moon was riding high now gib- bous and curved with one small cloud below it fantastically red like a salver of blood beneath a gleaming knife below it the wood seemed to hang like a black and i am the beast  tattered pall shot through with lances of light and towering shadow shapes grisly beards of moss hanging low from the boughs touched my face seeming to move over my eyes and cheeks i felt water squelch under my feet warm and evil- smelling rotting leaves in layers rose and lifted beneath me as though composed of sponge rubber stumps of water-cy- press thrust up at grotesque angles looked like squatting dwarfs moths flew before me slow silent and heavy-winged their shapes increased eerily by the mysterious underbranching penumbra of light here in the dark unfathomable night increased by the shifting fog-fingers and the unearthly light of the moon appetites as old as humankind lecherous and carnal awoke in me i moved through the trees quickly with gleaming eyes a feeling of inexplicable exultation in my heart hunched forward like a satyr it suddenly came on me that i seemed to know where i was going this knowledge shocked me like a cold douche but in the state i was in of baffled rage excitement awakened rioting desire i did not pay great attention to it it was only one among the hundred unleashed emotions rioting within me i heard voices to my left it was that way i was heading i stopped checking myself with instinctive caution the voices stabbed up suddenly in a scream they were repeated hoarsely wildly-- screams of discovery i heard other voices foregathering lights flashing the crash- ing of feet without altering my course i went un- erringly to the spot a ring of faces surrounded something on the ground i recognized frank jame- son gray the scotts others of my friends the women were sobbing the men after the first shouts of excitement were grim and tense-lipped my god i heard a voice joyce i pushed my way into the ring joyce's body nude as i had last seen it lay on its back the legs and arms flung apart like the petals of some lovely broken flower like a flower still blooming in the moon- light each limb each delicate modulation of the flesh was flowerlike in its softness-- yes like a flower even to the scarlet blot of blood on the breast for a calyx the blood came from her throat which had been hacked apart until her head was nearly severed from her shoulders that head that glorious head with its glassy eyes that had laughed so glad and carefree into mine the moon with its mysterious soft luminescence made more vivid her virginal pallor more scarlet the gruesome star at her throat the wound was horribly enlarged as if it had been seized by the open edges and ripped apart again again by some rend- ing instrument or--by hands of unnatur- al strength i felt the cold saliva trickle down the inner walls of my cheeks yet in spite of the pounding in me the paralysis of horror i did not feel surprise i seemed to know everything about that body its disposition how it lay something deep in me groaned as though to say you are lost there is nothing you can do my god i heard grey harning ejac- ulate what fiend has done this the beast of the sheridans someone said in a quivering breath like a sigh a vicelike frozen silence held us all in that impenetrable moon-drenched wood an owl swooping high overhead hooted a soft syllable it made everyone stare up- ward their faces shaken stricken caroline broke out one voice what of caroline with a sudden movement the group was galvanized into action frank cried grey you go this way--take will  dime mystery magazine with you--search the east woods--i'll phone the police--lyle and john you take the woods to the west his eyes fell on me bruce you take the premises around the house yes i nodded as i passed through the group i saw several seeing me unex- pectedly shrink from me with involuntary aversion i ran on heavily toward the house i did not seem to know where i was going my head was reeling in chaos i could not breathe my brain was ring- ing like brass had i done this i tore at my throat for air my eyes went over those blighting tree-tops to the unfathomable sky my soul seemed to cry out of itself as if for a second in tremendous agony it threw off a horrible weight god god help me i cried you know my heart i swear i am innocent before you that second's cry was swallowed up in the impenetrable night confusion engulfed me once more and something approaching madness i ran ran i came up suddenly at a wall in the darkness before me without knowing it i had blundered to the back of the house i could see the dark outline of the clipped hedge i felt along it turned the corner here the wood encroached sliced with squares of light from the house windows half in shadow were the back stairs i plunged up them without knowing why it seemed almost as though some force outside myself were telling me what to do --and i had no strength to disobey those commands as i ran through the lower rooms i felt the house was deserted there was no sound but--yes--my ear caught some- thing a footfall distinct quick--upstairs i ran that way as i came up from the shadow of the stairhead i stopped short the housekeeper was before me she wore something long clinging and dark on her bare feet were the merest wisps of high-heeled red sandals i looked into those malevolent beautiful eyes they were black in the semi-dark- ness black as the pits of hell burning with a sultry fire as she parted her lips in a smile i could see the tip of her red moist tongue between her teeth you have come back she said she moved close to me the sensuous atmosphere of her presence enveloped me my nostrils were filled again with that al- luring exotic scent you are tired she said very tired you must rest her eyes languorous inscrutable be- hind their long lashes swept me with a caressing look i could see the pulsing throb in the white column of her throat come with me she said and taking me by the hand she drew me down the hall my silence was not due to stupefaction it was due to the hellish burning desire that reared its bestial head at sight of her every movement of her graceful body moving ahead of me seemed to suck my very veins with hunger she drew me into a darkened room it seemed the antechamber of a bedroom it was littered with couches it rose above me in a vault of darkness i could see neither the ceiling nor the walls a light on a branching ornate candlestick made a nimbus of radiance at one side there was a smell of richness in it i could bare- ly see the rich hangings obscurely in the dark it breathed an oriental incense- like odor clinging aphrodisiac that soothed the senses she drew me beside her sitting on a low lounge she crossed her knees with a sensuous movement down the graceful fold that marked her leg i could see her bare foot in its red slipper tilted toward me she still kept her tapering fingers on mine she transfixed me with a slow smile that revealed the depths of her dark eyes the touch of her fingers seemed to send jets and barbs of fire up my arm i am the beast  your brain is twisted like a knot she said tight tight as though someone were drawing the ends to the breaking point i passed my hand over my face yes yes i muttered again i could feel her breath on my cheek your mind is screaming like a stretched wire as though one more touch on that wire would shatter it to pieces god yes i breathed her voice dropped like honey in me you will find solace she said put your head here she put her slim fingers around my neck pressed my head into the warm juncture of her neck and shoulder rest rest quietly--here you can be at peace though the dark clinging robe covered her f rom head to foot i was sure she wore nothing beneath it i swung like a straw between the horror of my experiences and the mad intoxication of her nearness yet i sensed a touch of horror here something dread ahead tired maddened as i was some obscure part of me was fighting against her they will not find you here she said they i jerked up my head who the other--your friends i licked my dry lips staring at her what was she saying what was she telling me with her evil eyes i know you did it she said i and i alone come do not be afraid of me i told you i was your friend--that was here to help you she put her hands on my shoulders holding me at arms length the movement swept back the full sleeves of her robe revealing her bare white arms to the shoul- ders her red lips parted again i could see them glisten tell me about it she said softly did you hack her with a knife i could feel my face tremble with the violence of my emotions who i articulated joyce she said joyce the one you murdered did you tear as is always his sign the edges of the wound like a star  whose sign i asked hoarsely she leaned toward me the black light seemed to leap out of her eyes our master she said the beast the beast you saw in the moonlight with a gagging movement i tore myself from her standing upright who are you i gasped what makes you speak as you do what do you know of what happened  i know all she said her voice was vibrant now her eyes wells of black tri- umph all i know you followed her from the car and murdered her horribly in the woods--at his bidding--his the master why should i not know when i too am his creature and do his will  she came to me and with a soft move- ment fitted her body against my own i could feel her bare arms from behind encircling my back and shoulders why struggle she breathed it is all over now it is done my mind seemed to be exploding again my brain teetered like a spinning bauble between two madnesses--the madness of her and the madness of conviction of the deed i must have done for a second i felt like shouting out in maniacal laughter seizing her and drowning myself in her beauty then that tiny part of me that edge still struggling blindly fought briefly through my mouth made cracked sounds my voice did not seem to obey me as god is my witness i croaked out i did not do it she withdrew from me with a supple movement as she did so one whole bare leg from red slipper to symmetrical thigh was displayed for a second and then dis- appeared in its folds she fixed me with her fathomless eyes a slow smile mock- ing crept over her face  dime mystery magazine you do not think so she said look i will show you she stepped to me again and with a deft movement of her slender hands she opened my shirt she spread apart the clothes to reveal my bare breast on it were prints--prints of blood-- small convulsed hand-prints--of piteous feminine delicate hands tearing in suppli- cation against the strength that had torn the life from them chapter four the pit of doom joyce's no other--they could be no other a tortured noise came from me i closed my eyes to try to blot out that damning implacable evidence now i could see those black eyes again that in- scrutable white face moving before me with the rapid motion of a snake's head what did you do with caroline she asked i could not scream i hung there voice- less my body quivering like the jarred pendulum of a clock again she was close to me peace she breathed it is all over--and now comes your reward she put my hands on her rich flesh then moving from me with a lithe move- ment she stepped into the shadows and opened a door i saw dimly the outlines of a richly caparisoned bed something came out of that room-- something intangible an indescribable emanation it cut the perfume of the room like a knife suggesting horrors beyond the bounds of human imagination come she said she enfolded me once more i could feel the voluptuous curves of her warm body through the soft material throbbing against my own that small bit of sanity in me fought through blindly again no i said come she said her voice more throaty imperative her eyes avid no i repeated and with a violent movement i threw her off she stood in the doorway with a single motion she opened her robe and stood nude before me as i crossed that threshold a constric- tion came over my soul like ice i stopped everything good everything sane everything decent in me seemed to be fighting a death struggle against the lure of this woman she appeared to sense it nude with her robe parted like great silken wings she threw herself upon me winding herself about me like a vine then i saw something beneath the cur- tains of the bed it was the face i had seen in the glade it was the face of the beast hideous unspeakably vile its mouth gaping in the blubber-lipped smile of a congo witch- mask it stared at me i saw its misshapen body move under the silken litter of cover- lets strewn on the bed a scream burst from me but even as i screamed a vestige of real- ization struck at the corner of my mind-- the thing was tangible--the thing was there this was nothing filling my mind's horizon and blotting out my soul--it was there before me no bigger than that bed under those coverlets i think it was that that saved my reason i let out a horrible cry of rage this was something i could get my hands on something i could break and tear i leaped for it the woman gave a scream dropped to the floor as i sprang forward she writhed her supple length about my leg so that i fell short of the bed i was like a wild man the room was absolutely black i tore beat struck at the bed i threw the woman from me i caught up a chair and flailing like a thresher in the darkness i smashed the bed--smashed it smashed every piece of it smashed the corners the hangings the paneled walls i am the beast  splinters rained around me i was panting like a gorilla i sprang to the wall and flashed the light on empty not a trace of the thing with the mask-like face i whirled to the ante- room the woman was just whisking away her robe flying like a banner from her white body i seized her i picked her up bodily off the floor you hell-witch i rasped you led me here--you brought me to him--where is he--the beast--where has he gone i held her overhead like a hun holding a a woman at the sack of rome i would have dashed her brains out on the floor but hands gripped me from behind i let her drop whirling bruce my god what's going on hold him four men had me pinioned the woman snatching her robe about her nudity jabbed a frienzied arm at me he came in here and tried to kill me she shrieked he did it he did it he murdered joyce what's this gasped voices i looked panting at the ring of faces saw grey frank tom scott the women someone had turned on the light the place looked like a shambles i found my voice it was more like a hoarse roar she is the accomplice of the beast i bellowed she is his partner the beast is in that room he is the murderer of joyce screamed the housekeeper her eyes like hell-fire her hair disheveled look--if you don't believe it--look at his chest her outflung hand pointed to my shirt which torn open revealed the extent of my bare breast what is this said grey stepping up to me my god--a woman's hands--in blood a shudder of fear was on their faces bruce where did those come from his brain has snapped i suddenly recognized dr hansen's quivering face my god i feared this the housekeeper's voice lashed the air like a whip he tried to kill me me me too like joyce and caroline ask him where caroline is dr hansen said in a steady voice where is caroline before those unflinching eyes my whole being seemed to collapse my eyes dropped in the cistern i muttered i could take no account of what i did or said i was past that point in the silence that followed i could hear the woman's strident peal of demoniac laughter he knows he knows frank jameson's eyes were on me shocked glassy like the eyes of a dead man bruce how do you know it was--just a guess i muttered my god-- i heard the doctor's voice --there is a cistern under the house-- connected with an old tunnel--but i don't know how to get to it at that moment a woman's scream bubbled up to us it seemed to come from the bowels of the earth i felt the short hair stand erect on my neck amy i gasped amy--she has found the body where where gasped voices i will show you i cried i leaped ahead of them for the hall again as in the wood i seemed to know where i was going my feet as by their own volition led me unerringly down the staircase we plunged down corri- dors stairways into the foul dark clammy reek of the cellar frank jameson's flash- light stabbed the darkness we saw black mildewing cob-webbed barrels walls ooz- ing a clammy sweat of damp the rest were confused only i knew the way seemed to chart it as by instinct in the  dime mystery magazine darkness i seized frank's flashlight played it around a far barrel-choked filth- grimed recess there--there--is the entrance i cried i turned on them my eyes were rolling a horrible confused sound like a moan issued from my throat i know what is in there--and i did it aghast they shrank from me i was listening to my own voice struck as dumb as they the men were by me tearing down the barrels they revealed a dark opening like a tunnel a vague light flitted far back on the rounded ceiling--and disappeared we plunged down the tunnel ahead of me someone cried out as we looked down into the cylinder of a cistern frank seized the light from me stabbed its ray down- ward a shuddering gasp came from every throat there lay the nude body of caroline outflung like joyce's white stomach upper- most completely revealed in the shallow water the slimy ooze played around her graceful sides touching her breasts as though with clammy tenderness there-- there--was the crimson star on her throat mingling with the black water frank jameson turned on me with a contorted grey face you--you--you are the beast--you did this i felt hands seize me i tore myself from their grasp--i leaped into that black cylin- der perhaps i wished to destroy myself perhaps it was reflex action--there was no other way of escape down down i hurtled struck the irregular wall rico- cheted struck a ledge tumbled off i hit the bottom scrabbling and splashing in the slimy ooze almost over the body of caro- line half-stunned i reeled up and saw-- the cistern bellied out at the bottom like a bell in the darkness was amy strug- gling in the clutches of the beast i saw his face--that hideous unspeak- able face--the writhing of his body-- amy's golden hair whipping above the gag on her face he had nearly succeeded in ripping the clothes from her one rose- tipped breast was thrust toward me one throbbing haunch quivered in his filthy grasp i dove for him closed with him an axe sheered by me we tumbled into the pit he was cold slimy stinking i smashed that unspeakable face i saw the nostrils rip he writhed from me his body was coated with ooze it slipped like grease through my fingers he was up trying to haul down something like a portcullis that hid the entrance from above i was baying like a wolf i hit him head down like a bull i drove him beneath me i slugged him again again i heard the roar of the portcullis overhead i sank my fingers into those hideous features ripping them the face came off with the brittle rip of a mask and i found myself looking into the handsome face of ralph hansen i came to in the quiet sun-filled warmth of a hospital room my family doctor was leaning over me on a chair beside me amy was sitting her golden hair glorious in the sun her blue eyes shining with love my great hand clasped in both her little ones i saw joy leap in her eyes he'll be all right  she asked the doctor dr parmalee smiled yes he said re- assuringly nothing serious--a fractured collar-bone and a few bad bruises my boy he said sitting down beside me you can thank this constitution of yours for saving you last night for saving your sanity his eyes were grave what-- i murmured who--it was ralph--ralph hansen-- my mind was full of confused recol- lections of last night yes said dr parmalee it was ralph hansen and dr hansen as you know caroline sheridan fell heir to an enormous fortune the doctor was hand i am the beast  in glove with his brother to get her for- tune by a codicil of the will the inherit- ance reverted not to caroline's husband but to the remaining sister joyce if caro- line predeceased her therefore it was necessary to put both girls out of the way dr hansen had in the years since you knew him fallen in bad circumstances lost his reputation and became a morphine addict so that he was an easy tool for his brother's schemes ralph hansen knew about you knew about the legend of the beast and decided to combine them to make of you the perfect scapegoat caroline invited you to the house-party unsuspectingly and the doctor met you at the station in a specially prepared limou- sine he released an ether compound in the tonneau which drugged the occupants with the chauffeur a henchman of ralph's they carried you both into the woods because of the long years you had spent under the doctor's psychological domin- ance you were an absolutely ideal prey for his powers of suggestion as you re- covered from the drug he put your mind again under the power of hypnosis he had used so much on you in the past hypnotism cannot make a man do what is utterly repugnant to his nature like murder--but a hypnotist can implant commands in the subject's brain which he will carry out after the hypnosis--pro- vided again these commands are relatively simple and not heinous or atrocious they could not make you murder the girls but they could make you admit the murder while you were hypnotized in the woods all the commands were implanted in your brain which made you give yourself away as the murderer--knowledge of the loca- tion of the bodies the lies you spoke the very words of confession when you re- covered you carried them out joyce did not recover they stripped and murdered her alongside you not ten minutes after ralph had murdered caro- line in the cistern they plunged your hand in joyce's blood and daubed her handprints on your breast the housekeeper was ralph's para- mour she was to lead you to the african witch-mask that was held before you dur- ing your hypnosis it had been imprinted on your mind as the face of the beast they hoped the shock of seeing it in real- ity would crack your mental balance that would have made a perfect motive as caroline's old lover you had gone in- sane through rage and jealousy and com- mitted the murders but you must have sensed a human being behind that mask parmalee reached out and patted my hand the doctor confessed everything before he took an overdose of morphine and died this morning ralph did not wait that long he cut his throat with his own axe i looked at amy but you--how did you get into that monster's hands  when i ran from you she said i wished to get away--away from every- body i wandered over the house and finally into the cellar there i came on ralph putting on the mask and daubing himself with black grease he bound and gagged me and but for you there would have been two bodies in the cistern thank god i said a sense of release peace and great thankfulness flooded over me i closed my eyes and when i opened them again the doctor was gone amy and i were alone i pulled her to me in her eyes i saw no recrimination about the incident with that demoniac woman no accusation only infinite tenderness and infinite love i closed my eyes again holding her pliant body to me history's gallery of monsters no  william stewart the monster of the mary russell by  john kobler on the morning of may th  the brig mary russell lay off the port of barbadoes her hold bulging with a cargo of sugar hides and tropical fruit-plants she was about to undertake the return voyage to cork ireland a commonplace little craft this mary russell with a commonplace crew and a nondescript captain the crew consisted of six young men smith chief mate swanson second mate cramer cook seamen howes keating and sullivan cabin boys richards  and deaves   history's gallery of monsters  there were also four passengers murley raynes connell and a -year-old eng- lish lad hammond the captain was one william stewart a frail little man with sunken chest and spindly legs a shock of flaming red hair and a complexion white as a flounder's belly he looked more like a clerk or a salesman than a sailor fitted to captain an arduous voyage let alone control the des- tinies of twelve human beings but aside from the seeming inadequacy of the captain the crew the ship and the proposed voyage appeared to be the es- sence of the commonplace certainly there came to those very ordinary men and boys no foreboding of the shuddering horror which awaited them beyond the horizon a horror unequalled before or since in the annals of the sea towards noon of the fateful day the brig uphauled anchor and with her sails bellying glided gracefully out of the harbor three hours later the island had sunk below the horizon and the ship the souls aboard her were infinitesimal entities in the vast inscrutable bosom of the sea their lives their activities their very thoughts under the domination of the little man with red hair it was the law of the sea his will was law to dispute it placed a man in jeopardy of his life for in those days mutiny was tantamount to high treason but the crew and the passengers of the mary russell had no reason to fear harsh treatment stewart was known for his kindliness and his ability he was said to be an excellent commander while in his private life he was known as a good husband and father sober and god-fear- ing on the first night out this admirable man summoned the entire crew to his cabin and there loosed a thunderbolt the men were not sure they could trust their hearing men said he his little eyes darting queerly from face to face i have reason to believe that there are those among you who plan mutiny a cry of disbelief mutiny the thing was incredible every one of them had clean records they were honest decent seamen intent only on earning a living not pirates and cutthroats john howes stepped forward good god sir there must be a mis- take i for one am loyal-- the little captain cut him off with an imperious wave of his hand i have good and sufficient reasons for my belief i have had a dream in it god appeared to me and warned me that that man-- his finger shot out towards the baffled figure of the passenger raynes--is planning to murder me and seize the ship raynes whose only fault was excessive drinking flung himself forward babbling protest but stewart his eyes gleaming strangely went on oh i have other in- dications i have watched him all day he spends too much time in the fo'c's'le he talks in erse so that i won't understand i heard him asking howes here how to navigate the ship all the men were protesting violently now stewart suddenly whipped out two pistols and slapped them down on the table before him i'll hear no more but this is fair warning the first man who so much as whispers mutiny i'll shoot down like a dog i mean to bring this ship safely into cork now go to your posts all of you and thus dismissed a group of sadly bewildered gaping men withdrew from the captain's cabin it was clear to all of them that something strange ab- normal was afoot but what none knew as the night deepened a sense of appre- hension of hovering terror entered their souls and they trod softly all of them as though walking in a nightmare  dime mystery magazine as the days passed stewart's suspicions grew increasingly violent the most in- nocent incidents and remarks he inter- preted as indications of brewing mutiny again he summoned the entire crew on deck they noticed that his eyes were wilder his gestures more violent he blazed at them i'm certain of it now some of you are planning mutiny out with it con- fess now and it will go easier with you i warn you the men stared helplessly from one to the other and made no answer so that's the way of it eh very well then i'll show you that you'll never seize this ship no matter what may become of me so saying he ordered the boy deaves to fetch up all the ship's instruments and the log he then took them into his own hands and one by one flung them into the churning sea now try to navigate the ship alone if you dare he pivoted on his heels and left them to the modern reader it will seem odd that the crew and passengers failed to take immediate action it would seem that believing themselves innocent they would force the captain to prove his charges or remain silent but such was the fear of mutiny instilled in every man's heart that not one of them ventured to speak out they did nothing and stewart pro- ceeded with his own devious plans the next morning the men noted with some alarm that he had armed himself from head to foot he not only carried two pistols but a harpoon and a crowbar as well it was on the night of june th that the captain's suspicions came to a head smith the chief mate had occasion to visit the storeroom several times for pro- visions and tools his footsteps awakened the captain he waited until dawn then arming himself with a harpoon ap- proached the spot where smith lay sleep- ing jolted him awake he announced in an eerie far away voice it is well for you that you're here and not below with the crew otherwise i would have to put you to death as a mutineer smith's mouth worked soundlessly but sheer amazement kept him from speaking stewart shook the harpoon at him rais- ing his voice to a shrill scream you are the chief instigator the din brought the others on deck they gathered around expressing their innocence and strangely a subtle change came over the captain he smiled and observed soothingly i believe you you are all honest men except smith tie him up this the men hotly refused to do and walked off stewart quivered with rage here at last was overt mutiny the more he thought of it the more his fury mounted until he was a trembling purple-faced fiend of rage he backed against the rail his pistols cocked clearly ready to shoot the first man who dared show his face observing him at a distance in this ap- palling excitement three of the men keat- ing connell and swanson went below and confronted smith look here old man keating told him the captain is beside himself with anger just to placate him let us tie you up then he'll calm down and everything will be peacefully settled at first smith objected then thinking it over capitulated he extended his hands meekly and the three seamen trussed him up they then reported to stewart what they had done appeared to please him he ordered them to place smith on the floor of the storeroom this too they did and from that moment on the captain person- ally supervised the unfortunate mate three times he visited him once to test the lashings again to bring him some food and a third time when he saw that histroy's gallery of monsters  the mate was suffocating in that airless hole to drill a vent in the ceiling but still stewart was not satisfied and in his mind there seethed a plan which remains among the most fantastic things ever done by a seaman stewart fancied himself as one man pitted against an entire crew of mutineers and he determined to sail the ship alone he planned to tie up every one of them the brig was about four hundred miles off cape clear and heading towards the mouth of the english channel when stewart put the first part of this amazing plan into action first he must have ac- complices some one he could trust all the men he firmly believed were mutin- ous there remained only the three boys in selecting them stewart was cunning he knew how easily the minds of children succumb to adventure exciting respon- sibilities he began a shrewd campaign to sell them the idea that he and they must be the heroes of the occasion must wrest the ship from the mutineers and bring it safely back to england although the captain's pale face and twitching hands somewhat disquieted them the boys were soon convinced that the safety of the ship lay in their hands the captain was ready to strike at two o'clock on the afternoon of june st con- nell one of the passengers was informed by hammond that the captain wanted to see him a moment in his cabin obediently connell went below turned into the tiny cabin the fierce little man with red hair faced him with a cocked pistol confess he roared at him or i'll blow your brains out connell could only shake his head dazedly stewart gave a signal where- upon hammond and richards rushed out from a cabinet in which they had been hiding and secured connell's legs and arms in this way six members of the crew were decoyed into the captain's cabin pinioned and flung bound and helpless into the cramped black hole where smith still lay stewart slammed the door shut they were alone in the dark it was smith who abruptly screamed at them through cracked parched lips you bloody fools don't you realize we are at the mercy of a raving maniac for the first time the shattering truth exploded in their numbed brains the captain of that ship the man who had piloted crew after crew over the high seas was a dangerous murderous fiend only a man accustomed to the sea can appreciate the full horror of this be- tween them and icy waters fathoms deep and haunted by killer monsters were only the frail boards of that little brig and on the brig in complete god-like control of their lives was a human monster mad and bloodthirsty cunning and more vi- cious than any shark or devil-fish of the deep modern psychologists could no doubt have diagnosed stewart's terrible mad- ness here was a little man a man who was physically weak obscure a nobody on land and at sea just an ordinary sailor unquestionably from childhood he had lieen the butt of stronger men's cruel jests here was a perfect clinical picture of the paranoiac maddened by a lifetime of per- secution real or fancied and with a meas- ure of power thrust upon him insanely lusting to vent revenge it is significant that all the members of the mary russell's crew were bigger and more powerful than stewart two members of the crew still remained at freedom howes and murley it was not long before they too were cast into the horrible hold beneath water level that left stewart and the three boys in sole control of the ship the horror had only begun the torture of being confined in black-  dime mystery magazine ness lashed by rough biting rope was un- bearable murley succeeded in partially freeing his hands when stewart on one of his periodic visits to the storeroom saw this he devised an even more brutal tor- ture he obtained a long thick rope and fashioned it into seven nooses--howes thought to be the most dangerous muti- neer had been lashed to the mast--which he slipped around each prisoner's neck he then secured the rope to staples ham- mered into the deck so that to avoid strangulation the men had to lie perfectly still the men realized at last with paralyz- ing terror that they were doomed to re- main thus until the ship reached port that would be in more than a week's time no man could live a week under those conditions already there limbs were swollen and blackened one of them keating had gone mad shrieking hor- ribly foam flecking his lips the hold was being transformed into a howling madhouse blood flowed from the men's bodies where the ropes cut the flesh and more than one of them strained deliber- ately against the noose to end their un- bearable agonies and with its bleeding screaming human cargo the mary russell sailed on toward england after he had tied the nooses stewart went up on deck to discover that howes had loosened his pinions with a final wrench he tore himself loose and faced the captain but he was unarmed not so stewart who gripped two pistols and now rasped the maniac men- acingly will you confess to mutiny never you bloody fiend howes flung back at him then i must tie you again you'll have to catch me first howes wheeled and dashed down the deck stewart emptied both barrels at his retreating back one missed the other smashed howes thumb the sailor emitted a howl of pain and kept running stewart reloaded and dashed after him the pistols barked again and this time a ball embedded itself in howes thigh the man dropped to the deck groaning horribly oh god god there's fire in my entrails he lay still stewart motioned to the terrified boys who had witnessed the entire scene he's dead he told them actually howes was playing possum hoping that stewart would leave him but his arm twitched involuntarily stewart seeing the movement levelled his pistol and shot point-blank lead ripped through the man's groin he looked up helplessly at the captain i'm done that does it he said pite- ously oh no the captain replied your voice is still too strong but i'll take care of that he thrust harpoons into the hands of the boys and moved cautiously towards howes there was still strength left in the sailor's arms he struggled to his feet determined to make a fight for it ste- wart went white with fear and backed away he called to the boys strike push your harpoons into him for an instant the boys hesitated ap- pealed to stewart he screamed at them strike i tell you drugged by those long days of horror in mortal terror of the captain they flung themselves on howes the ensuing strug- gle was fearful howes sprang aside and leaped upon stewart bringing him to the deck his powerful hands closed over the madman's throat and he began to squeeze the life from him but the boys pitifully misguided approached howes from be- hind cracked down with the harpoons they tore deep gashes in his head and back his grip slackened and he crashed backwards and still he was not dead but stewart was too frightened to finish history's gallery of monsters  him off he ran below and the boys fol- lowed howes crawled away bleeding from a score of wounds and collapsed among some hogsheads of sugar in the hold stewart's madness now reached its climax with howes alive and hiding some place aboard the danger of mutiny appeared overwhelming something must be done it is evidence of stewart's utter insanity that he now entered the hold where seven men lay dying and delivered a sermon of the most pious nature he declared that he held nothing against them that he loved them all but it was his bounden duty to protect his ship against mutiny he was even deeply moved by their sufferings and offered to release them if they would take the long- boat and cast themselves adrift they gladly accepted stewart was about to free them when fear again seized him he surveyed them sadly bid them a tearful farewell and left the hold their last hope was gone but in his mad twisted way stewart for a moment believed he was willing to spare them if only the dangers of mutiny could be avoided accordingly as he spied a sail he signalled it determined to seek aid this man who had all but mur- dered one sailor and was in the act of murdering the others actually signalled a ship to rescue him the ship hove to then seeing the empty decks suspected a pirate-trap and made off the incident was to have a ghastly effect at first the captain be- wailed his desperate plight then think- ing about it suddenly came to the belief with a true madman's logic that the de- parture of the ship was a sign from god a judgment upon the mutineers the last shred of reason snapped in his mind and he became in that instant a wild kill- crazy fiend he flung aside his pistols picked up a crowbar and burst into the hold followed by the three boys his terrible cry echoed shrilly in that hell-hole the curse of god is on you all with their last ebbing strength the men strained at their lashings tried to sit up the whites of their eyes gleamed weirdly in the blackness stewart strode up to the first man raised the crowbar and smashed it down on his skull it en- tered deep into his brain like a knife cut- ting butter sending blood cascading over the floor-planks spouting up into ste- wart's sweat-glistening face the man fell backwards and again the crowbar de- scended mashing his nose jaw forehead into an obscene horror of splintered bone and flesh a pitiful moaning a last appeal for mercy burst from the men's throats stew- art howled like a mad hyena laughed crazily you ruffians i'll kill you all you wanted to take my life now i'll take yours the taste of blood had given a new turn to his madness whereas first he was concerned only with what he sincerely believed was his duty now he craved bloodshed for its own sake he was standing over the second man connell eyes wide with terror glared up at him they maddened him those pinpoints of white flame he stabbed at them with the end of the crow- bar they drowned in sudden upswirl- ing pools of crimson wielding his weap- on like a medieval battle-axe he slashed back and forth breaking connell's head as though it were a flower-pot then keating and murley and sullivan his craving for blood had accelerated he could not kill fast enough he delighted thrilled in the unending fountain of blood lunging at them all haphazardly striking out at all of them raynes was the last raynes whom stewart had thought the original insti-  dime mystery magazine gator of the mutiny he told him james i once put a curse on you now i take it off the man implored mercy in the name of god the devil is your god stewart re- plied and again the crowbar descended crushing through the man's chest and jaw wildly stewart looked around him the three boys who had witnessed the butchery were cowering in the doorway whimpering stewart ignored them his gaze rested on the mutilated bodies suddenly a movement what not dead yet  he flung the crowbar from him and took up an axe he plunged himself into a fresh frenzy of slaughter he was like a mad butcher loosed in a slaughter- house he literally chopped the battered flesh around him into small bits until he stood ankle-deep in blood until brain and bone and fragments of flesh had splat- tered every inch of floor and ceiling and still captain stewart's blood-lust was not sated howes and smith were still alive that omission must be re- paired changing the axe for a harpoon he repaired to that part of the deck below which the chief mate lay smith had been separated from the others the day before during the entire massacre of his fel- low-sailors he had heard the screams been deluged with their blood which had seeped through the adjoining partition and now stewart himself stood over his head grim- acing through the tiny airhole it was smith's turn stewart gripped his harpoon more tight- ly and thrust it through the airhole at the helpless mate it sliced through his ears grazed his side almost gouged out his right eye but stewart was unable to ad- minister a final rending blow due to the narrowness of the aperture he went for his axe and began enlarging the hole meanwhile smith with a cleverness born of desperation managed to struggle over to the side of the hole so that he no longer lay directly beneath the savage harpoon thrusts instead the weapon penetrated a pile of hides on which the mate had been lying mistaking these for smith's body he thrust again and again until he believed the man was dead he reached in felt something cold and withdrew his hand satisfied he then nailed a board over the opening all but howes had been murdered or so stewart thought he was unable to find the seaman and too exhausted to try hunger and thirst clamored at his senses he ordered the boys to bring him food and wine he ordered them to bring them to him in the stinking cabin where lay strewn about the bloody remains of the crew and there he dined calling the boys attention to his steady hand he boasted i think no more of these carcasses than i f they were a pack of dead dogs one can imagine the condition of these wretched lads there was no longer any illusions of adventure and heroism in their minds they knew stewart was a homicidal maniac and that they had un- wittingly played his game for him yet small and weak as he was the captain loomed in their sight as something mon- strous beyond ken they could only cow- er in his shadow prepared to do what- ever he asked and pray that their own lives would be spared meanwhile a series of events were transpiring which had stewart been aware of them would have sent him into a fresh frenzy of murder howes ex- hausted and still bleeding had crawled out of his hiding-place to find water on the deck he spied stewart's pistols and axe left lying about he appropriated them found the water and returned to the hogs- heads at the same time smith was work- ing himself free stewart had neglected to remove his knife thinking him dead and with this he pried loose the board history's gallery of monsters  over the opening hoisted himself out and joined howes in the hold stewart was asleep following a heavy meal he had fallen into a deep slumber surfeited as he was with blood and slaugh- ter he awoke with the dawn and im- mediately a new suspicion seized him could he trust the boys it seems he had hung his watch over his bunk he had neglected to wind it before going to sleep but now it was run- ning to the captain's deranged brain this indicated that some one had crept into his cabin during the night there was no help for it the boys must be tied up he found them in their cabin and announced his intentions they went grey with terror they knew what it meant to be captain stewart's prisoner he swore not to harm them but he must render them incapable of mutiny they prayed sobbed they would have at- tacked him but he held them at bay with a crowbar slowly he reached behind him for a rope and beckoned to deaves come you must submit the terrified boy moved forward as though hypnotized once those ropes were around him he knew he would be battered to death by the crowbar god was there no escape no mercy from this madman stewart advanced to meet him arranging the rope into a noose he was about to slip it over his head when a loud cry of greeting rooted him to the spot he faltered an instant in that instant the boys lives hung in the balance then stewart turned and dashed up on deck the cry had come from another ship the mary stubbs bound for belfast from barbadoes her commander hap- pened to be an old friend of stewart he was captain callender and his voice had been raised in greeting he had sighted the flag of the mary russell at half-mast a sign of distress and had hove to far from terror at the sight of callen- der stewart cried out with vast relief for god's sake come to my help wliat's up mutiny i've had to kill eight of my men and one has escaped callender ordered his men to low- er a boat and he came aboard the mary russell what stewart showed him made him go sick and white with horror --the decks washed with blood the stench of death and decay everywhere the muti- lated corpses below and yet stewart convinced him that he had bravely downed a mutiny he even boasted of his courage the two men then went in search of howes they found him among the hogs- heads callender started back appalled when he saw the seaman's face it was an unrecognizable mask of dried blood howes called to smith and the chief mate crawled out of hiding at sight of him stewart turned pale i thought you were dead he stam- mered and added uickly i now believe you were innocent and i regret that i hurt you god spared your life but the next moment the spectacle of howes and smith sent him into fresh panic he raved madly of mutiny until they were removed to the hold callender was utterly baffled he knew both howes and stewart well whom was he to believe he decided in favor of stewart for he left him in full charge of his ship and headed for home with the brig close behind for two days the ships sailed on to- gether without incident then one morn- ing callender went aboard the mary rus- sell to see how his old friend was getting on callender had loaned him two of his own crew and now stewart drew him aside and whispered mysteriously your men are plotting against me too we must get rid of them callender's brow creased in sudden un- easiness what are you talking about man  why they're my two most reliable  dime mystery magazine sailors they've served me for years no i tell you stewart shouted in panic they're mutineers he didn't wait for callender's answer but rushed towards the rail and leaped into the sea a boat was lowered and he was dragged from a watery grave on deck he broke loose and again jumped overboard they saved him and this time tied him up there was no longer any doubt in callender's mind stewart was a madman callender was for leaving him impri- soned on his own ship but howes and smith had supped their fill of horrors they would bring the brig into cork but not with a raving maniac on board oblig- ingly callender had stewart brought up from the hold preparatory to transferring him to his own ship stewart saw howes immediately ducked below returned with a knife and leaped for the man's throat he could not be calmed until both howes and smith were out of sight then fin- ally he accompanied callender back to the mary stubbs presently the irish coast came into view as the mary stubbs approached cork harbor stewart spied three irish sloops he waited his opportunity-- humanely callender had not tied him up again--and when no one was alert sprang overboard and struck out for the first of the sloops mist hung over the harbor and he was soon lost to sight they took him aboard and believed his story that there were pirates aboard the mary stubbs who had threatened his life but soon stewart's madness brought fur- ther delusions this time the crew of the sloop were plotting against him he gave himself up to the water once more and managed to reach a fishing-boat in this he reached land by this time callender was ashore too stewart was promptly clapped into iron and lodged in the coun- ty jail the citizens of cork crowded down to the waterfront to see the ill-fated mary russell with her dreadful cargo of putre- fying corpses her blood-drenched decks and her half-maddened survivors they went wild with revulsion a cry went up against stewart and among the mob were anguished relatives of the victims they would have lynched the little cap- tain but armed sheriffs kept them at bay he was finally committed for trial the outcome of that trial was a fore- gone conclusion the defense pleaded not guilty by virtue of stewart's pat- ent madness the plea was accepted by a nauseated jury there was no alternative but to send the monster to an asylum for the criminal insane for the rest of his life and it was long that life stewart sur- vived for twenty years he was a model inmate he was at first so gentle that he was allowed to teach children religious exercises religion had always formed a deep part of his madness but fits of in- sanity attacked him from time to time when in his mind's eye he reenacted his fearful crimes in his lucid moments he was tortured with remorse he prayed constantly and read his bible towards the end of his life he said i cannot help praying for the souls of my poor men but he died hard as the bloody ghosts of his victims passed before his eyes the end it was the testimony of these three boys together with that of howes and smith which revealed the events aboard the mary russell j g lockhart in strange adventures of the sea states that stewart hailed a passing ship went aboard and procured these pistols in order as he explained to the captain to protect himself against possible mutiny the trial was

she wants to speak to you jane cameron said her name's nicki or something like that a name i never heard before tell her i'm not here cameron said   dime mystery magazine tell her i'm busy and can't see her his voice was brittle his eyes black and hard as coal jane cameron frowned she was a pretty woman all of cameron's women were pretty even those that he used chiefly for their money she wore an evening dress that clung sleekly around the smooth flowering of her hips the throat was cut low so that the tops of white round breasts were visible and the shadowed valley between them she said i think you ought to see her john she seemed anxious and she knows you are here she insists on talking to you cameron crushed out his cigaret vi- ciously all right he said you stay here he pulled on his coat a tall lean darkly handsome man  a man whom wom- en found irresistably attractive a man without a masculine friend in the world he went down the stairs slowly his a red mouth set in a hard line he was not looking forward to this interview though he had experienced many of the same nature with other women but this nicki was like no woman he'd ever known before she seemed to have no last name and what nationality or race she was he couldn't say there was something about her which rather frightened john camer- on some shadowy thing hidden behind her face and beyond her eyes which he had always felt without understanding he was relievedly glad that his affair with her was over though it had been exciting while it lasted almost too excit- ing sometimes for the woman's gorgeous dark-skinned body could burn with a passion that was more than human there were some esoteric practices of hers that had surprised had frightened even john cameron but she had fur- nished money when he had needed it desperately he was beyond that now he'd put her out and be rid of her she waited in the livingroom a tall slim dark woman her eyes were almond shaped tilting upward at the outer ends but the pupils had a way of sometimes ex- panding until they dominated the entire face it was then that cameron could feel the mystical frightful force which he could not understand she was wear- ing a long black cloak that covered her from ankles to chin but even now he could feel the strange and terrible lure of her body so now you are married john cam- eron she said as he entered her voice was low yet clearly audible with a sound that made him think of bells deep-buried in darkness he said yes i'm married now you and i are through and you shouldn't come here i will appreciate it if you leave and never come back you and i are not through john cameron and it may be that we shall never be done with one another her voice had a sort of rhythmic quality that angered the man we're through he snapped now if you will get the hell out of here he stepped forward toward the door but the girl glided swiftly into his path her dark eyes held his her voice was fierce with passion she said john don't send me away john look using both hands she opened the cloak wide to either side of her except for the cloak she was utterly naked the soft light of the hallway glowed on her golden-colored body it reflected on all the tapering curves on her slim legs that rose into full firm thighs on the smooth satin skin of her belly her breasts were high on her body large and erect and firmly soft her lips were parted and damp and quivering john she whispered she took a step toward him he felt the wild energy of her body that had always frightened him and the fear made him furiously angry he grabbed nymph of damnation  the cloak and jerked it around her you tramp he said get out of here for a moment she stood rigid her hands moved to hold the cloak her dark eyes began to glow i shall leave john cameron but not before i have said the things i came to say you are a coward john cameron afraid to fight your way against a world of men you have used women because they are easy for you every step forward you have ever made has been over the body and the heart and the soul of some woman you have made love but with your tongue only for you are incapable of worshipping anything but yourself you are a coward john cameron and  get out of here cameron shouted he stepped close to her his face purpling with fury     and there must come a time when you pay the girl said there must  he struck her it knocked her against the wall and she stood there swaying the print of his open hand showed livid across her forehead the bridge of her nose and even the eyelids now get out of here cameron growled the girl's eyes were very large and he had the weird impression that he could see through them as through dark glass to where something moved vague and in- distinct and horrible then she turned and was looking past him she said do you love this man are you happy with him cameron swung about and saw that jane was standing in the doorway i told you to wait upstairs he snapped now go back  not yet nicki interrupted and looking at jane she repeated are you happy  there were many emotions in jane cameron's lovely face she was fright- ened and in love with her husband and ashamed of his actions all at once she had been married only a few days so that the word happy in connection with marriage still had a sexual connotation and she blushed slightly at the question she said huskily i love john very much i'm happy with him the dark girl said a strange thing then addressing her words to jane al- though as she spoke she looked at cam- eron i give him to you she said-- for eternity he shall never be able to loosen his soul from the soul he has in his keeping so long as your love endures so long as your happiness is with him so long he shall be as other men after that--he shall remember nicki and the hatred she bears for him but even then his only hope for relief shall lie in you while she spoke the print of his hand was livid over her forehead and eyes she turned went to the door opened it and stepped out into the night she went without sound and for a long while john cameron and his wife re- mained motionless staring after her a year after he had married jane cameron was ready for his next up- ward step all her money was in his name now and he'd found marian reynolds a beautiful redhaired woman whose fortune would make the small one he had from jane seem pitiful besides marian could give him the place in so- ciety that he wanted he knew that he could win her already she had given him everything except the money and social position which would come with marriage all that remained was to get a divorce he located a detective agency that spe- cialized in such cases pete mccorv was a big square-jawed irishman who did not care for man or god or the devil and sure mccory said we'll get evidence against her and twil be no judge  dime mystery magazine living won't commend you for divorcing her it won't be easy cameron said she's a damned plaster saint and were she the mother mary we could frame her mccory told him give me two weeks to learn her habits and its a quick divorce you'll be getting but there's a price of course cameron said i expect to pay he smiled thinly thinking that it was jane's money that would buy her ruin it was on his way home through the lale twilight that his head began to ache a dull throbbing in his forehead that spread down into his eyes he stopped at a drugstore for aspirin but it didn't help i feel as though i had been read- ing too much he thought but he hadn't been reading at all there seemed to be no reason for the pain and with the pain came a strange fierce passion he was not usually an ardent man love making was more a means to wealth and position than an end in itself with john cameron but now he began to feel the restless urgent desire of a boy reaching puberty he looked with furtive eyes at the women on the street his wife was not at home when he arrived the maid said she'd gone out early in the afternoon without leaving any word cameron shrugged very well he said i won't be home for dinner anyway yes sir the girl said as she turned away he noticed the smooth flow of her dress over her hips and he called to her and stepping forward put his hand on the curve of her thigh she was french and had been trying to make cameron since she first came to work here but always he had been very cautious now she made an oohing sound and turned and looked up at him with twinkling eyes cameron said you know you are awfully pretty he leaned forward as though he was going to kiss her it was then the girl looked into his eyes for the first time and all at once her expression changed it might have been terror that swept over her face i --i've got to go in the kitchen she said she turned and almost ran from the room cameron started after her then remem- bered marian reynolds and decided to wait he was puzzled at his own unusual desire and he wondered what had caused the maid to change her mind so sudden- ly had caused that look of terror but that must have been some trick his own eyes were playing he thought he damned the dull ache in his head he had particularly wanted to feel well tonight when he was seeing marian he bathed and got into his dinner clothes but the pain continued i'll take some more aspirin before i leave he thought it may help he was stand- ing in front of the bathroom mirror a glass and aspirin bottle in his hands when he noticed his reflection his breath caught high in his chest then his lips grew cold against his teeth he leaned closer to the mirror across his forehead across the bridge of his nose and down across his eyelids there was a faint discoloration the shape of a human hand--such a print as might have been left by someone slapping him    a long-closed door opened with- in his memory and it seemed to him that he was staring once more at the almond-eyed girl nicki seeing the print of his hand on her forehead hearing her voice like a bell buried in darkness so long as your happiness is with him so long shall he live as other men after that--he shall remember nicki but even then his only hope for relief shall lie in nymph of damnation  you what strange words were these a long while john cameron looked into the past seeing and hearing the woman he had forgotten his body was rigid and beads of sweat mushroomed on his forehead but that portion covered by the print of a hand was dry and white finally he moved like a man breaking out of a trance he staggered his mouth was open and he gulped for breath i'm a damned fool he said aloud i'm let- ting my imagination run away with me i have a headache and i've been pushing my hand against my forehead that's all he washed his face in cold water rubbing at the spot where the print showed but the mark of the hand stayed the pain behind the forehead and eyelids did not cease it was now steeling his nerves study- ing himself carefully that he noticed his eyes there was no change in them of which he could be certain and yet there was a change a difference in expression rather than in color or shape for the first time he was able to see through his eyes into some portion of his real character and what he saw was not pleasant the pain behind his eyes continued des- pite the medicine he'd taken he won- dered why feeling so depleted physically he should experience such an unusual almost agonizing desire for women he finished dressing and drove rapidly to marian reynold's apartment on upper riverside he was panting heavily when the maid opened the door for him he stepped just inside the room stopped stood there rigidly waiting from the bedroom ma- rian called just a minute darling the maid went out then marian came in from the bedroom if that minute had been used to put on clothes she could have started with nothing and not have had to rush she was wearing a sheer negligee through which the shadowed outlines of her body were clearly visible the garment was held around her waist by a loosely tied belt and from there up it stood open he could see the gorgeous full mounds of her white breasts erect and trembling slightly from her breathing her red hair hung loose thick about her face and shoulders for a moment they stood on opposite sides of the room looking at one another cameron was in the shadows near the door she whispered john darling and they moved swiftly together he could feel all the warm quivering flesh of her body through the thin gown could feel her breasts flatten against him his mouth came down hard and fierce upon hers she trembled ground herself against him john she whimpered john      he lifted her in his arms and started toward the sofa and it was then she saw his face clearly in the light she cried out and her body jerked in his arms but he did not stop he was lowering her on the sofa leaning above her she tried to push him away her face was working with terror no don't john not tonight why he demanded he was pant- ing holding her fiercely why not  i--i don't know i--please he fought to hold himself in check he couldn't afford to anger her not yet after ihe marriage after all her wealth was in his name    he'd kill her for having held him off now but until then    there were plenty of other women    he left early at the door he did not kiss her did not even touch her hand there was something wrong tonight and there was the terrible pain in his head the growing fear in his chest that he could not conquer i'm sick he  dime mystery magazine told himself there's no need for me to keep remembering nicki and what she said that's absurd his wife was not at home when he got there he looked alxiut for the maid but she wasn't there either well he'd wait until jane came he undressed and went to bed but the pain in his forehead continued and he didn't sleep well although after awhile he took a mild opiate he lay in the dark and was afraid he wanted jane but she didn't come and he had no idea where she was the next morning jane was still gone the maid did not answer his ring and he called down stairs for the negro cook to bring his breakfast it was a half hour before she arrived with the tray she was a fat goodnatured negro woman i sho am sorry you ain't feelin spry dis mawnin she said put- ting the tray on a small table and push- ing it toward him miss jane ain't here and the lawd knows where she is you gotta gel up and do som'en mr john i'll find her cameron said she'll be all right then he asked where's the maid why didn't she answer my ring she ain't here she lef las night in a powerful hurry like she was scared of some'um and she ain't come back i don't-- the cook had the tray beside him and for the first lime raised her eyes to his face she stiffened and almost overturned the table lawd mistur john what  instinctively cameron moved his hand to his forehead he said huskily i got hit on the forehead yesterday left an odd sort of mark didn't it hit--hit sho do look funny the cook said she kept backing toward the door i come git the dishes later then she was gone cameron got out of bed still holding his hand against his forehead the pain was there dull and steady like some- thing gnawing its way through his skull he crossed to the bathroom and faced the mirror he swayed and caught at the lavatory some invisible vise closed on his chest crushing it perspiration came thick along his lip and under his eyes the print of a hand was still clear on there was a darker spot between his eyes and when he touched it with a finger it hurt it's sore he whispered i must have bruised myself it's sore as hell the bruise must have affected his eyes they seemed closer together than lie- fore so that he studied them as one rather than separately there was no change in their color but once more he had the impression of seeing through them into his real character into a place as cold and savage as the eskimo hell except that he was no longer emotionally cold desire had dug hot fingers into him and tor- mented him constantly he was beginning to understand the feeling tliat drives sex criminals insane and makes them attack women on the streets he turned from the mirror staggering he readied the bed and lay there a long while thinking of nicki and the last words she had spoken i've got to find jane he said at last getting to his feet i've got to find her he wanted her now as he never had in his life physically and because of the curse he could clearly remember nicki's voice saying his only hope for relief shall lie in you he telephoned the police then mc- cory the detective i'm not so inter- ested in evidence for a divorce now he said i just want to find her find her and bring her here quick he thought the cook might be able to add some small clue that would help nymph of damnation  and he went downstairs to speak to her she was not there pots still rested on the kitchen stove and the gas was burn- ing there were dishes in the sink but the hook where she always placed her hat was vacant the suitcase-like purse which she carried was gone they had employed only two servants cameron was alone in the house now silence flowed in deep currents around him that afternoon cameron visited a doc- tor the man touched him cautiously with rubber gloves prescribed and sent him away if the pain keeps up he said you better see another doctor i-- i don't think i can help you much cam- eron knew that he was afraid that night he tried to pick up a woman on the street she was dressed for her profession a skirt that clung tight over her hips so that every curve came through the cloth wriggling like skin as she moved a blouse open low enough to show her breasts and ready to be opened further her face was heavily made up but pretty in a hard bold way and she had a figure that offered a lot of fun cam- eron pulled his car over to the curb and called to her she came willingly enough hips sway- ing breasts jiggling free of any restraint and cameron felt desire that was like fire rush through him his hands shook he could scarcely breathe she said hello baby and leaned over the door of his car her dress swayed open he gasped and reached for her and she giggled but made no move to draw away so you're in a hurry she said it was then a car turned the corner and its lights swept over cameron's face for one second the girl stared wild eyed and then she screamed and jumped back- ward but cameron was frantic he held to her ripped her dress leaped out of the car after her she kept screaming fighting him until her clothes were torn from her a car had stopped and persons were running forward cameron leaped back into his automobile the motor was still running and he tore down the street he was sobbing shaking all over as days passed the mark of the hand turned darkly purple the sore between his eyes was a hole eating into his fore- head and more and more his eyes seemed to merge to become a window of dark glass beyond which the cold and cowardly brutality of his soul was visible doctors looked at him and turned away shudder- ing within two weeks he gave up hope of finding jane she had vanished as com- pletely as smoke frantically cameron turned to science for help time passed and the man lashed by terror remembered it only in whirling kaleidoscopic scenes blurred pictures as from a jerky oldfashioned cinema there were doctors dark-furnished consultation rooms men in white coats with fear show- ing plainly in their eyes there was the maddening sickening pain under his skull the pain that was driving him crazy there were the white corridors of hos- pitals and other doctors old bearded men with names that science bowed to and there was the start and shock when they saw him and the horror that came into their faces there were white operating rooms nurses white and silent as ghosts the smell of anesthetics the gleam of knives and always there was the pain gnawing its insane way through his face and always there was the insane desire for women he would buy them to come to him making the arangements over the phone keeping in a dark room watching their bodies grow white as they undressed before him and then as his arms went around them they would see his face and tear free screaming  dime mystery magazine there was the vision of himself in mirrors unchanged by operations no scars left by the knives but always the same purple print of the hand and the sore that was making his eyes into one doctors a long seemingly endless whirl of them money being paid out always money and then there were doctors no more he had no faith in science now there were high vaulted rooms expensive dark decorations the soft voices of the mediums there was the thin esthetic face of the spiritualist staring back in terror the man's long hands held upright between them there was the voice say- ing it is a woman she has been close to you i cannot see her now but you must find her only she can help you there was the intense darkness the vague ghostlike face that might have been jane's the voice crying gone    gone    but only she can help he remembered asking questions of spiritualists of fakers of police and dectective departments of persons on the street coming up to them while they started in horror crying out tell me have you seen her my wife i've got to find her i've got to find her there were jails steady-voiced men asking him questions asylums and barred windows then an open door and racing into the night jane jane i can't stand this hurting any longer  and there were attacks on women on the street wild in- sane with desire a sex-mad animal there was hunger and long nights of walking of asking passersby for money of seeing them toss him a dime before they turned and went too swiftly away there were cheap slovenly fortune tellers most of them told him nothing he remem- bered only those who repeated the phras- es a woman    you must find her    no one else will help    and finally there was the old negro man perhaps he could help to find-- cameron found him without knowing how there was one room unbelivably filthy down an alley in a city the name of which he did not know the man was old as time without hair and without eyes it seemed there in the murky gloom where he sat among a pile of dirty quilts upon the floor cameron stood before him crazy with the agony in his body tell me be begged where is she  i've got to find her there was no fear in the negro's face perhaps it was because he was blind and could not see that which had frightened the others he sat among his blankets swaying humming some kind of gibber- ish through toothless gums where is she cameron shouted tell me tell me the negro ceased to sway the hum- ming faded gently from his lips a long while it was silent in the semi-dark with blind eyes the old man looked past cameron past the clapboard walls of the hovel past time and humanity and quietly he spoke she is dead she left your house one spring evening while you talked to a big blond man a detective and asked him to put her in the dozens she went to the railroad depot and she took a train to birmingham she took some poison out of her pocketbook and she drank it nobody knew who she was and they buried her in the poorground cameron did not feel the pain in his head then his hands were clenched so that blood oozed around his nails but he did not know she--she committed sui- cide he said at last she killed herself the negro said there ain't but one way you can reach her you got to kill yourself folks who die by their hand don't go to heaven and they don't go to hell she the only one who can help you and you got to kill yourself to reach her the sound of cameron's breathing was nymph of damnation  harsh against the gloom i'll kill my- self he said i can't stand this pain any longer i'll kill myself the negro was humming his gibberish and swaying when cameron went out he had forgotten the white man and his trouble tt was not easy for john cameron to commit suicide i've got to he kept telling himself i can't stand this agony any longer i can't live much longer like this--and if i die naturally  sui- cide was the unforgivable sin those who took their own lives went neither to heav- en nor to hell even after death there would be no relief for cameron he be- lieved unless jane granted it and jane had killed herself because of him only through suicide could lie reach her and get released from agony but cameron was a coward when he stood face to face with death his muscles turned watery and he could not move there was a river in this city a great muddy stream and cameron stood upon the levee looking down at it the pain under his skull was beyond bearing it seemed to be ripping his brain into shreds there in the swirling water was relief i've only to jump in he whispered to go down    it'll be easy to die but his whole body trembled at the thought later he was in the small filthy room where he lived there was a piece of wire tied to a beam in the ceiling and standing on a chair cameron tied the other end of the wire around his neck i'll do it this time he said aloud i'll step forward and kick the chair over as i swing he had trouble twisting the wire so that it wouldn't come loose because his fingers were stiff and wet with perspira- tion they slipped and he broke his fin- gernails but he did not feel the pain because of the terror inside his heart and agony in his body once he stopped i'll get down and rest for a moment he said i've got to but he forced himself to stay in the chair and keep working at the wire it seemed to be years during which his fingers fumbled close to his neck it would be easy to die some other way he thought i'll be glad if someone would shoot me if an automobile hit me on the street but he was certain that accidental death would not bring him to jane suicide was his only way at last the wire was ready the floor seemed to swim in mist thousands of feet below him blood flowed into his face and his heart was cold and then the door of the room opened and he turned and saw her it was nicki her dark hair was thick about her face her lips were parted and damp and amorous she whispered john darling she was beautiful as no human being should be beautiful her body seemed to glow like lighted amber her breasts stood out from her body superbly shaped and firm quivering now as though the hand of desire had stirred them john she whispered come to me he cried out hoarsely and stepped for- ward he had forgotten that he stood upon the chair he plunged downward a scream started in his throat and then he reached the end of the wire and the scream cut short he clutched at the wire over his head trying to pull himself up he tried to rip at the twisted end of the loop his body writhed snakelike jerking twisting con- vulsing his bulging eyes saw the closed door there was no one in front of it now perhaps there had never been any- thing but a vision an accidental death wouldn't    his movements grew more gentle a shudder ran through him after that he hung motionless except for a slight swaying to and fro monster of his making by  henry treat sperry with his own hands dr kelland had created this monster of sadism and now he was paying for it    paying with the life's blood of his only daughter doctor james kelland held his arms stiffly in front of him his hands still dripping with carbolic solution while ronald eccles his young assistant helped him into his oper- ating smock read me the card on this next case ronald he said as the interne tied the cord about his waist it's a cardiac sorne- thing-or-other isn't it  yes eccles crossed to a small wood- en file resting on a tile-topped table in the corner while his senior wearily tried to push back a stray lock of grey hair from his forehead with his upper arm care- fully avoiding touching it with his hand eccles thumbed through the file for a moment and extracted a pink card and read  carlos cafarelli aged nine clinic patient for the past six months primary diagnosis aneurism doctors mcfee and haggard saw the patient on the next visit  monster of his making  and postulated an auricular leak from a feeble diastolic murmur they note not precisely characteristic and all other ele- ments of the syndrome are lacking sug- gest that dr kelland    yes yes murmured the surgeon a bit of the weariness leaving his face i remember now ronald a puzzling and interesting case do you know i still haven't the faintest idea of what's wrong with the boy he's an orphan--was sent here because he had been complaining of slight pains in his chest perhaps i am opening myself to censure for this but i must have a look into that lad's midriff something decidedly wrong--something very strange if i told you what i sus- pect you'd think me mad the older man suddenly halted as he noticed that his assistant was looking at him strangely never mind he mur- mured see if the anesthetist is ready five minutes later the surgeon stood above a small sheet-covered body on a long operating table in the glare of the powerful lamps his face was tightly drawn hawklike as he gazed down at the pale brown countenance of his small patient at a barely perceptible sign a nurse on either side of the table pulled the sheet down baring the boy's body to the hips then one of them quickly swabbed it with antiseptic from throat to navel the surgeon held out a rubber-gloved right hand and instantly a gleaming scalpel was thrust into it by the nurse standing on his right dr kelland bent above the body and the knife moved swiftly was instantly tossed into a shallow tray con- taining a colorless liquid which stood on a stand at his left the surgeon stepped back a long red line had appeared on the boy's bare brown body extending from a little to the left of his breastbone straight down the longitudinal plane for a distance of eight inches instantly eceles the interne and a nurse bent over the body closing the bleeding points with clamps swabbing away the blood leaving a gaping opening in the small torso they moved like sol- diers at drill every movement precise timed the nurse on the doctor's right had the next scalpel ready it was time for the transverse section she wondered why the doctor hesitated why he didn't thrust out his hand to receive the instrument she was never to know she looked at the surgeon's face still bent over the small body and came perilously near screaming she had never seen such an expression on a human face before it was as if the doc- tor was looking not at the body of a cliild but at a demon from hell suddenly the surgeon gave a choked gasp he looked up glaring about at his assistants with a white drawn face and staring eyes as though he had never seen them before get out he whispered hoarsely at last get out--all of you the interne gave voice to a half-formed exclamation of surprise and protest but another look at the surgeon's face stopped him abruptly he turned on his heel and walked out of the room followed by the fluttering startled nurses for perhaps a quarter of a minute after the door had closed behind them doctor kelland stood with his eyes fixed on space it was as though he were pre- paring himself to look again into the small fleshy pit which lay open before him and at last the color came back a little to his parchment cheeks his breathing became normal he bent again above the boy's body but this time there was no hesitation or evidence of emotion about his conduct he was once more the nerveless precise surgeon save that as he worked en- larging the wound with section after sec- tion he murmured half-audibly to him- self it's impossible against nature but it's  dime mystery magazine true this vena cava shows considerable swelling here that would correspond to the right auricle that's its function--it must be    then the coronary artery here takes the place of the ventricles and the vagus nerve is shrivelled to nothing--yet it functions--it must   his all but inaudible murmurings ceased and for fully fifteen more minutes he worked feverishly then he suddenly dropped the last scalpel in the pan of anti- septic which by now had taken on a pink tinge he washed the wound dressed it and applied bandages passing them round and round the patient's tiny form at last he finished and straightened up looking down at the child on the operating table with a strange look of awe on his hawk- like features it's incredible--unheard of he mur- mured what sort of creature are you my lad what manner of being will you become when you grow into manhood-- you who have no heart but if the good surgeon could have had his question answered at that moment the scalpel in his hand would have plunged downward--to bury itself in the small chest that was without a heart    twenty-five years later the offices of dr carl cardell were as softly lighted somberly gleaming and altogether colorfully impressive as mod- ern decorators muralisfes and surgical supply houses could make them in the anteroom where many an important per- sonage had cooled his heels awaiting dr cardeh's convenience were a number of luxuriously overstuffed divans and chairs lined against the walls in one of the smaller chairs sat a man whose aged face showed the signs of all but unbearable grief and anxiety his haunted eyes roved about the room lighting with fierce hope whenever the immaculately pretty nurse at the reception desk lifted her inter-office phone and dulling miserably whenever she nodded to someone else but at last the old man's turn came and he almost sprang to the door into the private office in response to the nurse's signal he passed through it quickly and it swung noiselessly shut behind him as he stood just inside the entrance his faded old eyes fixed on the darkly handsome young man who sat behind the great wal- nut desk so said the young man with no sign of emotion in his voice we meet again doctor kelland the old man did not reply for several moments he stood there his white bony hands hanging lankly at his sides their fingers trembling slightly in response to the storm of emotions which was racking his old body yes carlos he said at last in a low quavering voice the young man's face darkened my legal name is carl cardell doctor kel- land he snapped the change as you know has been registered in washington but perhaps you have decided to capital- ize on your knowledge of my past may- be you have thought of a way to fill the purse which your incompetence as a sur- geon has emptied    a wry smile twisted the old man's thin lips that's like you he said you would think that the young man's shoulders moved im- patiently what do you want he said harshly i'm busy kelland unbidden the ohd surgeon sank into a chair and sighed as he passed a shaking hand over his forehead it's about helen carlos you read about her accident cardeh's eyes suddenly quickened with interest he leaned forward helen what accident  about a month ago--while she was driving down from greenwich there had been a sleet storm she went off the road monster of his making  just below peekskill she got a few bruises and a bad shaking up but noth- ing serious--we thought then ten days ago she began limping the x-rays show a fractured patella   the old man's eyes raised appealingly to the young surgeon's we've had our differences carlos but surely you're fair enough to admit that i had great provoca- tion for whatever i did to you   suddenly kelland shuddered and broke off god this was worse than he had dreamed it would be he was talking to this man in the terms a father might use to cajole an erring son erring murder --sadism   his sick mind whirled back through the years back to the day when he the then famous surgeon doctor james kel- land had lifted the small brown weirdly functioning body of carlos cafarelli from the operating table carried it into a pri- vate room and placed it on a cot he had stood there for a long time gazing down at the boy a human being without a heart not really of course--but with an attenuated almost vestigial heart like a fish or a snake and that shrivelled vagus nerve obviously it performed its pneumogastric functions efficiently enough--but could it be that its attenuated condition was trace- able to a neurotic disfunction we say that the heart is the seat of the emotions simply because the rhythm of the heart is affected by the emotions of the brain via the vagus nerve and through the heart the whole body is affected by every emo- tion we experience would this child prove immune to the physiological reaction of emotion  and if he should--what a surgeon he would make his would be a steadier hand than ever a human being possessed before his would be an intellect clear and cold aloof from the emotions which make cow- ards and bunglers of us all his would be the icy fearlessness which penetrates fron- tiers with as much assurance as though they were long-familiar territory    again the old surgeon's gaunt body twitched with a spasm of revulsion but he mustn't let the man before him sus- pect what was going on in his brain if he could help it helen's life would be ruined if cardell refused to take her case only cardell could give her back the use of her right leg--save her from the life- long tragedy of being a cripple    there was a faint smile on cardell's chiseled lips his eyes as always were utterly devoid of expression save your breath kelland he said tonelessly i wouldn't lift a hand to save her if she were dying clowly the blood drained from the  old surgeon's face his hands clenching the arms of his chair until they were waxy white but he had expected this why should he feel this ghastly over- whelming rage against the man before him he was not a man really he was an intelligent beast nothing more it was no use the heartless cruel words aroused in the old surgeon's breast the wild desire to kill to rid the earth of the soulless monster before him    and yet it was a monster which was partially of his own creation it took doctor kelland several mo- ments to gain mastery over his emotions but at last he was able to command a tone which was a pitiable mimicry of car- dell's icy aloofness of course i expected this sort of a response from you carlos he said you can never forget that helen always hated you repulsed all your advances as she would those of an ape--thank god but naturally i didn't come to you without weapons you asked awhile ago if i had come to capitalize on my knowledge of your past i have decided to carlos but i do not ask for money--i ask for my daughter's happiness that is the price of  dime mystery magazine my continued silence years ago i would have denounced you had i not been ob- sessed with my ambition to make you the greatest surgeon of history i have con- doned murder carlos in the name of that ambition and now it is time for you to repay me a silence fell after doctor kelland's last words and for many long moments the men stared at each other cardell's face as always was completely devoid of emotion but in the depths of his dark eyes something that had been slumbering was quickening to life a cracked patella he said at last is hardly beyond the skill of the average surgeon the old practitioner ignored the heavy irony of the young man's tone it is a bad fracture he said shaking his grey head wearily you know as well as i that it is one spot where the slightest error results in permaanent stiffening of the joint suddenly his lean hands knotted into fists came down with pas- sionate vehemence on the arms of the chair by god cafarelli he cried you are going to do this thing--or you are going to the electric chair the mangled bodies of two girls now buried in pot- ter's field will rise up at my bidding and blast you to hell don't forget that i'm not asking you to save helen from being a cripple  i'm commanding you to do it and god help you if you aren't successful the old man had risen to his feet and stood there shaking like a wind-blown reed the young man continued to look at him calmly but the thing which lay at the back of his eyes was fully alive now a crawling worm of light which two young women had watched with depth- less horror as their pain-blasted bodies had slowly sunk into the release of death very well doctor he said quietly it is imperative that i be at my lodge in the poconos early tomorrow morning i am trying out some new elaborations of dr w s baer's method of treating mar- row infections in my laboratory up there if you don't object to driving helen up some time in the early afternoon his tone was precisely the same as he would have used to an old and valued client old doctor kelland shivered invol- untarily then wordlessly he nodded turned and went out the door as it closed softly behind him the strange eyes of doctor carl cardell re- mained fixed on space and the smile which slightly curved his handsome mouth portrayed the sort of delight that is known to the fiends of the deepest pit in hell  the laboratory and operating room which had been constructed in the rear of doctor cardell's mountain home lacked nothing which might be found in the most elaborately equipped modern hospital save the more ponderous appa- ratus doctor kelland glanced about in grim approval as with the aid of cardell he carried his daughter to the operating table helen kelland's pretty face showed nothing of the pain which this journey was costing her she had consented to this operation only after her father had argued with her for hours for although she had heard of none of the monstrous acts of sadism which had punctuated the young surgeon's career she instinctively sensed something in his nature that was vile and unnatural she sighed in relief and closed her eyes as the two men lowered her young softly rounded figure to the operating table her father immediately started to cut off the plaster cast which encased his daughter's leg before he had finished cardell rolled a tank of ether into place at the head of the table and fitted a piece of sterile gauze into the anesthetic mask which was connected to the tank by a monster of his making  length of thick hose the stage was set doctor kelland moved to the head of the table and took up the mask are you ready he asked in a strained voice cardell his sensitive fingers gently probing the flesh of helen's knee nodded absently and the old surgeon lowered the mask to his daughter's face he reached behind him with the other hand and turned a petcock on the tank a soft hiss- ing sound filled the room helen kelland's firm young breasts rose and fell under the sheer covering of her light summer dress as she inhaled deeply of die soporific gas and at last as his long-practiced old eyes detected the symptoms of complete anesthesia doctor kelland turned off the petcock and re- moved the mask we're ready carlos he said cardell straightened turned and walked casually toward the older man kelland watched his approach with mild wonder but he had no warning of what was to come until cardell reaching him sudden- ly threw himself upon the old surgeon pinning his feeble arms to his sides with one encircling arm as with his free hand he turned the petcock on the tank of ether and snatched up the mask doctor kelland had time for one star- tled cry and then his voice was muffled by the anesthetic mask as cardell clapped it over his mouth and nostrils holding it firmly in place within the space of a few seconds the victim's body lost its tension and relaxed supporting it with one arm cardell at length turned off the petcock and carried the lax body to the west wall of the room    when doctor kelland regained con- sciousness he did not realize for the first few seconds that he was in the same room brightly illuminated before it was now in a darkness which was relieved only by a red-rayed lamp which gave a spot light from the ceiling the blinds had been drawn closing out all but a few stray beams of daylight and as the old surgeon's eyes focused on what lay be- neath the red-rayed lamp his aching mus- cles suddenly hardened with the trans- fixion of horror helen was still on the operating table but she was stark nude now and her arms and legs had been securely bound to the table with stout straps the ruddy light bathed her slender body with a crim- son effulgence which emphasized rather than obscured the satin texture of her flawless skin kelland gasped and cried out in in- credulous horror attempting to lurch to his feet only then did he discover that he had been lashed securely to a chair against the west wall of the room and was powerless to move an inch at his cry a weirdly incongruous figure stepped out of the gloom and into the ruby nimbus of the lamp the figure was clothed in the black tights and jerkin of a long dead century and only after it spoke was doctor kelland able to recog- nize carl cardell ah--i'm glad to see you're back with us doctor said cardell and kelland was conscious of a vibrancy in his voice that he had never heard before now as soon as your attractive daughter has recovered we can proceed something which he did not yet under- stand made the blood run cold in the old surgeon's body proceed-- he quavered what do you mean i refer to the operation of course said the young man isn't that what we're here for yes--yes  of course but-- then the blasting knowledge of what portended almost shocked the old man back into senselessness his widening eyes fastened on his daughter's bare right knee noted sickly that nothing had been done to it good god he whispered you wouldn't do that carlos even a sadist continued on page  corpses on parade edith and ejler jacobson putrescent masses of decayed flesh they walked the streets of new york--the victims of the rotting death was bonny my beloved destined to be of their number could i alone outwit the monsters that had terrorized the world's largest city i would die trying     diabolical unearthly menace stalks through the pages of this pulse-speeding novelette chapter one dues payable to death they buried andy carter on one of those bleak february mornings when the sun forgets to shine he had a big turn-out and i wasn't sur- prised to see every society editor in town at st anne's dressed in mourning with note-books and pencils constantly in hand jotting down the notables present i guessed at the paragraph they'd give me barry amsterdam new york's play-boy and thrill-seeker number one was grieving at the loss of his erstwhile playmate the fabulously wealthy heir to the carter utility millions whose untimely death-- and so forth i only hoped they'd leave it at that be- cause i knew and so did others that andy carter hadn't died of pneumonia he had died of whatever it was that had made him a ghost-faced stranger the last time i'd seen him alive or could you call that--life that cringing shadow of a man who'd whimper as he pulled his hand from my clasp re- fused to answer the natural questions a best friend would ask we didn't speak of it to each other we who were the monied fraction of new york but it was there behind every bland mask of a face at the fashionable funeral andy carter had died of stark grisly terror   dime mystery magazine you look like the prelude to several a long drinks barry my boy said a slow voice at my elbow it was duke livingstone city editor of the chronicle and in times past friend enough to squash some of my snappier high-jinks before they reached the headlines tall and bald- ish with eyes like an owl's and a mouth that was sometimes like a kid's and some- times like a professor's he was humor- ous  he had to be a grimmer man might have gone crazy knowing the things he knew about people and their shortcomings i feel like the tail end of a bad life i told him and what brings you here poor old andy wasn't that important duke put a long finger against his thin nose and wagged it poor old andy he said died without explaining a few things that might be interesting to the press for instance what happened to the carter money andy didn't live long enough to spend four million-- duke skip it i urged skip it as an editor anyway don't hurt the car- ters any more than you can help it duke's owlish eyes followed my gaze to a brave erect little figure black-veiled at the front of st anne's and that's an- other thing he drawled i have a hunch bonny carter knows more about her brother's death than any of us don't worry i won't interrupt her grief--yet you're a little sunk on her aren't you  sure i was sunk on her until andy's --well we called it illness--we'd been talking armonk every night of the week duke knew it so i didn't bother telling him and i guess he knew i didn't want him around just then because he van- ished like the good fellow he was there was something about bonny car- ter even in the stark shock of sudden loss that made a man think of the way spring felt when he was a kid she was--well perfect violet eyes tawny hair flawless skin that was only a part of it you could feel something underneath that a kind of beautiful purity that made you want to help her and protect her i don't know what she saw in me ex- cept that i loved her but i knew from the way she reached out her hands to me the minute she saw me that if anyone could comfort her in this tragedy it was i i swore silently to myself that i'd live up to her trust in me god how little we know our own follies in spite of myself through my very efforts to save her i was to add to her sorrows barry she whispered has he gone that newspaper man i mean i held her fingertips reverently yes he's gone i said i asked him to duke's not a bad sort no he isn't but i'm wary of re- porters she was a little breathless and it was not the breathlessness that comes from tears her glance darted about un- happily and then she beckoned me into a side aisle i have to talk to you before we go to the cemetery she said barry i don't know what i'll be like afterward i've been so worried we don't have a cent mother and i and we don't know what's happened to it andy's club was awfully decent about paying for the funeral but the living should pay for their own dead i tried to tell her that it would be all right that the sweetest thing she could do for me would be to let me take care of her and her mother forever but she re- treated from me in a kind of appalled daze --and then i saw a look in those violet eyes that made me wish i'd died before i saw it it was the same look that had been on andy's face the last time i saw him alive a look that made you think terror like a huge cancer was amok in a living being feeding on it and slowly causing its death she wasn't looking at me she was looking at the pall-bearers six black fig- corpses of parade  ures moving with andy's coffin down the aisle was it the candle-light or the tragic occasion that made them seem what they were that sad sextet or was it-- my mind recoiled toward sanity from the thought--that same expression of panic gone hopeless that turned those faces so familiar to cameramen around the town's hot-spots into death's-heads of despair i didn't see bonny at the cemetery nor after the burial for the very good reason that the burial ended in a near-riot i remembering thinking then that life had turned into a crazy caricature of death i didn't know you see that i was as yet only in the hinterland of a horror that would blacken my world later it was just after the first spadeful had been flung against the coffin grant an- ders the leading pall-bearer stood very straight and gaunt at the edge of the grave his loose black coat flapping in the february wind like the wing-humming of the grim reaper grant's family had come over on the mayflower he was an old classmate of mine i thought that he was not looking too well suddenly high mirthless laughter pierced the reverent silence it was grant's voice there was a sharp crack- ing sound grant faltered and then plunged into the open grave his dead fingers still linked around a smoking re- volver i suppose i must have taken charge in the panic that followed because when sergeant connor put a heavy hand on my shoulder it seemed i had pushed eight men away from the body and was en- gaged in slapping a middle-aged matron out of hysteria i'm a friend of the carters i ex- plained i know all these people i tried to keep them from running wild ye've been doin a bit of runnin wild yerself m'boy said the sergeant not unsympathetically however i'm glad ye let no one touch the body he beckoned to a comrade in brass-and-blue and they hoisted poor grant out of the pit sui- cide they observed pithily grant had been a great one for thrills when i knew him and he was willing to pay for them whenever they offered con- sequently he'd usually carried at least a century on him generally more yet when we examined his pockets in that vain half-blind search for motive that follows every tremendously wrong human act we found--a nickel two pennies a clean handkerchief and one slip of paper in the otherwise empty wallet it was a notice from the quadrangle club that dues amounting to ninety dollars quarter- ly were payable on the first of february i thought dully and it was a thought that clicked on an empty cartridge that members of the quadrangle club seemed to be showing a singular mortality first andy--now grant anders i was oc- cupied with a resentment against kitty anders grant had married her on a dare and it worked out as such marriages usually do grant had been good sport enough to stick it but i was sure kitty with her erratic expensive tastes had brought my former classmate to this piti- able end what a difference there is in women i thanked god for the sweet sanity of my bonny--little realizing that when i saw her next she would seem far from sane i gave the sergeant my name address and twenty dollars for being helpful the funeral guests were gone and what was left of andy and grant was in hands fit to deal with remains suddenly after all the excitement i began to feel a little sick--and more than anything in the world i wanted to see bonny neither she nor her mother were at  the town apartment when i got back to manhattan i floundered into an easy chair and gritted my teeth over a scotch  dime mystery magazine and soda at ten-minute intervals i phoned the carters by five in the after- noon they were still out i had just about decided to go over there and wait for them when suki my man-servant an- nounced a visitor it was the city editor of the chronicle he helped himself to a corona and asked for a drink and then his mouth that was humorous as a kid's came out with a bombshell he said kitty anders has just jumped out of the window and then he sighed and blew the kind of contented smoke rings you see in bedroom slipper ads when it penetrated i shouted you're crazy or else everyone else is i always knew about everyone else duke answered you learn about them in my racket now lad i've done you a turn or two in our time you knew the anders better than i did would you say kitty was the sort of woman who'd kill herself out of grief at the loss of a husband i laughed not happily hardly she's dead then duke nodded most messily dead it's a shame she was a pretty woman say didn't i tell you earlier you needed a drink keeps a man's stomach down swallow one and i'll take you over for a look at the corpse there's some kind of cop who says you know the answer i damned sergeant connor in my pri- vate thoughts and went to the anders apartment on east seventy-third in a press car i'd avoided that apartment since grant's marriage--it was gaudy and there seemed to be a price tag on every- thing screaming expense i dreaded too the habitual reek of over-applied oriental perfumes that had been a perfect expres- sion of kitty i needn't have no hint of bottled flowers was in that air instead a sultry foulness faint but undeniable hit us the moment we entered duke's long nose wrinkled in distaste i wasn't imagining it in the bedroom surrounded by gew- gaws she would never enjoy again lay kitty anders and for salon she had the coroner the press and the law and now i placed that odor of corruption it pro- ceeded from the dead woman's decently shrouded body i said she's been dead for days and the coroner looked at me curiously and shook his head    take yerself a look said sergeant connor pulling the sheet from kitty's face i looked--and something in me froze i'm not a coward i've been in some tough spots in my time and laughed afterward but this was different in the first place with the removal of the sheet the stench became almost overpowering-- as though kitty had been pregnant with death before she died and on the dead face was that unname- able expression of hopeless despair that i had seen on too many faces that day that was it--she had carried death within her like an unborn evil--i turned away half- sick with a fear i dared not name to my- self ye wouldn't know what makes the poor girl smell so horrible would ye asked the sergeant i said the living don't smell like that nor fresh corpses   the coroner straightened and looked at me he was haggard and perplexed of course not but we have sworn testimony that mrs anders was alive this morning that she shouted a warning to passers-by before she jumped    he shrugged and went into the next room duke followed him hoping i suppose to get a more com- plete report the sergeant was busy with kitty's effects i don't know what kept me in that tmb-smelling room unless it were fear of the haunting uncertainty of the thing corpses on parade  some malign fate seemed amok among my friends tomorrow unless i learned its source of power it might strike nearer home    no one else had seen the small white thing clutched by those stiff white fin- gers no one saw me as i stooped to wrest the thing from their clasp the fingers were soft to the bone pulpy as though maggot-ridden i forced my- self to delve there    and the woman's hand turned to putty in mine like a squashed putrescent fruit i was a man i didn't get sick on the spot that would come later in her hand had been a membership card to the quadrangle gub chapter two one ticket to hell snap out of it duke kept telling me on the way back you're white barry well do you know any more than i do the sarge seemed to think you might i'd like to get it into a six o'clock extra i didn't answer because i was swallow- ing to keep my stomach where it belonged besides what was there to say duke had a nose he knew as much as i did was it true or was my imagination playing tricks on my memory that last time andy had retreated from me at the antler bar hadn't i thought what ghastly shaving lotion the lad uses for there had been a super-abundance of scent about him a scent with sickly-rancid un- dertones    god it was true what- ever they died of these ill-fated things they'd been dying of it for a long time be- fore  some loathsome disease that rotted all of them heart and brain last  i swallowed harder than ever and managed to talk looks like the dissolution of the upper classes the snootiest club in town is really getting something to turn its nose and i showed him the rumpled card i'd torn from those rotted fingers shut up duke said sharply you're letting it get you come back with me while i put the chronicle to bed she'll run an article on the quadrangle club that ought to stop the slaughter you might have two cents to put in i said no because i remembered with tightening heart muscles that i hadn't located bonny all day and she had told me that morning that she owed the cost of andy's funeral to--the quadrangle club no wonder she had looked as though doom were a little way off watch- ing her helpless struggle with malevolent and unfathomable eyes it was enough to drive a man mad that sinister shadow whose substance i could not perceive there was no need to phone i knew when i saw the mink coat and black hat on a coueh in the foyer that i had a most welcome guest i heard the auto- matic playing the pathetique symphony bonny crouched head buried in her elbows in a big chair her small black- robed body swayed mournfully to the third movement god i was glad to see her--and not to--to smell her she was pure thank god and untaint- ed still had the same faint toilet water scent about her woodsy with lavendar    she winced when i put my hands on her shoulders bonny where have you been all day  i asked anxiously she turned to me a white face in which the violet eyes looked like great bruises dodging reporters she answered barry i have to stay here tonight you can't i answered with a sharp- ness that was as much reproof to myself as to her there aren't enough rooms and-- i added laughing feebly--no chaperone chaperone she laughed with me but it was a high uncomfortable laugh that made my flesh creep bitter music she commented and then what do i  dime mystery magazine need with a chaperone i want protec- tion just for tonight i shook her for she was still laughing in that bitter almost hysterical way but it had no effect bonny you've got to tell me what are you afraid of she shuddered everything--even you you've been wicked in your time haven't you barry awfully wicked  but i love you that wasn't like bonny i'd told her all about myself and the low-lights of my past and she'd been pretty magnan- imous about it she wasn't one to rake up old ashes suddenly i hated that poignant music like a crossed child i snatched the record i heard the needle whine once and then the third movement of the symphony was in a hundred frag- ments on the floor i felt that way--once bonny told me she had stopped laughing her voice was flat hopeless now it doesn't matter can i stay tonight barry it may be the last time i'll ever be near you i shouted for god's sake talk straight if you'd only tell me what's terrifying you--you can't stay here think bonny we buried andy this morning you don't want to go to hell tonight do you she had resumed her rocking back and forth in the cradle of her own arms andy this morning she crooned to- morrow--kitty and the day after-- who knows  maybe bonny poor kitty poor bonny i couldn't bear the picture her insane sing-song conjured in my mind bonny with her tawny hair to die like kitty i slapped my sweetheart hard she whim- pered--and laughed i remember pleading and haranguing alternately but nothing shook bonny from her mad mood i shot questions about the quadrangle club at her but she kept crooning and laughing to her- self in the ghastly mockery of a lullaby finally i said i'm calling up your moth- er she'll spank you for this- mother's gone said bonny poor mother a telephone call to the car- ters proved she was right for the time being anyway i'd had enough skirting on the edge of nerve-strangling mystery i could think of only one man who might know some- thing--a very little something--and if i pooled my knowledge with his we might together find a ray of blessed light suki i shouted forgetting that there were still human ears left not deafened by madness take care of miss carter don't let anyone in i'll be back in an hour i handed the boy my gun he blinked and nodded suki was a good boy loyal and intelligent bonny laughed as i walked out into the night duke wasn't at the office when i got there they told me he'd gone to check some material for a special article on the quadrangle club featured for front page release in the morning i groaned fell into duke's swivel chair and waited there wasn't much humor in duke's face when he came in at eleven-thirty he took one look at me and said when did you eat last i don't know maybe this morning let's step across the street i won't say what i have to say to a guy with an empty stomach i didn't like the ham and eggs i wouldn't have liked nectar and ambrosia at that point but duke sat over me sternly making me gulp the stuff down anyhow and he only relaxed over my half-finished cup of coffee i've been over to the quadrangle club he said harshly an umpty layout big brownstone front thick curtains and a stuffed butler at the door couldn't get corpses on parade  in though god knows how they've kept the cops out after today's high-jinks they sponsored the funeral didn't they well you need a ticket from the social register to crash i didn't want to waste time i said i'd heard all that before the quadrangle club had been one of those things in the background all my life like the horse show my lad said duke his face one long grimace from the bald spot on his brow to the cleft in his narrow chin do you know whom i saw in the lobby just past the butler no you look as though it might have been a ghost correct said the duke it was andy carter there are points beyond which the mind cannot go discrepancies of evidence which only the insane may enter and live i knew as soon as duke told me that i believed him and i know too that something snapped in my brain it had to i started moving and moving fast first i drove through every red light on the route to my own apartment i wasn't surprised to find suki blubbering and frantic and bonny gone that was part of the grotesquely hideous nightmare miss carter get telephone call i not can stop her she say-- suki paused and there was stark fear in his face--her brother want her she go is not miss carter's brother dead this morning  dead kitty anders must have been dead a week before she stopped moving about in the land of the living what was to keep a corpse from rising then if the dead forgot to die it was only after i got to the quad- rangle club that the horror stopped i put one finger on the doorbell and kept it there the door opened to the width of a man's arm something bright flared astoundingly in my face and blinded me i didn't see or feel whatever it was that smashed down on my skull and sent me into oblivion with a burst of shooting stars t felt my head going round and round just before i opened my eyes i ex- pected to wake up in hell but they'd can- celed that trip apparently because i was in my own bed with suki's worried brown face bending over me and duke living- stone's back between me and the window duke's mouth puckered as he turned still with us he said when i found you in the gutter you looked as though you had been done in for good he paused and then exploded nerts what a set-up the cops won't even touch it my mouth was dry and there was a weight on top of my head where i'd been cracked that seemed a truckload i said i'm not so sure and reached for the phone sergeant connor told me cheerily that everything was under control then why the hell don't you raid that place i told him the sergeant answered his cheer con- siderably shaken now me boy we can't raid a respectable private club because of a coincidence a damned peculiar coincidence his voice dropped to a whisper we got orders--not to touch it when i expostulated there was a soft click barry there's only one way duke's voice was weary as though he'd been up every night for a million years you've got that ticket i haven't got you're a social register lad get in touch with the quadrangle club and apply for member- ship it was a ticket all right a ticket to hell but maybe i'd find bonny in hell a brisk secretarial voice at the other end of the wire told me i would be investi- gated and if i furnished the customery references my membership would be con- sidered  duke's article on the front page of the chronicle that morning was one of those  dime mysteery magazine brave damfool things that only cub re- porters and veteran editors have the nerve to do he told his story simply starting with andy's funeral there was grant's suicide and kitty's he stated flatly that kitty hadn't killed herself for grant's sake the popular young matron said he was anything but a faithful and loving wife he hauled over the quadrangle club briefly mentioning its history as a tony haven for the best people of the eighties and he posed the question reasonably enough why has the ha-cha generation of blue-bloods joined the brownstone tra- dition  can it be that behind those vener- able portals there is a stimulus for those jaded appetites a pleasure so exhaustive that its ending leaves nothing but self- loathing and desire for death duke grinned at me when i looked up at him like a small boy who has made an offensive precocious remark and ex- pects to be told how bright he is i said nice work duke i'm glad you left your latest hunches about the carters out of it that was decent a newspaperman is never decent i left that out because i may not have proof proof i howled you can't prove anything the chronicle's going to run into the biggest libel suit in history duke smiled his sad crooked smile maybe but it won't go to trial tomor- row and by the time we get our day in court i'm gambling we'll have proof enough to halt the whole blamed mess i was finishing the second cup of black coffee and where would you be getting it i said duke didn't answer just kept looking at me i know i said you think i'm going to get it for you god i hope i can i hope i can find bonny-- i didn't dodge his whimsical blow to the chin it was his way of bucking me up you'll find her he assured me if there's anyone who can crack the story it's you if you want an expense account on the chronicle   i said no i'm on my own got to be going said the duke think it over barry a big paper has resources files of information contacts    it can send you inside places you couldn't crack yourself it's a help i agreed with him it was the brightest ray of light i'd seen yet duke gave me a press card informing the police that barry amsterdam was working for the new york chronicle and left me to my own devices chapter three doom cracks its whip judge rainey told me that after- noon in his office if i hadn't known your uncle barry i'd throw you out what do you mean i'm blocking police in- vestigation  why would i do a thing like that why i don't even belong to the damned club but i insisted you're the only poli- tical force in town that could the others don't come from your kind of family the judge a big man with a magnifi- cent silver head forgot that he'd known my uncle he threw me out    it seemed hopeless hopeless it might be three weeks before i'd pass that brown- stone front myself and in the meantime bonny  i felt dry in the throat every time i thought of bonny it was like the thirst of a dying man lost in the sahara something made me look up as i walked through the front lobby of the office build- ing something indescribably vile   and familiar an odor of the charnel-house a woman swathed to the eyebrows in silver fox had just passed me i recog- nized her at once as judge rainey's young and beautiful second wife i ran after her and grabbed her arm she turned and corpses on parade  i--i had known thea rainey as one of the town's huskier young glamor girls seen her cantering an hour after dawn heard her throaty alive laugh    and now i saw her with the cancer of death almost victorious in her wasted frame barry amsterdam she said and then she laughed--but what a laugh the ghost of her youth chuckling in hell    and god help her she stank under the heaviness of her perfume there was a rank odor of decaying flesh    i had dropped her arm but she re- trieved mine i shuddered at the touch and she knew it and licked her lips they'll get you too she whispered you're a nice lad barry once--you didn't know it did you--i fancied i loved you they'll bring you to me in death barry    they'll let me kiss you   i went back to thea's apartment with her it took every ounce of stomach i had but i went she promised she'd talk if we were alone    she even seemed to know where bonny was    her butler served us sandwiches and highballs she touched neither when i had pleaded with her for agonizing minutes she rose her chalky face as- sumed an expression of terrible despair you want to know what they do to us she whispered tensely crazily i'll show you before i could stop her she had zipped her dress open from throat to hem she stepped out of it i cried stop but she didn't stop she stepped out of her slip and i saw the white diaphragm below her brassiere gleaming uncleanly  she tore off the brassiere and the silk shorts in hideous nudity she advanced one step toward me her breasts her hips seemed half-decomposed    and the smell it was like the fumes that might arise from a city's garbage lying for hours under an august sun    and then i was engulfed in a putrefac- tion that had been the beauty of thea rainey her arm white as the under- side of a fish belly twined about my neck she pressed her naked body to me she darted her face close to mine i felt the kiss of loathsome death and when i would have withdrawn she pressed closer then--i've read about lips melting in an embrace but i'll never read it again without being sick for that was exactly what thea's lips did they squashed with the same hideous plosh of rotten fruit that had marked the disinte- gration of kitty's hand    i didn't turn to look i ran my mouth felt ghoulishly filthy as though i were a cannibal epicure i ran right to the chroni- cle office duke i said i know why the police won't touch it it's not rainey it's rainey's wife    and then i was suddenly very sick thea rainey's funeral was held next day at st anne's society was there but it was a weirdly changed so- ciety from the polite group that had met two days before at andy carter's funeral in fifty hours the upper crust of man- hattan had been transformed to a cower- ing half-idiocy  no one mentioned the haste of the burial we were thinking of other things each of us seemed menaced by some unholy destruction we did not speak to each other more by two score were the faces that wore an expression of hopeless despair and we knew we who had escaped so far that they were the doomed    they told us nothing though they had been our friends and our loved ones there was a great wreath of flowers from the quadrangle club but its roses and lilies were not enough to combat the mingled odor of strong perfumes that rose from those who had come to honor the dead perfumes that covered a vague but unmistakeable odor of decay thea rainey had been emblamed cleverly they had drained her blood and replaced the broken  dime mystery magazine features with wax but for her friends the dying no such service had been ren- dered i didn't go to the burial i needed fresh air i walked aimlessly about town that forenoon i wasn't quite sane i think a dozen times i followed some woman simply because she had red hair    but she was never bonny bonny had the thing touched her yet the fifthy disease that a doctor in thea's case had despairingly named heart dis- ease  why hadn't she been at the funeral  was she stolen or killed i saw the last cars of thea's cortege winding southward on park dully i watched them they were bound for a cemetery in brooklyn but the last--was that a glimpse of tawny hair i caught behind the curtained window--made a u-turn and headed north north they had buried andy in westchester    and bonny had said she was going to--her brother i taxied to my garage took my car and stamped on the accelerator it wasn't clever half-blinded with dread as i was for by the time i'd located sergeant con- nor and had him explain me out of traffic court in yonkers it was three-thirty i was at hawthorne by five    and when i came to the cemetery night was on me night without a moon    the gates were locked so i clambered over the wall in the darkness the tomb- stones were a glimmering reproach to one who would discover their secrets i crept along stealthily to andy's grave once i saw a swinging lantern and i ducked be- hind a monument hugging the dank cold earth that was nourished on death but there were no lights where we had left andy there zvas a pile of fresh earth where his stone had been and the grave- pit yawned wide open with the cold sweat pouring down my face i peered from be- hind the dirt-pile    two hooded figures stood on either side of the unlidded coffin and lying within her pale hands crossed over the emblaming sheet her violet eyes alive with mad fear was bonny they were lifting the lid ready to put it into place  i jumped toward the near- est figure caught him in a frantic half- nelson and pushed like a frightened ghost the other figure leapt away barry you don't know what you're doing shrieked bonny i didn't listen i kept pushing beneath the black robe i felt that familiar puttiness bonny stood up in the coffin her hair falling over her shoulders pure as a dream of heaven in her white dead-dress barry let me die    this isn't a hard death it's over so soon  not like the others   let me save you barry dimly through the wild hate that throbbed in my brain i knew that she was giving her life for my salvation i didn't want that god no i pushed a little harder    and the brain of the hooded thing splashed out of the rotted skull i dropped the body it fell with a soft whoosh against the coffin when i snatched off the hood i saw no face only battered brain and bone    bonny screamed i turned and saw the other hooded thing reaching down on me with the butt end of a revolver no time to duck  i took it later i would remember as though in a dream that a black devil had carried bonny away but it would be no dream because when i awoke just before dawn i was to find myself lying cold and aching across an open coffin in an open grave when i got back to town that morning suki handed me a single thing that had come by mail it was a neat little invita- tion black on white asking me to attend my initiation at the quadrangle club that night with the polite reminder formal in a lower left-hand corner i looked at it till the letters danced--and fell into a corpses of parade  drugged sleep of nervous exhaustion i awoke toward evening suki had laid out my soup and fish i felt fresher freer- to think for the first time in days that card    they'd rushed it i thought    and i wondered if there were not some connection between last night's episode at the grave and this morning's invitation either last night i had blundered  too much or else    and another thought made me pause  or else the whole thing had been deliberate that glimpse i'd caught of bonny luring me to witness a witless scene in a graveyard too many horrors had forced them- selves on my awareness in the immediate past as i dressed i thought how in- credible it should be that i was going to the quadrangle club to unearth the grisli- est of imaginable horrors    the quad- rangle club that had been for fifty years a guarded haven of wealth and prestige it was almost insane but then my world had been insane for days even as i drove over the thought per- sisted that i was going on a fool's errand i wondered why    somewhere at the back of my head a gap persisted some- thing i should have known that eluded my dulled senses i pulled myself together and went through the brownstone portals old-generation tone cut-glass chande- liers and the gentlemen taking their port in the card room that was the quad- rangle club i recognized most of the members of my own set the moderns and their would-be modem mammas and papas but we were stiff and strange with each other incense burned almost overpower- ingly everywhere but it was not enough to hide that other smell   half the faces were chalky and tragic the other half like polite masks over real terror nowhere did i see bonny so you've joined too barry mona wells said to me she was a charming kid lithe and dark and vibrant recently married to a friend of mine martin wells but here for a reason i could not fathom her brown eyes were pools of sorrow i said where's mart haven't seen him around for a while the wine-glass in her fingers cracked at the stem her eyes grew mad martin's been ill she whispered then he shot himself at seven this evening i left him lying in his blood my god mona what are you doing at--a party party her voice was the voice of an animal being tortured it was my invita- tion to join   when i tried to follow her she lost herself among the guests tt was all i could do to keep from run- ning berserk among the guests shak- ing them like rats to get the information i wanted they were all peopk in whose families there had been recent tragedy-- like mona had martin told her before he died  was that why he died  and where was bonny  did she know    too much too music came from the dim hallway and in the glittering drawing-room guests were dancing what a dance that was like the slow waltz of decaying corpses who had entered hell in evening dress i stood and watched vainly among them for a girl with tawny hair i felt a light tap on my shoulder and there stood the portly butler with mona wells white and shaken at his side mr amsterdam if you please i've re- ceived word that the initiation is to be- gin won't you come upstairs for your interview  we followed him up the winding old- fashioned staircase mona still refusing to look at me at the end of a corridor the butler swung open a door and deferential- ly waited for me to enter in here sir  i paused for the room was in darkness  dime mystery magazine then i shrugged my shoulders nothing much was left to lose  i passed the obsequious figure and went into darkness i heard the click of a lock behind me and footsteps fading down the hall i found a wall by groping and leaned against it a voice muffled as though it came through a filtered microphone said that will do nicely barry amsterdam you may stand as you are i answered who the hell are you my voice sounded grim as though it were echoing from wall to wall of that small room as though the room were a cata- comb    i am justice if you like a name the voice i told myself in spite of the stiff- ness of those short hairs at my nape must be human again that pestering gap it was a joke  i said as much this is not a joke the voice went on justice has long been due to you and your kind--parasites despoilers fatteners on the land there is in each of your lives or in the lives of those you pretend to love some crime too ugly for public knowledge but justice knows of course it was a human voice damnably human  that pestering thought at the back of my head was beginning to click  in a moment i'd have my finger on it i said what is this  blackmail  as though it had not heard me the muffled voice continued and you barry amsterdam  we have waited for you a long long time too long you have escaped the fate you merit but you will not escape now the thing had clicked i knew the name of the man behind that voice it had been so evident all along that i'd missed it exultantly i realized that at last i was one step ahead of him because i knew who he was and he didn't know i knew it i couldn't blurt it out now it might have been my death sentence to keep my voice steady i yelled so what  you will mail to the quadrangle club in the morning a check for one hundred thousand dollars you will shun the so- ciety of friends you will do our bidding come at our call and respond out of your generosity to any further call for funds the hell i will you will do these things or else the death that rots before it kills will come to bonny carter i shouted you dirty perverted mur- derer i wanted to hit something hard but you can't hit at a voice we are glad to accommodate with proof the voice slurred on then i had to grab at the wall because the floor started tilting under me like one of those crazy things at coney island i felt my- self slipping gently to a lower level in the building where there was light chapter four the scent of burning flesh i blinked a little i was in a sort of cage constructed by driving iron bars in a semicircle from floor to ceiling of a stone-walled room the back wall of the cage was the section of the floor that had just swung down at a height of ten feet there was a gap in the rails through which i had fallen and a sort of gate in front of me latched on the outside the room beyond my cage was large and rectangular and had a platform ex- tending across the far end a big machine something like a gigantic searchlight oc- cupied the left side of it wide cracks of light in the long wall to my left indicated a shut door there was a chair just in front of the camera-thing a wooden chair with leather straps about the legs and back i peered trying to find a sign of life in the purplish dimness far to the left in the shadows two figures gleamed luminously white i cried out in sheer horror at the sight of them corpses on parade   they were women nude bound upright to stone pillars one of them was bonny bands of ad- hesive covered her mouth had i found her--too late i went crazy mad tried to force the steel bars that kept me from her shouted insane chal- lenges to the thing that had done this to us two black-robed figures stepped from behind the machine one of them stood guard over the helpless women it was hooded and i recognized it as the thing that had spirited bonny out of her brother's coffin that had taunted me a few minutes ago in the dark room i was cold with despair because i knezv who he was i knew but my knowledge had come too late--i could do nothing and bonny in deadly danger    the other figure was not hooded--it was the club's butler he descended from the platform and walked toward me com- ing to a stop just out of reach of my arms his robe fell open a little and i caught a glimpse of the heavy automatic that netled in its holster under his shoulder god i thought if i could only get my hands on that gun for thirty seconds the butler said sir the master wishes you to witness an exhibition he trusts it will bring you around to his way of thinking he retreated and while my heart went berserk in my throat i saw him unbind one of the struggling nude figures and strap her to the plain wooden chair not bonny thank god the girl fac- ing that evil-looking macfline was mona wells like a demon lecturer explaining his lantern slides the butler continued suavely mrs wells has aiso refused to accede to our wishes she has one more chance before we accomplish her end--a little prematurely to be sure mona shrieked in horror i won't do itl you can't make me you murdering fiends you got martin didn't you well you can send me after him as though it were a step in a routine the butler opened that door on the left wall   light flooded the chamber there behind a network of iron bars like the door to a prison their foul white saces mad with hatred of the fiend who had destroyed them stood the legion of the cursed--the rotting beyond them i saw the sad but still-human faces of the others mrs wells said the butler will do nicely for your education mr amster- dam he stepped behind the machine i heard a whirring sound and there was a sudden blinding flash of light accom- panied by the sickening smell of burnt flesh mona shrieked again god i'll hear those shrieks in a dream the night before i die it had happened that was all it took a whirring sound a flash of light and you --started to rot i joined her shrieks over and over again i screamed at the hooded monster and the inhuman butler you damned swine you damned swine mona's voice died to a whine and be- came silent she slumped in her bonds the butler undid her straps and led her back to the pillar and tied her up again her head slumped forward on her chest --she was unconscious i hoped that she was dead the butler glanced at her once and then came over and stood near my cage--a httle nearer than before i could have almost reached out and touched him a sudden inspiration flashed through my mind it was a slim and desperate chance    but it might work if only i could get him one step closer    the rotting corpses who once were my friends were silent now behind their bars --silent with hopeless terror and despair the hooded figure turned toward me an unholy chuckle escaped from un- der the hood do you see your friends  dime mystery magazine now barry amsterdam  do you see them as they are as you will be soon their bodies are rotting now even as their souls rotted long ago it is justice and they are afraid of justice they are afraid of me those who have not yet felt the power of my--for want of a better name shall be call it radium x-ray--treat- ment know that their time to face it will surely come they don't know me barrv amster- dam these sons and daughters of the four hundred i am only one of the forty mil- lion but they are afraid of me they know that they are safe only so long as they obey me they cannot escape for no matter where they go i can follow them --because they don't know who i am i can sit beside them on the train or drink with them at their houses and they will not know that justice has overtaken them they will never know--until it is too late and their souls are roasting in hell he stopped suddenly and gestured toward bonny perhaps another demon- stration will convince you barry amster- dam that it is better to submit to me she no longer has any money so she can no longer obey my commands it is time for her to meet the death her rotten soul de- serves it had come i could wait no longer the single card i held must be played--a slim last desperate hope    i shouted no one else may know you now    but i know you--duke livingstone the hooded figure uttered a roar of rage and sprang toward his fiendish ma- chine the butler his face white with sudden fear took an involuntary step toward me--started to draw his pistol this was what i had hoped for at the same moment i had shouted duke liv- ingstone's name i thrust ray arms through the bars of my cage my hands clasped behind the butler's neck and with the strength of a madman i jerked his head toward me there was the sodden crunch of flesh and bone meeting hard iron and the butler's form went slack in my arms duke livingstone had halted momen- tarily in astonishment at my sudden action and that hesitation was all i needed hold- ing the unconcious butler against the bars with one arm my other hand darted to his half-drawn automatic i fired two quick shots duke spun heavily reeled back a half- dozen paces and slumped to the floor i fired three more shots into his twitching body it jerked convulsively and then was still    as the echos of the shots died away there was absolute silence for a few sec- onds i heard a high-pitched voice scream the butler has the keys and then all hell broke loose shrieking imprecations and crying for me to free them so that they might tear their former tormentors to pieces the mob of living corpses beat fran- tically at the iron bars of their prison while the yet untainted were almost hys- terical with joy i found the keys but before freeing the others i released bonny and held my coat about her head as we hurried from that hellish room so that she could not see the sickening and ghoulish fate of duke liv- ingstone and the butler    i suppose it drove him crazy i explained to the reduced group of friends who had survived he was always saying that it got him knowing the things he knew about people he was a devil moaned jane an- ders grant's sister he got judge rainey's wife to keep the police off us he played husband against wife mother against child he was a ghoul we mustn't talk about it bonny whispered barry take me home she nestled against me in the car barry i tried to save you that's why yesterday when i caught a glimpse of you corpses on parade  from the car i showed myself hoping you'd follow me if you couldn't rescue me at once i thought at least you'd see that the mess was far too loathsome for you to bother with my arm wound tighter about her you thought that would keep me away bonny didn't you know i loved youi thought for a moment of the inanity of women and of the courage of this one but bonny i said why did you leave my apartment the night i left you with suki  she shuddered slightly duke living- stone called and told me andy was alive that he'd seen him he seemed to think i knew more about it that he did so i didn't think anything was wrong till i found myself his prisoner he kept me gagged most of the time   i swore softly at the dead    if i'd only realized what i should have realized a little earlier i might at least have saved poor mona wells it kept bothering me what the tie-up was between the quad- rangle club and the horrors i was help- less before it dawned on me that duke was the tie-up he had to be the man it was he who'd suggested it to me in the first place if it hadn't been for duke there just wouldn't have been a tie-up--either in my mind or in the newspapers i won- der why he didn't try to keep it a secret  duke wanted his scheme to have pub- licity because i imagine he was about ready to close operations in new york with thea rainey dead he couldn't stave off an investigation much longer and when the investigation started he'd be out from under then he meant to give the horror as much front page space as pos- sible so that when he started operations elsewhere under the same disguise people would be afraid of him he meant to use you barry either as a victim or an ally if you'd been fright- ened off at the graveyard--if you hadn't come to the club--you'd have been his chief character witness at an investiga- tion but you came barry--and you saved all of us who were left to save i had been nodding as she explained and suddenly i felt that my head wasn't going to nod any more at my volition i was really faint i pulled up to a curb ex- plained and let bonny take the wheel dearest what's the matter  she asked anxiously i said that darned clout on the head i took last night wonder if i should have it x-rayed no she almost shrieked at me don't--even--think of that word again    i had it x-rayed nevertheless but there wasn't anything wrong except a bump bonny doesn't know about that our home life is about as harmonious as things human can be but--i hope and pray neither of us needs an x-ray again be- cause i still remember the look in bonny's violet eyes when i mentioned the word the end the river styx we americans are an incredulous people we do not like to believe in anything we cannot see or touch when something occurs that we cannot quite understand or account for we are only too likely to shrug it off as being impossible and forget about it as quickly as we can  yet who among us can understand the common everyday facts of life or death we like to think of ourselves as being a progressive people -- as possessing greater knowledge and wisdom than ever man had before yet many of our modern discoveries and inventions were common- place in the great civilizations that flour- ished while we were but half-naked savages roaming the vast forests with no thought but to keep our bellys full it is a strange and somewhat awesome thought men who have spent their en- tire lives among the meager ruins that are all that these ancient races have left to us say that we have no more than tapped the secrets of their lost sciences and forgotten powers--that the greatest wonders of the past are still hidden from us what happened to these once magnifi- cent cities  did any of their peoples escape whatever dreadful scourge it was that could so suddenly and so completely de- stroy a whole civilization no one knows   but it seems probable that a few must have survived and that these mis- erable wretches fleeing to distant lands mingled with the roaming savage tribes and passed on to them some of their secret powers  still in some of the des- olate out-of-the-way fastnesses of this vast continent there are small bands of indians whose legends tell of how the gods came to them eons ago and taught them their mysteries and whose fearful rites are traceable to no known source they are different from other indians and the very few men who have pene- trated their strongholds--and have re- turned alive--have told such fantastic tales of the eerie and occult powers of their priests and chiefs that not so very long ago these brave men would have been burned as witches  in the may issue of dime mys- tery magazine j o quinliven takes us to the home of one of these strange tribes whose murderous rites and ancient

  but doctor kelland didn't need car- dell's answering sardonic chuckle to asure him that the heartless demon was in fact quite capable of operating on his daughter without giving her an anasthetic

unable to restrain himself in the tide of grief and terror which overwhelmed him doctor kelland cried out helen oh god helen-- the girl looked toward him where he sat in the shadows yes father she murmured her mind still cloyed with the last effects of the anasthetic then a movement at her side caused the girl to turn her head and her eyes fell on the fantastic figure of cardell great heavens carlos she exclaimed what are you doing in that costume the evil smile on the young man's face deepened i doubt whether you would understand my dear he said put it down to a perverted taste for the the- atrical i am about to indulge myself in a rare pleasure--that of arousing cer- tain emotions which in another man are gratified with comparative ease but which it my case require rather powerful stim- ulae as he finished speaking cardell took a gleaming scalpel from die small table at his side and bent over helen's defense- less body the girl's tortured writhings were held firmly in check by the cruelly tight straps which bound her to the table her screams which all her fortitude was un- able to repress as the fiendish surgeon's knives bit into the sensitive nerves of her knee blended with doctor kelland's help- less desperate cursing then finally she fainted and although the satanic gleam of pleasure faded from cardell's eyes as she did so he kept working until the operation was finished and the wound closed and bandaged then he carefully prepared a new plaster cast and encased the girl's leg in it before she regained consciousness the operation was over but this as doctor kelland knew only too well was just the beginning cardell had performed the operation to provide himself with an alibi after the bodies had been unearthed from the wreckage of  dime mystery magazine their car he would tell of their visit to his mountain home for the purpose of having the operation performed on helen's knee the testimony of kelland's servants and the condition of the knee itself would substantiate his story cardell straightened and under the weird red light which poured down on him from above he was the picture of satan incarnate he grinned at kelland and then turned his eyes ablaze now with unholy lust on the girl lying stretched on the operating table his hands slid lasciviously over her nude helpless body bestowing unspeakable caresses it's a pity such beauty must be de- stroyed my dear he murmured soon i shall have to open your white skin and let your bright blood flow away and that will bring me far greater ecstasy than the kisses you would never give to me but first you shall give me something else --whether you desire it or not    but perhaps before it is over you will de- sire it   he was bending over the girl press- ing his body against hers caressing her with a growing fever of passion when suddenly his movements were arrested by a cry of mingled despair and rage from doctor kelland for god's sake man if you are foul enough actually to go through with this thing at least have the decency to kill me first slowly cardell arose from the body of his victim the diabolical leer on his face deepening as he gazed toward the shad- ow-shrouded wall

he spoke cardell picked up a scalpel and started walking toward the bound and helpless figure sitting against the west wall but doctor kelland was hardly aware of his approach within the past five minutes he had discovered an un- stoppered bottle of carbolic acid standing on a shelf next to him and he had con- ceived an almost hopelessly desperate plan almost hopelessly desperate--yet it represented the sole chance of saving helen from this unspeakable demon as cardell came close to him doctor kelland suddenly bent his head sideways gripped the neck of the carbolic acid bot- tle in his teeth and raised it to his mouth cardell fearing that he was about to lose a cherished victim through suicide sprang forward with an angry cry as he did so doctor kelland allowed the bottle to fall from his mouth to crash onto the floor and the next instant spewed a mouthful of terrible acid into cardeh's face the man's agonized shriek was joined by the old surgeon's horrible choked coughing the acid was burning away the lining of his mouth searing his tongue and soft palate helen from her operat- ing table had been able to turn her head enough to see the desperate performance and she cried out wordlessly to her father cardell shrieking and cursing tore madly at his eyes with both hands he staggered fell to the floor clawed his way to his feet again and went blundering

struggle weakly against the ropes which held him to his chair he was half in- sensible with pain and he knew that he had won only a temporary victory over his satanic opponent cardell would still be able to grope his way about enough to find them as soon as his pain had sub- sided and he would surely kill them even though he would be unable to carry out his plan of wrecking their car and thus directing suspicion away from himself as though in confirmation of his worst fears cardell presently stumbled blindly to his feet he pawed his way to he in- strument stand beside the operating table and picked up a scalpel he raised his head then and his face was a horror of seared flesh and bloody sightless eyes he grinned with a ghastly grimace that's right doctor he whis- pered hoarsely keep

that his hour had indeed struck he was utterly unable to control the terrible coughs and groans which his pain wrenched from his body cardell guided by the sounds would find him--and after that he

page  he suddenly flung himself forward as though no longer able to curb his fero- cious impatience and began slashing out with the scalpel the first blow ripped through the old practitioner's coat sleeve and the next found a mark in his side he flinched as he felt the hot sting of the steel and car- dell giving vent to an animal grunt of sat- isfaction went on slashing wildly his face contorted into a mask of fiendish pleasure then suddenly doctor kelland felt one of the ropes that bound his arms to his body give way one of cardell's wild slashes had severed it and kelland found that his right arm was almost free he began immediately to push forward on the rope which hound his upper arm against his body and as cardell buried the scalpel in his left shoulder the old surgeon suddenly freed his entire right arm the pain of his shoulder wound stung him to cnergetic action he swung out savagely and struck the blood-thirsting beast who was cutting him to pieces square on the point of the jaw the blow caught the younger man off balance his feet slipped on the glazed tiling and he crashed down striking his head with an audible crack against the corner of a surgical cabinet doctor kelland freed himself from the remainder of his bonds in less than a min- ute then he was at his daughter's side slicing with a scalpel through the straps which held her just as cardell began to stir again kelland lifted her with a super- human effort and carried her into the hall- way and out to the car which awaited them in the driveway--the car which was to have become their coffin depositing

escaping victims doctor kelland meshed the gears and steered the car out onto the main road five miles away was the state hospital there he could obtain relief from the burning agony of his mouth the throb- bing hurt of his wounds he would not be able to talk or eat anything but liq- uids for months but the time would come when again he could take his place in the operating room wielding the knife
