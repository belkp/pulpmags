derek van erp looked at her his blue eyes were very intent she always had the feeling that he could read exactly what'she was thinking you were expecting some one else weren't you sorry i'm not the person but won't i do fran adored the fit of his suit and his spats and his cane and the gray gloves he held so nonchalantly in his left hand if bill would only dress like that but bill was the sort of fellow who thought putting on a clean collar more than once a week was effeminate it's really after hours mr van erp fran said primly but since i'm here is there anything i can get for you he smiled you could get me a million dollars perhaps or happi- ness or love he said the last word very low fran s cheeks went pink she al- most forgot she was in love with bill whenever mr van erp came into the store mr van erp made her  street amp smith's love story magazine feel queer and breathless as though she had been running a long race and was just in sight of the goal impulsively she spoke why you don't have to wish for things you have everything money posi- tion her voice trailed away the smile died out of mr van erp's eyes i have nothing he exclaimed bitterly my wealth consists of forty dollars in cash i got that by selling my entire ward- robe the clothes i have on are all i have left material possessions that is of course i possess a broken heart if that could be classed as an asset and i'mustn't forget cranky old uncle laurence he's despised me all my life if he knew i was going in for carnival life what a laugh he'd get fran gripped the edge of the counter you mean you're broke mr van erp really broke a rich important man like you derek looked ill at ease sorry i flared out i didn't mean to but i've been pretending so long that it was a relief to tell the truth for a change fran felt a queer constricted sen- sation around her heart the wax- works figures you've been buying you don't mean- oh mr van erp i thought of course you were joking you couldn't intend to have a wax-works show at coney a a social-register fellow like you her eyes were swimming with tears derek didn't notice he was touching the tip of his well-polished shoe with the ferrule of his cane i could cadge from my friends i suppose or depend on invitations at house parties to see me through or go down on my knees to uncle lau- rence but that sort of thing never appealed somehow no this is better the van erps bequeathed me just one legacy a wax-works show those dusty broken figures have been stacked for years in the van erp attic now i'm going to make them support me i never would have fixed those figures if i'd thought you were in earnest cried fran i imagined of course that you were going to have some sort of party using the wax figures derek looked straight into her eyes nice of you to be so wor- ried about me little golden-haired girl i love it i eat it up espe- cially since another blonde sent me back my ring the minute she knew the market had wiped me out now i want to ask a favor of you i've just two things left in this world the wax works and my pride to- night i'm dropping out of my old world disappearing none of my friends are ever going to know that derek van erp is a wax-works pro- prietor silly of me of course but i'd go to any lengths to keep any- body from knowing so will you keep my secret for me golden girl confusedly fran murmured of course i'll never tell mr van erp cross my heart but you don't know anything about coney island why i'll bet you ve never even been out there don't bet or you'll lose i've haunted the place for weeks three days ago i bought my location and moved the figures out last night i opened he frowned not much business yet fran thought back you bought an abraham lincoln and a napo- leon didn't you from us i mean he nodded and you fixed marie antoinette's face and mc- kinley's leg and julius cassar's neck they look as good as new fran looked away mr krause charged you top price because he extra sheer  thought you were rich i'm so sorry if we'd known mr van erp seemed to grow taller i'm not yet accepting char- ity he said stiffly what i buy i pay for hastily fran asked what is it you want to-day mr van erp he drew a small package out of his coat pocket i came for ad- vice i didn't like the cotton stock- ings marie antoinette was wearing so i got these but i wasn't at all sure of the size and the clerk said they could t be returned if they were tried on even by a wax figure so will you see if they're correct fran took out a pair of extra- sheer pearl-gray stockings she caught her breath they're lovely she cried unconsciously her tone was wistful and i'm sure they'll fit she caressed the stockings gently with the tips of her fingers fran wore service hose they lasted longer suddenly she looked at derek mr krause said that if you came into the store you were to have a chinese mandarin we have in the basement she said recklessly mak- ing up the story as she went along we-we give a sort of bonus to our best patrons it- it's on the house oh derek exclaimed that that's rather liberal isn't it the chinese mandarin had been in the basement for two years mr krause had taken it on consign- ment and the owner had never re- turned for the figure mr krause had forgotten it was even there the gift of the figure might make up in some measure for the over- charging mr krause had done fran thought the figure is in the storeroom i'll get it fran added derek insisted on following her down into the cluttered dusty stor- age basement the one dust-cov- ered light in the place went out

with his other hand fran stood quite still his touch was like fire on her wrist fire that went straight to her heart and made it thud wildly unconsciously she swayed toward derek the top of her head brushed his chin soft strands of hair caressed his cheek she heard the swift intake of his breath then he caught her close in his arms he held her for a pul- sating palpitating second fran gasped like a child she lifted her lips to his derek's mouth closed down swiftly his kiss was like a brand binding her to him forever fran hadn't known a kiss could be like that bill's kisses stirred her but never like this her lips grew warm her breath caught in her throat with a little sobbing sound instantly derek released her i had no right to do that he said slowly fran couldn't reply she stood motionless while her lips kept on thrilling to the magic of a kiss such as she had never known before derek found his flashlight the round glow showed a jumble of waxen arms and legs and old cos- tumes mr krause wasn't noted for his neatness in the center of the mêlée was the mandarin he stood with his arms proudly folded he was incrusted with dust and cobwebs formed a gray veil over his face but he was an imposing figure none the less there said fran huskily that's the mandarin  street amp smith's love story magazine the mandarin wasn't very big he reached only to derek's shoul- der but it was rather difficult to get the figure up the narrow steep stairs derek backed up the stairs carrying the figure while fran held the flashlight fran wasn't paying any attention to where she was go- ing and the first thing she knew there was a disheartening sound of a rip and she knew her right stock- ing had caught on a projecting nail with difficulty she bit back the an- gry ejaculation which welled to her lips once upstairs in the store again they cleaned off the mandarin and found that the figure was in perfect condition derek's delight was boundless thirteen is my lucky number he exulted and this makes the thirteenth figure for my collection i can't help but succeed with this he had evidently forgotten all about the kiss but fran hadn't her lips kept tingling treacherously you'd better go wash your hands in the back of the shop fran said in a matter-of-fact tone it was when derek came back debonair as ever that he saw the rip in fran's stocking fran assured him that it didn't matter at all but derek was abject if you hadn't gone down to get the mandarin for me this never would have hap- pened i've got to make it up to you somehow his eyes stared at the cobweb-sheer stockings destined for marie antoinette the very thing he cried marie can get along with her cot- ton hose who cares but these were intended for you he crammed the stockings into fran's protesting hands bill came into the store just then fran took one look at his gloomy face and her cheeks flamed red she put the stockings behind her with a betraying gesture bill went on glaring fran explained that derek was a customer she explained too vehemently in her agitation bill s mouth dragged down farther at the corners the way it always did when bill got jealous fran looked appealingly at derek van erp derek drew on his gloves he went to the door and hailed a taxi motioning for the fellow to come in thank you more than i can say for the mandarin miss fran he said gently then with his cane he gestured toward the small belliger- ent figure of the chinese put that in the cab if you please gee muttered the taximan but he gingerly approached the man- darin just the same i shall let you know if the man- darin brings me luck said derek going out the door i shall give myself the pleasure of giving you a punch in the nose growled bill when he was quite sure the taxi was gone then he jerked fran's hands forward and looked at the stockings before fran guessed what he was about he struck her across the face with the flat of his hand that'll teach you not to be a little flirt and take presents from men like him fran put her hand to her face she stared at bill who had suddenly become a stranger a terrifying stranger you- you didn't wait for me to explain did you she said very slowly what explanation is there when a fellow like him gives stock- ings to a girl like you there s just one answer fran's eyes were misted with an- gry tears and just what kind of girl am i bill she demanded extra sheer  you never set the day for our wedding all the crowd we go with know that we re engaged so i'm poison to all the men you ve put your brand on me bill yet you never talk about our getting married bill didn't look so angry now he had the grace to seem ashamed i'm sorry fran but you know what a temper i've got i can't help flaring out sometimes was there a smug hint of satis- faction that his temper was so bad fran listening with ears that criti- cized thought there was bill took fran into his arms a girl as pretty as you has to be care- ful what kind of presents she takes from men he mumbled then his lips closed down over hers always before fran had liked bill's kisses she had been afraid when he kissed her but still she liked being kissed now something had made a difference impatiently she drew away aw don't be like that fran i'm sorry i've begged your pardon  street amp smith's love story magazine and you'll admit i had plenty of provocation come on give us a kiss then we'll go out and eat i've found a swell place where they only charge forty cents for a whole dinner fran shut her eyes and let him kiss her that's more like my girl said bill when he let her go come on let's go i'm starved fran exhibited the tear in her stocking i can't go like this i got this rip in my stocking going downstairs for that figure for mr van erp that's why he gave me this pair go out and get me some stockings bill so i can change bill looked uncomfortable oh come along nobody'll notice if you've got a run we're not going anywhere except to eat anyway stubbornly fran shook her head i won't go out in the street looking like this either you get me a new pair of stockings or else- oh put those on if you're going to be so fussy bill exclaimed test- ily but for the love of pete let's get going so after all fran wore marie antoinette's stockings when she came out of the little back room where she had donned the stockings her cheeks were flying danger signals of red but bill didn't notice the restaurant's just around the next corner he said funny we never noticed it before i don't think it's queer fran retorted when they got there i won't go in i hate stuffy smoky dirty places like that and you know it all right buy your own dinner then if you're too ritzy to come in here with me deliberately he went into the res- taurant leaving fran on the pave- ment outside fran bit her lip tears stung her eyes bill and she were always having quarrels like this sordid affairs that made her feel cheap and ashamed slowly she walked along the street there was a tea shop at the corner a quiet place with black-painted tables and orange can- dles that gave a romantic atmos- phere fran went in and sat at a table near the door she stared at the menu with eyes that did not see the waitress did not come for some time while fran waited the door opened noisily bill came in he slammed the door behind him and stamped over to fran's table he sat down opposite her you're a nice one walking out on me like this he growled fran drew a deep breath bill i can't stand this sort of thing any longer she gasped we've been engaged for six months and we fight all the time there isn't a day that we don't quarrel about something bill it's cheap and common to fight the way we do what's the matter with us bill said honey i love you so usually when he said that fran thrilled way down to her toes this time she shook her head you've shut me up often enough saying things like that this time love-making won't do we've got to talk matters over just then the waitress came without consulting fran bill gave the order that was his usual cus- tom fran paid no heed you never set the day for our wedding she persisted i'm en- gaged to you all the crowd we go with know that so i'm poison to all the men you've put your brand on me bill yet you never talk about our getting married extra sheer  his eyes smoldered so that's it you're sore because folks know you're engaged to me so you can't flirt well i'd call that pretty low if you ask me fran shook her head you don't understand bill if you and i got along all right i'd stay engaged to you forever and not even want to look at another man but we fight and she hesitated summoning her courage i'm not sure but i don't think i love you any more bill maybe i did love you once but now- her voice died away before the fury in his face so that's it is it giving me the run-around because a swell pays you a little attention don't you know that his sort considers you on a par with a doormat something to wipe his feet on that isn't so fran said in a choked voice oh then you do like him so that is it all right take him then i'm through the food came and they ate at least fran supposed she ate there was a big lump in her thoat and her heart felt frozen sorry i can't give you back your engagement ring she jerked out but since you never gave me one i can't very well how could i give you a ring i'm not a millionaire like your pre- cious van erp he's no millionaire either he's broke poorer than you or me but he's not whining not much he's going to run a side show at coney island that s the kind of fellow he is the minute fran had spoken she would have given anything to call back the sentences but it was too late bill's eyes looked intent inter- ested so he's going to run a side show is he a wax works i suppose or he wouldn't have been hanging around the store i don't know what'sort of a show lied fran but it was too late i wonder what'sam krause would say if he knew you were get- ting so thick with this van erp and turning down his own nephew or maybe you ve forgotten that it was sam krause that introduced you and me my uncle sam krause he looked at her intently fran had a scared feeling that seemed to be all over her body i suppose you mean my job she whispered slowly just that bill leaned across the table don't be a little fool fran fran laid down her fork funny she laughed jerkily it's taken a lot for me to see what you really are bill krause an awful lot all week i've known that you were meeting sadie small on the quiet while i waited for you but i wouldn't let myself know that be- cause i didn't want to i thought i loved you you see to-night for the first time in my life i see you as you'really are common jealous cheap two-timing stingy low so we re through bill through for good and if you want to take my job away go ahead i'll get an- other blindly fran went to the door and tugged it open blindly she hurried along the street she walked until she was weary then she saw a subway kiosk she dived down the stairs and fumbled in her purse for a nickel once inside the turn- stile she took the train bound for coney island all the long jolting way out there she thought about bill a curtain of tears was on her lashes she was  street amp smith's love story magazine weeping for the love that had never really existed it took quite a while to find the tiny place labeled the wax works of history a man was feebly speiling outside in a lacka- daisical manner no one was near fran tendered her dime to him and went inside derek van erp was sitting on a box his face buried in his hands at her step he jumped up oh he said you his face was alight with pleasure shyly fran said i thought i'd come out and see how the mandarin stood the trip derek smiled he's the best ex- hibit i have miss fran i'm be- ginning to think that a man has to be born to this side-show business i don't seem to have quite the hang of it yet you see not a soul has come in since we opened i came in said fran there was a queer little electric silence yes you came re- peated derek that's the very nicest thing that's happened to me since everything went to smash do you'really feel like that asked fran she was gripping one hand with the other tightly i'm glad because i've come out to to take a job with you a job gasped derek but but i haven't any money i can't pay you enough i have some money saved up said fran stoutly she looked around the long narrow room was par- titioned off into twelve compart- ments in the twelve spaces were set wax figures faintly reminiscent of a fancy-dress ball cassar wear- ing a toga morgan in a pirate's doublet and hose cleopatra re- clining on a divan daniel in the lions den george washington about to chop down a cherry tree william tell with an apple in his hand florence nightingale in a nurse's garb marie antoinette co- quettishly displaying her cotton stockings abraham lincoln poca- hontas king george president mc- kinley and the mandarin they look quite all right don't they derek asked following the line of her gaze his tone was anx- ious they- they're hopeless fran exclaimed absolutely hopeless of course no one would come in here not a chance people only come to a wax works to get the blue jim- mies blue jimmies yes nightmares horrors they want to see blood all over everything famous characters who have murdered folks with axes and things fran was almost tearful george washington murdered a cherry tree with a hatchet derek s smile was wry wouldn't that do fran struck her hands together lightly i've an idea derek we're going to make a success of this thing she was so excited she didn't notice she had called him by his first name we'll call this place the cham- ber of horrors and when people get inside they'll shudder with ter- ror go out and rustle up a couple of cans of good bright-red paint after that get me a needle and thread and a pair of scissors and tell that half-dead individual out there to stop barking he's through for the night then as derek blinked in sur- prise hurry we have so little time fran awoke the next morning to a feeling of pleasant anticipation extra sheer  she lay in bed too lazily content to move presently the unfamiliarity of her surroundings shocked her into complete wakefulness she was in a tiny room spartan- like in its severity she lay on a hard cot scrupulously clean near her was a kitchen chair a mirror was tacked to the wall beneath was a shelf with a basin containing water fran sat up with a jerk clasping her knees with her interlaced fingers what under heaven had happened to her own room some one knocked at the door a masculine voice called fran do hurry and dress i'm afraid to stay alone any longer with these horrors they make my blood run cold then fran remembered she laughed aloud coming she cried it had been a task transforming derek's stiff galaxy of figures into a chamber of horrors she and derek had worked till three o'clock in the morning time raced by fran hurried into her clothes washing in the small tin basin combing the tangles out of her hair with her pocket comb derek had wanted to taxi her home at three in the morning she wouldn't hear of that and derek wouldn't let her go home alone there was a deadlock finally derek suggested diffidently that she could stay in the back room of the museum while he bunked with the living skeleton in the freak museum next door gladly fran consented so weary was she that she fairly fell into bed but she couldn't sleep for a while she kept thinking about two men bill and derek derek and bill when she finally slept she dreamed of the two good morning she said shyly coming into the museum some- how she hadn't remembered how tall and good-looking derek was he bent and took both her hands in his i never can'thank you enough for taking my dead wax works and turning the place into a shambles his mouth laughed but his eyes were very earnest fran blushed but of course i can't let you quit your job and come out to work for me that would be an imposition on my part besides there's that boy friend of yours fran said quickly things do look grand don't they she walked around examining the different exhibits president mc- kinley was now a bartender in a sa- loon scene they had put an apron around his middle clad him in a workingman's shirt and smudged his face with charcoal caesar dressed in modern attire was a gun- man with a revolver in his hand menacing florence nightingale now an entertainer in the place next to this was a chinese scene the mandarin pointed a long fin- ger nail at an unfortunate coolie whose head was on the block over him bent a bloodthirsty figure with a hatchet in his upraised hand they had turned the executioner's face away lest his resemblance to one george washington be too marked in derek's room lay the powdered wig and the blue satin suit previ- ously worn by the figure marie antoinette was walking through streets running with blood daniel was having a gory time in the lions den that was as far as fran got in her examination of the museum derek stepped in front of her he tilted her chin with his forefinger and looked deep into her eyes i want to tell you something he said you're the grandest girl i've ever  street amp smith's love story magazine known and the most beautiful they stood quite still gazing at each other fran felt a tingling of her spine she trembled suddenly the moment was gone come on let's eat said derek briskly over their bacon and eggs derek said something else that fran was to remember always funny how some people are friends the minute you first meet them it was like that with me when i first saw you fran tried to reply but the words stuck in her throat she just sat looking at him pretty swell i'must say fran's head went up with a jerk bill she gasped bill krause was standing next to the little white-topped table so engrossed were they that neither she nor derek had noticed bill as he came into the restaurant bill's face was horrible he looked as if he hadn't slept his extra sheer  eyes glowered hatefully and his mouth was a thin white line so you spent the night with this side-show punk did you after all your touch-me-not ways with me he hurled the words at fran like so many handfuls of mud out here last night i watched out- side the place neither of you came out and here you are having breakfast together what more proof do you want derek moved so swiftly that afterward fran couldn't believe bill's face was horrible his eyes glowered hatefully so you spent the night with this side-show punk did you after all your touch-me-not ways with me he hurled the words at fran like so many handfuls of mud bill gasped fran she felt faint and sick derek's eyes narrowed he got up leisurely one more word and i'll knock you down he said slowly bill took a step backward you can't shut me up i followed fran that she had seen right bill sprawled on the floor with a sur- prised expression on his good-look- ing sulky face derek looked at the knuckles of his right hand you'd better apologize to miss fran for this brawl he said quietly fran's eyes were glazed with tears please go derek she touched his sleeve with her finger tips let me talk to him alone but- began derek gazing down at bill  street amp smith's love story magazine please she repeated tremu- lously i'll be right outside said derek grimly call if you want me he paid the check for the breakfast and stalked out he walked up and down like a sentry outside the win- dow fran noticed that bill took plenty of time about getting to his feet derek was outside by the time bill faced her bill laughed hysterically so you're the girl i thought was straight fran sighed wearily bill are you crazy i stayed all night in the back room at the mu- seum derek bunked with the liv- ing skeleton next door bill glared at her from bloodshot eyes that's a new one the liv- ing skeleton what do you take me for anyhow haven't i been through enough i tramped back and forth in front of that cursed side show all night long i'm about crazy his voice broke fran looked at the man polishing glasses in the back of the restaurant no one else was around bill you've got this all wrong bill came close i should kill you you'deserve it but i love you so i'm going to keep you straight for the rest of your life if i have to keep you shut up in one room we re getting married you and me right now so at last you've said what i've been waiting to hear for six months i've waited now when you do speak it's too late fran's face was very grave bill i'meant what i told you last night you and i are through will he marry you bill's eyes glared into hers it isn't a question of marrying i- i thought so well you'd better do some tall thinking you're out of a job my uncle won't let you come back no recommendation either bill's tone gloated so you'd better take me up on my offer pretty darned quick go away said fran slowly before i begin to loathe you bill's breath came whistling through set teeth he caught her wrists and twisted them his hands hurt derek came dashing into the lunch room his face was furious bill let go of fran and dodged out of derek's way better be sen- sible he advised fran over his shoulder as he fled down the street derek came over to fran if that beast had hurt you- his voice wasn't very steady fran gasped i don't believe i thanked you for the nice break- fast derek's face cleared he smiled down into her eyes did i ever happen to mention that you're the grandest girl in the world he asked softly at two o'clock people began crowding around the chamber of horrors attracted by the crimson skull and crossbones fran had painted here said fran taking the roll of tickets from derek i'll sell these while you tell people about things inside the museum oh i couldn't let you do that fran you've done so much al- ready i- here's my dime and i'd like to go into this-here place if you two could decide which one of you is going to sell tickets broke in a woman s harsh voice fran pulled a ticket from the roll and pocketed the dime she smiled ls-e extra sheer  at derek go along she whis- pered he patted her sleeve i'll get even later he promised then he disappeared into the museum all afternoon people straggled into the chamber of horrors but they didn't seem to be much im- pressed when they came out they announced loudly that the show was no good fran's heart contracted with fear what if the museum failed after all what would derek do then her hands went clammy cold about four o'clock business picked up crowds flocked in they came out chattering interestedly fran strained her ears to listen do you think king louis is real i don't he's just another wax figure but if you ask me i'd say he's cleverly made king louis but they had no figure of king louis there was no time to think about the matter people were arriving too fast fran made change with flying fingers by five thirty the cash box was full this is the zero hour miss said pete he was the new man they hired to ballyhoo might as well shut up shop for an hour fran nodded wearily she slipped down from the high booth where's the boss went on pete he hasn't as much as stuck his nose outside the pitch all afternoon i don't know said fran she was suddenly worried hastily she went into the museum at her entrance a weary figure in a blue satin suit and wearing a white periwig got hastily in posi- tion on his knees in front of marie antoinette marie antoinette was coquet- tishly lifting one corner of her skirt to display her shapely ankle just as fran had arranged but fran hadn't painted the sign which hung above her is king louis real five dollars to any one who can make any of our wax figures smile derek gasped fran king louis scrambled to his feet flexing his weary arms and legs as he did so i should have taken an easier position to-night i think i'll just try standing in front of marie but derek fran was staring at his face thickly incrusted with wax and paint i don't under- stand i wasn't sure it would work that's why i didn't tell you be- fore derek stretched again george washington's suit fits me beautifully doesn't it he went on as she still stared uncomprehend- ingly i did this mechanical-man stunt at all the college powwows it always brought down the house and people this afternoon fell for it like nobody's business they tried so hard to make me laugh that they put themselves into good humor i'll bet they bring all their friends and come back to-night and the best thing of all nobody could possibly recognize me under all this wax and paint derek nothing on earth is go- ing to keep you from succeeding her eyes were luminous with unshed tears derek shook his head not since i have to live up to you dear i sort of bucked at making a fool of myself in front of all these stran- gers it was different from making a little sport for my college pals and then i thought of you out there selling tickets i remembered that you had given up your good job and thrown in your lot with my un- certain fortunes that decided me ls-e  street amp smith's love story magazine fran's lips trembled he had called her dear i got fired she said slowly so this is really charity giving me a job you see i need a job and i need you derek mur- mured in an odd tone as fran sold tickets and made change that night she thought about derek and what he had said she was in love with him the knowledge came to her with the force of a blow in love with derek van erp and she had never guessed that was why she had at last realized that the thrill she felt over bill's dangerous kisses wasn't really love this new tide of feel- ing which swept over her was quite different it was something so won- derful that it took her breath away hello fran fran's thoughts stopped short bill she gasped with bill was a big burly policeman fran s heart came up in her throat and stayed there pete she said in an urgent un- dertone take the ticket booth for a minute will you pete climbed to the booth as she slipped down she drew bill a little distance from the museum now she gasped what do you want we want your mr van erp bill was smiling nastily fran caught her breath don't say his name so loud he calls him- self mr smith out here blandly the officer said what- ever he calls himself tis no concern of ours but i have a warrant for the arrest of the person who stole a wax figure out of mr sam krause's storeroom oh everything reeled dizzily about fran she clutched at the officer's arm but you can't do that the mandarin was an old fig- ure that just took up space mr krause offered it to anybody who would cany it away there was no question of stealing mr krause seems to think dif- ferently put in bill importantly fran turned on bill like a whirl- wind so this is the way you get even is it a low-down contemptible way you know darned well that mr krause wanted to get rid of that figure bill smiled nastily fran went on in a breathless tone all right have it your way if you want to but i was the one who took that wax figure from mr krause's storeroom serve your old john doe warrant on me let's have this over with bill stopped smiling and looked annoyed mr van erp is the thief he snapped i was the one who took the fig- ure repeated fran doggedly bill said a few words to the po- liceman in an undertone the offi- cer moved over to the corner and stood there bill pulled fran into a secluded corner his mouth met fran's in a kiss that was degrading and frightening finally he stopped kissing her you've got into my blood he cried hoarsely i didn't know how crazy i was about you till i found out you'd fallen for this high-hat chap but you'll never get him see not if i have to kill both of you to keep you apart fran struggled to free herself from his hateful embrace his arms were like bands of steel about her i can have him put in jail for the theft of the mandarin it won't do any good for you to say you took the figure i'll swear -i saw him taking it from my uncle s shop fran gave a pitiful little groan besides i know this fellow's real extra sheer  name no smith business will go so i'll smear the van erp name he's so proud of over the front page of every dirty newsrag in town i'll see that he pays plenty for taking my girl fran clasped her hands oh no she gasped she remembered how she had given her word to derek that no one should ever know his real identity no you mustn't do that she repeated there might be a way this could be fixed bill s voice was insinuat- ing what instantly fran was tense she had a foreboding of something evil if you married me i'd pledge you my word that i'd forget all this van erp can hide down here in a moth- eaten museum till he dies for all i care fran swayed her knees seemed to buckle under her she remembered how derek had called her dear she thought of the expression in derek's eyes when he had told her she was his friend she couldn't let derek down not ever no price was too high to pay all right if you'll prom- ise faithfully that derek goes free fran felt sick and worn out bill s lips lingered on hers hatefully then he let her go fran stood quite still run- ning the back of her hand across her lips as if to wipe off his kiss meanwhile bill had gone to sum-mon the police officer sorry he fran was fum- bling her way out of the marriage- license bureau she blundered blindly into some one who was run- ning down the corridor fran fran darling i'm not too late you haven't married that rotter said importantly to the policeman the whole affair was a mistake  street amp smith's love story magazine just an error too bad i dragged you clear out here for nothing fran was shivering her head ached horribly the price of derek's pride was marrying bill she laughed hys- terically yesterday she might have thought that being married to bill was the grandest thing in the world to-day she knew better she saw bill with true eyes and what'she saw made her shudder let's hurry she gasped begin- ning to walk toward the subway she must get away before derek missed her don't you want to get your hat bill's voice seemed to come from a long way off what do i care about a hat fran was tramping resolutely along the ride into town was seemingly endless bill's hands were hot and possessive on her arm bill talked a great deal fran crouched against the seat she felt numb and queer i'll be by to-morrow morning at nine bill said when he left her at the door of her boarding house but let me tell you if you try to com- municate with this van erp fellow everything'll be all off and he'll go to jail don't forget that and re- member i'm being pretty forgiv- ing not every man would conde- scend to marry you after what's happened when fran was alone in her room she brushed her lips with her spread fingers whimpering like a child who has been hurt married married to bill oh she couldn't she threw herself face downward on the bed and wept finally ex- hausted she fell asleep it was eight o'clock when she woke stiff and unrefreshed from sleeping in her clothes numbly she undressed and bathed she couldn't think couldn't plan her mind seemed to have stopped slowly she put on her prettiest dress and her best slippers with shaking hands she rouged her pallid cheeks some one knocked at the door fran's hand flew to her heart had bill come already surely it wasn't time coming she said in an odd little scared voice she pulled her hat over her curls her feet stumbled as she went to the door bill kissed her till she went limp in his arms everything in the room whirled about crazily while fran fought to keep from screaming white he said in a satisfied tone i'm sure glad you're wearing white a regular bride fran whispered i don't love you you know that yet- yet you insist on this farce of a wed- ding bill's eyes darkened angrily stop that sort of talk he com- manded you're going to be my wife and my wife is going to do as she s told the marriage-license bureau was filled with people tremblingly fran followed bill into the room she felt as if she were marie an- toinette on the way to the guillotine fran looked at the people dazedly tall women seemed to marry little men and big men selected little girls old and young homely and pretty fran bit her lips and sank down onto the nearest chair you'll have to wait cackled the old man who was with a young gig- gling girl looks like people is still gettin married despite what the books and newspapers say fran felt as if there wasn't enough air in the room to breathe she twisted her fingers together she extra sheer  fought with all her will to keep from fainting derek she must remember that she was doing this for derek like to take a look at the morn- ing paper cackled the talkative old bridegroom-elect limply fran accepted the crum- pled sheet she held the newspaper for a time not even looking at it she was horribly aware of bill's shoulder against hers suddenly she felt bill stiffen he made a lunge for the newspaper but he was too late fran's eyes had caught a glimpse of the front page oh she gasped she snatched the paper away from bill's clutching hand on the front page was a picture derek in his king louis costume scion of wealthy house jailed was the heading under the picture of an interior shot of the museum was the text derek van erp steals wax figure beside that was an old snapshot of derek in his polo costume fran's eyes blurred with fury so you sold derek out any- way after you'd promised you're the next couple cackled the old fellow coming back with his license in his hand fran i can explain bill was licking his dry lips so can i fran's hand shot out and she slapped bill resoundingly across the face a startled gasp went over the room fran didn't notice she was fum- bling her way out of the place she was crying horribly she blundered blindly into some one who was run- ning pell-mell down the corridor fran fran darling loving arms closed about her fran i'm not too late you haven't married that rotter fran blinked back her tears derek she whispered his name she clung to him oh derek i didn't tell about you i would have died rather than have anybody find out i was going to marry bill to keep him from telling i- so that was it derek's voice was grim darling i've been tracing- no loitering in the halls if

the box he had in his coat pocket six pairs of cobweb stockings darling he said gleefully bought with an advance on my salary these stockings are your own sweet they don't belong to marie antoinette i adore you repeated fran their lips met in a long long kiss love's surety moonlight and a midsummer night and a garden full of flowers all filled with the mystic light found only in love's bowers

promise of a love whose might does not keep me guessing emma upton vaughn going primitive  by  marie hoyt the doorbell rang and delphine parker's movements suddenly became feverish she grabbed for her purse and hat took one last look in the mirror patted her hair expertly added just a bit more rouge and then satisfied snapped out the light she doubted if she had ever looked better well that was as it should be she'd probably never have another chance like this one she walked into the living room and at once the excited light in her eyes faded her face became absolutely expressionless h it s you tommy she said slowly i thought you were still at school came home for the holiday dell i thought maybe you'd be surprised to see me but i didn't ex- pect this tumultuous welcome i mean you could have controlled yourself a little better not shown such wild joy maybe even re- frained from leaping forward into my arms like this well- defensively- you could not expect me to have the band out when you didn't even tell me you were coming if you'd told me i could have saved the evening for you as it is i've got a date i gather as much from your opening remark somebody i know martin french  street amp smith's love story magazine tommy whistled softly not the martin french of the rotogravure sections and the wads of dough oh don't be nasty martin french is nice i wasn't being nasty where did you meet the gentleman he sits at one of my tables i suppose i'll be wasting my breath if i tell you his reputation is slightly n g you'll consider that i'm butting in or that i'm just plain jealous don't be silly nobody pays any attention to a man's reputation now- adays tommy's voice lost its bantering note delphine suddenly knew that he was in dead earnest and it won't do me any good to ask you not to go with him no it won't who gave you the right to pick my friends anyway well -quizzically- i love you dell and i've asked you to marry me doesn't that even give me the right to ask a favor and i've refused to marry you and i've told you i didn't love you you're no more to me than than the postman her anger went as suddenly as it had come oh tommy i didn't mean that not just that way you and i have always been friends and i hope we always will be friends but- but my ideas are old-fashioned and the place i live in is a small town and i'm still a college boy no money just prospects please don't make it sound worse than it is tommy the doorbell rang again tommy picked up his hat with a wry smile maybe if i go out now he said they'll be taking a picture of him for the papers and i'll get in it having the two men meet in the hall and having to introduce them made dell ill-at-ease but tommy did not linger and in a few minutes dell and martin french were driv- ing off in the big imported roadster she put tommy resolutely out of her mind this man was everything tommy was not this man could give his wife anything she wanted no matter how expensive it might be dell knew she had to make the most of this night with him if she wanted him and she did want him when modern girls wanted a man they did not sit back and wait for him to choose them they followed out some definite plan to gain his favor and in that one respect they were apt to be as successful as the royal northwest mounted martin french's age was inde- terminate due to the meticulous care he took of his face and skin the massages exercises and the other youth-saving devices which only the very rich have time for and can afford they had gone only a short dis- tance before martin turned off the main highway and entered the yard of a small country school the high snowbanks on each side of the high- way effectively hid the yard from any passer-by yet the yard itself was packed firm by many small feet so that there was not the slightest danger of the car getting stuck this move on martin's part took dell by surprise yet he reassured her by sinking back in his seat offering her a cigarette and lighting one for himself hope you don't mind he said in that lazy exciting voice of his driving between high piles of snow isn't much fun i don't like to drive anyway not when there's some- body like you to talk to you know i've got a lot to find out about you i don't know a thing except what my eyes and my heart tell me going primitive  and what's that dell smiled my eyes tell me you're the most beautiful girl i've ever seen the most fascinating i've ever met and my heart tells me that i'm be- ginning for the first time in my life to believe in love at first sight that so astonished dell she could think of nothing to say in reply after a moment he went on you know dell he said i wish you knew me better i wish you knew me well enough to realize what that means coming from this confirmed old bachelor you've done something to me all right and to think that when i first saw you i thought you were just another pretty girl i didn't realize that you were dangerous dell listened incredulously skepti- cally yet there was a ring of sin- cerity in his voice which forced her to believe him then almost as if he could read her mind he laughed softly i've got to stop talking like this he told her you'll think i'm either crazy or have the world's best line even if it is the truth i know how it must sound i swear it's the first time it's ever happened to me i'm just as astonished as you are abruptly he changed the subject without waiting for her to speak he drew dell out about herself and he talked about himself he was a fascinating talker and dell listened enthralled after a long time he mentioned again his having fallen in love with her he laughed about it wryly and by that time it seemed to dell as if she had known him for years i guess the joke's on me he said always before this i've gone out with girls made love to them and then gone on to others but there isn't going to be any love- making for me to-night i want to kiss you more than i've ever wanted to kiss any one before and i won't do it because i won't dare risk it i value your good opinion too darned much that bit of frankness touched dell the spell of the night was on her and she suddenly realized that she wanted him to kiss her that if he kissed her this half love which she felt for him might turn into a blinding passion which would match his you wouldn't lose my good opinion if you tried to kiss me she told him softly if you loved me and didn't try to kiss me i'd think it was funny it didn't sound blatant the way she said it martin looked at her joyfully incredulous for a second then he took her in his arms and kissed her as she had never been kissed before it was the first of many kisses at first dell had not intended that there should be more than one but her refusals seemed to hurt him and at last she made no pretense of refusing she lay in- ert in his arms trembling with the passion of his kisses crying a little they did not get home until almost morning to her surprise dell experienced a sense of shame the next morning when she awoke it was in vain that she told herself that kisses meant nothing and that she loved martin she knew in her heart that she should not have let him kiss her and that she did not love him not yet anyhow she wanted him she admitted she wanted to marry him he was a matrimonial prize such as few girls ever capture maybe love would come later she was not like him able to fall in love at first sight she had to be at the inn early the freeport inn catered only to  street amp smith's love story magazine who gave you the right to pick my friends i've refused to marry you and i've told you i didn't love you you're no more to me than than the postman the very rich and socially prominent and was as exclusive as it was ex- pensive most of its business was done in the summer but situated as it was on the shores of lake champlain it offered every known form of winter sport almost as many people patronized it in winter as in summer and during the winter carnival weeks it was always so crowded that extra waitresses had to be hired dell home for christmas going primitive  vacation was always one of these extra waitresses the work in the morning was con- tinuous beginning with the early risers who were going out onto the lake to the fish shanties late breakfasts overlapped early lunch- eons so that not till the middle of the afternoon did the girls get time off the servants entered the inn through a door in the lattice- work under the vast high veranda and passed on through another door into the basement at three o'clock dell stood just inside the lattice door putting on her gloves and buttoning her coat against the bitter cold outside when she heard voices from the pathway she could see martin with two of his friends and she did not go out at once because she was afraid that she would not be able to greet him without embarrassment she realized instinctively that from out- side in the bright sunshine he would not be able to penetrate the murk behind the lattice-work though she could see him perfectly she did not mean to listen but she could hardly help herself i was out last night with that swell-looking blond who waits on my table she heard martin say and what a girl stunned she stood there strain- ing to hear every word i suppose you tried the old line on her the one my wife says you tried on her i'm not going to kiss you because i care too much about what you think of me martin grinned good-humoredly well he replied you've got to admit that it's different from most lines and that it usually works even if it didn't on your darling oh i'll admit it works the other man said grudgingly you could make most any of em believe you were telling the truth well are you going to marry the girl don't be silly mac when i marry anybody it won't be a girl i can kiss the first time i go out with her you're like all the great lovers the other man grew sarcastic you've had it so easy you're scared of your competitors you ve only- they drifted on out of earshot leaving dell standing rigid her face white her eyes cold and staring dell did not cry she was so angry at first that she could not think clearly when the anger died down a little and she was able for a minute to stop hating martin her ideas gradually changed he was still just as good a prize as he had been before common sense told her that she had had her chance to win him and she had flubbed it he had been testing her out and she had kissed him against her better judgment because she had supposed it was what she must do to please him now the point to be decided by cold analytical reasoning was whether or not she still wanted him she decided that she did and now she had the upper hand be- cause she knew how she stood with him and he didn't know that she knew in the three remaining days of his stay at the inn she might be able to do a great deal if she tried hard enough if she didn't win him she would at least have had a good time the next morning dell met tommy he had lines pails wood cooking utensils and food loaded on a sled i'm going to take my shanty out over the reef and fish for a couple of days he told her better skate  street amp smith's love story magazine out and see me this afternoon if you can spare time from the new boy friend dell talked with him a while and then went on up to the inn martin was the first of her people down for breakfast and she found in con- versation with him that he too was going out to one of the shanties for a days fishing dell said nothing but a plan was forming in her mind modern young ladies don't sit around and wait for men to come to them she remembered that afternoon when she was off duty she took her skates and went down to the wharf far out across the smooth expanse of ice she could see the tiny specks which she knew were fish shanties she put on her skates and started toward them she covered the distance rapidly with lazy powerful strokes fishing through the ice for smelt is a winter industry on lake champlain the fishermen have shanties about six feet long and four feet wide equipped with bunks which fold up against the walls during the daytime a folding table a stove for warmth and for cooking the shanties are on runners and are dragged out to the fishing grounds where they are anchored to keep the wind from carrying them away holes are cut in the ice to cor- respond to trap doors in the floor of each shanty and the men sit in them fishing sometimes for weeks on end without going ashore the fish company truck drives out buys their catch and brings them pro- visions that afternoon the ice which is kept clear almost all winter by the driving force of the wind sweeping unobstructed over the lake's hun- dred and fifty mile length was here and there patched with snow but it did not spoil the skating when dell at last reached the shanties she went first to tommy's he was enjoying a fine run of smelt at the moment and did not try to detain her when she informed him that she must leave and see martin before she went ashore i might have known you wouldn't come clear out here just to see me he grinned and went on with his fishing the shanties which the hotel kept for its guests were all painted red and dell could tell martin's only by number it was on the opposite side of the reef and with several shanties between it and the smelt run martin was having no luck at all he wel- comed dell profusely she came inside took off her skates and sat in the chair opposite him but this is perfectly grand he told her i was bored to tears and then the one person who could never bore me came along oh honey -he was suddenly humble- you look perfectly adorable may i kiss you but dell was all ready with her story martin she said that was one of the things i came out here to talk to you about i can't kiss you any more it's not right i never kissed a man the first time i went out with him before in my whole life you- i guess you swept me off my feet but it won't happen again it's not right martin nodded slowly if you think we shouldn't then we won't he said you know you can do anything to me but it was very evident that he did not intend to abide by that promise slowly indirectly he went about the task of breaking down dell's resolve now that she could sit back detached and watch his going primitive  performance she had to admit that it was the finest thing of its kind she had ever seen it was done so per- fectly that again and again she found herself swayed by his words and ideas yet knowing that it was a line kept her from yielding martin favored her with his whole repertoire and when he found her still adamant she saw another side of him he came suddenly across the shanty and tried to force her to kiss him she held him off like an expert without losing her temper please martin she said please don't she might just as well have asked a favor of the wind martin had experienced her kisses and he wanted more of them he was will- ing to be adroit as long as it seemed to be gaining him his ends but if adroitness failed there was always force dell found out that either martin french had been lying to his friends about his admiration for girls who would not allow themselves to be kissed or else he reserved that admiration for girls in his own walk of life waitresses were just a pleas- ant interlude i won't stop he told her i'm mad about you i'm wild about you dell shook herself free and stood facing him her anger rising martin she said if you don't stop i'll- i'll call for help i'll scream and with all the shanties close to us somebody will be here darn quick now be sensible martin paused uncertain his face a thundercloud then he turned and stalked through the door slamming it after him dell dropped into a chair relief flood- ing her she found she had been under greater strain than she had supposed she stayed in the cabin because she did not know what martin's next move would be she had taken her skates off and his were still lying over in the corner she had picked up one skate and started to put it on when he re- turned martin she said in a desperate effort at reconciliation please don't take it like that please she wanted to tell him that he was being inconsistent but she could not not without telling him how she recog- nized his inconsistency but dell he said and he threw his hands wide in a hopeless gesture i can't stand it i can't stand having you near me loving you the way i do and not being able to kiss you i can't stand it then i'll go away because you can't go on kissing me the way you did last night if i let you you'll think i'm cheap she began putting on her skates again but he stopped her no dell you can't go please dell again he tried to take her in his arms and again she eluded him and it was then that she became aware of a new sound the sound of runners on ice the shanty was moving with the wind she tried to tear herself free from him but he was expecting the move and forestalled her then she tried to scream but again he was too quick for her he crushed his hand over her mouth and held it there go ahead and yell he snarled in a tone she had never heard him use before i fixed that we'll be far enough away in a couple of minutes so you can howl till you're blue in the face gradually dell's first unreason- ing panic the panic which comes to any person on finding himself held prisoner gave way to an even deeper panic built on thought they were  street amp smith's love story magazine traveling north ahead of a south gale and dell knew that only a mile or so north of them where the lake widened there was open water lake champlain does not freeze like the smaller bodies of water the south end which is comparatively narrow freezes early the middle part where they were freezes next and often the wide lake does not freeze at all the shanty was gain- ing momentum every moment its flat side acting as a sail shortly dell knew unless they jumped out onto the ice they would both drown martin a man who knew nothing about the lake did not realize this she tried to tell him while she fought him she panted out the in- formation but he only vaguely listened and he laughed at her a hard chilling laugh that had no mirth in it he no longer tried to keep her from screaming but she did not scream because she knew they were too far from the other shanties for any one to hear her instead she tried to fight her way to the door her mind worked with startling clearness she knew about how fast they were going and about how far they had to go and she realized that there was little time left again and again she tried to break away from him and jump out onto the ice but always he caught her and held her over and over she screamed at him that open water lay ahead of them that it was in- exorably closer every minute but it did not good all his life martin had lied to get himself out of tight situations he thought dell was doing the same thing now he was no longer trying to kiss her he knew there would be plenty of time for that later on he contented himself with keeping her there in the shanty not letting her escape dell grew frantic almost insane with terror she broke away from him and went to the tiny window in the gathering dusk she could see the angry black of open water not a hundred yards ahead some of her terror must have communicated itself to him because he came over beside her to look in the split second of complete quiet dell heard the ring of skate runners then martin shrieked and jumped toward the door as he did so the shanty's momentum was checked so short that it threw dell to her knees and catapulated martin on past the door into the wall they heard a shout outside and dell reached the door first the shanty had stopped moving and on its south side his skates dug into the ice as he leaned back on the rope with which it had been anchored stood tommy martin came out looking at the black water and trembling violently dell kept her eyes turned away from him you know tommy said grimly it was a good thing i tagged along i guess i saw your shanty start to go places so i put on my skates and followed why didn't you jump out we didn't know it was moving martin lied quickly before dell could answer i suppose i didn't see you come out and deliberately hack the anchor rope tommy snapped a long silence followed finally tommy broke it you two put on your skates and help me anchor this shack again then i'll start back you got an extra spike french martin had one they drove it deep into the ice and fastened the end of the rope to it now i guess i'll be on my way going primitive  the spell of the night was on her and she suddenly realized that she wanted him to kiss her you wouldn't lose my good opinion if you tried to kiss me she told him softly tommy said and leave you two love birds alone i'm coming along dell said her voice was not quite steady now that the strain was over martin went with them they started away in the teeth of the wind tommy leading and sud- denly he came to swerving stop at the same time grabbing his two companions dell looking up quickly saw open water ahead of them automatically she turned her eyes to tommy and met his quizzical glance a wry smile twisted the corners of his mouth this was only a crack when i came along he said now there must be twenty-five feet of water here  street amp smith's love story magazine it took a few seconds for dell to realize what that ever-widening strip of water between them and the main ice meant then- then we're marooned on this flow she demanded in- credulously he nodded it looks that way well we can swim that dis- tance anyway martin french said go ahead tommy told him i'm not having any ice water baths for mine thanks and when you get to the other side it will be a toss-up whether you can get to shore before you freeze but what are we going to do we ve got to do something there isn't anything we can do they'll pick us up to-morrow if the ice cake holds together they went back to the shanty we might as well eat dell said i'll see if i can make a meal out of what's here better save some of it for to- morrow tommy suggested there isn't even enough for to- night martin told him we'll be off here to-morrow use it all tommy dressed the smelt that were in the fish pail there were quite a few of them but pitifully little else only the left-overs from martin's luncheon dell still felt hungry when they had finished but the meal had made them all more cheerful the cheerfulness grew as the evening progressed outside the wind had died down so that they were drifting slower even though the current was still taking them away from the main body of ice the weather was much warmer too and inside with the fire going they removed their light leather skating coats dell began almost to enjoy the experience yet always she gave thanks deep in her heart that tommy was there martin brought out a liquor bottle and offered them each a drink dell refused and tommy took only a swallow martin drank quite a lot you don't know what's good for you he told them you won't need any fire if you get a couple of shots of this down you i'll stick to the fire as long as it lasts tommy told him that stuff tasted worse than bootleg liquor later on tommy went to the window and stood for a long time looking out at last he called the others outside a dense fog was rolling out from the land envelop- ing the shack in a dead wet vapor it gave everything a ghostly appear- ance i was afraid of this thaw tommy said i hope the fog will be gone by morning but it was not gone by morning dell slept a few hours and when she awoke tommy was already up she woke cold the fog enveloped them and they could not see ten feet from the shanty tommy's face was grim can- can'they find us in this dell asked she knew what the answer would be they may run onto us he shrugged or we may drift ashore but it's a thousand to one chance even with planes they won't find us to-day martin joined them i'm hungry as the dickens he told them what are we going to eat i'll bite tommy said what are we going to eat martin went back into the shanty and rummaged around but found nothing at tommy's suggestion they went to the thick side of their flow and drank deep so that they would forget their hunger but they ls-e going primitive  dared not drink too much and the icy water went down only a few sips at a time after that they walked around to keep warm they dared not use any more of their pitifully small supply of wood for fear they might be there another night or might get fish which would need to be cooked martin walked to the edge of the flow and called into the mist again and again but there was no answer so finally he gave it up he went back to the shack then and finished the rest of the liquor in the bottle when dell entered the shack a while later he was drunk and again tried to kiss her she eluded him easily and went outside tommy had rigged lines through four holes in the ice but he was having no luck the flow had long since left the shallow water of the reef and there were few smelt in the deeper places besides that his sinkers weren't heavy enough to cut down the angle of his lines the fog held and they heard or saw no one tommy remained cheerful in spite of everything he and dell walked around to keep warm but they only partially succeeded the fog pressed in upon them making everything weird and unreal the dampness of it accentuated the cold and chilled them to the very bone ugh tommy said disgustedly it's like walking around in a dish of oatmeal you can pretty near feel it i'll bet our folks are plenty worried right now especially yours mine never know what fool thing i'll be doing next several times they heard air- planes but they were on the direct new york-montreal route so that such a circumstance would not have been strange whether there were searchers out or not ls-e martin had produced another bottle from his pocket which tommy stole during the afternoon and threw away dell did not begin to mind the cold or the hunger very much till nightfall then it was very bad they sat huddled up in the shanty and in spite of tommy's studied attempts at cheerfulness the time dragged and there were long periods of silence the grim reality of the situation had taken hold of them all dell had never been so cold be- fore in her life it was a cumulative cold it hadn't seemed bad at first but there was no relief from it and there was no food to make body heat she was miserable from the gnawing hunger which gave her no rest and the cold found her weakened unable to combat it martin's attitude did not help when he talked he told them over and over that no help would come that they would die out there he cried in drunken maudlin despair dell knew that if there had been no tommy to counteract that un- healthy attitude she would have gone mad as it was she wanted to cry or to laugh recklessly some- times she could hardly keep herself from doing one or the other if only either the hunger or the cold would let up for just one minute she kept dwelling morbidly on that if it would only let up for just one minute she thought she could go back to it cheerfully but it never did the hunger grew worse and the cold more intense with the darkness for several seconds she was aware that tommy was watching her in- tently suddenly he rose and took her hand come on he said we're going to run you're close to hysterics  street amp smith's love story magazine dell knew that she was not close to hysterics she hadn't uttered a sound she told him so only she seemed to have to shriek to make herself heard i won't go i can't go i can't move he pulled her roughly to her feet and half dragged her outside then they ran at first dell stumbled again and again but gradually as the blood began to circulate she could run without stumbling her legs grew tired her whole body seemed weak as if her blood had turned to water she began to drag back making him pull her he warned her twice then stopped and slapped her a stinging blow on the face it cleared her head like magic for an instant they glared at each other and then tommy dragged her forward again in that instant she hated him hated him as she had never hated martin even when he had been holding her prisoner in the shanty either you run he told her grimly or there'll be more of those somehow she knew he meant it and she ran but she hated him after a long while she began to beg him to let her stop the cold in- side her had abated it no longer seemed unbearable but fatigue had taken its place he let her walk then but he would not let her stop altogether and she was afraid of him she had never seen him like that before even in her misery she thrilled to his mastery after what seemed to dell like hours of walking and running tommy stopped at the shanty and told martin to come out martin refused and there was a short fight then tommy dragged him out and mercilessly forced him to walk with them after that the grind went on twice dell slumped to the ice in a heap but each time tommy dragged her brutally to her feet and made her go on she welcomed each of martin's rebellions because they gave her a chance to rest vaguely she realized that tommy was doing this to save her life to keep her from freezing yet she did not want to live she did not care life was too miserable too horrible just now to be borne all night long they traveled up and down that ice flow dell grew gradually more and more sleepy until it seemed as if she could not hold her eyes open it seemed in- credible that she should go to sleep on her feet yet several times she came close to it each time tommy shook her awake you can't go to sleep he stormed at her if you do you'll never wake up get hold of your- self will you try to help me dell hated him she hated him fiendishly for making her run and walk and for keeping her awake once she caught herself thinking that when they came near the edge of the flow it would be easy to shove him off just a tiny push would do it he was almost tottering with a little shudder she realized that she was thinking about murder the disgust she felt for herself brought her wide awake for long minutes she lost track of time in a way that was blessed she only knew that the fog did not lift when it was light again and that again it grew dark sometimes they rested but always tommy forced them up again brutally made them get onto their feet and stumble along the hunger was worse they stopped often at the edge of the flow to drink dell noticed that now going primitive  all night long they traveled up and down that ice flow several times she came close to going to sleep on her feet each time tommy shook her awake you can't go to sleep if you do you'll never wake up tommy did not go close to the edge when they were near him she was glad he didn't while it was still dark the fog lifted and it grew bitter searing cold now's the time for the fire tommy told them they cut up the table and the bunks with the hatchet and built a bonfire on the ice the heat was blessed and some one might see the  street amp smith's love story magazine flame the shoreline was close all dark trees and white snow they were drifting toward it time seemed to jerk along for dell she was not conscious of dropping off to sleep yet that shore seemed to leap nearer in huge jerks the gentle hump came when she was not expecting it and threw her to her knees they ran off the flow and floundered in the deep snow that came almost to their waists there was no crust in the woods where the sun did not seep through ahead of them was a shack one side almost buried in snow tommy broke the lock on the door and they went inside there was a stove an old keg of nails and wood piled in the corner lots of wood in five minutes they had the stove so hot that it glowed in the dim light of breaking day vaguely dell realized that though they were warm they were little better off than they had been be- fore they could not wallow through that deep snow to find help it would have been a physical im- possibility not even tommy could do that there were mattresses on the bunks martin took one bunk and dell the other the last thing she realized clearly before she dropped off into a stupor which was half sleep and half faint was that tommy had taken the hatchet and broken up the keg she couldn't understand that there was plenty of wood in the corner she saw him fitting two of the staves to his feet like rude snow shoes once she came out of her stupor momentarily to realize that martin was just as he had thrown himself onto his bunk but that tommy was not there in the shanty she dropped off into unconsciousness again without thinking much about it next there were people horrible grotesque people and she had hard work telling which were real and which were part of her nightmares again in those dreams martin was trying to kiss her and tommy was forcing her to walk on and on she hated tommy she woke many times after that and always the figures surrounding her were vague blurred as things had been blurred in the fog but one day she woke peacefully as if from a long sleep and everything was natural the hospital room the tables the chairs the bed all looked natural and tommy sit- ting beside the bed looked perfectly natural why hello tommy she said and she smiled at him he smiled back but it was a misty smile as if he knew a great relief she suddenly found that she did not hate tommy as she had supposed it was something else so there's life in the old girl yet he said good old life good old girl he talked on very fast for several minutes and then suddenly he stopped there's no use trying to laugh my way out of it he said this thing has me down and pretty near licked i've been like a crazy man for days i've always loved you dell but being out there so close to you and seeing what a thorough- bred you were made me love you all the more and instead of being able to make you love me i had to make you hate me hate me enough so maybe you wanted to kill me i thought i hated you she told him softly but you can't think straight when you're in anguish i -i don't hate you now going primitive  still his face was serious worried couldn't he see that there was noth- ing to worry about but what about martin he came through it better than you did and he'll be after you i found out about martin dell shrugged that -that awfulness did something for me when you're as close to death as that and fight- ing to keep breath in your body you get back to primitive values money doesn't matter nothing matters but courage and strength martin was a coward and pretty weak you saved our lives you you were wonderful tommy then you don't love him she shook her head slowly then paused and waited but still he said nothing only watched her with a worried frown oh tommy can't you see love is one of the primitive things that matters love matters above money or anything else if you have love you're happy if you don't you're miserable i found out that i loved you that i've loved you for ages and have been fighting against it and against you because you wanted to take away my free- dom now i'm not going to fight any longer tommy i don't want to be free i want to be yours i'll be happy wherever you are come down here tommy where i can kiss you and muss up your hair and know that you're real tommy was silent for a moment then bending down he took her in his arms and crushed her close to him oh darling i've been so fraid i was going to lose you fraid that you wouldn't love me suddenly he stopped talking and his lips found hers in a kiss that seemed to touch their very souls and make them one in that moment of ecstasy note to lovers hold no shame that her lips her laughing eyes her tiny feet and gaily colored dress calls from your eager heart its deepest sighs and melts your greatest frown to gentleness hold no shame her lightest spoken word echoes within your heart a grave command nor that her tender murmurs half unheard come like a sweet rain to a parching land love needs no alibi no masquerade no hidden trysts no secret sacrament love is too powerful to walk afraid of all oppression seeking its descent hold love's hand beneath the brightest sun and laugh with her-nor hide from any one bert cooksley reckless bride by  peggy rutherford a two-part story part ii chapter iii i never quite knew how long i spent swimming and splashing in the sunny tree-bor- dered pool to my tense nerves it seemed hours while i kept my eyes strained in the direction of the campus sloping up to hillcrest manor teeth chattering in cold panic lest some of the school au- thorities would appear before i could manage to get away but it couldn't have been more than a few minutes before the cameraman called out through the trees that he was finished trembling with relief i ducked un- der the shadowy water at the far end of the pool just as he emerged once more onto the lit- tle beach good work sister here's your money one hundred bucks jaunt- ily he counted out the bills then stooped and laid them on the sand weighting them down with a stone say we've got a car here want a lift anywhere he drawled his reckless bride  eyes a little too friendly some- thing in their expression made my heart knock with sharp apprehen- sion i hardened my face no thank you i shook my head so definitely that he shrugged grinned knowingly and started back through the woods i was frantic for them to be off shivering with chill and nervous- ness i waited under the water until i heard their voices retreating through the trees mingling pres- ently with the roar of a motor that soon died away in the distance like a flash i was out of the pool scrambling up the big rock where i had left my clothes my hands were like ice after being in the cold water so long but i managed to dress faster than i ever had in my life be- fore my spirits rose like a bird as i snatched up the money from the sand and stuffed it down the neck of my sweater how glad i was that i'd had the courage to earn it now nothing could keep me from reach- ing don before he sailed breathlessly i began picking my way through the woods and soon found the tracks made by the movie people's car why on earth had i been so childishly self-conscious as to refuse a lift into the village i wondered running as fast as i could along the bumpy trail but it was better that i had i didn't dare leave any traces behind that could easily be followed once miss hill discovered my escape she would lose no time in notifying oliver what he would do if he caught me this time i didn't dare to think all i knew was i had to get to don before i could be traced there then somehow we could manage to outwit oliver so he couldn't make trouble for don how i didn't at- tempt to fathom out now i was straining every ounce of energy on getting completely away from hill- crest before i could be overtaken the thick underbrush soon tore off my béret and i stuffed it in the pocket of my tweed jacket twice i turned my ankle on the rough ground as i ran but i kept on ig- noring the pain would i never reach the road it seemed hours before i finally emerged from the last strip of woods and climbed over a stone fence onto the highway here it was smoother going i tore down the steep road my ears strained for the sound of a car pur- suing me the road curved sharply and as i stumbled along hopelessly con- fused i saw a quarter of a mile ahead crossroads bristling with sign- posts could i ever make it my breath was burning my throat like fire my heart was a sharp knife in my side but doggedly my feet kept pounding on driven by the desperate need of reaching the vil- lage where i could get a train to new york or better still there might be an airport near enough so i could get a plane that blessed money i could feel the wad of it pressing the flesh under my sweater like a soothing hand of encouraging help as i reached the crossing at last gasping breathless it seemed there was something strangely familiar about the place and no wonder a glance at the nearest sign told me i had stumbled onto the state high- way this was the same route don and i had come the night we had eloped from betty's we had passed by this very spot little dreaming how soon we were to be torn from each other's arms the agony of that night surged over me in a black tide a sob ached in my throat i couldn't see  street amp smith's love story magazine the signs across the road for the hot tears stinging my eyes but only for a moment there was no time for futile regret now blinking away the tears i ran across the broad highway then as i began searching the signs i heard something that made my heart jump into my throat down the road a high-powered car was zooming toward me instantly my brain flamed with alarm it might be the police per- haps miss hill had already set them on my trail quick as lightning i darted down the bank and hid in a clump of bushes so thick that i couldn't see the road as i crouched there cold with panic praying des- perately that the car would pass on but it didn't pass with a screech of brakes that froze my blood sickeningly it ground to a stop in the very spot where i had stood a moment before heavy feet leaped to the asphalt bounded down the bank came crashing through the bushes panting with stark terror i fled through the brush like a wild hunted animal but it was no use i was half paralyzed with fatigue and fear a hand reached out and caught my arm in a firm grip sobbing stormily i tried to fight free but i was whirled helplessly about to face the dazzling sunlight then suddenly i wondered if i had lost my mind lynore it was a sharp breath harsh with unbelief my heart stopped beating blinking against the blinding glare i stared up incredulously at the tall form towering over me while the world stood still my senses reeled dizzily oh it couldn't be don with a hoarse groan he stooped and engulfed me in his arms hungry trembling arms that strained me tight in an agony of relief don i couldn't believe it in another minute i'd wake up and find it was just a dream with a sob i put up my hand half fearfully to touch his face and felt my heart leap wildly no it wasn't a dream oh don hysterically laugh- ing and crying at the same time i crumpled against him clinging to him while wave after wave of de- lirious joy surged over me for an endless moment we clung together not able to speak not ask- ing the reason for this unbelievable miracle knowing only that some- how our arms were where they be- longed at last each crushing the other heart to heart lips mated again in starved breathless kisses while the long weeks of cruel loneli- ness faded away darling don's hand trembled over my hair my eyelids my throat as though to convince him- self that i was real he drew back a little his eyes searching mine where on earth have you been he demanded passionately his face bending over mine was so haggard and drawn that my heart contracted seeing how terribly he too had suffered unsteadily i pointed back up the road where i had come telling him about hillcrest manor and explain- ing that i hadn't dared to let him know where i was for fear oliver would carry out his threat to ruin his career if we tried to see each other there was nothing i could do but wait for my birthday but when i saw in the paper that you were or- dered to sail i couldn't wait so to-day i -i ran away from school i faltered my cheeks tingling guiltily i was trying to find some way to get to new york when you reckless bride  came along oh don how did you ever happen to find me i stared up at him breathlessly he laughed grimly i was hunt- ing you darling i've been doing little else the last three weeks i was in torture not knowing what oliver had done with you but i couldn't find the least trace of you i've been back to the inn at least twenty times but the manager swore he hadn't seen either of you since you left that night the last few days i've had to be in washington getting final instructions before sail- ing and i just got back this morn- ing i stopped at home long enough to learn if there had been any word from you then i'drove up here again i was determined to find you before i sailed i went to the inn once again but i got the same an- swer as before i knew betty long's camp was closed but i wasn't leaving any stone unturned to find you i was on my way there when i saw you run across the road i couldn't believe it was you but i had to make sure i'm sorry if i scared you half to death dear he strained me convulsively against him pressing his lips tenderly over my face i thought you were the police i murmured shuddering he gave a start his mouth tight- ening say that's right there's no telling how soon they'll be after you but this time they re not go- ing to find you there was a ring of triumph in his deep voice as he picked me up in his arms and strode through the bushes and up the bank his big roadster was standing in the road and the familiar sight of it was a quick thrill nothing could overtake us now my blood sang in my veins as he lifted me in then quickly leaped in beside me with a quick twist of his strong brown hands on the wheel he whirled the car around and sent it speeding down the pike the way he had come with a sigh of content i lay back in the deep seat limp half be- wildered with the wonderful reality of his nearness after the terrific anx- iety of trying to reach him yet in- side i was still tense with apprehen- sion that lay like a cold shadow on my heart suppose i would only be the means of bringing him trouble that would ruin his career oh don where can you hide me so oliver won't find me i asked breathlessly against the stiff breeze of our rushing that's something i'll have to fig- ure out by the time we reach new york he said thoughtfully but don't you worry about that dear you just leave everything to your husband with a confident little laugh he cuddled me close against him with one warm arm so that i couldn't see anything but the wall of his big shoulders and the profile of his face above the wheel a thrill of hot uprushing joy swept everything else from my mind it was just as it had been the night of our elopement only now every- thing every moment was more precious for the weeks of separation that had gone between the com- plete wonder of our love would only be the more poignant the more overwhelmingly sweet for the anguish of our waiting dusk had deepened into night be- fore we finally reached new york as we drove through the brightly lighted streets my heart was beating a wild tattoo of mounting excite- ment yet each time we had to stop for traffic i went weak with ter- ror every pedestrian that glanced at us in casual interest every face  street amp smith's love story magazine there's no telling how soon they'll be after you but this time they're not going to find you there was a ring of triumph in his deep voice as he picked me up in his arms and strode to his car in the cars abreast of ours seemed to be the face of oliver i clung tense and nervous to don's arm and slid lower in the seat keeping my head bent down until at last we turned in at a public garage it was one where he wasn't known he explained as we left the roadster there and transferred to a taxi as we swung around a corner and sped uptown i suddenly real- ized what address don had given the driver i stared at him surprised but that's your apartment isn't it he shook his head not quite it's a couple of blocks above you don't mind walking back that little distance do you dear we'll run less chance of being seen but don it's dangerous for us to go there i panted wanting to go there more than anywhere on earth it's the very first place oliver will go to look for us don laughed and covered my reckless bride  hand in a close warm clasp when he does he'll be informed at the of- fice that the place is vacant which is true we've sublet it furnished for the rest of the lease the new ten- ant is coming to-morrow or the next day when i left this morn- ing i didn't expect to be back and mother was getting ready to leave she's going to live with some friends in westchester while i'm abroad so the coast is clear it will be the safest place we could possibly stay for to-night at least i stared at him breathlessly but how can we get in without be- ing seen we can go around by the service entrance the janitor's a good scout he'll take us up in the serv- ice elevator and forget about it it's not exactly the way i had planned to bring home my bride but it's bet- ter than running the chance of be- ing separated again isn't it sweet- heart in the dusk of the speed- ing taxi his gaze held a light of love and longing that made my heart pound madly oh don yes i whispered tremulously as the cab swung to the curb and stopped luck seemed to be with us the street was deserted when we got out and walked the short distance to the rear of the apartment house and a few cautious moments later we found the hall to his suite empty as he unlocked the door even in our tense haste to get in before any one happened along he picked me up in his arms and carried me over the threshold for good luck he said with an unsteady little laugh when we were safely inside without turning on the lights he carried me through the foyer into the big living room beyond his foot- steps on the thick rugs scarcely dis- turbing the silence i could feel his heart pounding hard against mine as he made his way through the quiet shadows and i sensed that he was thrilling to the same riot of emotions that were taking away my breath the soft darkness was broken faintly by pale moonlight filtering through the closed venetian blinds lying in silver strips on the floor and touching the objects about the room into vague opalescent shapes the very atmosphere bathed us in peace melting away the nervous tension that had tormented us through the past hours with a happy sigh i closed my eyes as don sank down into a deep divan still holding me in his arms darling -home at last he strained me close until our two hearts were thudding as one until i was half gasping with the sheer joy of our surrender to love his lips hot and demanding buried themselves in my throat throbbed over my face tingled on my eyelids until i looked up at him in breathless wonder almost faint- ing with sheer swooning happiness oh i loved him so much his arms were tightening with pas- sionate eagerness his eyes shone with tender light his voice was whispering his love with each quick unsteady breath trembling i raised my lips parted in breathless quivering surrender to his ecstasy like liquid fire raced over me as i felt the stabbing sweet- ness of my husband's kisses his eyes were drowning me with love as he bent over me suddenly i felt him stiffen look- ing up i saw he was staring in- tently over my head then as i turned quickly instantly on the alert i heard the sound that had startied him from an adjoining  street amp smith's love story magazine bedroom came the distinct tread of footsteps my heart stopped in a frenzy of terror quick as a flash don was on his feet his breath hot with alarm as he picked me up from the divan but before he could take a step there was the sharp click of a door opening an oblong of yellow light shot across the floor obliterated in- stantly as the lights were snapped on in the living room and we found ourselves confronted not by oliver nor an officer as i dreaded but by the tall slender figure of a white- haired woman as startled as we don was the first to recover his breath why mother his laugh was shaky with relief i thought you had gone hours ago there was a moment of uncom- fortable silence then i was detained unexpectedly came the low reply the eyes regarding us were clear blue like don's but grave unsmil- ing as they took us in with one level understanding glance my cheeks flamed hotly con- fusedly i put up my hand to my tangled hair but don was drawing me forward eagerly his arm tight about me mother this is lynore my wife there was a ring of triumph in his deep warm voice and he glanced down at me his soul in his eyes the figure in the doorway seemed to hesitate a moment before she came slowly across the room and took my trembling hands in smooth firm fingers with a quick eager smile i looked up at her and suddenly sobered for there was no answering smile on her handsome aristocratic face only a stern gravity that sent an odd chill of foreboding over me why i felt like that i didn't know nothing in the world mattered now that i was safe with don all i could fathom was that it had prob- ably come as an unpleasant shock to his mother to find him so unex- pectedly with a strange girl in his arms and i tried not to blame her for being a little angry yet i couldn't shake off this un- reasoning panic i stepped closer to don still staring wistfully at his mother and then i realized sur- prisingly that she was not angry it was instead anxiety that drew her fine features so sharply her sweet eyes were deeply troubled as she looked at us no don she said tremulously she is not your wife i stopped breathing i just stood there staring at her braced for what was coming next don's face went sober his hand tightened on my arm i don't un- derstand you mother he said evenly i told you all about our elopement you knew i went away this morning determined to find lynore and- yes his mother interrupted un- steadily and you had been gone only a few minutes before a man called to see you on a matter he said was very important when i explained that you had gone he left this with me and insisted i give it to you as soon as possible she had moved over to a secretary-desk in the corner taking a long stiff en- velope from the drawer and hand- ing it to don i didn't know how to reach you quickly so i decided to wait here in the hope that you might change your plans and return after all the man was a special mes- senger he said this was a court notice that your marriage has been annulled reckless bride  her eyes were deeply troubled as she looked at us no don she said tremulously she is not your wife your marriage has been annulled annulled don stared at the envelope his face whitening he turned his stricken eyes on me so that's what oliver has been up to keeping you penned up in that boarding school why didn't we guess i tried to speak but no words came my throat was dry and parched it felt choked constricted as though a tight band was slowly smothering out my breath the room blurred and swayed as every- thing went a little black before my eyes don tore open the envelope sav- agely drew out the legal document he held it so i could read it his arms trembling about my shoulders but i couldn't see for the hot blinding tears scalding my eyes all i knew was that oliver had sepa-  street amp smith's love story magazine rated us again this time com- pletely my heart dragged with the sickening futility of it all i hid my face against don my body shud- dering helplessly with bitter hope- less sobs darling don't don implored holding me tenderly and trying des- perately to soothe my grief do you think for one second i'd let this annulment stop us we'll get around that look at me dear gently he lifted my wet face to meet his eyes and my heart lifted at the grim undaunted look on his face we'll find some other place to keep you hidden until saturday then we'll manage to get you on the boat somehow in time to sail your birthday comes next thursday while we'll be at sea we'll simply have the captain marry us then and oliver won't be able to do a thing about it and that will make everything all right again breathlessly i gazed up at him through my tears my heart bound- ing upward again but before i could speak his mother laid her hand on his arm no don you can't attempt any- thing like that she insisted if lynore's guardian is so opposed to the marriage he would be sure to turn the whole thing into a scandal that would ruin your career in the consular service i could feel don stiffen he drew a long breath and stood very straight his mouth was a grim tight line then i'll give up my career i'll quit the service before i begin he muttered dully i'll get a job do- ing anything before i give up lynore like that i refuse to sail without her we're not going to be sepa- rated ever again i mean it the out-thrust line of his jaw clutched at my heart thrilled me insanely close in his big arms i felt a pang of pity for his mother her face had gone white as death she put out her hand and tottered against a chair like an old woman don she cried so shrilly that my blood chilled again what are you saying you can't mean you'd give up your whole life's ideals like that not after all we've gone through to get you where you are it's been cruelly hard in all the long years since your father died but i've gladly sacrificed every cent to educate you was proud for any suf- fering i had to endure now just when you've attained your ambition i'deserve something more than this you can't give up i could feel the color leave my face as i stared from her to don my heart hammering painfully your mother's right don i gasped you can't quit there must be some other way for us even if you must sail at once i can follow you- no listen he interrupted sud- denly his eyes glowing again blue and deep and sure i have it wonderingly i stared at him as he drew me over to where his mother stood his laugh was full of confidence as he put his arms around us both mother you take lynore up to westchester with you to-night oliver will have no way of tracing her there after i drive you both out i'll run down to washington and spend to-morrow trying to ar- range things to suit us under the circumstances i'm sure they'll give me permission to postpone my sail- ing date till thursday then we can be married quietly that morning before the boat sails he kissed us both breathlessly laughing his con- fident little laugh until my own ach- ing disappointment was soothed a little and i forced my spirits to meet reckless bride  the situation as gallantly as he was doing it seemed a perfect solution even don's mother was satisfied now that she saw our love need not be denied without endangering don's future she entered into the plan enthusiastically even in our anxious haste to leave the apart- ment quickly before oliver could in- terfere again she took time to hunt through her bags to get me a warm coat for the ride up to westchester long before we reached the lovely country home of mr and mrs eng- lish where we were to stay i knew i was going to love her as my own mother whom i couldn't remember and i knew too that she was going to take me to her heart as a daugh- ter for when she introduced me to our elderly host and hostess who welcomed me with a gracious hospi- tality that made me almost happy she put her gentle arm around me and said with a courageous little laugh i've almost forgiven lynore for taking don away from me it makes it a little easier since i'm to have the fun of their wedding i was glad we had arranged things without breaking her heart don and i left her talking over hasty plans with her host and hostess who were tremendously thrilled at the prospects we slipped out to the vestibule a moment before he left then an agony of loneliness swept over me like a black tide as he took me in his arms and kissed me good-by i thought i couldn't stand it it was like tearing the heart out of my body to have him leave me again what if he couldn't postpone his sailing and would have to go without me or what if oliver would trace me in spite of our caution i couldn't shake off this sense of impending fate i clung to him frantically shivering in his warm arms oh don it seems we re doomed to be separated i gasped if anything happens this time i'll die he held me close we aren't go- ing to let anything happen this time darling he whispered against my lips isn't it wonderful the way there's an answer to everything if you hunt long enough it's all turned out so much better than we thought even better than eloping oh how can you say that i panted staring up at him he held my face between his hands his blue eyes gazing deep in mine were glowing with utter worship because you're too won- derful for any makeshift marriage lynore his voice was low rev- erent almost his arms cradled me as though i were infinitely precious my darling you're the ideal of every dream i've ever had i love you so much that i'm willing to wait for a wedding that's worthy of you then there won't be the least chance of any stigma to threaten our hap- piness because dear our mar- riage is going to be paradise he kissed me until we both were breathless then with a husky little laugh he was gone chapter iv the days that followed were crowded with bewildering exciting happiness at times i even forgot the shadow of danger that hovered over me threatening constantly to shatter our expectations don was with me every possible moment he had succeeded in ob- taining official permission to post- pone his sailing date until thurs- day and he was staying secretly with jimmie rand one of his col-  street amp smith's love story magazine lege friends who owned an estate across the road from the english house we had to use the utmost cau- tion for we knew that oliver had detectives trying to find me twice they had even come to the house asking for me but mr english had ordered the servants to keep my presence an absolute secret i didn't dare to step outside day or night but there were plenty of se- cluded corners in the big house where don and i could spend hours alone hours filled with heart-hungry kisses hours that were dangerously sweet with clamorous yearning im- patience for the day when nothing on earth could keep us apart would thursday never come every minute we were simply exist- ing for the time to pass until i was legally free from oliver's power to take me away from don our nerves were tense constantly on edge with anxiety that the torment of our waiting would not be futile not that i hadn't plenty to do to help speed the days it was taking all my ingenuity to get together some sort of a trousseau without be- ing able to leave the house to shop even if i had had enough money of course don insisted on furnish- ing everything i wanted but i hated to let him buy my clothes before i was his wife anyway i still had the hundred dollars i had earned in my mad attempt to get expelled from school and get to him my cheeks burned every time i thought of that afternoon in the mountain pool but i refused to let it bother me it would have been foolish to tell don about it what was the use for me to step down even for a moment from the high pedestal where his ideals had placed me the incident would never have occurred if i hadn't been placed in such desperate circumstances which were entirely beyond my control ex- cept to escape the best way i could i told myself that every girl has things in her life that are unneces- sary to tell her husband and so i had simply explained to don that i had run away from hillcrest during a hiking trip the details were nothing but a memory to be forgot- ten a secret no one would ever know nevertheless i was thankful for the money glad i hadn't had to spend any of it except a few dollars for a couple of cheap dresses to sup- plement the tweed suit i had worn from school there was enough left to provide an astonishing amount of things at bargain prices which don's mother managed to find for me on a couple of shopping trips to new york there were two unbelievably cheap dinner dresses that looked all right at night one of shiny black satin smartly enough cut to be ex- cellent for dining in public aboard ship the other of white chiffon that made me feel and look like a bride my traveling ensemble was of deep- green wool that made my skin lus- trous white by contrast and turned my hair to vivid gold under the small felt hat fashioned like a baby's bonnet this was to be my wedding attire since we were going straight to the boat after the ceremony which owing to the necessary secrecy of our plans was to be performed in the presence of only the immediate household and a few close friends nevertheless don's mother and mr and mrs english were making as elaborate preparations as possible under the circumstances and jim- mie rand had quietly made arrange- ments for a smoker in don's honor on wednesday night ls e reckless bride  i knew nothing about it until don told me wed- nesday afternoon i was in the big living room busy helping one of the maids decorate an im- provised altar with ropes of smilax which mrs english had insisted on providing the afternoon was unusually warm and i had just opened the french window onto the terrace when i saw don coming across the road from jimmie's the min- ute he stepped in through the open window where i stood waiting for him i could tell he was fuming about something after the maid had left us alone i hadn't any idea there was going to be a smoker he complained until jimmie called up from town a moment ago and told me to watch i've got something that'll interest you a film that was taken in a pool in the woods it's pretty hot stuff i thought you wouldn't want your boy friend to see it considering all the whoopee be-tween you and the guy in the picture for the fellow he's sending out to furnish the entertainment i did my ls-e  street amp smith's love story magazine best to call it off but jimmie in- formed me that everything's set a lot of our fraternity brothers are coming out from philadelphia and new york and several of the men in the state department are com- ing up from washington so there's no possible way i can get out of go- ing since i'm the guest of honor do you mind very much dear he asked anxiously of course i'll mind i laughed ruefully but as long as it can't be helped i'll go to bed early and get a beauty sleep as though you needed it he caught me close in his arms you'll be the most beautiful little bride a man ever had darling he buried his face in my hair my throat kiss- ing me as though he could never kiss me enough suddenly just behind us there was a step on the terrace startled we drew apart in confusion then with a gasp i realized we had been off our guard just once too often for a strange man was outside the window a swarthy beetle-browed individual who stood watching us curiously how long he had been there i didn't know i darted back of the curtain trembling in terror as don whirled on him well what do you want he de- manded shortly why don't you go to the front door and ring the bell the man shrugged what's the use of bothering i heard your voices and i came around to see if this is mr rand's place i'm fur- nishing the entertainment for a smoker he's giving to-night it's across the road don said briefly you go on over i'll fol- low you in a minute with a mumbled thanks the stranger went down the steps and across the lawns don turned to me and pulled me from my hiding place why you're trembling like a leaf dear he said anxiously oh that man saw me i panted nervously i'm afraid he's a de- tective from oliver don shook his head no he's exactly what he said i've seen him before at smokers and i don't par- ticularly like the type of entertain- ment he supplies either but it's jimmie's party so i have nothing to say well i promised to show the fellow what's to be done in preparation so i'll have to go now i'll be back here after a while but in the meantime i'm going to finish my packing so i'll be ready to sail to- morrow he caught me close his heart leaping in his eager eyes to- morrow just think of that dar- ling he kissed me a swift hot kiss that throbbed with exultation a kiss that promised everything in life after he was gone i stood staring after him my pulses leaping in pride for the lithe handsome strength of his magnificent body as he strode across the road and dis- appeared in jimmie's house for a long time i stood there lost in dreams of the utter rapture waiting for us only a few hours ahead of a sudden i realized i was not alone with a violent start i saw that the beetle-browed man had come up onto the terrace again so softly that i hadn't heard him he had left off his hat and his close- clipped hair stood up over his bul- let head like black bristling fur he carried a bulging tan brief case over which he was smiling at me there was something in his furtive swarthy face that sent a stab of un- reasoning panic through me in spite of what don had said about him reckless bride  frantically i reached for the window to close it but with a quick sinuous movement he stepped forward and thrust his foot over the sill wait a minute sister he drawled in a voice of easy familiar- ity i've got something of yours that'll interest you in a big way i stared at him my terror dis- placed by fury at his insolence you must be mistaken i said coldly i never saw you before i started to move away his lips twisted in a grin and i never saw you before neither but it's a lucky break for both of us i got my directions mixed and accidentally busted in here a while ago the minute i saw you i recognized you from your picture my picture i stared at him puzzled suspicious i don't un- derstand he tapped his bulging brief case i've got it right here in one of the films i'm going to show to-night at the smoker for mr harrison it was taken in a pool in the woods somewhere he grinned know- ingly i stepped back as though he had struck me in the face my heart froze in my throat in a flash i realized what he meant and a sick- ening wave of horror stabbed through me oh it couldn't be true fate couldn't have twisted things like this it's pretty hot stuff you know he added his dark face a leering mask i thought you wouldn't want your boy friend to see it con- sidering all the whoopee between you and the guy in the picture but there wasn't any one else in it i gasped my heart hammering terrifically my breath choking my throat anyway i don't believe you could recognize me -the cam- era was too far away i panted desperately he leered darkly you're wrong on both counts sister the guy that made this film is good he specializes in pictures for the smoker circuit maybe you didn't know it but he must have got a shot at you before you knew he was there any- way there's enough close-ups of your face so that i recognized you even if he had another couple there for the regular acting and you doubled for the girl in the water no one'll ever know that from the picture the name of it is she hung her clothes on a hickory tree he said watching me intently while my eyes dilated in horror as every word he uttered struck a death blow to my heart of course he added insinuat- ingly if you don't want the film to be shown to-night i can sell it to you i caught my breath sharply how much i panted well it s a total loss to us that way he rubbed his chin thought- fully while i thought i'd go insane i'll make it one grand one thou- sand bucks he elucidated my heart sank sickeningly but i haven't that much i gasped then i remembered all the money i had earned from this wretched pic- ture had gone for clothes for my trousseau and a black mist clouded my brain a horrible feeling of helplessness paralyzed me i stared at him mute with despair well it s  k by me he shrugged the film goes on to- night he shifted his brief case and started to leave no i cried sharply wait i pressed my shaking hand over my aching eyes my brain reeling des- perately what could i do if only i could ask don for the money  street amp smith's love story magazine but i shrank from taking the risk of shattering his illusions about me my thoughts flashed to the only other person i knew to ask for help oliver he would have plenty of money but i dared not go to him he was still my guardian he still had the power to stop the wedding yet there would be no wedding if the picture was shown at the smoker i told myself wretchedly not only would i be sure to lose don but with so many of his col- lege friends there together with his associates in the consular service he would undoubtedly be dropped from his career with dishonor for having been engaged to a girl whose picture was featured in the smoker circuit my heart thumped miserably oh i had to do something desperately i stared at the fur- tive eyes watching me there's only one way i can get you the money only i can't get it to-day to-morrow i'll be eighteen and i'll come into what i've inherited from my father i'll have to give you a note due to-morrow you can take it to my guardian then and he'll have to pay you out of my money there's only one thing- i hesi- tated in a panic of doubt and fear but it was my only chance you'll have to promise not to get in touch with him until to-morrow it wouldn't do you any good anyway you wouldn't get your money till then besides i -i'm hiding from him he mustn't know where i am under any circumstances i'll have to be sure of that before i give you his name oh you can trust me sister the man vowed solemnly i've got no wish to get you in trouble only these days you can't blame a guy for picking up a little money wher- ever he can i promise you on any- thing you want to name that i won't go to your guardian till to-morrow why i couldn't leave here before two or three o'clock to-night if i wanted to the smoker will last that long and between now and then i've got to rig up a screen and some sort of a projecting booth no this is on the level see then as i hesitated uncertainly he added here's your film he took a round flat tin box from his brief case and held it so i could see the sticker on top while he pointed to the printed title she hung her clothes on a hickory tree then still keeping it tor- mentingly out of my reach he opened the container and unwound several feet of film holding it up to the light for me to see one glance made my face burn with shame and dismay frantically i turned and ran across the room to the desk snatch- ing up a pen and a sheet of paper in a frenzy of haste i wrote a note to oliver directing him to pay the bearer one thousand dollars and dating it for the next day the film peddler stood over me watching closely until he had the note in his greedy hands another moment and he was gone leaving the film coiled on the desk like a viper frenziedly i gathered it up in a blind panic to destroy it at once burn it burn it my brain or- dered desperately i scarcely breathed for fear some one would pass me as i raced down to the base- ment where after hunting fran- tically i found some matches in a wall case above the laundry stove a moment later the wretched strip of celluloid vanished with a bright flare in the laundry tubs i was glad don had to go to the smoker that night it would give reckless bride  me a chance to be alone and com- pose my shattered nerves which had turned dinner into a nightmare for me it was almost more than i could do to laugh and talk natu- rally during the meal but somehow i managed to keep up until don left as it was he stayed with me until after ten when he saw the cars beginning to arrive across the road before he went he held me close in his arms whispering that this was the last night we'd ever have to be apart i could feel his pulses leap- ing his eyes so blue and deep were warm and glowing with his love for me and my heart con- tracted thinking how narrowly i had escaped seeing them harden with scorn and contempt but it was foolish to allow that thought to tor- ture me now i kept telling myself hadn't i burned the film with my own hands don could never in the world find out about it it could never endanger our love again his kisses passionate and tender calmed me filled me with a sense of utter security when he left i was on fire with thrills because i knew i was the happiest girl on earth shortly after i went up to my room i heard the rest of the family retire for the night but i didn't undress for bed just then i had some last-minute packing to finish it must have been at least a half- hour later when i heard a tap on my door opening it expecting to see don's mother i was surprised to find the housekeeper standing there there's a man downstairs to see you miss lynore she said a queer look on her stolid face to see me i stared at her and then i saw she was holding out a visiting card uncertainly i glanced at it and gasped sharply for the name engraved on it was oliver bennett an icy shudder cut through me oh how could he have found me after i had eluded him this long but he had just as i had feared he would i had known all along this might happen at any minute my heart drummed insanely in my ears oh i can't go down tell him i'm not here i panted and then i saw the housekeeper had turned the card over so i could see the words written on the back in oliver s familiar handwriting i know you are here if you see me at once i'll not make any trouble but if you'refuse i'll bring the police and force you to come with me o b for a frantic moment i wanted to run and hide or rouse the house- hold to protect me but that would be madness i knew he meant what he said about the police and i had to prevent that at any cost my only chance lay in making him see reason and let us alone there was no other way out of it i had to go down weak with terror i entered the living room a moment later oliver was standing importantly in the center of the floor a sly ex- pression on his handsome florid face his thin lips spread in a smile as i stood trembling in the doorway ah the little runaway in per- son he drawled come in child don't be afraid i'm not going to kidnap you this time let us sit down and have a quiet little talk he motioned toward the davenport slowly he sat down but i remained standing what do you want i faltered searching his narrowed eyes afraid to breathe he raised his brows in a gesture he had always used when he had any one helpless in his power well first of all i want to congratulate  street amp smith's love story magazine you on becoming a shall we call it a film star his words struck me like a bolt i stared at him my heart stopping how how did you find out i stammered reddening painfully scarcely realizing what i said i'll admit it was a surprise oliver chuckled after hunting you everywhere with detectives since you vanished from hillcrest i was just ready to believe you had drowned in the lake until about an hour ago he cleared his throat maddeningly i had a telephone call from a man who peddles films for smokers he said he had just sent a film featuring you out to a stag party being given to-night for young harrison he thought that i as your guardian wouldn't want it shown my brain reeled sickeningly why hadn't i known the man would break his promise not to see oliver before to-morrow but i'd had to risk the chance in order to get the film from him then suddenly i remembered but he can't show the film i gasped weak with re- reckless bride  i'm the one who's going to call the police don cried i'm going to have you arrested on a blackmail charge unless you leave lynore alone besides you're no longer her guardian she's of age lief i burned it he sold it to me i gave him a note to you to pay for it out of the money i inherit to-morrow morning i see oliver's eyes narrowed then you did make the film and they- he paused while a strange expression whipped across his face they made two copies oh no i choked my eyes di- lating in horror he nodded secretly smiling the man who called me said his partner had telephoned that some- thing happened to the picture he had and wanted the other copy rushed right out they're an enterprising gang they tried to get me for a thousand dollars to keep it off the screen to-night i've got an hour yet to hand over the money i pressed my hand against the pain in my throat then you'll pay it i panted he shook his head not unless you make it worthwhile my dear but i will i moaned frantic- ally i'll give you twice the money you advance i'll give you every cent my father left me only pay  street amp smith's love story magazine it oliver i clutched at his arm in a frenzy of pleading he took my hand in his i will on one condition lynore he said his eyes glinting that you marry me at once i stiffened and stared at him ap- palled in a suffocating flash i saw the hungry greed in his avid gaze recognized it for what it was for what it had been almost since i had lived in his home and i had never dreamed it even when he forbade my seeing other men he had dared to think of me like this even though he had a wife i shrank away from him in revulsion but he caught me back against him holding me in a grip of steel don't look so horrified lynore he said softly my wife died three weeks ago in the sanitarium i've been waiting for it before i spoke to you like this i've tried to keep you free so i could marry you i've been mad about you ever since you began growing up with a swift motion he tried to kiss me blind with rage i struck at his face desperately i struggled against him don't you dare touch me i panted i hate you i wouldn't marry you for anything he reddened violently not even to save young harrison from seeing that film he said harshly from the description i got it would be plenty to turn him against you if he sees it and he will see it unless you promise right now to marry me my brain whirled as a black tide of hopeless despair engulfed me it seemed my heart crashed and died inside my throat what could i do i closed my eyes in an agony of helpless panic you'd better make up your mind oliver was purring in my ear the film goes on in just a few minutes if you want me to buy it for you you'll come with me now i'll leave a check across the road then we'll go to a magistrate and be married as i stared at him a sudden des- perate hope flamed through my brain there might be just the barest chance i could outwit him i lowered my eyes well all right i said very low i'll get my coat i was afraid he wouldn't release me but he did evidently he was surprised at my sudden meekness he stood in the doorway watching me with glittering eyes while i went upstairs the instant i reached the second floor i began running silently along the thickly carpeted corridor until i reached the servants stairs a mo- ment later i was hurrying through the dark kitchen letting myself out the back door as i ran silently over the grass around the end of the house i could see oliver through the lighted living room windows impa- tiently pacing the floor madly i sped across the road to jimmie s skirting the lighted drive until i reached a clump of shrubbery at the entrance the door stood open laughing voices of men drifted out to me as i crouched there in the shadows trembling then they hadn't gone down yet i could hear them mov- ing about in a room to the right of the hallway beyond a wide door- way half concealed with draperies and right outside that room was a wrought-iron stairway with a flight underneath leading down did it lead to the recreation room and could i make it without being seen i had to heart in my mouth i slipped noiselessly inside past the door without being seen and down the reckless bride  steps a moment later i found my- self descending into what was un- mistakably the recreation room stooping cautiously i could see a white screen hung at the far end and near the foot of the steps was a little boxlike booth some one was in it and as i crouched there watching breathlessly the swarthy film peddler suddenly came out of it he walked slowly over to the screen and adjusted it then he went out through a doorway behind it like a silent flash i was down the stairs and in the tiny wooden booth i nearly knocked over a film projector on a little table in my eagerness to open a bulging tan brief-case lying beside it hands shaking i opened it and com- menced drawing out the contents one after another round tin box i examined in mad haste until at the very last i realized it wasn't there my heart knocked sickeningly desperately i looked about saw a small package lying on the chair wildly i tore off the wrapping just enough to see it was another film and the title on the top was she hung her clothes on a hickory tree snatching it up breathlessly i slipped out of the booth under the stairs i saw a table piled high with smoking supplies and i caught up a paper of matches as i shot up the stairs just as heavy feet reentered the room from the far end as i reached the entrance hall some one parted the draperies in the wide doorway but i didn't stop i didn't even look like a hunted ani- mal i raced out into the driveway swift feet pounded after me and my heart knocked sickeningly i couldn't get away but i could destroy the film madly i fled around the house tearing open the tin box as i ran in an instant i had the film free i caught the end of the strip and flung the spool to the ground unraveling it completely in a glittering heap on the gravel stooping swiftly i lighted one of the paper matches and touched it to the celluloid there wras a bright flare in the dark- ness just as a tall figure came run- ning around the house lynore it was don his voice thin with amazement what are you doing over here dear i couldn't speak my throat was dry burning miserably i turned and stared at him panting pressing my hand against my heart as he came up to me before he could touch me another figure came pounding around the drive a bullet head bristling with short hair flashed through the light streaming through the wrindowrs in the house hey where's that film a swarthy face was thrust close to mine you took it you little- here be careful don seized his arm flung him away from me what's the trouble he demanded his jaw thrust out ask her the film peddler snarled pointing at me ask her why she just stole one of the films out of the projection booth i was going to show at the smoker oh so you burned it already stooping he picked up the charred spool on which the film had been wound from the center of a black smudge on the driveway angrily he whirled on me again say do you think you can get away with that even if you did pull the wool over this guy's eyes he laughed harshly it's a big pity he can't see you in that film it's the hottest number we've ever had on the circuit well any time you  street amp smith's love story magazine you know i couldn't hate you lynore no mat-ter what you did promise you'll never doubt again that i love you he demanded want to make some more money diving in your birthday suit come around he turned and strode to- ward the house don flinched as though he had been struck for a moment there was tense silence as he turned to me his eyes sick it isn't true is it lynore he demanded his voice hoarse tell me it's a lie and i'll kill him my brain whirled frantically but i knew it was useless to lie out of it it would only make it more hopeless if it ever came to light again i nodded just miserably yes don it's true i gasped oh i should have told you at first but i never knew this would hap- pen- my voice broke wretchedly breathlessly i sobbed out the whole story from the minute i had vowed to be ex- pelled from hillcrest manor un- til to-night when i had discovered there had been a copy of the original film which i had bought for a thou- sand dollars oh don tell me you under- stand i begged my heart hammer- ing painfully tell me you don't hate me but he turned away his face white set he strode off around the driveway without another word my mind went black in that moment i wanted to die blindly i reckless bride  stumbled across the lawns sobbing miserably i had lost don irre- trievably all his tender worship- ing love had turned to scorn and hate there was nothing for me in life but to get away quickly spare us both the humiliation of ever see- ing each other again gropingly i started to run- and found my- self seized in a rough grasp so you tried to sneak away it was oliver angrily confronting me you'll see how far that gets you i won't pay for the film now oh the film's burned i gasped and don knows the whole thing it's turned him against me i hope you're satisfied weeping bitterly i pulled away sure i'm satisfied with a soft laugh he pinned me against him i'm glad we're rid of him then he won't try to interfere because you and i are getting married to-night oh no you're not spoke a deep young voice that made my heart leap looking up incredulously i saw don striding over the grass to- ward us but you are getting out of here quick unless you want to get hurt his hands clenched threateningly as he faced oliver take your hands off lynore oliver drew himself up impor- tantly indeed not he retorted holding my struggling arm more tightly i'm her guardian she's leaving with me to-night if i have to call in the police i'm the one who's going to call in the police don cried i'm go- ing to have you arrested on a black- mail charge you and that film ped- dler downstairs unless both of you leave lynore alone besides you're no longer her guardian he held out his watch it's five minutes after twelve she's of age a blinding wave of light seemed to free my soul my heart began beating so fast i thought i was go- ing to faint dimly i was aware that oliver was glaring at his watch then with a grunt and a fearful look at don he turned and almost ran out to the road a moment later we heard the sound of his car vanishing in the night lynore with a low cry don's arms were about me lynore dar- ling you're free nothing can ever take you away from me again i stared up at him scarcely breathing then you don't hate me i whispered trembling i thought when you went into the house- oh darling i went in to warn that fellow not to spread the story around about that film he'll never bother you again neither he nor oliver they both know they've laid themselves open to serious charges don held me close his eyes shining above mine with a tender glowing light you know i couldn't hate you lynore no mat- ter what you did tell me you know that darling i looked up at him a wave of joy drowning my heart in ecstasy oh yes i whispered tremu- lously i know it don a moment longer he held me so i had to meet his eyes promise you'll never doubt again that i love you -love you -love you he de- manded but he didn't give me a chance to answer his lips smothered the words on my mouth while his arms crushed me close against his heart in a mad exultant embrace and as we clung together in breathless surrender to our love while the world stood hushed stilled it seemed that tiny silver bells of joy chimed in our thudding hearts ringing in the new day our wed- ding day the love pawn by  hortense mcraven paula had never been kid- naped before and the sensa- tion wasn't a pleasant one she had often wondered how it would feel now she knew stolen and only a week before her wedding to monty lewis she glanced again at the grim stranger who had kidnaped her in her own car and tried to imagine how he felt also a young fellow like that really good-looking must be goaded by some terrific strain driven by some desperate need to take such a chance what suffering had etched those bitter lines in his hard handsome face half an hour earlier paula had hurried from madame rosalie's where she had been fitted with the last ermine bordered velvet and the wispy bits of chiffon lingerie which were part of her luxurious trousseau stowing a flat box away in her sedan she had glanced up to see this young fellow with breath- taking nerve step out from behind a truck on the crowded street jump into her car beside her and order tersely drive out to highway  paula obeyed what else could she do with an automatic sug- gestively touching her side if it's money you want she the love pawn  gasped looking desperately about for help my uncle jerry will pay you any amount my uncle or my fiance would do that she con- tinued her tawny-brown eyes flash- ing furiously but i wouldn't she took one hand from the wheel to snap her fingers under the man's nose i'd never give in i'd refuse to traffic with your kind fine exclaimed her kidnaper amazingly i knew you were that kind spirited and nervy when i se- lected you to help me in a plan i've got you might call me red- with a gesture toward his hair which flamed in the sunlight- because we're going to know each other pretty well before we get through with this thing of course i know you're paula ingram sheer surprise made paula drive on down a busy street past two un- suspecting traffic cops her captor's voice echoed in her ears with a familiar ring where had she heard it before he was not at all the criminal type he was well dressed his hands cared for his teeth nice and he would have been splendidly attractive but for those harsh lines about his mouth that terrible look in his slate-gray eyes the whole thing was almost ab- surd it seemed so natural yet so horrid she drove on through business streets residential districts out to the open country twice they passed people she knew one a car full of girls who had been with her at a luncheon in her honor that very day they waved at her if she should scream now- no squealing ordered the deadly voice at her elbow she could feel the cold steel of the re- volver through her dress let your friends think you're taking a ride with a new date a new date you must be crazy she said her eyes flashing you will never get away with this you poor puny thing i almost feel sorry for you when i think of the money and power my guardian uncle jerry will put behind a search for me there will be no search said the man who called himself red calmly i've fixed that we leave the car at philadelphia and i'm taking you by airplane to santa barbara california the countryside through which they were passing swam dizzily past paula to california from wilming- ton delaware to santa barbara her city of recollections the home of a man she wanted to forget red coolly relaxed even lighted a cigarette you are the girl who is to help me take some money from the bank there help you rob a bank i'll die first defied paula's vivid mutinous lips you -you can't force me to do that yet i have a hunch that you will and my hunches seldom fail he seemed so sure that chills ran through paula it won't be ex- actly robbery not from my point of view drive slowly and let me tell you a little story my name is jack delafield five years ago my father was one of the wealthiest men in southern california then on the market he lost all except a quarter of a million a lot of money for some people but little enough when you've had more a group of hard- boiled thieves in tailored clothes four men who pretended to be friends fleeced dad completely de- liberately murderously took his last cent it wasn't only the money but his power his name all gone one windy night he came home to find just one bullet in his revolver it was enough he sent it through his  street amp smith's love story magazine heart six months later mother died crushed i faced the world alone i had worshiped my dad and -the slate gray eyes brooded bitterly- i swore i'd have my re- venge and got that money my money back oh i tried the law but it was no use the gang had covered the evidence and they're still at the same old game robbing whenever they can now i've a chance to burn them up danger means nothing to me paula felt a swift stab of pity young and so desperate i've laid my plans well he was staring unseeingly at the town they were whizzing past the gang is operating in mexico with blinds in california i've learned no mat- ter how that almost the exact sum they stole from us will be in this bank in santa barbara for a few hours some day soon until it can be divided i'm going to get that money -mine- or die for it in spite of herself paula felt a thrill of excitement she loved to live daringly scent danger in the air and with this handsome bandit- her head with its gold-brown hair flying was up her delicate nostrils wide where do i come in on this she asked swiftly you are to be nice to the cashier of that bank find out which day the money will be there you are the only girl in the whole world who can do that because eric kendall is in love with you paula almost lost control of the wheel no she cried furiously not eric kendall i won't do it so that is the bank and eric- oh but you will red broke in masterfully a year ago you visited in santa barbara and eric fell madly in love with you you had a wonderful time together you seemed to care for him re- member remember she could see eric's blond head and broad shoulders his well-groomed air of the prosperous young business man there had been tennis tournaments and horse races at the smart country club the green strips of sward sun shining pennants flying from the grand- stand herself in a white dress with orange coat the breeze on eric's hair dances too in the open air pavilion the feel of eric holding her close the perfume of thousands of california's sensuous carnations and eric making love to her beg- ging her passionately to stay and marry him yes eric was attrac- tive and with his bold complacent way would be successful you're thinking of him now said red as if he read her mind when you see him again the affair may click you ran away from him last year you came home to marry the millionaire monty lewis to please your uncle but you don't love monty he doesn't stir you not exciting enough you're sec- retly longing for some one else paula gasped how did he know all this i did want to please uncle jerry he has done everything for me sure the strange slate-gray eyes looked into hers but if you had really loved eric as a girl like you is capable of loving you wouldn't have thought of that you would have gone straight as a die to your man what a strange conversation with a bandit who had kidnaped her talking of love and yet with his fascinating compelling eyes and the lines almost gone from his face he could have been a lover worthy of any girl if fate had dealt with him differently the love pawn  he took both struggling hands in one big one holding her fast some little fury aren't you calm down sit at that desk and write what i dictate this isn't getting us anywhere she said angrily shaking off his spell you'll be clapped in jail as soon as i am missed and that won't be long now but you won't be missed just before i picked you up i sent a wire to your uncle it read monty and i decided could not stand big formal wedding married to-day at two o'clock en route to california in my car paula ah-h he was clever think you're smart don't you she cried but monty has gone on a hurried business trip to canada  street amp smith's love story magazine not to return till the day before the wedding i know that that played into my hand monty's trip was confi- dential and he told no one he was going except you you intended to tell your uncle to-night but by to- night you and i will be far away meanwhile uncle jerry will think you are having a honeymoon with monty and monty up in canada will think you are safe at home so no one will search for you shakily paula kept the car in the road who are you she cried and how did you learn all these things the man only laughed tauntingly then he said with that strange ringing voice that kept echoing deep within paula when we reach philadelphia you are going to write a note to uncle jerry in your own handwriting saying you are safe and happy i shan't cried paula rebel- liously you shan't make me but you will he said again paula had the feeling of being driven by fate it was not the gun he had more it was some odd com- pelling power the way his look bore down on her he was a strong de- termined man paula knew it something feminine in her re- sponded even while she fought against him i shan't help you get money from eric's bank either her vivid lips mocked him if you think i'll use his love for me to lure that in- formation from him you'll find i can struggle to the last ditch you are beautiful when you flame like that he said suddenly i like a girl with temper you precious little wild cat then you'll have plenty of chances to admire me he leaned nearer i could he said slowly if i were interested in girls but i have no time for them now all my mind and soul is cen - tered in my plan for revenge and you are only a pawn in the dan- gerous game i play the fact that you happen to be a pretty little love pawn means nothing absolutely nothing to me paula s brows knotted only a love pawn was she she'd show him she had a mind and a will of her own she didn't know yet what she would do but she wouldn't fall in with his plans she was tired when they arrived at philadelphia at nightfall they had made good time stopping twice for gas but always at such remote filling stations that paula knew it would be useless to try to escape now she was so weary the maze of city streets was all a blur red ordered her to stop at an apartment house in a quiet section it's a walk up he apologized but paula didn't care it was good to stretch her limbs only when he took a key from his pocket and un- locked the door of a small apart- ment did she wake up this is sketchily furnished from odds and ends left after our crash he was saying but it is home for me for the present welcome lady fair we will spend the night here with a click he turned the key in the lock paula turned white locked in through the window she could see cavernous walls of other apartments windows more windows and behind them people were living but who would hear her or care if she called she was trapped red put out his hand to take her coat but in spite of his gun she struck at him furiously you brute she sobbed between set teeth how dare you bring me here ls-e the love pawn  before i'd let you touch me i'd kill myself he took both struggling little hands in one big one holding her fast but paula- you think you can hold me she panted but i'll show you i'm strong be quiet he ordered i keep trying to tell you you misunder- stand if you behave yourself i'm not going to harm you we are not alone i have two japanese ser- vants who stayed with me when dad's establishment broke up any- way he said coolly do you think i'd risk ruining my well-laid plans for you- a girl even if you are beautiful he added with a queer look at the red mark she had left on his wrist some little fury aren't you calm down sit at that desk and write what i dictate strangling her sobs paula stepped proudly across the worn but once good rug automatically she no- ticed the tasteful chintz the few pieces of well polished furniture he knew good things his words kept ringing through her mind even if you are beautiful she did not know whether she was glad or sorry that he had taken his strange touch away from her better not resist better pretend to fall in with his plans later she could think of a way to escape she wrote what he dictated that she was on her honeymoon that she was gloriously happy red took the letter from her forcefully and tore it up you have disguised your hand he said sternly write another the room swaying about her she obeyed too worn to wonder how he had known but there was one more chance she remembered a erame she used to play with uncle jerry when she had been in a very strict boarding school where her letters were corrected she always signed them with a special little crook to her name so he would know she was in some childish trouble she wrote it that way now hoping praying uncle jerry had not forgotten doesn't seem exactly right yet said red critically but let it pass he rang and gave orders to the japanese phone the garage to send for miss paula's car and store it for a week see that this letter gets off at once by air mail and tell yugi san to come here when the tiny woman pattered in she looked so much like a wee madame butterfly in her native kimono that paula almost said what a darling maid but she would not let herself praise red's establishment make miss paula comfortable in the guest room he ordered smoothly dinner in an hour both yugi san and her husband koti seemed to speak so little english and they looked at their master with such doglike devotion that paula realized it would be use- less to appeal to them for help perhaps you would like to dress for dinner red was saying suavely he handed paula the box of clothes from her car how strange the black box with its gold letters rosalie looked here in the tiny guest room she de- cided not to dress but on second thought why not why not give this disdainful young bandit who had no place for girls in his life an eyeful standing at last in the long severe dress of heavy white faille which incased her form like the un- opened sheath of a lily bud her eyes gleamed mischievously she was ls-e  street amp smith's love story magazine beautiful and she knew it dis- missing yugi san she turned proudly before the mirror kicking aside the fascinating little fishtail train that swept the floor the gown was demurely high in front but low to the vanishing point in the back revealing the smooth shoulders that hours with dancing masters and on horseback had given her from head to foot she was chastely white not a hint of color except her own gold-brown hair and carmine lips she stretched luxur- iously loving the feel of the stiff silk on her ivory body wondering how certain slate-colored eyes would look when they saw her there was a little cough at the door dinner is served miss paula she jumped in amazement a tall black-haired butler stood there im- maculate in evening clothes benson paula rushed to him in surprise benson the substitute butler who had worked in her home when the regular man was ill that strange ringing voice that sometimes cracked like a whip sometimes stroked her like a caress the puzzle which her mind had been trying to solve was suddenly clear you red and the butler ben- son are the same you got that place in my home just to find out about me thinking you a servant i never looked at you closely but now i know but the red hair- a red wig is the best disguise i know he said people hardly look further than that and i know lots about you i've watched you come and go listened to your telephone conversations i've seen you going reluctantly to monty lewis's arms and take his kisses coldly ah said paula you cad forgive me all part of my game he stepped close to the taut little figure in the beautiful stiff dress and his glance appraised her charm you don't love him he said coolly you will never go back to him oh i've seen you in all sorts of garbs in riding breeches in lacy negligee i've stood so close beside your chair when you dined i could have laid my lips to your quivering shoulder the strange thrilling voice was caressing now and i've had intimate glimpses through half- opened doors of you all dewy from sleep cuddling against satin pillows for your breakfast in bed dazed a warm riot of feeling coursing through her paula stood powerless to move while he placed his hand tinglingly magnetic on the silky smoothness of her bare back two pair of eyes startled looked into each others for a long mo- ment they stood thus you see i could have kidnaped you for quite another reason if i let myself go but my will shuts women out getting that money back is my one obsession his voice cracked again he took his hand away leaving paula shivering after the job is over you will be safe no one will suspect you and i shall disappear over the mexican border i know a place where neither car nor plane can follow with a fast horse under me and a jingle of spurs i'll be gone and you you will find eric's arms waiting for you eric is a handsome blond devil after all after all a little drearily paula's heart echoed the words she could do worse she thought re- luctantly tearing her glance from the dashing red at least eric would always have money to take care of her and if he asked her again to marry him under a golden california moon- the love pawn  righto cried red you're thinking of eric and eric's love a chime of dainty bells sounded shall we go in to dinner milady gravely red offered his arm gravely paula took it a small table was set in the living room the hour that followed left its impress on paula for life dining opposite a charming man in impec- cable clothes one who had once be- longed to the world she know it was hard to believe he had brought her here by force it must be true that he was jack delafield she had heard of the family remembered vaguely that they had lost their money somehow obviously he was used to playing host his ringing voice told her de- lightful things and her laugh tinkled out it was a delicious sit- uation with just a spice of danger he had told her he did not want her yet she wondered if his eyes did not tell a different tale the maid pattered to and fro with enticing foreign dishes and the three red roses she had arranged with the artistic skill of the japanese slowly opened in the warmth of the room like hearts of love baring their vo- luptuous breasts to the kiss of the candlelight paula and red sat long over coffee and cigarettes until at last the candles burned low the harsh lines were almost erased from his face giving him a different look what a shame paula was thinking for a man like this to be drawn into crime she felt an intense longing to help him save him from himself if she pretended to fall in with his plans surely some way would be opened up to stop him from this awful thing something of what she was think- ing must have showed in her face with his usual clairvoyance he put his hand forcefully on hers don't get the idea of reforming me i'm not worth it and there's no use the lines came back to his face he crushed out his cigarette you are tired he said abruptly time for bed uneasiness laid hold on her again it was so quiet there perhaps he had sent the servants away perhaps she was alone with him afraid he accused must i explain again that although you are a prisoner you are entirely safe with me yugi san is already asleep on her pallet in your room you -faltered paula trust in him rushing over her you are nice good to me i'll never be afraid of you again the city was dimmed by a light fog when they got away the next morning red's plane was ready at the airport and yugi san and koti looked like dwarfs in their funny leather jackets and goggles paula could have called for help again and again as they crossed the city but something stopped her she told herself with a hammering heart that she didn't want to go back on red she wanted to see this thing through the trip across country was one long thrill paula was not surprised when they reached santa barbara to find that red had engaged rooms at a quiet hotel yugi san was her maid koti his man then red outlined his final plans that night there was to be a masked ball at a beautiful resort on the beach he had gotten cards for he still had friends in santa barbara paula was to go with him in mask find eric flirt with him get what in- formation she could about the  street amp smith's love story magazine money red needed to know the exact day it was to be in the bank on the actual day of the hold-up she was to gain entrance by a side door just before opening time counting on eric letting her in then manage to keep his attention until red did his work red had learned that eric was the only officer who kept a gun in his desk he kept telling paula they must not fail now must not suppose i refuse to do all this she asked her eyes flashing you won't refuse he said quietly his eyes compelling i know i have another hunch and that strange power she had felt ever since she'd known him stretched taut as a wire between them now was her mo-ment was she go-ing to help red or tell eric every-thing a rustle showed where red was hiding a re-volver smothered in the lace ruffle at his wrist the love pawn  the ball was in full swing that night when a tall cavalier in plum- colored satin buckled shoes and powdered wig with a languishing lady in bouffant dresden flowered taffeta on his arm presented their cards at the exclusive club the costumes were rented from an agency but what did that matter under the crystal shaded candles they glittered and shone the pol- ished floors were crowded and ex- citement made paula's breath come fast where in all that throng was eric soon she spotted him resplendent in black velvet with rhinestone or- naments no disguise could hide his complacent bearing the blue eyes that had always been a little shrewd she managed to slip into his arms eric she whispered mysteri- ously are you glad to see me he started violently who are you don't you know my perfume of jasmine flowers eric paula he held her closer where did you drop from from the skies literally brought here by a young hero who swept me off my feet where is monty lewis in canada paula replied calmly i've left him i'm never going back darling his voice grew thick paula noticed he had grown stouter since she'd seen him and the blue eyes were shrewder come outside he was saying so we can'talk trailing through the door on eric's arm paula quivered with the suspense of it all now was her mo- ment was she going to help red or tell eric everything in the darkness half hidden by a tangle of yucca she saw a certain cavalier in plum-colored satin fol- lowing them it was like some dramatic moment on the silver screen she and eric sat on a marble bench under pomegranate trees the ocean breeze fanning their heated faces a rustle that was not the wind showed where red was hiding a revolver smothered in the lace ruffle at his wrist she let eric put his arms about her the powder from her bare shoulder making patches on the glistening black of his coat paula you ran away from monty you came to me i'll never let you go back to him never i'm mad about you paula more than ever you've got to marry me to-morrow he silenced her reply with a forceful kiss if i can wait that long the bushes rustled paula smiled grimly did the cavalier in plum- colored satin like the sample of love-making he had forced on her listen sweetheart eric's com- placent voice was taking a great deal for granted i'm making lots of money we're in on a big deal now see this telegram he struck a match to show her it says that at dawn to-morrow nearly a quarter of a million will be sent from mexico by secret messenger to be stored in the smaller vault of our bank till we can divide it just myself and three others my share will be more than fifty thousand that will be your wedding present we'll be married and play around with it on a honeymoon in europe paula's breath stopped like a cur- rent that has been shut off to- morrow the thing red had been planning living for the thing that had seemed somewhere in the future was upon them like an avalanche another thought burst like a bomb through her dizzy brain red  street amp smith's love story magazine had never told her that eric him- self was one of that gang of four men the thieving murderous gang that had helped kill red's father and ruin his life she shrank from eric with loathing she had known he was ruthless shrewd but not a thief how had she ever imagined she loved him what do you say darling he insisted fatuously the world turned crimson for paula she wanted revenge for red she wanted to help him she wanted to follow him anywhere everywhere even if he were a fugi- tive from justice into the desert into the mountain clinging with him on the fast horse with jingling spurs oh if he would only let her go with him why she'd freeze or starve just to be near him just to have him kiss her carelessly now and then for she loved him loved him loved him why hadn't she known it before then she remembered red did not want her red would never take her she got up stiffly i'll let you know to-morrow eric she said in choked tones and her face wet with tears rushed back into the ballroom the chill of dawn came into the hotel room which she shared with yugi san and found her haggard unsleeping all night long she had lain there trying to think of a way to keep red from committing this crime although he felt the money was rightfully his if he took it as he planned he would be hunted down like an animal his danger his suffering cut her as if her throb- bing heart had been laid bare alternately with this feeling came the glory the sweet shame of her love for him she was proud of loving him jack delafield smooth suave man of charm and red- glorious red the bandit who had forced her to drive off with him and who now held her soul in the hollow of his strong brown hand it rushed over her in wave after wave that left her weak and trem- bling the kisses of monty and eric were nothing nothing she had never been desired by any man because red did not want her she had never been kissed by any man because red had denied her his lips yet she was powerless to save him after it was over he would ride away and leave her only a love pawn in his game red's knock at the door sounded like the trump of doom she felt like a prisoner going to her execu- tion when they slipped down to the comer near the bank shivering under their coats a small rented car waited near by in it red was to make a dash for the border where the fast horse waited and paula unsuspected would be left free to take the first train home or stay in california with eric good-by paula and forgive me you're a great little girl paula could hardly see the dark head the slate-gray eyes for her tears in a few moments now- why it couldn't be she couldn't bear it red she said desperately don't- don't do this thing don't brand yourself for life in your heart you know it's wrong don't mind about me i don't matter i don't count kick me aside i won't tell only get away and start your life somewhere else his face grew so dark she thought he was going to strike her no he cried no no no for a moment paula stood still on the bare street corner the wind whipping her skirts the love pawn  all right she said shortly let's get going she had tried it was no use she would follow him anywhere she shut her eyes so she would not see him when he left her to wait near the door the corner clock struck eight at eight-thirty red had told her the time lock on the vaults went off at eight-fifteen eric came hurrying around the corner ready to go on duty good morning said paula placing herself in his way smiling her prettiest why in such a hurry he stopped short amazed paula i didn't expect to see you here she cast down her lashes well i got to thinking about last night and- eagerly he drew her through the side door of the as-yet-unopened bank come into my little cage darling where we can'talk you promised to let me know to-day sweet complacently he took her hands in his paula looked wildly about her the shades of the bank were drawn the big front door shut no one was about except the janitor and another early worker outside she had a glimpse of red he was sig- naling her her heart flew to her throat when she saw he had not put on the disguise after all ah the foolish bravado there he was dark hair slate-colored eyes ready to come in and do this awful thing if she could only save him the man she loved the clock struck eight-thirty and at the sound of that one stroke a plan so simple yet so daring burst full-born into her reeling brain that she turned to ice at the very thought it was the sight of eric's gun that made her think of it eric darling she murmured and slipped into his arms with one quick gesture she had the gun in her own hands she turned on him put them up she cried hoarsely quick and unlock the small vault and hand over that quarter of a million paula quit joking come one step nearer and see who's joking to the vault i say something in her white face and set lips halted eric the janitor and the other man came running only to find themselves lined up also paula almost smiled at red s sur- prised face at the door she had taken his play out of his hands and he didn't know what to do little did he realize what risk a woman will take for a man when she loves him quivering with fear that some- thing would stop her now that she had begun her dangerous game she drove her prisoners before her made eric unlock the vault and give her the canvas bags of money a flam- ing sense of power thrilled her as she backed to the door keeping the trembling trio covered there was no sound except the ticking of the big clock outside on the street traffic flowed on undisturbed at the very threshold paula cried in a clear voice i'm taking this money eric kendall to keep the man i love from doing it by rights it's really his money it doesn't belong to you and your thieving gang but we really don't want the filthy stuff after all that telegram you showed me last night can be traced and jack delafield and i will have enough evidence against you to send you to jail so fast it will make your hair curl  street amp smith's love story magazine here take it i only pretended to get it to save him superbly she threw the bags of money on the floor at the frightened eric's feet much good it will do you now and if there is any pun- ishment for my little joke it is i and not jack delafield who will have to pay at least i have saved him sobbing with great racking sobs shaking her paula ran from the building ran leaving pande- monium uproar behind her ran straight into red's arms bewildered he lead her to the car quick paula get in before that mob gets you i don't know what it all means but i've got to save you ah it was sweet to have him take care of her to sit beside him and see him take the wheel she looked at his brown hand there and wanted desperately to put her own under it she wanted to snuggle against him and ride on and on forever but of course it couldn't be he must put her out soon after all she must go back and face the conse- quences of what she had done while for him there would be the border the desert with a fast horse under him but he would not be hunted she had saved him from that he careened around a corner driving like the wind red she said trying not to let her lips tremble put me out while you get away there is nothing for me to run from he said i'm just taking you to safety as for me didn't you notice i came out without my dis- guise that was because i decided not to take that money after all i kept trying to signal you but you didn't see me from the first hour i saw you paula something differ- ent came into my life but i denied it bitterly kept fighting against the thing you meant to me at last on that corner back yonder when you begged me you made me see what a cowardly fool i would be to carry out my plan i couldn't go through with it that's all far behind a car was pursuing them gaining on them block after block so said paula laughing shakily the love pawn  we're being chased for something neither of us really did i threw all the money back i can't understand he shouted against the rushing wind why you him against the rushing wind be- cause i love you and you may not have any time for women jack delafield and your mind may be set on re- with one quick gesture she had the gun in her hands she turned on him put them up she cried hoarsely quick and unlock the small vault and hand over that quarter of a million pulled off that stunt at all i couldn't hear what you were say- ing paula's hat was off gold-brown hair streaming the suspense and the danger had made her eyes like pools of light her lips were whipped to a scarlet froth i did it she shouted back at venge but you can't get away from me you kidnaped me so here i am ah said the man called red only this time his wonderful voice was vibrant low and he no longer seemed to be trying to shout against the rushing wind how can there be any revenge when you  street amp smith's love story magazine spoiled all that when you showed me the right way and what use is there for me to run from you al- though i wouldn't admit it you had me tied the first hour i went into your home and watched you one night trailing down the stairs to meet monty lewis darling dar- ling i might have known i couldn't harden my heart against you you wonderful vivid little queen deliberately he stopped under a feathery pepper tree on a side street let them catch us if they want to but first i'll have my kiss a flame of tender fire enveloped paula his kiss made everything else in the world seem tame his kiss set everything that had hap- pened before it into the past this and this only was the beginning of life and love and rapture it was so that uncle jerry in the pursuing car found them a few moments later uncle jerry who had trailed paula across the con- tinent on the clue of that little crook to her signature and who had ar- rived at the bank to ask news of eric just in time to see her fleeing with red after that there was nothing else for uncle jerry to do except use his influence and his check book in hav- ing eric and his crowd brought to justice and the newspapers made a heroine of paula but red stubbornly refused to let uncle jerry's money do anything for him sweetheart he said after the simple ceremony that meant just another marriage to the clerk but heaven to red and paula do you realize that you've married a pretty poor man don't try to walk out on me cried paula her lips on his what difference does money make the little love pawn has taken her heart's king for always and always he crushed her to him and kissed her- long thrilling kisses for our honeymoon said red softly i know a fast horse that will carry double and holding her close in his arms he told her of the horse and of the tiny cabin in the desert where under a star-spangled sky they would spend their honeymoon plighted troth cascades of copper curls your hair is like a paisley shawl protecting shoulders white and fair of one for whom i dearly care who is my life my all their glory like a burnished sea alight with sunset gold reflects the warmth of love that we shall know and feel eternally what our embraces hold frances i shinn first payment on paradise by  winifred wadell she could hear him puttering about in his room as she lifted her hand to knock even after she had rapped on the door she al- most turned back to the safety of her own apartment at the end of the hall she didn't know his last name he was an inventor and his friends called him jerry that was all she knew except that she had been vaguely aware of his dis- approval the few times they had chanced to meet jerry looked like the sort to con- demn her for running around with a bunch of carefree artists more in- terested in good times than in art he was frightfully serious about his work maybe he needed money she thought it would help her plans if he did serena smiled her most bewitch-  street amp smith's love story magazine ing smile when he finally opened the door and faced her with an embar- rassed grin i thought you were one of my creditors he explained that's why i didn't come sooner i hope the surprise is a pleasant one she was somewhat embar- rassed herself he was handsome in a blond clean-cut way much hand- somer than she had realized that depends what can i do for you miss- goodhue- serena goodhue i'll tell you if you'll ask me in she smiled up at him when they were seated in his plainly furnished apartment serena looked up to meet his puzzled gaze i'm waiting to hear why you came i'm very busy you see he waved in the direction of the clut- tered work table you invent things don't you then when he nodded that's why i think you'll do this is very mystifying what can my inventions have to do with you my uncle invents things too i want you to marry me marry you he exclaimed she laughed at the look on his face only for a few weeks she ex- plained hastily i've just received word that my uncle is very ill i must leave for california to-morrow i wrote him some time ago that i was bringing my husband back there with me to settle down it should be an easy matter for you to find a husband there are many eligible men in new york and you are very beautiful his glance was one of contempt mixed with admiration this is doubtless your idea of a joke but i'm really not interested he rose as if to end the interview it's not a joke and i'm not in- terested in you either- not really she replied quickly the man i was engaged to jilted me he mar- ried another girl a week ago her lips trembled i didn't tell uncle john his name and since my uncle can't live more than a few weeks longer i thought maybe for a thou- sand dollars you'd marry me you didn't mention the thou- sand dollars i might be interested after all it's strictly a business proposi- tion she said coldly i thought you might help to make uncle john's last days happier since you're both interested in the same thing he eyed her steadily no doubt you're still in love with the man who jilted you why don't you tell me your real reason for making this proposition you want to save your face with your friends here in new york isn't that it serena felt the angry color rise in her cheeks yes i still love him i'll always love him maybe i do want to save my face as you put it but that isn't my real reason for asking you to marry me please believe that he rose to stand in front of her his arms folded across his chest looking up at his lean athletic fig- ure in worn gray tweeds serena was suddenly ashamed here was a man who took his work seriously who lived for an ideal perhaps she was missing something after all you don't know the meaning of the word love he told her gruffly you're selfish and self-centered like the rest of that bunch you run around with i know what you are- calling yourselves artists as an excuse to ignore the conventions posing as the real things when you're nothing but imitations i didn't come here to be in- first payment on paradise  sulted serena said rising to face him her brown eyes bright with anger i don't care what you think of me or my friends i don't want to be married to you for even a few weeks i'll find some one else she turned quickly away from the look in his eyes wait he commanded i'm sorry i said what i did i need a thousand dollars badly you might find a man less decent than i am i assure you i'd have no desire to take advantage of the situation he laughed boyishly i have a hunch i'd earn the money coping with that spirited temper of yours if i married you for a few weeks i'd see that you earned it she answered a dimple appearing at the corner of her mouth i'm not promising that the job will be an easy one what's your uncle's last name he asked furman- john furman have you ever heard of him i'll say i have he's one of the really great inventors why didn't you tell me sooner i accept your proposal if you'll have me i- i don't know she stam- mered it seemed absurdly melo- dramatic now her impulsive deci- sion to run down the hall and ask a man who was almost a stranger to marry her she wanted to hurt landell carnes hurt him as he had hurt her he had thrown her over for a girl with loads of money and had gone abroad with her to study art serena pretended that she had broken the engagement but she knew that her friends suspected the truth i'll try to make it as easy as i can for you jerry offered gently you've been hurt but it's mostly your silly pride i'm going to take care of you till you're back home in california he held out a strong brown hand shall we shake hands on our bargain as she put her hand in his serena felt tears dangerously close she couldn't bear sympathy now her voice was sharp with pain when she answered our bargain doesn't in- clude pity from you i'm quite capable of taking care of myself if you think you'll be able to stand me for a few weeks we'll be mar- ried this afternoon she turned and hurried out of the room to the haven of her own at- tractive apartment his name was jerome brandon and he did have decent clothes to be married in serena was thank- ful that she hadn't offered to buy him a new outfit he probably had a lot of silly pride himself she wished her friends could see her new husband in his well-tailored dark- blue suit he was far handsomer than any of the men she knew there was nothing about jerry to be ashamed of when she gave him money for the expenses of the trip he accepted it casually without any sign of embarrassment the hours that followed were like a hectic nightmare it was not until after they were on the train headed for california that serena curiously removed the worn old ring from her finger jerry had placed it there during the ceremony some initials were inside and the inscription love everlasting love everlasting she repeated to herself and laughed mirthlessly her husband had a most peculiar sense of humor here she was mar- ried to a man she barely knew while her whole being was crying out for landell dear handsome landell who had broken her heart as care- lessly as he had won it jerry's cool acceptance of the  street amp smith's love story magazine situation was more than serena had bargained for he saw that she was comfortable that she had magazines and cigarettes then left her his became ill serena glanced at jerry he was looking indifferently his lips set in a straight line it's part of your job to pretend serena had thought that landell was the only man who could thrill her and here she was trembling because jerry had pressed his lips to hers the knowledge made her angry with herself and with jerry who had kissed her merely as a friend bride alone sunk in an abyss of misery when they drove up before the rambling spanish house that her uncle had built shortly before he to like me she reminded him sharply i do like you serena he turned to look into her eyes in spite of myself i find i like you i'll play the rôle of devoted young first payment on paradise  husband when we're with your uncle i didn't mean that she said and flushed because his eyes were laughing pretty setting he said chang- ing the subject quickly it's beautiful here she agreed dully the very brightness of the scene made her feel tired and miserable as if she had already lived her life and had come to this lovely spot to die the red tile roof of the house gleamed in vivid contrast to the green of the grass and foliage everything was bathed in califor- nia sunshine if she had only been coming home with landell instead of jerry her longing to see him was at times almost physical pain this is my husband she heard herself saying to her uncle's nurse who met them on the patio and kissed serena with the freedom of long service your uncle is so happy about your marriage she said after she had shaken hands with jerry he has been looking forward to the day when you return home with the man you love she led the way to a far wing of the house where the sick man had his quarters serena choked back her tears when her uncle took her hand in his and said feebly my little girl has come back to me she has some one to care for her after i'm gone he looked at jerry then as if satisfied with what he saw you are a lucky fellow serena may have seemed thoughtless at times but underneath she's fine and true i know that sir jerry said so emphatically that serena looked at him quickly to see if he meant it i'd like to live long enough to see your children running about the place but that can't be serena looked away to keep jerry from seeing the flush that spread over her face when she glanced back at him she was surprised to find that his eyes were gentle she liked jerry in spite of herself he was so straightforward so much worth while at breakfast the following morn- ing he greeted her with boyish en- thusiasm it's a privilege to be here with your uncle he's a great inventor and he's a grand old man besides  street amp smith's love story magazine i'm glad it will make things easier she said seating herself op- posite him she had put on a becoming red- and-white knitted sports dress jerry didn't comment on her ap- pearance but his blue eyes held approval your uncle sent for me early this morning we had a nice chat about your future our future he cor- rected himself that's good you didn't let him suspect any- thing she looked at him sharply fear filled her heart trust me serena i let him do most of the talking this is going to be one of the most wonderful ex- periences of my life your uncle has given me permission to use his lab isn't that an honor then in answer to the question in her eyes i've been trying to put across a little gadget of mine that's why i went into this deal you've told me very little about yourself she reminded him didn't think you'd be interested if i put this invention of mine over it will mean everything to some one waiting for me back home some one i love very much he added tenderly i understand she murmured jerry was in love and he hadn't told her she had confided in him and he had kept silent about his own affairs she might have known that any man as nice as jerry would have a girl i've bored you with my troubles when you have plenty of your own i do hope you can put your inven- tion across i'm being paid to listen to your troubles he said with his appeal- ing boyish smile anyway i haven't been bored he was laughing at her she rose with dignity you're making fun of my un- happiness just because you have some one waiting for you to share your success you make light of my misery i- i wish i could die she cried tears filling her eyes he rose to face her across the table i wouldn't make light of your unhappiness but i wish you'd for- get that cad you were engaged to he isn't worth breaking your heart over he isn't a cad you have no right to say that you don't even know him he married another girl because he owes it to his art to get ahead he still loves me i know he does and he turned down a love like yours for the sake of his art he came around the table and took hold of her shoulders i want to be your friend serena he bent his blond head and kissed her softly full on her lips just to seal our friendship he said not quite stead- ily serena put her right hand up to her lips jerry had kissed her she had thought that landell was the only man who could thrill her and here she was trembling because jerry had pressed his lips to hers the knowledge made her angry with herself and with jerry who had kissed her merely as a friend be- cause he loved another girl never do that again she de- manded a gentleman would re- spect our bargain he smiled down at her forgive me you looked so lit- tle and sweet and unhappy in a few days serena realized that jerry was avoiding her she knew that he was spending most of his time in her uncle's lab in the base- ment she stood it as long as she ls-e first payment on paradise  could then went down and knocked sharply on the closed door come in he called he glanced up from his work scarcely seeming to see her you seem to be busy these days she said watching his long fingers move expertly over the machinery on the table yes i'm pretty busy he grunted isn't that uncle john's invention you're working on just looking it over too bad he couldn't finish it he didn't glance up he spent years working on that invention you have no right to disturb his things i forbid it your uncle has something here he said looking up at her his whole face alight you don't understand what this means i can't see why it should mean anything to you she answered and turned and left the room that night her uncle grew worse when the doctors told serena that it was only a matter of hours she went in search of jerry he was not in his room she finally found him in the lab she opened the door softly he was working furiously with grimly set jaw working as if against time she looked at the work table quickly it was her uncle's invention jerry she cried out why are you here at this hour i'm trying to finish some work do you need me uncle john is dying he's ask- ing for you there won't be time to finish she heard him mutter as he followed her up the narrow basement stairs her uncle died an hour later it was to jerry he spoke his last words carry on my boy and be good to my little serena when jerry turned away serena saw that his eyes were filled with tears jerry was a good actor she thought bitterly if she didn't know the truth she'd believe that he was really grieved as she waited for jerry in the library the day following her uncle's funeral serena's mind was a con- fused jumble jerry would soon go out of her life forever she won- dered how it would seem without him she'd miss jerry terribly miss his quick smile his eager inter- est in everything about him jerry was so frank and outspoken surely he must be honest but why had he been working on her uncle's in- vention the doubt arose again to torture her could he have known about the invention when he mar- ried her he could finish it and present it as his own work and no one would be the wiser but she wouldn't let herself doubt jerry he was going back to the girl he loved and that was that he came in quickly an apology on his lips sorry to have kept you waiting i've been getting my few belongings together i- i want to thank you- for everything you were wonderful to uncle john she studied his face for any sign of embarrassment or guilt his eyes met hers frankly fearlessly he was a dear old man i'll be better for having known him she went over to the desk and picked up a check as she handed it to him she raised her brown eyes to meet his intense blue gaze i suppose you'll be going back to new york soon he said you'll be happy to get back with your artist friends i'm not going back jerry you've made me realize how unim- ls-e  street amp smith's love story magazine portant my career is i'm going to settle down here as uncle john wished you're a wonderful girl i want to apologize for the things i said to you that first day i didn't know you- then he fingered the check absently i guess i was pretty rude forgive me every word you said was true i didn't make any sacrifices for my ideals- if i had any ideals it wasn't in me then of course it was in you you just hadn't had any reason to make sacrifices these weeks here have meant everything to me always re- member that of course they had meant every- thing to him she reflected bitterly he could go back to the girl he loved with money enough to finance his invention i hope you'll be very happy jerry she said slowly because she found it very hard to wish him hap- piness with some one else and now i guess that closes our business deal just then a servant came in with a card the gentleman is waiting in the study miss serena serena glanced down at the card in her hand and her face blanched landell was here in her house you must excuse me jerry she faltered shall i wait please she walked into the study across the hall as one in a trance she didn't know what she felt or believed any more when landell came to- ward her with outstretched hands she tried to speak but her stiff lips could form no words lovely serena he said in his caressing voice i've come back to you you've come back she echoed her voice sounding strange and far- away why and where is your wife i left her my marriage didn't turn out the way i expected he took both of serena's cold little hands in his you could always appreciate what it means to my work to have the right surround- ings wasn't your wife willing to help with your career she wouldn't give me time to work and she nagged about the bills i'm a great artist i can't be both- ered with money matters serena studied his face as she had never consciously done before he was handsome yes but there was a weakness about his mouth and chin that she had never noticed before as she looked at the man before her jerry's clean-cut features ap- peared as clearly as if he stood there in landell's place she saw his frank blue eyes his boyish smile at that moment she recognized lan- dell for the selfish egoist he was what a blind little fool she had been i knew you'd be waiting for me he said softly trying to draw her into his arms you understand me it was as if a veil had been torn from her eyes she wanted to shout aloud for joy she was free free of the infatuation that had all but wrecked her life yes i understand you she an- swered quietly i understand you at last you can make up to me for the unhappy time i've had he went on misunderstanding i suppose your uncle left you well fixed we'll travel see new places have a grand time together i don't love you landell she first payment on paradise  barely whispered i know now that i never loved you of course you love me you're crazy about me i don't blame you for wanting to punish me though he drew her to him despite her efforts to free herself as he bent his lips to hers she looked over his shoulder to see jerry's face at the door he disappeared down the hall as she jerked herself free i don't love you i have only contempt for you i'm in love with my husband my hus- band- do you hear then it s true that you are mar- ried but we can get rid of him easily enough oh yes that will be easy she said bitterly in fact i'm rid of him already then what is wrong he asked impatiently i'll tell you what is wrong i've thrown away my chances for hap- jerry's arms were about her he was whispering all the endearing things she had so longed to hear she lifted her lips for his kisses unmindful of the group of people on the station platform piness because of a cheap substitute for love i married a real man and didn't have sense enough to appre- citate him i wouldn't give the mem- mory of on of jerry's smiles for a file- time with you now go  street amp smith's love story magazine but it wasn't so easy to send landell away serena had to listen while he enacted the rôle of broken- hearted lover while he talked she heard a car go down the driveway her heart sank surely jerry wouldn't go like that without a word of good-by landell made his dramatic de- parture at last serena rushed out to the porch just as her car drove up the driver stepped out and touched his cap respectfully mr brandon made his train miss serena then he is gone she said dully her heart felt like lead within her she went inside and down to her uncle's lab as if drawn by an invis- ible force glancing about the room quickly she saw that her uncle's in- vention was gone her whole world toppled about her ears as she buried her head in her arms on the dusty table jerry darling how could you she sobbed i thought you at least would play fair she wanted to die here in this room where her uncle had spent so much time in this room that had meant so much to jerry he had told her that she didn't know the meaning of love she knew now jerry had gone back to the girl who was waiting for him now it was too late she wearily dragged herself up to her room a haggard-faced girl looked back at her from the mirror of her dressing table jerry is gone she told the image sadly he doesn't love me he has gone back to her that other girl waiting for him her gaze fell on a letter propped up against one of the ornate bottles on the dressing table she opened it with shaking hands the check she had given to jerry fell into her lap she read the words through a blur of tears serena dear i'm fading out of the picture i wanted to surprise you with news of the success of your uncle's invention i know i can put it over and it will mean a nice income for you find happiness with the man you love the some one waiting for me is my mother it might amuse you to learn that i love you with my whole heart and soul jerry it was the postscript that brought a sob to her throat just a line saying i can't take the check please accept my services as a small payment on para- dise serena could never recall how she got out of the house and into her car when she came to herself she was thundering out of the drive- way the train had been gone for twenty minutes or more there was the bare possibility that she might overtake it at the first station as she drove she prayed dear god let me be in time i must ask jerry to forgive me the california highway gleamed white in the dusk on and on sev- enty miles eighty once she thought she heard a train whistle in the distance she pressed her foot down on the accelerator and the car reeled crazily onward she kept her eyes glued to the ribbon of road unwinding before her she'd prob- ably wreck the car and kill herself but she didn't care she didn't want to live without jerry anyway the train was still at the station when she stopped her car with shrieking brakes breathing a sigh of thanks she climbed on the near- est coach she was scarcely con- scious of the curious glances of the passengers she knew that her hair was blown about her face in wildest confusion what she didn't realize first payment on paradise  was that she was altogether lovely in her yellow sports dress that en- hanced the lights in her hair and eyes red-brown hair and hazel eyes now dark with excitement she found jerry on the observa- tion platform as she took hold of his arm the train started to move jerry she cried you must come with me hurry serena his cry held longing and heart- break i'll explain later jerry the train is moving we must get off she pulled at his arm he picked her up in his strong arms and sprang lightly from the moving train putting her on her feet he faced her a stern look in his blue eyes now tell me why you are here what is wrong serena hesitated for a moment at a loss how to begin nothing is wrong she finally said bravely i just came to tell you that i love you jerry stared at her in amazement you love me but darling i mean serena i saw you in another man's arms please don't torture me tell me what this is all about i'm not torturing you and i didn't want to be in his arms if only you'd waited you'd have heard me tell him that i love my husband oh jerry won't you please come back to finish making the pay- ments on paradise my dearest one paradise is wherever you are jerry's arms were about her he was whispering all the endearing things she had so longed to hear she lifted her lips for his kisses un- mindful of the group of people on the station platform i want a husband for always and always she said when she could get her breath let's go back home now you mean let's go back to para- dise he corrected her softly and stooped to kiss her once more before he helped her into the car as they drove along in the dark- ness serena nestled against her hus- band s shoulders with a blissful sigh somewhere in the distance a train whistled lonesomely she shuddered thinking how nearly she had come to losing this man who was her very life and with whom she knew she was to find happiness forever and ever cause for divorce by  jessie reynolds kathy's hair was as brown as a chestnut fresh from the burr and as smooth there were dancing yellow gleams in it as though fires had been lighted at its roots all winter she had been let- ting it grow until now it lay a soft coil low on her neck she wore a yellow wool dress that clung to her slender figure and was belted by a wisp of twisted leather like a gold chain she had gone to the door with wade duncannon and was standing for a minute with him in the hall it wasn't much of a hall it smelled of cooking and there were worn places in the carpet and the janitor had forgotten the ceiling lights when he cleaned but wade duncannon wasn't thinking of the hall nor the carpet nor the ceiling lights and kathy knew it and her heart ached with pity at the thing she saw in his eyes you've dove's eyes kathy and smiling crookedly he added a guy named solomon told that to another woman a good many thousand years ago and if you remember solomon was a married man too a lot more married than cause for divorce  i am that's supposed to be a joke kathy but kathy didn't laugh she didn't smile i wish you wouldn't wade she pleaded and i wish you wouldn't keep making excuses for coming here evenings night be- fore last it was some papers i'd for- gotten to sign at the office before i left last week it was something else just as absurd to-night it's those bonds they're in the safe you saw me put them there your- self and this is my sister's home wade it isn't mine shiela is beginning to notice and so is bob before the look in kathy's honest gray eyes wade's dropped guiltily he said sullenly like a shamed boy i did look in the safe honest i did kathy and i couldn't find them and cameron did want them in a hurry he called me at the club as for that sister and brother- in-law of yours if they don't know i'm crazy in love with you they re blind kathy dear- his sullenness softened to pleading- it isn't as though helen didn't want a divorce she does she's as anxious for one as i am anxious to give it to her but she wants a new york divorce where incompatability and mental cruelty don't go and i'm just old- fashioned enough not to let her drag my name over every paper in this town for a- a whim unless you - there was humbleness in his eyes humbleness in his stammered unfinished question but at kathy's shaken head his humbleness was forgotten he caught her hands in a tight grasp and pulled her to him his dark eyes bored down into hers fired with jealous anger what's the matter with me any- way he asked thirty isn't old i've got money and a clean past- as men's pasts go cleaner than lots of men i know or helen wouldn't be howling her head off for a divorce she can't get it's another man that's what it is you love some one else who is he if i knew whom i had to fight if i- but kathy's fingers were on the door holding it open and her voice clear and final was carrying out into the hall and back into the living room behind her i'll find those bonds for you to- morrow wade they're in the safe right where i put them i'll come down early and get them out for you and then wade's feet were on the stairs and kathy had turned toward the kitchen and the half prepared tray for shiela that wade s coming had interrupted kathy was glad almost of shiela's headache that had sent her early to bed she was glad that bob wouldn't be home until late she felt terribly depressed wade was so kind so good even if he did have a good business and plenty of money life had given him a bad deal he wanted a home a good wife some one who would be con- tent to settle down and live a peace- ful life with him kathy knew too that he wanted her if only she could go to him if only she could let his love infold her protect her if only she could forget this blind hopeless devotion for bob that she had hidden so long in her heart that last year in the university she had been so sure of him before shiela's coming had spoiled it all so sure and so happy then shiela and her frail loveliness her blond wistful appeal had arrived and bob was her brother-in-law instead of her husband and worshiping at shiela's spoiled indolent little feet kathy sighed and brushed at her  street amp smith's love story magazine eyes shiela's tray- she must get it in to her and those bonds of wade's strange he couldn't find them she had almost reached the kitchen when a noise made her stop turn around it came from the bedroom it was shiela crying real crying not the spoiled first-of- the-month whimpering that could bring bob's arms about her in quick forgiving for a huge pile of unpaid bills this was terrible crying wild sobs with terror behind them and fear kathy ran for the bedroom and threw open the door shiela she gasped shiela for a wild in- stant her heart almost stopped at the sight of the crumpled froth of lace and silk on the floor at her feet but at kathy's voice shiela raised her head from the arm that had cradled it and dragged herself to her knees her blue eyes were horror-filled and her tiny face was twisted with fear on the floor by her side was a bottle with the cork out and the air was filled with a sweet heavy odor shiela christie kathy raged and snatched at it that's the laudanum bob got for his toothache what are you doing with it what does this mean but before she could move before she could reach shiela or touch her shiela was at her knees dragging at them crazily yelling things at her horrible things about those bonds wade duncan- non had been hunting for about being at the office and seeing them in the safe and- you mean kathy heard her- self saying slowly that you took those bonds shiela last week shiela wailed that day when i came in to see you and you left me alone to hunt for something in the file room i- i saw them there where you had put them and- oh kathy don't look at me like that don't i had to have money i just had to i owed every one things bob never had heard of that fur coat i'd told bob i'd saved the money for i paid for it with my house money and they wouldn't take it back and the grocer said he was going to sue us oh i was crazy but those bonds were worth a thousand dollars shiela a thou- sand dollars you didn't owe that much you couldn't where's the rest of it maybe we can make it up some way- borrow the money it's gone every bit of it it's gone shiela pulled herself to her feet and stumbling to the bed threw herself across it her weak face was swollen with tears tears hung heavy on her long lashes a woman i know who plays the market she- she told me if i could get some- thing to use for collateral she could make thousands for me so- so i gave her five hundred dollars and was going to get everything back before you missed it at all how did i know she'd lose it for me how did i know the market would drop like it did and out there to-night when i heard wade duncannon asking you for it when i knew they'd find me out- oh i wish i were dead i do i do i tried to kill myself and i was too scared even to die they'll send me to jail and bob will hate me he's so hard about money kathy so dreadfully hard hard kathy's eyes swept the room its frivolous lace pillows its gaudy toilet table littered with powders perfumes and creams seventy-five dollars a week shiela and every cent of it turned over to you hard and now you've cause for divorce  brought this on him oh shiela how could you how could you that's right take bob's part stand up for him you're in love with him you've always been in love with him be- fore he asked me to marry him you'd have snapped him up you're my sister yet right here in my own house you're in love with my husband you're glad i'm in this mess you want him to leave me so you can get him for yourself kathy was sick her se- cret the secret she had thought buried so deeply in her heart was discovered sheila gasped kathy shiela for a wild instant her heart almost stopped at the sight of the crumped figure at her feet  street amp smith's love story magazine at last the walls reeled the floor swayed the ivory of her cheeks was a crimson agony of shame shiela slid to the floor dragging the ruffles and satin of her bed with her she snatched at kathy's arm her fingers digging cruelly into the soft flesh i'm horrid i know i am kathy you've been so good to us living here when you'd lots rather have lived alone and paying board and all but i can't help it i'm mad you can help me out of this kathy and you've got to wade duncannon is crazy about you you could tell him anything and he'd believe it tell him you never put the bonds in the safe at all that they have been lost mis- laid tell him- he gave them to me himself kathy interrupted dully he stood there and watched while i put them in the safe and no one has the combination of that safe but wade and myself not a soul to-morrow he ll know they are gone and- well suppose he does find out shiela's words were slow she kept her eyes averted what if he does he- you could do anything and get away with it kathy kathy's voice was very still as still as her white face and dove-gray eyes when she spoke i could let him think i stole them is that what you mean because wade duncannon loves me too much to harm me i could let him think me a thief to save you not to save me alone shiela wailed to save bob kathy he's the one who'll suffer most and you know it you know what the doc- tor said about his heart what any shock anything sudden or terrible was liable to do to him she snatched at kathy's hand grabbed from it the still half-filled bottle if you won't help me kathy i'll kill myself i will when he comes home he'll find me dead and he'll die too the shock will kill him you'll be a double murderer kathy she ran for the bathroom slammed the door shut and turned the key kathy pounded on it outside on the stairs she heard the sound of feet bob's feet heard him in the hall and heard shiela's wailed promise promise i'll never run up another bill kathy never promise and then she was unfastening the burglar chain on the door with her i promise still on her lips she was grateful for the room's dimness grateful for the first time for bob's brotherly unseeing eyes h'lo sis he mumbled and threw his coat and hat onto a chair where's shiela hey shiela she's got a headache kathy replied she's in the bedroom bob better not turn on the lights you'll find a cold supper in the ice box and going to her room she closed her door very quietly on his anxious love-filled darling it seemed to her suddenly that she couldn't bear any more in the darkness of her tiny room she undressed it was warm out- side even the air of the great city was sweet with the live soft odor of spring down below a car honked there was the low caress of a man's voice and the soft laugh of a happy girl somewhere a radio was playing some one was singing a dreamy love song bob bob bob kathy sobbed for your sake for you and kneeling by the window her brown head on her bent arm she cried herself into a miserable sleep of exhaustion when wade reached his office the next morning kathy was there cause for divorce  waiting for him there were faint shadows beneath her huge gray eyes and against the pallor of her face her lips were a splash of crimson because she neither thought of it nor cared she never had been so beautiful looking at her wade flushed and fumbled with his hat and cane to hide the starved hunger that shook him his voice was casual even gruff those bonds kathy i suppose you found them cameron is com- ing for them this morning there was a strange tenseness about her silence that brought him about quickly to meet her eyes inside herself somewhere kathy was telling herself this isn't true it must be a nightmare i'm dream- ing while outside she was saying baldly her words bleak and toneless with fright they aren't there wade they aren't there i took them i had to have money and i took them to play the market i had expected to make a lot of money but i lost his hands were on her shoulders turning her to face him his eyes were boring into hers you what he was crying down at her you what say that again kathy you did what i took them i had to have money and i took them it- it- she groped wildly for a reason and snatched at the first thing her half crazed mind could grasp shiela's reason it was a fur coat i owed for they were going to sue me and i took the bonds to gamble on and lost that's a lie wade said his face was as pale as kathy's but his eyes were hot with quick suspicion you might as well tell me kathy you took that money to help the man you love what is his name if i can't get it from you i'm going to your sister and your brother-in- law i'm going to find out he was reaching for his hat when kathy caught his arm she wasn't crying she was too miserable to cry but she was sobbing dry tearless sobs that tore at her throat wade please please not that i'll pay you back i'll do anything wade if you don't tell them any thing he looked down at her clingin fingers looked into her eyes you'll do anything will you he said anything scared aren't you and all for a fur coat bosh crossing to a window he stoo there his arms crossed looking moodily down into the street below all right kathy he said at last and laughed and kathy chilled at his laughter it was so cold and mirthless and hard all right i'm taking you up on that you say you were in trouble that you had to have money you knew i would have given you ten times that sum if you wanted it yet rather than let me have the pleasure of helping you you stole it you owe me a thousand dollars kathy and you're going to pay it back do you know how coming close to her he stood be- fore her holding her eyes with his it seemed to kathy she couldn't have moved had the world come to an end she didn't try you are going to spend this week-end up in the mountains with me wade went on i've got a cottage up in the catskills and you're going there with me you're going to be that cause for divorce that helen has been wanting me to give her for so long and you're going to give me that kiss i've starved for and hungered for and dreamed of  street amp smith's love story magazine the next thing kathy knew his arms were around her his lips were on hers and a wild strange ecstasy was holding her limp and helpless in his grasp when he released her kathy stood very still and very white staring at him she was shaking her teeth were chattering it wasn't be- cause she had never been kissed before she had what pretty girl hasn't it was that she had wanted those kisses that the instant wade duncannon's lips had touched hers something had happened to her something wonderful some- thing terrible something that had made her forget everything but his lips on hers but then she was remembering again you she gasped her voice hoarse with fury how dare you how dare you she stared fasci- nated at a muscle that beat and throbbed in his white face how dare i wade asked and laughed does that mean how dare i kiss you or how dare i ask you to go up to the cottage with me you women all alike aren't you bluff promises you who were willing to do anything any- thing his words came bitterly from between twisted lips right- eous now aren't you you weren't so righteous when you took that thousand dollars for a fur coat you know i won't make you go through with it and- i won't you're cheap just like helen you're cheap and chiseling but you win he reached for the phone and got the outside office i want a thou- sand dollars in gold certificates issue l  have them here in- side an hour looking up he faced a new kathy i'm not a chiseler wade she said i'm ready to kiss you any time you want me to i'm ready to go with you too when do we leave there was defiance in her upraised chin her whole air was defiant but there was no defiance in her eyes instead there was fear the fear of a child facing the dark and terribly afraid and try as she could kathy could not hide it wade took her hands kathy for months i would have given my life to have kissed you just once as i kissed you now and you haven't let me touch you for months you could have had me my name my love and you turned them down and now you are willing to let my wife spread your name across the front page of every newspaper in this town you are willing to go up there to that mountain place of mine alone with me for two nights and a day for a fur coat it doesn't make sense i want to know his name i want the name of the man for whom you're doing this i want his name it seemed to kathy that her heart was crying that inside her she could feel its tears but outside she was quiet and still even her voice was level and controlled when- ever you are ready to go wade she said and walked away from him in her own office kathy pulled out her machine and went about her work she took dictation- wade's dictation her fingers pounding methodically at the keys she took messages- wade's mes- sages she listened to his terse hastily made plans he was to call helen's attorney and notify him when helen could get her evidence they were to leave he and kathy that very after- noon after work he said and kathy's cheeks crimsoned miser- ably no need your going home after clothes everything you'll cause for divorce  need will be at the lodge you're about helen's size and he had added his lips twisting wryly you'll have to fix it up with your family some way i'm having no irate brother-in-law bearing down on me with a gun you needn't worry kathy had replied and tried to sneer but the sneer had quickly turned into a sob she ate no lunch she thought that food would choke her but coming in to her office wade said gruffly go get yourself some coffee you look half dead she got some coffee and called shiela lily the maid who came three hours a day to clean an- swered the phone mis't christie she's out yassum    no'm i dunno whar she is    i'll tell her to call mistah duncannon's office yassum and i'll tell her you ai t comin home till monday sure i will she'll get it all twisted kathy thought and then desperately what difference does it make any- way what difference will any- thing make after monday at three o'clock she put on her hat and closed her desk the last time i'll be working here she told herself and thinking of the pub- licity that would follow wade s divorce added or anywhere else probably taking the elevator down to the street she found wade waiting there with his car his foot on the gas wade stared down at her easier to dance than pay the piper isn't it kathy i'm not complaining am i kathy asked and bit at her lips to still their trembling for a long time they rode in silence kathy thought of things of silly inconsequential things of the people they passed whether they were happy or miserable as she was of the buildings looming about them and the secrets they held she thought of wade's place in the catskills of things she had heard about it how he had built it for a honeymoon cottage and never used it how he kept it stocked with food and wouldn't have a tele- phone and ran away to it when he was tired or overworked or wanted to be alone one of the girls from the office had gone up there once with some papers for his signing and had told about it her eyes wide with awe it's glorious flowers and moun- tains and a lake all his own and electric lights and swell furniture and you ought to see the boss in a bathing suit and laughing like a kid wade in a bathing suit wade happy and swimming and young the wade who had kissed her and awakened her heart to love shiv- ering again in memory of that mo- ment's wild ecstasy kathy looked up to find wade staring down at her and her cheeks crimsoned in angry self-consciousness they left the city behind them left the main highway behind them left civilization behind them to turn into a dirt road that swirled through blue-black canyons dark with early twilight there were no houses no build- ings of any kind it seemed to kathy she never had seen anything so silent so utterly still at her side wade duncannon was still too his dark eyes on the road ahead his face in profile toward her clean- cut strong and as still too as the rocks that loomed on either side suddenly to kathy all her troubles- those that were with her and those that were before her- be- came dwarfted and utterly insigni- ficant beside these everlasting hills  street amp smith's love story magazine her shoulder brushed wade's her fingers touched his sleeve and rested there and a sudden strange peace swept her light as her touch had been wade answered to it with a quick look a spooky place these hills he said moodily have to have a good conscience to ride through them kathy a conscience without fur coats to make it tiwnge tears which she had refused to shed before pinched kathy's eyes you're cruel she cried and jerked his hot fingers held hers tight i'm not sick it's your lips i want sweet it's you i'm sick for give me your lips- his words trailed into space cause for divorce  her fingers free i- i wasn't think- ing of coats or anything else but how far away trouble seemed and- and- the car grated to a stop put- ting his fingers beneath kathy s chin wade raised her face to his and what kathy he asked what else were you thinking you touched me with your hand i didn't ask you to do it and you didn't know you were doing it for the first time in all these months you wanted to touch me i want to know why and because beneath the gaze of his steady eyes kathy felt as she had felt beneath his kiss helpless and spineless and weak she an- swered him truthfully as a child might have i was thinking it was as though you and i were alone in eternity and how peaceful it was and how sweet and i just wanted to touch you that was all just without any reason and she added irritable and pettish too as a child might have done i'm sorry you hated it so i won't do it again listening wade's dark eyes were like flames there were red spots burning high on his thin dark cheeks he leaned toward her for an instant kathy thought he was going to kiss her again and fought against that wild something inside her that wished he would steeled herself against it for very shame but he didn't and the car was on its way climbing climbing twilight deepened into night the road rose higher and higher climbed to meet the moon and the stars turned at last into a graveled driveway that darted like a white tongue from beneath an arched concrete mouth kathy climbed to the ground and while wade ran the car into a garage and locked the doors she stood staring wide-eyed at the little jewel of a house before her a white jewel of a house so white and shining that the moon- light seemed to come from it and not from the moon at all there was an arched door with a honey- suckle vine over it and a lock that wade opened to let the warm odor of a closed house out to greet her and as she followed him over the sill there were lights popping on and doors being flung open and more honeysuckle filling the whole house with its heady fragrance at the end of a soft-carpeted hallway glass doors opened onto a white pillared portico that held the star-dotted sky as in a frame and listening kathy could hear the swish-swish of water carrying the thought of beauty with it like the soft rustle of a woman's skirts kathy's voice was a hush of de- light and her hand caught at her throat for the wonder that filled it it's beautiful she cried it's dream land it's love land she hardly knew she had spoken until wade's harsh laugh brought her back to herself with a jerk worth a fur coat is it he jeered and his face was white be- neath its tan and kathy thought suddenly almost forgetting the hurt of his words that he looked ill and strange she noticed how his hands shook and how wild his eyes were and shivered in sudden foreboding as his hands pulling her toward him burned through the thin sleeves of her dress i didn't mean that kathy he said hoarsely i didn't want to say that at all i've got a rotten head- ache i've had one all day and what you said just now hit me on the raw this house is a dream house i built it of dreams that never came true it was meant for  street amp smith's love story magazine a love house and it has never known love do you want to know what helen said to me when i brought her here a bride she said heavens wade this tomb if you think you can bury me in a place like this you're crazy take me back to the city quick there's a garden out there somewhere let's go out kathy i want to sit there with you beside me and dream in the grass were tiny white flowers like fallen stars he threw himself down among them and pulled kathy to his side his hot fingers held hers tight you're sick kathy cried i know you are wade it's in your eyes it's been there all day and i didn't know it you're burning with fever i'm going in and make you some coffee she tried to free herself but he held her close coffee in love land he mocked it's your lips i want sweet it's you i'm sick for give me your lips- and then his words were trailing off into starry space and he was doubled up his hands clasped to his side his face twisted into a gasping torture of pain my side he groaned had an attack- once- before they froze it out and now it's come again up here how kathy got him to the house she never knew as far as the door he had helped her had walked leaning against her an arm about her shoulders but there he fainted a table was in the way and as he fell his head struck it a tiny trickle of blood oozed from his temple to dribble down a gray cheek kathy had to let him lie where he had fallen until she found a bed- room she was humbly grateful there were no stairs in this house built of dreams with her arms be- neath his shoulders she dragged him to it and finally got him onto the bed by the time she had his shoes off and his collar and tie he was con- scious or partly so and his face was not pale but red as fire and his eyes were burning pits that sunk away from the pain that racked them in- the kitchen- the ice ma- chine he mumbled could- could you make- an ice-pack only hope- to freeze it no- doc- tor nearer than twenty miles no telephones in dream houses you know but kathy didn't hear the last for she was in the kitchen swinging open the doors of the small ice box snatching at its tiny ice-filled trays her heart pinching with terror at the few cubes they held she found a towel and made it into a pack smashing the ice down with a cleaver snatched at random from a kitchen drawer frantically she ripped wade's shirt and slipped the freezing blessedness against his tortured side the bruise on his head was swell- ing she wet towels and laid them against it holding them there with cool white hands his lips were bleeding and leaning over she saw the marks of his teeth in them and was sick with pity she was crying and didn't know it but in an inter- val of pain wade saw it and smiled bleakly that fur coat- it let you in for a- lot of trouble he whispered and later when she had slipped her arm beneath his head that's nice dear that's so nice i've dreamed that you held me like that i've dreamed- and listening to him kathy knew ls-e cause for divorce  how kathy got him to the house she never knew as far as the door he had walked leaning against her an arm about her shoulders but there he fainted what it seemed to her there in that lonely room she must have known all along that she loved wade dun- cannon that she always had loved him what that kiss of his had proven to her and what the agony in her heart was proving to her now that if he died she must die too that she couldn't live without him out in the kitchen beside the refrigera- tor its regulator tick- ing away like mad she shook impo- tent furious little fists if only the ice would hold out if only it would make enough and make it quickly ls-e  street amp smith's love story magazine seeing the worry in her eyes wade whispered weakly don't -take it- so hard dear it's the ice isn't it it- can't last when -it's gone you can't do anything more no one- can i- i- wish you'd clear out i- i- did- what i said i would do kathy i- told helen's attorney they'll be- here they'll be here- to-morrow you -you mustn't let them find you you- you- wouldn't wish that on me kathy to die- with that- on my soul even if- you- do- hate me- you wouldn't- want- that and then kathy had him against her heart and was cradling him there sobbing to him with an agony of words that poured themselves out as though there were no end i love you i love you i don't hate you i love you you can't die you can't see my arms about you- they'll hold you fast i don't care if all the world finds me here i want them to i didn't take that money i didn't when you're well i'll tell you everything -everything i want to tell you but now nothing matters darling but that you live that you live for me and then the ice was gone and there was nothing left nothing but her love and her straining arms day was dawning when the fever broke at last where his face had been an instant before parched and burning dry suddenly beneath kathy's desperate touch it was wet and cool and his eyes had closed in an exhausted painless sleep pulling the covers over him in great thankfulness kathy stumbled to the door too tired to cry too tired to even think she was stand- ing there staring numbly at a shin- ing dew-washed world when bob and shiela rattled up the graveled drive for a second she looked at them speechless almost not recognizing them the world and all it held had been so far away then with a strangled sob she ran to meet the white-faced frantic-eyed shiela who was running to meet her with outstretched arms he'll live shiela wade is going to live she sobbed he's been sick all night long oh so terribly sick but he'll live oh i didn't know i wanted a woman so i didn't know i wanted so awfully to cry hours afterwards- centuries- seconds- now that wade was out of danger at last kathy kept no time they were gathered together about his bed he had wakened from a long deep sleep to their voices whispering in the kitchen and had called kathy's name and she ran to him to kneel down and kiss his fright-filled eyes darling it's not helen it's bob and shiela they've been here for hours they've got something to tell you that can't wait i can't let it wait not one minute not one second shiela bob it wasn't a long story as they told it bob and shiela together beside wade's bed a gaunt dusty very sober bob holding a wilted tear-streaked shiela by the hand shiela's words had come slowly at first for she had been frightened -terribly frightened but con- scious of her husband beside her of his fingers comforting her and giving her strength she had spoken her confession from brave lips her tiny blond head tip-tilted her blue eyes round and true as kathy had known she would lily the little maid had twisted her message miss kathy done spendin th week-end with mistah duncannon yassum that's what cause for divorce  she say right ova this hyar phone and frantic with guilt shiela had taken a taxi to wade's office to find him gone mr duncannon was in the mountains for the week-end he had made no secret of his des- tination there had been no need but it was the doorman who told her about kathy he had seen them drive away together that was when broken utterly crushed shiela had gone to bob with the truth -and bob was so good oh youve no idea how good she cried all this awful night when we lost our way twice and thought we'd never get here when we were so frightfully worried he never scolded me at all never blamed me but just tried to help me and now we're here and everything is all right and-- we'll pay back every cent mr duncannon bob and i every penny and i'll never run up another bill as long as i live wade's hand was weak as a baby's but it was strong enough to find kathy s and cling to it kathy he whispered darling it was your sister you were shield- ing there wasn't any man in it at all oh kathy kathy i want to hear you say it i want to hear you say there wasn't any man the question was still trembling on his lips still unanswered when another car rolled up the drive and other footsteps came hurrying through the open door and down the hall until filling the bedroom door blocking it triumphant exulting stood helen wade duncannon's wife and her attorney tall thin- faced and frosty-eyed at first confused a little by the sun outside helen had seen only the bed and wade lying there his head against kathy's shoulder and she had laughed well done wade couldn't have been better guess this will pass as cause for divorce even in new york then her eyes narrowing a trifle who's the girl haven't i seen her before i guess we'll have to have her name wade raised himself turned in kathy's tender arms his face was grim this is miss willis my sec- retary he said and helen- he smiled a little sadly a little wistfully but crookedly amused i would like to have you meet her sister and brother-in-law mr and mrs christie they are spending the week-end here with me too i'm afraid helen my dear i'm afraid your cause for divorce is no good a man who has had an attack of appendicitis over a per- fectly chaperoned saturday night can't- but you called my lawyer she broke in you told him if we'd come up to-day we'd get our evi- dence you told him that wade kathy stumbled to her feet she pushed her hair back from her tired white face her eyes were shining not dove's eyes now but star eyes misty and love-filled and sweet and her lips were sweet too up- curved and tender and crimson with the blood from her beating heart and you can have it she cried of course you can he's trying to shield me can't you see we were here alone all night bob and shiela just came we meant to be alone we love each other we're crazy about each other go on back and get your divorce i want you to have it i can't wait until you get it looking at her helen stripped off her gloves and found a chair bet- ter give me the story some one  street amp smith's love story magazine she sighed there's more than cause for divorce in that girl's face it was bob who told it told of the stolen bonds of shiela's weak- ness and kathy's sacrifice and listening totally unconscious even that she was doing it kathy buried the last ghost of her old hero- worshiping adulation behind a sister's glowing pride when he had finished helen stared about the tiny room for an instant and dabbed unashamedly at her rouged mascara-streaked cheeks some kids she said some kids and going to kathy she kissed her and then smiling down at wade i'm not such a bad egg wade after all we'll get our divorce but we'll make it via reno i'm leaving to-night good- by and take the happiness you deserve and i never gave you then her car was tearing out toward the road and wade was holding out his hungry arms and asking eagerly jealously humbly over and over again there's no one else but me is there kathy tell me please tell me darling that i'm the only man you love please and kathy was answering crying against his cheeks against his lips against his hair there's no one in all the world but you there's never been any one in all the world but you there never will be and shiela stum- bling from the room pushing bob before her blinking at the tears that blinded her knew with a happy worldly wisdom that what kathy was saying was true that once real love comes to a woman's heart all other loves are as troubles are dreams that vanish with the day stars i shall snare the stars from the sky  in a net of dreams-come-true-  silver stars and golden stars  and stars that are palely blue-  but i shall bring them every one  when dawn springs up and the night is done  i shall bring them to you and i shall say to you now this  pale-blue star i will trade for a kiss  and this one silver as frost on the pine  you shall wear if you are mine  for an hour for a day for a twelve-month gay-  bright bright in your hair it shall shine but this this star of smoldering gold  it shall be yours to have and to hold  it shall become of yourself a part  if you will place it and me in your heart a leslie day of awakening by  dorothy ainsworth heather dropped the bundle of magazines she was un- wrapping as the drug-store door opened dick cross tall and handsome his face flushed and un- shaven saluted her jauntily hello angel face ish y'workin hard you're drunk heather said quietly dick leaned against the soda fountain and yawned well y'see it was like thish last night- i know heather interrupted a note of weariness in her voice i know the rest of that speech by heart the fact remains though that we're having a flu epidemic here in broadville and you're running the only drug store in town what about the prescriptions- and what about your promise to me he scowled can't put in fifteen hours a day here i am heather retorted sorting the new magazines that had arrived  street amp smith's love story magazine that morning somebody has to be on the job doctor burns dropped in with a handful of prescriptions before seven this morning bet he came t'see you dick snickered heather's brown eyes were con- temptuous you are drunk you know he's engaged to nancy tren- ton see if a little sleep won't sober you up you can't fill those pre- scriptions in the shape you're in now y'd think we were married inst'd engaged he mumbled she slipped his ring off her finger and laid it on the marble counter we aren't even engaged heather announced calmly i told you i wouldn't put up with your drinking again he stared at her bare hand stupidly she continued i can't go on dick i've given you a hundred chances and each time that you've broken your word it has done something to me to my feeling for you i don't love you any more i can't even respect you she said with finality dick fumbled with the ring nother man he said heavily y're walking out on me because nother man heather colored painfully you had better get some sleep now i'll stay on here at the store until you have time to break in a new girl he laughed shortly y're only talking but maybe i'll call your bluff other fish in t'sea tilting his hat over his eyes he walked unsteadily to the prescrip- tion room at the back of the store he had set up a cot there for just such emergencies heather waited a few minutes after she heard the creak of the springs then she went back too and covered him with his overcoat which he had thrown onto the floor she touched his hair lightly he looked so utterly helpless that her heart contracted a little with pity -not love pity that he should at twenty-five be throwing himself away like this she had really meant it when she had told him that she no longer loved him now she wondered if she ever had loved him in the true sense of the word hand- some and fascinating he had swept her off her feet in a whirlwind court- ship she hurriedly closed the door be- tween the prescription room and the store as a customer impatiently tapped on the cigar counter it was nancy trenton very chic in a gray squirrel jacket and a tiny violet- colored hat pulled down over her short auburn hair i'm terribly sorry heather apologized i didn't hear you come in two packages of cigarettes nancy said sharply charge them to dad heather reached for mr tren- ton's favorite brand i'm glad he's better this morning she said cheer- fully oh they aren't for him nancy retorted he's still too sick to smoke i'm tired of walking around on tiptoe so i'm driving over to lin- wood to-day and by the way if grant comes in here don't let him know you saw me she said quietly it was then that heather noticed the glistening black roadster which was parked in front of the drug store the car bore a license plate of another state and a stranger sat at the wheel heather glanced swiftly at doctor grant burns's fiancée grant is so tied up with his prac- tice he never takes me any place nancy said defensively day of awakening  the man in the black car played an impatient little tune on the horn nancy hurried outside and motioned for him to stop heather saw her point her smartly-gloved hand up- ward doctor burns's office was directly over the drug store with a surging mixture of feelings heather watched the roadster drive away nancy trenton was a hope- less flirt and grant burns was such a fine chap heather knew all about how nancy had pursued him until finally they had become engaged she recalled grant's tired young face as she had seen it a few hours before and nancy was two-timing him because he couldn't take her places for just a moment heather allowed herself to be lost in a day- dream of how it would seem to be engaged to a man like grant burns some one dependable she thought wistfully her next customer was old doctor addison his eyes red-rimmed from loss of sleep his face pinched-looking and drawn he pulled off his hat and rubbed his forehead wearily dick's drunk again i suppose he said in a tired voice wish you were a druggist heather i need these prescriptions right away oh dick worked late last night but i'm expecting him in any minute now she fibbed loyally we'll have the prescriptions delivered be- fore noon hm-m-m snorted the old doc- tor what do you see in him heather you're the prettiest girl in town and you're going to marry a scamp like dick cross he looked at her evenly she showed him her bare left hand but i'm not marrying him she contradicted which means that i'll be out of a job as soon as the epidemic is over broken with dick have you doctor addison asked with his booming laugh say that will make life worth living for at least three of my patients he said shyly the door opened and doctor burns strode in my prescriptions gone out yet heather he asked worriedly i- i'm sorry she stammered it wasn't so easy to lie when grant's blue piercing eyes were upon her dick worked late last night and he hasn t come in yet he frowned funny thing i thought i saw him more than an hour ago how are things going with you doc awful doctor addison an- swered bluntly i haven't had my clothes off in forty-eight hours i'm going to grab a cup of coffee and then drive over to turner's thad is pretty low run up to my place i've got an electric plate and a coffeepot in the back room grant offered some things i'd like to talk over with you too if you don't mind he added the door closed on doctor addison's dragging heels grant smiled provocatively into heather's dark eyes you've been a soldier and nobody seems to be giving you much credit but i want you to know i think you're pretty swell he said proudly and about dick- get him on the job if you have to use dynamite i've got to have those prescriptions when he had gone heather crossed the store and looked earnestly at her reflection in the mirror behind the soda fountain dark eyes set wide apart- hair pale-gold- a small pointed face nothing spectacular she thought just another pretty girl in a world of pretty girls even if doctor addison had called her the prettiest  street amp smith's love story magazine one in town but nancy was that and nancy was engaged to grant heather turned sharply away from the mirror a little afraid of what she might see in her own eyes dick was deep in a drunken stupor she took him by the shoul- der and shook him vigorously he was as limp as a rag doll she tried sloshing cold water on his face but still he slept then she slapped him repeatedly with the palm of her hand until he sat up at last what the- he began hoarsely dick dick she cried urgently snap out of it you've got to fill those prescriptions both doctor burns and doctor addison have been in lemme lone he slid back onto the pillow dick she shook him please -dick she cried tearfully she got him on his feet and mixed a bracer here drink this heather took the empty glass from him how do you feel she asked anxiously rotten he swayed a little on his feet i mean heather explained do you feel as though you could go ahead with the prescriptions is your head clear enough sure get me some coffee and i'll be all right he said brusquely black coffee not dish water and you might write out the labels for me i'm too shaky maybe i'd better go for the coffee instead of phoning she sug- gested then it's sure to be strong enough but i'll write the labels first so you can get started you're sure you're all right she repeated i could put up old addison's stuff in my sleep he snapped there were eleven prescriptions in all heather wrote out the labels in her neat round hand as dick read them to her she often did that for him sometimes she pasted on the labels too then slipping into her coat she ran the block to the res- taurant she was sitting on a stool at the counter talking to bill the pro- prietor while she waited for the special brew of coffee when some one in the kitchen screamed bill muttered under his breath and darted through the swinging doors and as the screams continued heather ran into the kitchen too there she found sadie the waitress gripping her right hand with her left the front of her apron was stained with blood and her wrist was bleeding profusely she pulled away from bill when he tried to help her doctor burns is in his office i'll take sadie there if you'll rush that coffee over to dick yourself heather offered she pulled a clean handkerchief from her coat pocket and knotting it around sadie's right wrist she made a tourniquet with it the girl still gripped the palm of her hand so that heather could only guess as to the extent of the injury sadie's frightened screams had changed to moans of pain heather watched her anxiously as she took her to grant's office he was sitting at his desk head resting on his arms when they entered doctor addison had already left sadie sank limply into a chair and showed him her hand steady he whispered tensely in an aside to heather i'm going to need your help twenty minutes later grant took sadie home and heather was glad to drop down onto the couch in his back room she was feeling a little faint herself and she was dead tired day of awakening  besides she had been work- ing twelve hours a day and more at the drug store dur- ing the period of the epi- demic it seemed to heather that she had only just fallen asleep when she heard some one calling her name softly insistently she tried to open her eyes to rouse herself but she was too tired then strong arms lifted gently and she burrowed her face against a tweed coat that smelled of tobacco and medicine the arms tightened about her arms which made her feel so secure that even half-awake she knew they did not belong to dick suddenly her eyes flashed open and she looked deep into grant's blue ones he lowered his head and kissed her hungry kisses that filled her with a strange sweet fire without thinking heather returned his lasses pressing grant smiled pro- vocatively into heather's dark eyes i want you to know i think you're pretty swell he said whispered her soft lips against his burning ones heather grant whispered heather- dearest but nancy- she whispered back re- proachfully grant's arms dropped from her so suddenly that she fell back against the wall he groaned and thrust a hand through his light hair forgive me heather and for- get he cried in despair she laid her fingers against her lips to steady them but i can't forget i- i don't want to she cried defiantly i ought to be shot he said savagely there's nancy and there's dick- there's only nancy heather  street amp smith's love story magazine corrected him i've definitely broken with dick grant looked at her quickly and his face brightened at the good news but then it clouded slowly and he continued in a dreary voice i thought my work was all-im- portant in my life that it always would be but it isn't heather you are there was such aching desire in his voice that she made a little pleading gesture with her hand i'm fond of nancy and it wouldn't be fair to hurt her what are we to do you and i he asked des- perately heather pulled on her coat i'll go away i couldn't work for dick any more now i told him i'm go- ing as soon as the long hours at the store are over grant turned up her collar pro- tectingly and for just a moment his fingers lingered against the warm smoothness of her throat two o'clock he said at last i'd better get started on my calls good-by heather she shivered that good-by sounded so final good-by she managed and fled down the stairs to the drug store she found dick in the prescription room drinking straight whiskey well he began savagely about time you were getting back heather glanced at the work table the milk bottle in which bill had delivered the coffee and an empty cup stood there the labels were gone did chuck parks take the prescriptions in his car she asked worriedly dick jerked his head in assent where have y'been he asked brusquely she hung up her coat sadie cut her hand badly while i was at the restaurant and i took her to gra- doctor burns's office afterward i meant to rest only a minute while he took her home but the first thing i knew i fell asleep she explained wearily and i'm supposed to believe that you were sleeping all that time he pulled his mouth into an ugly line about time nancy trenton got wise to things i'd say dick she cried in horror the telephone rang and heather glad of the chance to escape flew to answer it the call was from the trenton home that was doctor burns she told dick in a startled voice he wondered if you could have made a mistake in filling his prescription for mr trenton or mixed the labels he's taken a turn for the worse it's his heart dick moistened his lips he swore softly and reached for the whiskey if he dies- heather stopped dick swallowed convulsively then he shrugged his shoulders you wrote the labels he said un- concernedly if i tell them that you made a mistake in pasting them on that let's me out heather stared horror-stricken you wouldn't she cried with trembling lips dick grinned unpleasantly burns isn't going to testify that you weren't here when the prescrip- tions went out he's not going around telling people that you two were alone in his office for a couple of hours not when old man tren- ton's money is involved he cried triumphantly she tried to think but her head was swimming and she sank down onto the cot she mustn't do anything that would hurt grant professionally heather told herself and if he wanted to clear her she mustn't let him do it bay of awakening  you win she said dully only we'd better get both doctors to check over the other prescriptions that went out this morning if mr trenton did get the wrong bottle some one has his heather reached doctor addison at carlson's and he called back an hour later to say that his prescrip- tions corresponded with their labels she telephoned grant at trenton's and he said that he would check his it was nearly five o'clock when he came into the drug store how is mr trenton she asked trying to avoid his compelling gaze oh fair considering where's dick he asked lightly heather indicated the back room with a nod of her head drunk she replied tonelessly i'm glad you came in instead of phoning she said eagerly i want to talk to you that makes it mutual grant grinned happily heather i'm go- ing to kiss that dimple in the corner of your mouth she drew back quickly about mr trenton's medicine it's best that people should think that i made the mistake that i mixed the labels on the bottles you're not to tell them that i was with you instead of dick at the time nancy- there wasn't any mix-up in labels he interrupted briskly and dick filled the prescription correctly it was nancy who caused her father's heart attack she was married over in linwood to-day mrs trenton was a little afraid to tell me under the circumstances nancy had telephoned her just be- fore i got to the house some fellow from kansas whom she had met while she was away at school mr trenton's wild with rage that's what i meant when i said his con- dition was fair considering oh heather breathed faintly married grant stepped closer and im- prisoned her hands and now darling he cried with a happy smile i'm going to kiss that dimple not here where everybody can see you she begged in sudden panic why not broadville and the rest of the world might as well know that i'm crazy about you and that we re going to be married well heather said demurely i do think you might have told me first he flashed a teasing irresistible smile and drew her into his strong arms i love you heather he whispered tenderly let me take care of you always always she answered clinging to him he kissed her eyes with their little shadows of fatigue the soft hollow of her throat her warm sweet lips when he released her at last she looked up at him bravely

had no clear idea of what to do her work on the paper had given her an idea of court procedure but her own case seemed so simple that it seemed almost superfluous to even take her to court she would

unaware of her you know you're coming up for reelection next fall the younger man was saying in an easy assured voice and my paper goes into the homes of a lot of your people i don't like to remind you of that but it seems necessary right now the mayor's fat ungainly body teetered on its toes evidently he was thinking i know he finally said but your paper's always been with my party why you'd lose readers if you swung out of line i can afford to take a chance on that but you can't afford to take a chance on losing votes the other man returned crisply there was a long silence then which seemed to be tense i know linden- it was the mayor's voice but i can't do this why it ain't legal it ain't accord- ing to law thursby linden's crisp clipped- off sardonic laugh echoed for only a moment in the corridor i've known you to be a little bit careless of the law before mayor and this is a case of have to it's copy marked must but suppose it gets found out that i came over here and inter- fered in this case like this what're people going to think what's my wife going to think yeah what's my wife going to think of my meddling in the case of a girl like this a note of triumph in his voice as if at last he was sure he had found a telling argument once more sophia sitting in her cell her hands clenching feeling as if she must be going a little bit mad with suspense heard linden's laugh that's a good one your wife what do you suppose she'd think if she knew that some of your clothes had been found in the apartment of that cabaret singer who was found murdered the other day one of my boys did a little sleuthing on his own before even the police got on the job why man that's blackmail the mayor's eyes were wide open and the words came after a mo- ment s silence oh no i wouldn't call it by any such hard name as that it's- well merely business i know but i don't see how i can do this the mayor stalled now see here- sophia listen- ing recognized the note of purpose in linden's voice- i want that girl out of here she can't come up in court her name must not get into the papers in connection with this that's the case that's what i want of you well- why linden the mayor was squirming i can't interfere with the boys here you know how we've been trying to make a clean- ing up lately the word's gone out that some one's got to be taken in for every crime reported we're not going to have a lot of cops walking the streets for nothing they can at least grab some one that looks suspicious and find something out about em make some attempt to get em and now i can't tell the first man that follows orders to lay off how would that look i'm not interested in that little and lovely  the matron surveyed sophia with cold eyes hope you don't think you can go to court in them things she said indicating the fragile pajamas got any way of getting decent things to cover yourself with mayor i've stated a case and it must go my way anyway what's it to you if she's on the level she'll get out and if they've really got something on her why then she ain t safe out anyway she's a secretary in your office ain't she with a shrewd look at the publisher sophia caught the look and  street amp smith's love story magazine understood it but somehow it brought no blush to her pale skin she had the feeling that it was all too unreal that the whole thing was some strange play that she had been called upon to act in she had an odd feeling of detach- ment i've told you what i want mayor the words coming in lin- den's cool voice were clipped off and curt i don't generally ask twice for anything the too plump man peered at the taller slimmer one with eyes that were oddly and humorously childish by heaven linden you want a man to jeopardize his whole position in town i've put effort into getting where i am and now to risk the whole thing over some little secre- tary that gets into a jam with the boy friend- linden straightened is this a refusal he asked curtly i haven't all morning to spend even on this well now- yes or no oh well you'n me've been pretty good friends sure we'll turn her loose and suddenly he was genial as if granting a favor that was of his own doing i'll call dreher and tell him to forget the case their feet sounded on the con- crete floor that means i'll take her right out with me now- right away linden asked sure sure the mayor replied eagerly willing to go all the way with the favor once he had started they disappeared sophia knew that even though linden had not looked at her once not met her eyes for even an instant the two men had been talking about her she wondered how linden had learned about her being there per- haps rhoda had gotten in touch with him at least it had been tact- ful of him not to look at her while she sat miserably in that cell she couldn't have endured that shortly she heard steps in the corridor and knew that the matron was coming toward her door the older woman stopped you sure are a lucky girl she said and in a voice quite different from the one she had previously used shaving influential friends to get you out of a jam i thought something like this might happen when i saw your address she was unlocking the door and sophia her nerves taut stepped dizzily out into the corridor vaguely she heard one of the girls back of her say some folks have all the luck and then she was following the matron blindly sophia it was linden and sophia her hands in his was trying to laugh since she knew she must do that or cry thanks i'll remember this sophia heard him saying to the chubby man who stood beside him and was eying her keenly and then she was glad that he hustled her out of the place and down to his big roomy roadster she needed the uplift of the luxury of that after what she had just gone through how did you know they were her first words and it was only with a conscious effort of will that she kept them steady hick doing an early round saw your name and inquired i nearly passed out when he told me- seemed impossible sophia said nothing for the mo- ls-e little and lovely  ment she was thinking of hick lean lanky nervous police reporter who worked on a battered old type- writer that no one else could use and always sat face to the wall i'm taking you home now would you like to stay there all day and rest you can have the day off if you want perhaps you'd better sophia thought a moment no she finally said unless you don't want me in the office i'd rather get back to work there was something timid and frightened in her voice want you in the office with his characteristic laugh we couldn't get along without you that was why i came down there and insisted upon having you then i'll just go home and freshen up and get right to work i'd rather fine linden didn't ask her anything about what had happened some- times sophia was glad and then the next moment she longed to tell him all about it and ask him what he knew of arnold's fate and that of the other man in the case she wanted to talk it would have relieved her and yet she felt she had no right to put the burden of her confidences on linden perhaps he wouldn't want to be that much drawn into the affair because sophia knew enough of police procedure to know that even though she had been released and was driving away free with her chief there would still be more to the case just what direction the rest would take she couldn't even guess but that it was not finished she knew linden stopped the car directly in front of st mark's and was out in- stantly attending her as if she might have been a queen of the realm the telephone girl looked up at her casually there was no knowl- edge of what had happened in her calm and friendly eyes the young lady left your key in your box miss ambler she said oh thanks such a lot leading the way to her apartment door she was a little bit surprised that linden accepted her invitation to come in and wait while she changed ordinarily he was at his desk at that hour immersed in flimsy for while he did none of the actual edit- ing himself he kept in close touch with incoming news- wire and local he said nothing until she emerged from the bath-dressing room in fresh clothes and smiling faintly that was quickly done sophia was glad that he injected nothing personal into the moment so far he had not asked her one question or uttered one word of sympathy it was better that way for she knew that the first word of sym- pathy would have broken the dam that was holding back her tears it would have been easy to break down and she didn't want to linden was on his feet leading the way to the door locking it and handing her the key in his car they turned directly to- ward the office at the curb he paused a moment before getting out and turned to sophia no one at the office knows any- thing about this except hick so there'll be no explanations and for that too sophia was grateful at first it seemed to her that it would be almost too difficult to take her place at her desk and go through the routine of the day but as she fell into line of duty it was ls-e  street amp smith's love story magazine the hours previous that began to seem impossible and dreamlike to her she felt as if it must have been some other girl who had rushed madly out in the night to try to res- cue arnold cranston and had only succeeded in getting herself dragged into difficulty occasionally her thought lingered for a moment on arnold she worried a little about him and yet she knew that he had so often run afoul of the police during his drink- ing that it would probably be noth- ing new or alarming to him in the evening she would get in touch with him or he might even be waiting for her rhoda of course had saved her own skin there was nothing there to worry about but instead of going straight home as she had planned when her office hours were over sophia found linden standing at her desk you're having dinner with me to- night he said if you have any other arrangements please call them off this is important there was something like fright in sophia's eyes as she looked up at him the earnestness of his voice had alarmed her he didn't gen- erally speak to her that way certainly- why i'll be glad to she replied not quite steadily would you- could we stop at the apartment so i could change a little grin twisted linden's lips as he looked down at her the dark silk of her suit looked as fresh as the moment she had put it on her soft honey-colored hair waved beautifully under her trim little hat you look perfect as you are he said then that's all that's neccessary on our way they drove uptown and along the drive where sophia looked down on water that reflected a calm summer twilight sky she remem- bered that other evening when they had been driving along there and had seen the blonde whose sharp anger had sent linden home in a blue funk sophia wondered what that girl was doing on that evening why lin- den was out without her probably she had one of those swell dates that linden so disliked in summer they were threading their way through narrow riverdale avenue in yonkers and then up through wide and beautiful north broadway and on to the open road they drove miles without a word and yet there was no strain in the silence their companionship seemed to be the sort that had no need for words it was an easy thing that blended well with a sum- mer evening after a hard day through tarrytown and the roll- ing hills of ossining on to har- mon and down a steep hill flanking the property of one of the former and well-known wives of a theatrical producer to turn sharply right and bring up at the door of an inn around which the croton river winds with lazy grace there with the car drawn close to the evergreens flanking the door linden dropped the evening paper still damp from the press when they started in sophia's lap seen it he asked no better look at it then sophia opened it and stared at the front page she felt the color draining from her face this -she asked in a strained voice- is what you brought me out here for little and lovely  partly his voice was natural only partly i do want to talk to you about this but -and he was smiling gently as he bent to take the keys from the car- i wanted the pleasure of this evening with you more sophia felt a smile curving her lips in spite of the terrific beating of her heart stepping off the porch of the inn the faint scent of evergreens sweet in her nostrils sophia was held by the sheer beauty of the night linden seemed to sense her mood beautiful isn't it he murmured  street amp smith's love story magazine thanks she said thank yourself for being such a comfortable person to know i'm not sure that's a com- pliment it is in this day and age lady fair it certainly is they were out of the car and walking into the restaurant linden who evidently knew the place led the way to a small private dining room at the right the room drew a gasp of sur- prised admiration from sophia its walls in japanese scenes were almost startling in an electric icy sort of blue its woodwork black enamel touched with gold and its windows hung with gold-toned fabric that gave an effect of per- petual sunshine its furniture black lacquer linden caught sophia's look of startled and wondering admiration he laughed softly now i haven't that purpose in mind at all if i ever make love to you it will be honest love probably in an early-american setting it seems more respectable i'm not sure that you're not one of those wicked men that one hears about i've never seen a place like this before and instantly sophia was con- scious of the fact that she had said something that might have been better left- unsaid there was a strange tenseness in the atmosphere and linden was leaning across the table toward her with an air reminiscent of a certain few mad moments in the dusk of her apart- ment that sophia had never quite been able to forget no sophia he was saying in that warm glowing voice that seemed to light fires within her own blood you haven't seen this place before there are a great many places you haven't seen things you haven't done that i'd like to take you and do with you with a girl like you beside him a man- he paused as if just realizing that his emotion was running away with him and sophia sat opposite him mo- tionless a spell seemed to have been cast over her in that moment and she forgot everything except that thursby linden who had once called her little and lovely sat opposite her and that his voice was echoing to the very uttermost reaches of her heart and then he was talking again and in his thoroughly businesslike tone but we didn't come here to be romantic young lady however easy it may be with the croton river winding down there below us and gold fish lazing in the water i want to talk to you about last night sophia looked up at him her eyes apprehensive and very young in their fright don't be frightened linden said i'm standing by and with all the confidence in the world in you little lady i just want to know what really happened last night i have the garbled police version but i want the real one and so while their dinner was brought to them sophia told him the story of the night before be- ginning at the place where she sat in the garden in her pajamas enjoy- ing the cool starlit night i see linden said as she finished and you don't want this girl rhoda brought into it because you don't want vincent nelson hurt he was looking away and there was an odd note in his voice no sophia murmured quietly you realize of course that there's going to be considerable fuss little and lovely  kicked up over the disappearance of the girl from the car of course it will never get out that they had one girl jailed for her the mayor couldn't explain his part in it and neither could any one else but they're going after that girl pretty hard there'll be orders given to let you alone but under pressure the police who picked you up may disregard those orders and come after you personally to try to get something on you don't you think then that it would be better to get this rhoda to come clean cranston won't talk not as long as she's out of the picture he says and he's apparently a man of his word sophia thought a minute i can't drag rhoda into it- not unless she comes forward herself with her story you're foolish because she won't you're risking things i'll protect you as much as i can but there may be a limit to what i can do i'll- i'll risk it she murmured and there's another phase of this since the paper came out the dead man has been identified as jack maddern member of the wealthy maddern family he was to be put in control of a beer syndi- cate- rather had just been given the job that means the maddern money will be spent in trying to clean this up little girl it doesn't look too good i feel like putting it to you that it's your duty to put the investigators on the right road by telling them what you know but they wouldn't believe me she said her slim white hands mov- ing in a gesture of emptiness with the other girl to question they would you think it s really my duty unquestionably your duty to the family of the dead man- any honest citizen's duty i had this in mind when i got you released this morning the only way i'd want to do it came thoughtfully from sophia would be by telling her and having her go to the authorities herself that would be the nicest way to do it there was admiration in the fine dark eyes with which he looked at her for a moment it seemed to sophia that her hands would have to go out across the linen tablecloth to him to be held in his but he made no move toward her so she sat motionless waiting for the riot of emotion within her to subside i'll do it then she said in a barely audible voice when she dared trust herself to speak the sooner the better to-morrow evening make it noon have a luncheon date with her and stay as long as you wish get your point over though before you leave it it's im- perative and his voice was all business again and his eyes had cooled sophia felt a distinct sense of let down and chided herself for it she had no right to mistake his interest in her she was being utterly foolish i'll try to that s the stuff the dregs of coffee in their cups had long ago grown cold linden signaled the waiter and paid the check chapter vi outside a soft fitful summer shower had rustled through the trees and shrubbery and spangled them with glistening jewels sum- mer evening with a sky set with a million stars was folding gently  street amp smith's love story magazine down over the earth- a thing of soft shadows and gentle breezes of low murmurings stepping off the porch of the inn the faint scent of evergreens sweet in her nostrils sophia was held by the sheer beauty of it city people missed so much she thought never to know the faint sounds of summer evening in the country the soft sighing of wind in the trees the vagrant scents of sleeping flowers the whir of wings in the dusk almost that was never to live linden seemed to sense her mood beautiful isn't it and there was that in his voice that made it seem as if his arms had reached out for her and then dared not claim her and had drawn suddenly back again sophia knew a sense of chill and of hurt a strange aloneness that almost frightened her and then with an almost actual physical effort she shook it off foolish to miss his caresses when they had never been hers and never had or could mean anything to her foolish to let their omission make her feel so deserted and alone and then she was sitting in the car and linden was slipping in be- side her and behind the wheel she wondered if his hands act- ually trembled a little as they took the wheel or if she only imagined that the light was so uncertain i'd like to go the other way in- stead of back to town linden said in a low voice as the motor started sophia was looking out into the night and echoing his thought a thousandfold too poignantly to speak so she merely turned and smiled at him laughing at me aren't you lady fair and he had broken the spell and was thursby linden the great publisher again but it wasn't so easy for sophia laughing at him as if she could when suddenly she knew that her heart ached with a strange empti- ness because his arms had failed to do what his voice had hinted i hope i haven't kept you from some other date to-night he said after a short silence i had to have this out with you though i want to know that you're going to be clear of things yourself no i hadn't any other date i was glad when you asked me linden turned to her sharply for a moment were you and once more it seemed that something infinitely sweet and close hung in the air something that sophia wanted to snatch and hold against her heart and never let it go but a moment later his attention was on the road again and sophia was contenting herself with looking at the river which stretched out to- ward the city like a path of silver as they drove along and the night grew darker the stars overhead were like brittle crystal against the dark- blue velvet of the sky and summer night scents assailed her nostrils it was all so beautifully dream- like it didn't seem possible that there was the city to go back to with its heat and duty sophia felt the air on her face grow gradually warmer as they ap- proached the city until finally it seemed to be fanned from huge radiators it was over all too quickly that glimpse of country in mid-summer it's been lovely she said to linden as he crossed the sidewalk with her toward the entrance of the group of buildings in which was her tiny apartment little and lovely  he smiled down at her sophia could just see his eyes gleaming in the soft light not half so lovely as you've been he said she felt suddenly foolishly word- less she knew that she should have some light flippant reply for that but none came to her vivid lips a thing that usually was easy for her was suddenly impossible she looked up at him as they stood at the door of her studio her wide and lovely gray eyes met his dark ones just as their wistfulness was at its peak sophia it came from him a trace huskily as she swung the door back and said gayly won't you come into my parlor said the spider to the fly and she would have given worlds to have recalled those words then just after her name had come from his lips sounding so like a prayer i can't think of anything nicer at the moment he was once more the perfectly controlled publisher lighting a cigarette with fine non- chalance while sophia's lips trem- bled over it and her breath came almost too unevenly to draw but he seemed not to notice and with a perfectly steady hand lifted the match to his own cigarette sweet little place you've got here he said after they d sat for a moment of silence i like it and it seemed to sophia such silly conversation such foolish meaningless words to say when there was really so much that she wanted to say to him but something had happened to the evening that whimsical mood of romance that had seemed to hang so tenderly near their grasp on several occasions eluded them en- tirely for the remainder of the eve- ning and sophia held out her hand with prim formality as linden rose to go it's been lovely this evening she heard herself saying with strained formality when she wanted to say so many other things and it's wonderful of you to have in- terested yourself in me helped me so to-day i don't know what would have happened to me other- wise and she was looking up at him very earnestly but linden brushed it all aside with an easy laugh nonsense child you'd always get by- anywhere anytime and then but don't fail to take care of that other matter to-morrow- the other girl sophia wondered if he'd even heard her reply so casual and care- less was his leaving she turned back to her room with an oddly unfinished uncomfortable feeling he'd been so casual and as for herself- she couldn't quite understand she had supposed all along she had been in love with vincent nel- son and yet it took only the near- ness of linden since that first eve- ning to set her very blood on fire to start a thousand wistful dreams in her heart and his leave-taking had been so casual yet he had troubled to come and get her that morning had put him- self in a position of obligation for her surely that meant some- thing there were other girls in the office who could take his dictation almost as well as she could her brain was chaotic that eve- ning as she turned to her bed one thing stood out even over and above her charge to see rhoda on the morrow thursby linden had  street amp smith's love story magazine spoken her name with emotion weighting his voice she held the memory of that close against her heart whatever else might come she would always have that and with all the shadow that hung over her knowing well that she was the mysterious girl who figured in the newspaper story of the murder sophia ambler slept with a smile curving her colorful lips the man she loved had betrayed his own emotion in the speaking of her name her heart sang at that new hope filled it and she loved him she was finally ready to admit that her sleep that night was dream- ridden blondes with clear high haughty voices passed swiftly through her dreaming in high powered limousines and looked back angrily men drank too much and then staggered crazily to cars which they smashed into other cars and sophia awakened herself from sleep with her own cry of fright at a collision of dreamed automobiles she went back to sleep only to dream again of hysterical girls cry- ing begging to be spared the con- sequences of their own folly sophia wasn't much rested when she awakened to the light of an- other day but she dressed with more care than usual it seemed imperative that she look well thursby lin- den would be at the office at the desk next to hers he glanced up but with only a cool good morning as she took her place near him and she felt as if her heart was sinking untold miles it was at noon that he seemed to really realize her presence she was standing at her desk putting on her hat to go to lunch you're to take your time to- day he said in a voice that held a note of gentleness be sure to take care of that matter i will and thanks she looked down at him her wide gray eyes grateful surely he must care she thought what happened to her she had called vincent's office and made the date with rhoda through him vincent had not even talked to rhoda about it so sure was he of her doing what he asked tell her it's important sophia had added just before she hung up and so rhoda appeared at sophia's apartment a bit defiantly you might have at least asked for me she said nastily something flamed within sophia at the words she had intended to be kind to the girl all her anger at vin had died out and seemed to leave her with no reason to be any- thing but kind and understanding to a girl who found herself in an unreckoned difficulty but rhoda's words swept all her kind intentions before them like so much sun-baked chaff in a strong wind because i knew you wouldn't come if i did she said coldly i knew that with vin aware of the date you'd have to keep it or ex- plain things to him and that might be difficult i don't know what you're talking about sophia stared at the girl i'm talking about the night be- fore last she finally said rhoda shrugged her shoulder that doesn't mean anything to me sophia wondered if she was hear- ing aright or if it was all some strange dream rhoda who the little and lovely  last time she had seen her was cringing and begging for protection was suddenly coldly defiant perhaps you think it doesn't sophia said after a little silence but that isn't all cleared up if you've read the papers you know that arnold's in a jam a bad one and won't talk she waited half expecting rhoda to speak but when no word came from the other girl it's up to you to do something i haven't anything to do with- i'm not doing anything you haven't anything to do with it rhoda sophia exclaimed scarcely able to believe that she had heard aright of course not no one knows that i was even out with arnold that night why should i volun- tarily step into such a mess because- the word coming slowly as she tried to understand the other girl's code- you are the only one who can tell what hap- pened who can put the seal of truth on arnold's story that he was at certain places that night with you drinking when maddem was killed they know how long he had been dead when they found him if arnold can prove that he had only reached that spot a few moments before he was found there he'll be all right otherwise- she paused dreading to say the words that came to her mind don't you see what you can do for him you can save arnold from- that's ridiculous the other girl broke in arnold has money let him spend it getting out why should i risk my position risk losing vin just to save him to spare him a little trouble it means my whole life i'm not going to do it and if that's what you called me here for you've just wasted a good lunch they were at the table and sophia was pouring tea from the quaint orchid pot oh no i haven't sophia said suppose i tell what i know i will if i have to what you know derisively what good would that do what do you know after all about your coming in here that night as you did there was a little pause during which the girls eyed each other and seemed to match purpose it was rhoda who broke the silence and startlingly i'd say you lied her words dropped into the silence of the room like particles of ice falling on cold concrete their chill seemed to go through to the very bones of sophia she shivered as she looked into the opaque eyes of the girl opposite her she had the feeling of being in some strange and horribly unreal dream this couldn't be the girl vincent nelson had paragonized he had said she was good good and who would there be to prove that i wasn't telling the truth rhoda was going on people would believe me before they would you it pays to have a good reputation you know sophia gasped at the words and stared at the other girl as if she was discovering a new kind of human i'm not going to sacrifice my- self for arnold cranston rhoda continued why should i you wouldn't be sacrificing your- self you'd only be helping arnold getting him out of a jam releasing him from all connection with that car in which maddern was found it's mad of even the police to link him with maddern's death but they've got to pin the thing on some one and arnold happened to be the  street amp smith's love story magazine person who was handy he's being made a goat of don't you see don't you want to help him make a goat of myself to help him but you wouldn't be sophia persisted i should think you'd welcome a chance to test vincent's fondness of you if he wouldn't stand by you thorugh this do little and lovely  people used to test love and all that sort of bunk nowadays you grab what you can get and let the testing go i happen to want vincent vin's going to be somebody some day and i'm going to be the wife of that somebody think he'll stand by through the rest of your life rhoda laughed unpleasantly this isn't an old-fashioned novel sophia she said people used to do those things test love and all that sort of bunk nowadays you grab what you can get and let the  street amp smith's love story magazine testing go and i happen to want vincent do you think i want to work at a typewriter all my life not so's you'd notice it and vin's going to be somebody some day and i'm going to be the wife of that somebody and you're letting things like that keep you from being honest about arnold there was unbelief in sophia s voice it was almost impossible that rhoda who had been worrying over a nephew being out at night could be so hard and callous it isn't a matter of that- it's what's going to happen to me that i'm thinking of i can't afford to do anything different than i am then i suppose sophia began in a lower tone that it would be just as useless to tell you that i'm in the jam almost as badly as arnold is mr linden has gotten me out i spent a night in a cell for you it s pretty indefinite whether i'll stay out or not rhoda paused on that for a mo- ment then surely if your boss -with a peculiar intonation - can get you out he has influence enough to keep you out and that should be enough for you let people stew in their own juice i say if arnold hadn't been drinking so much they'd believe what he says and he'd be all right he needs a lesson so do a lot of us rhoda but not quite this cruel a lesson well is there anything else you want to say to me she had finished the crisp salad sophia had put before her would there be any use saying anything else to you not if it's along the line you have been talking sophia sat staring out the low windows at the back of her apart- ment windows that looked out onto the garden she loved the pool where fish that she had actually made friends with moved like darts of gold the trees and privet that swayed in every breeze that passed but she saw none of the beauty of it she was thinking of a number of things of love and the things it did to people rhoda cheating cruelly and calling it love the exquisite blonde polluting linden's leisure hours with musts and calling it love love was a word she decided that could mean almost anything or nothing at all well it was rhoda smiling faintly a tinge of triumph in the smile she evidently felt that she had won her point sophia looked up at her studying her face intently for an instant well nothing i guess she said finally there just isn't any more everything's been said that can be i don't know what next and then she paused a moment a strange little smile twisting her vivid lips as an idea rather a memory came to her she said you're getting away with this just as you got away with that story about the attempt at kidnaping you aren't you or at least you think you are it startled rhoda for a moment caught her off guard but only for a moment she grinned well it worked anyway didn't it she asked vin didn't let me go home alone any more i'm not so dumb after all pretty cheap stuff though a trace of loathing in her voice as she thought back to the night rhoda had told that far-fetched tale well all's fair in love and war ole dear and this was both it little and lovely  worked just as what i'm doing now will work i hope you know what you're talking about is that all you wanted of me yes that s all sophia replied quietly not looking at the girl well -with an attempt at airiness- thanks for a nice lunch rhoda stood at the door a moment and waited for a reply then when none came she closed it and passed on out into the heat of mid-after- noon sophia in the cool dimness of her apartment looked at the clock on the high old mantel half past two they had sat long at lunch and accomplished nothing she must get back to the office she was just rising ready to powder her nose and put on her hat when the telephone tinkled something about the sound breaking into the quiet of that hour startled her though actually there should be nothing alarming about the ringing of one's telephone that is what one had it for she answered it and started a little at the voice that she heard she listened a moment but i can come she said no don't linden said crisply i'd rather you wouldn't i've got- ten wind of something don't be alarmed i can handle it but please don't come to the office all right if you say so and she knew that thursby linden must have heard the tremor of fear in her voice for his reply came quickly i'll be there in as near an hour as i can make it meantime don't let any one in unless you know them all right sophia's slim white hands were icy as she turned from the tele- phone fear clutched at her heart like a strangling hand and then she tried to laugh at herself what after all had she to fear she had done nothing quite accidentally she had become en- tangled in a crime but she had no part in it she was even free not even out on bail so what had she to fear she tried to laugh herself out of the strange mood that had sud- denly possessed her she scoffed at herself why she hadn't even the courage of rhoda rhoda laughed at the whole thing and she was really a part of it she flayed herself for a craven but her hands trembled as she washed and put away the dishes and some of the fine china showed nicks as it was put back on the shelf sophia turned from it rue- fully she had loved that set- orchid and thin as an eggshell against her soft green linens it looked like an exquisite garden she slipped out of her office clothes and into a soft eggshell white with a stunning sash of black if thursby linden was coming to see her no use of reminding him of the office and it was nice to dress up for a change- nice she realized to dress up for him but still her hands trembled a little over the fastening of the smart heavy sash it was longer than an hour be- fore linden appeared and when finally he did sophia knew a sense of relief at least with him there nothing could happen it was nice of you to let me have the afternoon off it's so warm she said after all her fever of anticipation falling back into the employee-and-employer attitude she had wanted just for that once  street amp smith's love story magazine with him to live up to the dress she had put on and then failed i think i was doing myself a favor in giving myself the oppor- tunity to come here he said settling in a comfortable chair light- ing his cigarette and then sitting back to look admiringly at her i wonder if you have any idea of how charming you are i wouldn't mind a bit being told with an audaciousness that doubly enhanced her fragile love- liness thursby linden's dark eyes were warm with something more than admiration as he looked at her he bent and caught her hand as she passed him and staying her progress lifted it to his lips we'll come to that later i always like to leave the nicest things until last right now we have something rather serious to talk about don't get frightened as he saw the dark points of alarm widen her lovely gray eyes i just want to put you on your guard lady fair so that we can give you the maximum protection protection from what well -and he was trying to laugh slightly at the thing- from this sort of thing he rose moved to the studio couch where she sat and dropped down beside her and held out a bit of paper upon which words were crudely printed i don't know how much there is to this he said well concealing the alarm that he felt but it's best not to miss any bets in a thing like this we've got a new kind of criminal to deal with nowadays a new sort of desperation more petty and still worse to deal with a thing that stoops to a depth of vicious cruelty that normal people can't quite conceive of i'm telling you this sophia not to frighten you but just to put you on your guard -very much on your guard sophia took the piece of paper and looked up at the man forcing a brave little smile to her lips i'm not afraid mister with a funny little swagger of bravado bring on your bold bad men but her pale face became even a shade paler as she read the crude words on the soiled paper she looked up at linden speech- less a kid a little street urchin brought that into the office straight to my desk this noon shortly after you'd gone he scooted past every barrier no one could stop him barefoot and ragged and came straight to my desk some one had put him wise as to just where to come with that and you little lady evidently were shadowed this noon as was your guest no startled the word burst from her lips i'm afraid so whoever it was who murdered young maddern knows that i'm here right now he said quietly and it was then that sophia noticed that he had been speaking in a very subdued tone since his arrival at the apartment but you have nothing to do with it- we have nothing to do with it i know child but they've got a goat there- arnold cranston- and they don't want your story to re- lease him and set the police on the trail of the real killers coppers get funny when they're driven by the chiefs and there's been a drive lately a hard one higher-ups have been criticized because mur- derers thieves and kidnapers have been getting away with their swag and no one has been caught the higher-ups have brought pressure to bear and the result is that the cops little and lovely  are going to bring in some one for every crime now as long as they have some one to pin a thing to they won't make much of an effort to get any one else as long as they can hold cranston there everything will be hunky-dory cranston's pretty much alone in the world there's no one turning heaven and earth to get him out poor bird and he's evidently too much of a man to give this other girl away but he will give her away when he realizes how serious it's going to be with him i'm not so sure he replied in a tone as if he himself wondered at the fellow i've been looking into that and the strange part of it is that he's fallen into an attitude of not caring he seems to feel his life isn't worth mixing other people up in trouble and so he isn't saying a word but he can't do that why it's crazy of them to accuse him- crazy there isn't a bit of evidence that points to him of course there isn't the case against him is as full of holes as a sieve there just isn't any case against him but what difference does that make until some one else shows up they've got him and the wheels of justice are moving along and of course the time will come when it will be too late to do anything even if any one would sophia stared her eyes were wide with horror it seemed im- possible that her innocent hurrying across the street that night could have resulted in so much turmoil it seemed impossible that the processes of law and the thing called justice could be so weird there was nothing sane or sen- sible about holding arnold any one could see that but the trouble was no one wanted to that is no one who mattered sophia looked down then again at the note in her hand she shivered as if a cold wind had blown over her and closed her eyes for a moment chapter vii when sophia opened her eyes again she felt linden's gaze upon her and saw in the dark depths of his fine eyes that warm gentle thing that had gone so straight to her heart and held it once before she made an impulsive movement toward him her slim white hands went out involuntarily through the cool dimness of the room it seemed to her that her very heart was crying out in its loneliness and longing and then the sharp ringing of the telephone bell shrilled through the silence sophia started a mask of fear lay for a moment over her white startled face the thing was getting her nerves linden understood he was on his feet beside her he had her hands in his small cold fluttering he held them firmly hold on to yourself he said in a low calm tone you really haven't a thing to fear as long as you're careful and i'm seeing to it that you're that let me listen while you answer sophia lifted the instrument and spoke into it it seemed that she waited a thousand years for some sound from the other end of the wire it came finally low guttural horrible say lady if you like the place you're livin better lay off the  street amp smith's love story magazine sophia shivered and closed her eyes when she opened them again she saw in the dark depths of linden's eyes that warm gentle thing that had gone straight to her heart and held it once before idea of spilling what you know about the fellow that's up for the maddern killing there was just a moment's silence then and we don't mean mabye before the man had finished ls e little and lovely  speaking linden had rushed from the room to the operator out in the hall find out where miss ambler's call is coming from please he or- dered crisply the girl plugged in investigated and then turned to the waiting man the party's hung up and there's no way of tracing him she said politely thursby linden managed to thank her just as politely and then hurried back to sophia to find her standing white and frightened the telephone still in her hand linden took it from her and re- placed it that was close he said i ex- pected it but it came even a little sooner than i thought some one followed your girl friend here and listened to your conversation do you think we'd better warn her sophia grinned cynically she's safe a forty mule team couldn't pull the facts from her she's going to let things go just as they will then the less we say to her the better she might even turn in with the other side i suppose things like that do happen though rhoda's supposed to be good with a trace of sar- casm in the tone her courage was returning to her flooding back and washing before it all the fear that had rioted her there was something to fight and she was ready for it suddenly she seemed to gird her- self for battle she even stood and pulled the smart black sash a bit around her linden grinned you have the air of getting ready for battle he said that's just what i'm doing i suppose this is what that note meant i'm the dame that was to keep her trap shut yes little and lovely they dared refer to your exquisite mouth in that way he exclaimed in ten- der humor i'll make them pay in humor but there was something grim about it i'm going to be one of those girls that makes them pay and pay and pay if you know what i mean there was frank admiration in linden's eyes you're made of swell stuff sophia he said his voice echoing the admiration of his eyes and you're made of grand stuff she was standing hands behind her looking up at him and then with a gay little laugh aren't we the bouquet slingers though but with me sophia i'm afraid it wasn't a bouquet there was a rather tensely quiet note in his voice you're not insinuating that my flowers were any less real than yours no only that i don't deserve them so much a brave woman is something sophia a brave one who is at the same time generous and feminine and lovely should i take a bow she asked laughing with sweet lightness i think you should and then for a moment they stood looking at each other again with that peculiar warm tense electric current passing between them sophia felt as if his arms were reach- ing out for her she had the sensa- tion of being held in them and yet they were standing apart his arms down at his sides but after all the joking's over -her voice was quite serious- threats or no threats i'm not go- ing to let arnold cranston pay the ls-e  street amp smith's love story magazine terrific price that he's apt to have to if some one doesn't interfere i'm going to talk when the time comes regardless thursby linden's hand moved up in a staying gesture as if he would have stopped the words that some one listening in might hear but it was too late they had poured from sophia's vivid lips with young and passionate earnestness sophia in low voiced protest she stopped then and looked around as if there might be some one in the room what a rash child you are and then once more they found themselves standing staring at each other have you a date for to-night linden asked finally and quite frankly sophia grinned no tall and handsome she said i told you i'd been stood up i haven't any dates any more i'm all out of them that boy will come running back as soon as he finds out how lucky he was when you looked at him but that's neither here nor there if you haven't a date how about going out with me i have an engagement with that blond queen who spit fire from the limousine the other night but why not come along with us sophia stared at him for a mo- ment do you realize what you're ask- ing thursby linden she ques- tioned do you know that you're just begging for trouble when you suggest such a thing to that girl linden laughed easily you don't know her he said lisbet likes meeting people better than anything she does you know she's one of those girls who's always studying types- oh very seriously because she's going to write a book some day she'll be crazy to know you you'll be something new to her she's often asked me about the girls in the office i know but asking you about them being mildly curious about what kind of fish flesh or small fry they are and going out in the same party with them are two quite dif- ferent things ole dear if i may say so you may say so little and lovely catching her mood but that doesn't mean that i believe it i know lisbet she's got her funny little ways but on the inside she's all right i'm going to call her and before sophia could say any- thing more he had the telephone in his hand and was giving an east side number surely sweet i'd love to i'd be thrilled i think that s grand perfectly grand linden had drawn sophia into the circle of his arm and held the phone so that she could hear what lisbet's high sweet voice said and so you see he said after hanging up that's that he had just turned from the phone and they were standing very close he looked down at her for a tense moment gripped her shoul- ders and held her so for an instant then he pushed her from him run away before i kiss you he said trying to speak lightly but not quite able to mask the emotional huskiness of his voice is it to be a very precious date to-night or semiprecious she asked quickly looking up at him quizzically and trying to hide the emotion that had surged through her own being in that close moment i'd say precious- he had got- ten control of himself again- but of course you're talking about little and lovely  clothes as women always are so let's say semiconscious and you stay just as you are that dress is per- fect you're a dream in it thank you kind sir her elaborate curtsy in the dim light was an extravagantly lovely thing and now come here young lady and let me very seriously tell you that aside from wanting very much to spend the evening basking in the cool light of your beautiful eyes i haven't wanted you and your young rashness to be alone to-night she stepped back in mock offense then it wasn't that you were pining for my society just as sort of protector like a mustard plaster in cold weather or something linden laughed well you could have picked out a little nicer simile i don't know that i'm flattered a mustard plaster sophia laughed lightly- a laugh that was like the chiming of a thou- sand silver bells at twilight a laugh that was like a soft breeze blowing over a colorful garden at vespers that makes it all right said linden anything's all right that starts the music of your laugh have you ever listened to it your- self little and lovely it's the most beautiful thing some day when i'm very down and in need of flattering compli- ments i'll laugh and listen to it and try to remember that lovely thing you've just said i could say so many things so much lovelier there was a sud- den earnestness about his voice that sophia recognized and that all but stayed the mad beating of her heart the room seemed suddenly to be filled with a tense undercurrent of emotion to be continued beginning next week beginning in glittering girl may christie's latest novel in serial form miss christie

how society acts when it takes off its party dress out next week two in love by  dorothy cox hesse less than half a dozen passen- gers occupied the  bus when eloise got on just one minute before it left the city termi- nal for its night run to the sea this was the season of the year when the northern pacific beaches were not so popular storms were frequent and fogs were of almost daily occurrence but eloise mer- rill's heritage was of the sea her great-grandfather had been a sea captain sailing to the far east her grandfather had owned a steamship line and her father cecil merrill was a shipbuilding magnate who had added to his riches another for- tune by marrying eloise's mother this evening eloise was doing an unprecedented thing on an irre- sistible impulse she had boarded a bus instead of driving her own fast roadster she had left a note for her mother telling her not to worry or to be an- noyed this once she'd decided be- fore it might be too late she would have a taste of unhampered unher- alded unphotographed freedom she craved a week-end trip like any other average young girl who wasn't flat- tered deceived publicized and sought after at every turn and the very good-looking young man seated directly across the aisle was not at all unaware of her amaz- ing beauty he could scarcely take his eyes off her yet somehow his frequent and admiring glances in her direction were not offensive the two in love  first time his dark-gray eyes met eloise's hazel gold-flecked ones she experienced a quick delightful thrill this in itself was unusual for she was used to being stared at eloise had everything that other girls long for beauty health wealth and a high social position but she wanted something more and that particular something was the one thing which seemed hopelessly im- possible to obtain she longed to love and be loved romantically ardently for herself alone stripped of the allure of great riches she looked out the window but scarcely saw the darkening fields or the flaming foliage of autumn she was lost in thought wondering about the dark-haired young man dressed so becomingly in a brown tweed suit who was he what was he and why was he aboard this clat- tering bus bound for the practically deserted beaches he had a metro- politan successful air about him she had glimpsed a leather brief case partly covered by his folded over- coat which lay on the empty seat beside him probably an ambitious bond salesman or a prominent young lawyer she wanted terribly to know she couldn't resist a second glance and was amazed to find her heart thumping faster when their eyes met his eyes smiled a friendly greeting and involuntarily her warm sweet mouth curved in a provocative smile but she turned her head away quickly and con- tinued to stare blankly out the win- dow suddenly the bus left the state highway and almost immediately a strong wind came up eloise pulled her green béret with its cocky little feather more closely over her cop- per-colored hair and reached for her green swagger coat like a flash the young man jumped up and held her coat for her may i please he begged wouldn't you like some of the win- dows closed yes thank you exclaimed eloise eagerly then after the briefest of pauses you can tell im- mediately when you reach the coast highway it always gets so windy she smiled up at him and he smiled down at her and at that very mo- ment a lurch of the swaying bus landed the stranger directly into the vacant seat beside her we'll soon be running into a fog she ventured and hoped that her voice did not betray her delight over the happy accident going far his voice was deep and soft to de lake she replied i've friends who always spend a month in the fall at their cottage there they hate the summer crowds and like to watch the storms and she added with an enchanting smile and a flash of her beautiful white teeth so do i i love to see those tre- mendous waves dash so madly against the rocks and bombard the lonely beaches it's savage and overwhelming and it thrills me more than anything i know of i know he declared understand- ingly it gets me that way too sort of fills one with strange wild yearnings for one hardly knows what we're pagans i guess laughed eloise or romantics he smiled down into her eyes for a few minutes there was si- lence then how far do you go she asked as nonchalantly as pos- sible while her heart pounded furi- ously as she waited for his reply she didn't want him to leave this gallant stranger who already seemed  street amp smith's love story magazine like an old friend it seemed strange but she needed him he was so real so understanding and he didn't know she was a poor little rich girl running away it was surely fate which had prompted her to hop onto a public bus for a long night ride alone maybe she was a romantic but she was already prac- tically certain that this clean-cut good-looking soft-spoken stranger was the one man she wanted the mere thought that he might not re- ciprocate and fall in love with her almost sent her into a panic i'm bound for agate beach he told her my chief is staying at the inn under doctor's orders to rest and play golf in the salt air i'm taking down some blue prints for his approval your chief queried eloise ex- periencing a momentary sense of disappointment because he was not what she had thought yes he explained he's the senior partner of west harris amp west architects i'm secretary chief secretary i suppose you'd call it oh replied eloise i've heard of the firm a very old established company sort of pioneers on the coast aren't they and literally roll- ing in wealth then without waiting for his an- swer she went on too much money is an awful handicap i think suddenly aware of the slip she gave a gasp of dismay this young secretary with the warm pleasant smile and clear eyes must not suspect that she was one of those with too large a share of the world's riches she wanted to win him with- out that ever-popular lure resolutely she turned her face to him i've had ample opportunity to learn something about rich peo- ple she hastened to explain i'm traveling companion to a very wealthy restless and discontented woman she and her husband mar- ried to combine two large fortunes and to please their parents but i don't think mere liking is enough of course she couldn't ever have been a romantic she finished smil- ing up at him roguishly like you he smiled in return and then but you're amazingly wise for a girl so young well she continued with a little shrug i've been around a good deal traveling all over one picks up a lot i've made three trips to europe two to the orient one to rio de janiero and two to florida with my- my employer and she's never satisfied when she's here she wants to be there and when she's there she wants to be elsewhere you think settling down would appeal to you then he asked mis- chievously eloise was thrillingly conscious of the ardent look in his eyes the sup- pressed eagerness of his voice he was undoubtedly falling in love with her he must be and it was fate that had brought them together she shivered a little if she hadn't taken this shaky bus she'd never have known this de- licious achingly sweet feeling which was filling her being with a warm happy glow she longed to snuggle up close to him to let her head drop on his shoulder and ride on and on through the windy darkness with the fog sifting across her face spraying it like a pin-point shower you're cold he murmured soli- citously i'll close those rear win- dows altogether when he resumed the seat beside her they as with one accord sat huddled together and the warmth and masculine strength of him so moved and thrilled eloise that her two in love  lovely face flushed hotly if her fastidious conventional mother could see her now she'd go into a heavy faint but what eloise asked herself did her mother know of the kind of love that flames up like a torch in the darkness to warm the heart and carry one away with joy his arm which lay across the back of the seat slowly slid down to her shoulder his hand pulled her fox fur more closely about her face and remained there eloise did not re- sent it on the contrary she felt a delicious tingle racing through her the bus slowed down ahead of them lights blurred drunkenly in the thick fog twenty minutes here for lunch the driver an- nounced they were the first to alight in- side the little cafe it was cozy warm and cheerful they sat on stools before an immaculate lunch counter and ate hot clam chowder sand- wiches and coffee delicious chowder exclaimed eloise the best i ever ate he de- clared and eloise who had eaten the richest and most expensive foods in most of the famous hotels of eu- rope wished with all her heart that she might go on by this young man's side forever eating in homy little inns enjoying simple pleasures the yearning in her heart became an ache a deep argent hunger to pos- sess and be possessed you haven't told me your name he reflected suddenly when they had drunk the last drop of steaming fragrant coffee i'd like to know because you see i can't let you go without some assurance that i can find you again and soon he added fervently but i'm sailing for hawaii next week replied eloise regretfully and intentionally neglecting to give a name she would have to think up one she told herself nervously my restless lady wants to drink in the sunshine and grow slim on a diet chiefly of pineapple she laughed they were back in the bus again and moving slowly onward through a strange eerie world blanketed with ever-thickening fog while well out from the shore line the melan- choly sound of a whistling-buoy gave almost continuous warning to ships of the nearness of dangerously concealed rocks another half hour and you'll be getting off he announced ruefully as if he too were affected by the peculiar loneliness of the dreary night please trust me and be- lieve what i am going to tell you i never dreamed i'd be lucky enough to meet a girl like you there are things i want to say that i can't say here would you mind if i stopped off at de lake to-night and came to see you at your friends cottage in the morning i'd be glad to see you again in the morning she answered trying desperately to control the happy tremor in her voice if it isn't stormy we could have a round of golf if you'd like we can borrow my friends clubs there's a tricky little course near by that would be wonderful he cried i'd better tell you my name now it's stephen mccready and mine fibbed eloise is louise morgan two hours behind schedule they alighted stiffly from the bus the sleepy night agent emerged from his tiny office and directed stephen to the hotel then he picked up eloise's bags and said he would take her down to the hardings cottage grace and jim harding were pop- ping corn over red-hot coals in the  street amp smith's love story magazine fireplace when she stumbled into the warm bright living room we'd given you up grace cried did you have a breakdown or did the fog delay you it was the fog eloise explained after she was seated shivering be- fore the fire telling them about the trip she omitted only the impor- tant detail that she was hopelessly in love with a sort of glorified chief clerk whose name she had learned only fifteen minutes before this information she imparted to grace later when grace was curled up in bed under a woolly comforter while eloise cold-creamed her face and unpacked you're plain crazy grace ex- claimed you know you wouldn't dare marry him you'd ruin both your lives your worlds are too far apart you've just gone absurdly romantic next week on the boat you'll be having an exciting flirta- tion under a tropic moon and forget stephen to-night i think you've got a touch of fog on the brain eloise gave her a disgusted look and the week after that she stormed mother'll be trying to marry me off to that count belfern we met in palm beach last spring he's meeting us in honolulu and i'll be causing mother headaches and no end of woe because if ever i did have the idea that i might marry him and pay his bills and add new distinction to his ancestral castle it's all off now since i've met stephen and learned about real love i wouldn't marry a prince with a throne in the immediate offing you're being a little ridiculous elose besides do you want to break your parents hearts their hearts won't break and you know it grace only their ego would be hurt if i marry as they'd say beneath me they want me to make a brilliant match to uphold the family name and all that but i don't care a snap about such things now i want to exercise my right to choose my own future mother and dad had their choice now i'm going to make mine but don't forget grace per- sisted that you've deliberately de- ceived stephen and another thing he might not relish the idea of being just a rich girl's husband that's what's bothering me most right now eloise admitted how- ever dad may disinherit me i doubt it grace said de- cisively he may threaten to do so and stage a few wild gestures and then relent but even so there's the cool million or so your grandmother left you outright what would you do about that heavens cried eloise in dis- may honestly grace i forgot all about that suppose it would be a stumbling block still we could put it in trust or whatever it is people do for their children or keep it for our old age or if stephen is hope- lessly proud and set we could give it to some charity or whatever stephen advises for getting rid of it grace sniffed and shook her head dismally you are sunk if you actually think you could live on a clerk's earnings i give up it's no use arguing but don't tell me a year or two from now that i didn't warn you she advised solemnly then you and jim won't give me away but you'll let me tell him after he- after he tells me what i think he s going to exclaimed eloise a bit incoherently and with slightly less assurance what if he really wasn't as serious as she'd thought or suppose he saw everything differently in the morning she felt a little panicky two in love  i'd marry you no matter who you were she whispered huskily i love you so much his arms tightened around her his heart pounded at thethought of her great love for him it would be more than she could bear to lose him now count on us of course said grace encouragingly and ask him here for lunch if you're still on speak- ing terms after the golf or love game  street amp smith's love story magazine and now good night and for pity's sake don't lie awake losing your beauty sleep thinking about how to live on fifty dollars a week but eloise did lie awake hours and hours and decided if worst came to worst and he would not accept her money she would indeed have to learn to figure costs and make budgets the prospect didn't please her but she wanted stephen so badly mentally she tried to budget forty-five or fifty dollars a week to pay rent food and clothing bills but it wouldn't come out anywhere near right then she'd go over it all again but forget half of the items until the whole business was dismally depressingly discouraging exhausted finally she went to sleep the next morning was clear the sun came out and the sea was a deep bright blue a good omen eloise thought as she dressed in her most becoming soft wool dress a golden-yellow and chestnut-brown combination which did bewitching things to her almost amber-colored eyes and shining bronze hair stephen came just after they had finished breakfast and almost imme- diately they departed for the golf links they played two holes and then sat down on a bench in the warm sunshine i couldn't sleep he began for thinking of you it's terribly soon to be saying it but i love you louise the minute i saw you something wonderful happened that had never happened to me before nor ever will again it isn't given to a man to love twice this way i can't give you up he cried pas- sionately if there's any hope at all for me please tell me at once for i can't stand this uncertainty an- other minute he had firm hold of her hands as if he were afraid to let go of them i loved you from the very mo- ment you stepped into that rickety old bus and somehow i felt that you returned my love tell me quickly darling was i right he gazed at her an excited glitter in his eyes yes stephen she murmured in a soft tremulous voice i love you too you darling he cried then after a hasty glance about the course he snatched her into his arms and kissed her lips her eyes her glorious hair i haven't much to offer a girl who's had the world for a playground he whispered against her soft cheek but if you'll take the big chance with me some day i'm sure i'll stand at the head of something instead of at the bot- tom are you willing to give up your position my sweet and stay and marry me and now suddenly eloise was fearful truly afraid to tell him of her deception and of her immense wealth he was just as she had suspected the kind that wanted to win his own place there had been pride and ambition in his voice when he said some day i'll stand at the head of something she turned her face away she didn't want to see his eyes condemn her yes i'll stay and marry you stephen she whispered softly but wait wait she cried wildly as he was about to take her in his arms again i've a confession to make i'm not a paid companion i'm that unhappy rich woman's daughter i'm terribly disgracefully wealthy stephen i'm eloise mer- rill i hated it deceiving you but you do understand don't you she pleaded lifting her beautiful be- seeching face to his it was the two in love  only way i could make sure of being loved just for myself very tenderly he gathered her close you'd marry a nobody a comparatively poor man eloise his voice shook with emotion i'd marry you no matter who you were she whispered huskily i love you so much his arms tightened almost fiercely but still she felt there was some- thing troubling him a look of in- decision flickered across his face what is it she demanded fear- fully i was just thinking people say very uncomplimentary things about a poor young man who marries a very rich girl i knew it she cried pulling away from him and looking straight into his eyes at least i was afraid you'd feel that way so i thought it all out before i went to sleep last night and i'm willing to give up all my money and live on whatever you make with your love and help i can learn stephen father can cut me off except for a small dowry and i'll give the fortune my grand- mother left me to some worthy charity stephen held her off and looked at her his heart pounding at the thought of her great love for him until a suspicion of tears dimmed his eyes and he swallowed painfully i don't deserve you he said very sol- emnly but all the rest of my life sweetheart i shall try to make up to you for that brave little speech he kissed her again and then con- tinued i'm ashamed too for putting you to such a test but you see precious it's been almost an obses- sion with me to find a girl who would love just me i understand all too well what you have had to contend with it's been practically the same with me so when i knew i was falling in love with you last night i deliberately deceived you same as you did me i'm stephen mccready west junior partner of west harris amp west and some day i'll be the head of the firm i had a little smash-up with my car yesterday afternoon that's how i happened to

careful in handling sharp instru- ments this is a time for you to stay in a groove to some extent otherwise you will suffer financially taurus husband the taurus husband is an autocratic in- dividual he is practical loves his home and insists upon order and system he is intense jealous strongly physical and not interested in persons on the outside when they interfere with his schedule and exist- ence he loves beauty color and the romantic side of life becoming very tem- peramental when routine is disrupted the taurus man is emotional and fixed in his opinions if you wish to have harmony with this life partner be tolerant of his ideas and do not openly oppose him he needs to be prodded gently and subtly but his stubbornness is notorious and dictation is something for which he will not stand in the least degree never play practical jokes on him his sense of humor does not extend that far taurus men have moments of morbid resentment toward life and toward persons associated with them they are very sen- sitive and are likely to brood over matters for a long time before doing anything about them facts and reality are the keynotes of the male taurean's existence he likes to sift everything to its actual source and if you think you are fooling this man over a long period of time you have another thought coming it is rare to see these husbands swerving from their ideals prin- ciples and beliefs they believe in con- stancy and have such an intense pride in possessiveness and authority it is unusual to see them in the divorce courts but remember when they are through with anything all the king's horses and all the king's men are powerless to influence them to change the sanctity of the domestic situation is not to be tampered with in the eyes of the taurus husband do not at- tempt to blast these men from their chosen path of living that is extremely impor- tant allow him to go his leisurely way if he can control his temper and live with a goal in sight success is his eventually and you can depend upon his reliability  the star question box  mr g m q born september   ireland hour not stated this is more of an acknowledgment of your letter than anything else mr q it was impossible for me to communicate with you directly and my copy was written long ago for that period when you desired to receive your answer through the magazine you were not very definite about your trip but i assume it was a journey connected with business your influences this year are favorable if you will coordinate your ef- forts with past endeavor and contacts and continue to pursue a program which i hope you made long ago as far as i can ob- serve from the general positions in your chart the results of the year are solely dependent upon your hard work and your ls-e your stars and you  ability to see and take advantage of op- portunities if you care to write me again i will be very glad to hear from you m c born january   texas  a m i think you will make a success of secretarial work you have an evenly bal- anced disposition and you are shrewd your mind will develop excellently as you become older as long as you are engaged in study at this time do not give it up but in the future if you have an oppor- tunity to study designing commercial art or something of that nature it would be advisable you have a fairly good year in  in some respects but you will have restrictions which will be irksome do not try to move too fast try to seek part- time work you will be able to do your work efficiently mrs l m a husband born may   please write me again more in de- tail it would be better for you to tell me the nature of your husband's illness and the hour and place of birth of him and of yourself of course i do not answer medical questions but am able to show periods of improvement and a better men- tal attitude if i have sufficient birth data on which to make a judgment your hus- band's chart shows restricted health condi- tions in  but i hesitate to express my opinion about his physical welfare because of lack of the information stated above we published an article about the sign taurus under which your husband was born in the issue of november   if you will send us fifteen cents we will be glad to send you a copy of the issue miss v r born october   florida  a m i do not know whether or not you have met the man you will marry but you certainly will be in the mood for marriage beginning in november  and during the following winter you will receive a proposal which will probably result in marriage in the late spring or early summer of  you see astrology indicates the impulses urges and oppor- tunities but you are a free agent and be- ing a human being you have the power to make your own decisions of course hot hollywood news c streetamp smith's picture play c monthly all news stands ls-e  street amp smith's love story magazine when you contemplate a marital partner- ship or a business partnership with any one the two charts affect each other that is why it is necessary to have the chart of both persons concerned when a ques- tion on this subject is asked mrs e m born january   new york  a m chicago would be a more pleasant and better place for you but new york is better for your husband so what shall i say to you the influ- ences in your husband's chart are not fa- vorable for a change in residence until the fall months of  the year  is good for both of you and there will be some phases of your life this year which will be pleasant and acceptable too but next year is the better period for both of you in every way your husband will be very restless this summer and there is a journey shown for both of you so i suggest that we compromise take the trip to chicago when it is convenient to do so look over the situation then make your decision in my opinion it would be very inadvisable for you to make a big jump not knowing the conditions ahead if your husband is employed now i certainly do not advise you to make this important move before the spring months miss w g born february   time and place not stated as nearly as i can judge without your complete birth data your chart does not blend well with that of the young man you will meet some one else whom you will like much better during the year and you will have the op- portunity to marry in the early fall months your influences generally for the year are better for business however and you should try to advance yourself in your work or seek a better position in the spring edward born september   new york  a in it does not seem to me that you are suited for your present position i advise you to seek creative work of some nature such as illustrat- ing or landscaping or even floral work also you would do well in merchandising especially in relation to wearing apparel department-store work should be very sat- isfactory to you because you have many interests and this would give you several outlets you have a good chart but you should never postpone anything often you will lose chances because of this tend- ency to procrastinate you were born under the sign libra we have to list the signs in the born between- in the man- ner we do because of the flexibility of the time the sun enters each sign each year thank you for your letter if i can do anything further for you let me know miss e p born july   place not stated  a m i really think you are going through a transitional stage here and that your affections are tied up in such a way that you would regret marriage if it is executed in the near future i am very sincere when i say that a marriage from your personal standpoint should not trans- pire until the summer months of  on the other hand in many respects the majority i should say- your chart blends exceedingly well with that of the pisces man february th it is quite possible for me to see why this great attraction exists and why you love him so much but you are a sensible person and i feel you know this young man will not live up to your expectations entirely you are very ambitious and from what i am able to observe about the young man without his hour of birth it is my opinion that your outlook upon life differs and complete harmony from an economic standpoint does not exist i am here to help you and it is against my ethics for me to say definitely that you should marry this man i advise against it and suggest that you hold your decision for a time think it over if i can help you further let me know a r a born december   will you please write again and send me your complete birth data also the full data of the young man in question i am un- able to answer your specific question about marriage unless i have complete data mrs b born april   maryland  p in thank you so much for your kind letter as you know it is always pleasing to know that your work is en- joyed and appreciated and a warm glow came around my heart when you wrote that you traveled so far each week to buy the magazine about your property it would not be advisable for you to force the sale on your house at this time as a matter of fact it would be better for you to wait for about another sixteen months i know you dislike hearing this but your influences at this time are not as favorable for the sale as they will be later of course you can sell at sacrifice but i would hate to see you do that perhaps you can make an arrangement for companionship your stars and you  which will keep you from being so lonely i see your point of view and appreciate your feelings but in this case patience will bring reward you are an aries person and patience is not one of your strongest attributes but i am sure you have lived this life rather completely and realize that we cannot have everything we wish at the time we want it will be glad to hear from you any time you care to write to me m e b born october   new york  p m at the time you wrote me you were upset mentally and were in- clined to place a morbid construction upon everything and i feel sure you have gotten hold of yourself somewhat by this time and will have overcome some of your panic you have an excellent chart at birth comparatively speaking and even- tually you will find much contentment and stability of a permanent nature you must not allow any individual factor to color your entire viewpoint or your mode of existence because you are a person who will have many things happen throughout a lifetime charge all these things to ex- perience and incorporate them construc- tively into your single pattern of life when this association of seven years ended recently it was the termination of a defi- nite cycle in your existence and now you must go on to other fields which will bring you experiences- some pleasant and others annoying the year  will bring marked changes in your environment in connection with your associates in your social and business life nothing is hopeless the workers of the world must carry on to big- ger things and higher developments if certain conditions exist too long we begin to stagnate and fail to turn with the wheels of progress and in a person of your tem- perament the failure to make advancement every day of your life is detrimental to your viewpoint you have been in a rut to some extent during recent years and that is why this sudden shifting of the scenes has disturbed you it is that way with most of us one of the most impor- tant years of your life is  there will be readjustments and many changes men- tally physically and spiritually two spe- cific times of mental and actual upheaval are in february and november your in- fluences for the year are uncomfortable in some respects and bring mental strain on the other hand if you will take each oc- currence as it arises handle it in your usual efficient manner charge it to progress and go on to new things you will save yourself heartache and mental security some of your planetary conditions this year are very promising you will have the assistance of the planets in meeting these crises and your salvation will be in keeping philosoph- ical and balanced there is an element in your chart which brings you protection and if you will only have confidence in yourself and your future no matter what the personal adjustments are you will pre- serve your excellent faculties for bigger and better things i am not trying merely to soften my words by offering you encour- agement it will be a hard year to live but there are mitigating influences which will be helpful and which will bring you much pleasure the summer period is less strained than the other months and by the time the end of november arrives you will know definitely just why everything that will have happened has occurred above all things avoid a feeling of panic that will do no good and you can handle your affairs much better if you keep a clear head i am sorry not to have been able to answer you sooner but it was im- possible the future is much brighter for you keep that conviction uppermost in your mind my best wishes go forward and my offer of further cooperation when- ever needed why questions are not answered kai does not

knowledge that it will have her full attention address mrs laura alston brown street amp smith's love story magazine  seventh avenue new york n y it has no doubt occurred to many newly married couples that the business of rushing away on a honeymoon trip could for various reasons be either dispensed with or postponed especially when the bride is a modern young business woman who feels that she cannot absent herself from her work for any length of time but if we give way to mel- low sentiment there is something so lastingly sweet and romantic about a honeymoon the delightful holi- day of two married sweethearts who for a short period can feel free from immediate responsibilities and the trying adjustments of married life southern sweetheart can't decide whether to take a honeymoon trip or begin housekeeping at once dear mrs brown i am faced with a very puzzling problem like many other girls of twenty-one i have met the right man and we are planning to marry in the spring however i find it very hard to decide whether we should go away or start our life together without too many sudden changes do you think that a young business woman should take a honeymoon trip when she marries bob my fiance insists that it's up to me to decide but i can't make up my mind it has been agreed that i am to keep on working after we are married because we will need both salaries to keep things going and i know that many young brides find marriage a bore when time hangs too heavily on their hands i have a rather responsible job which needs my constant attention and besides that i think that the various adjustments all young couples have to go through when they marry cause enough upheavals but whenever i stop to think about it i notice that almost every girl i know who is planning to marry is looking for- ward to the time when she will go away on her honeymoon with the man of her dreams my mother thinks that bob and i should have a honeymoon trip but my older sister argues that in these modern times sensible young couples can easily get along without a trip of this kind i would like your advice on this prob- lem mrs brown and will gladly welcome any suggestions that friend in need read- ers care to make to help me decide this honeymoon question southern sweetheart sometimes it seems that the only way to make a decision no matter how important the question- is to  street amp smith's love story magazine toss a coin and take the conse- quences all joking aside however although some people are inclined to look upon the time-honored honey- moon custom as an upsetting ordeal many young couples feel it is the ideal way to begin married life most people feel that there is a rare sweetness and a feeling of ela- tion in going away from the rest of the world if only for a short time on the other hand many young married couples would probably find just as much joy in marriage if they started housekeeping immediately after the wedding ceremony responsible jobs of course can- not very well be left hanging in mid- air but don't you think my dear that some one else could look after the more important details of your work until you returned if the responsibility of your job worries you perhaps you could go away for only two weeks or start in house- keeping at once and make week-ends your special kind of honeymoon holiday dear mrs brown at nineteen when i was a telegraph messenger boy i started going with a girl of sixteen i worked my- self up until at twenty-one i became a commercial telegraph operator the salary was good and i thought i was old enough to get married i proposed to my girl friend and was accepted the position i held however was a little too heavy for one of my short experience and the consequences were that i worried about it so much that i was obliged to give it up this of course changed all my plans regarding marriage and i de- cided to try my luck in a distant state through a misunderstanding in our let- ters my sweetheart and i broke our en- gagement and we both started going out with other friends when i returned home a year later i met her again and some- how we made up for a year everything ran smoothly although i was not working steadily and we couldn't get married a few weeks ago my fiancee went visit- ing out of town and having nothing bet- ter to do i went to a skating rink where i met a girl with whom i think i fell in love recently this girl admitted that she cared for me and has offered to give up all her other boy friends if i would break my engagement but how can i do that mrs brown i know that my fiancee loves me and i would hate to hurt her the question is should i break off with her and take a chance on wrecking our lives or would that be too selfish i am still very fond of my fiancée and will always consider her a very fine person we might marry and i could try to make her happy but do you think that it would work out my new girl friend doesn't care whether i have a job or not she says that my future prospects make no difference in her affection for me i have tried to find out how my fiancee would feel if we were to break up again but she wouldn't even dis- cuss it don't you think that she would forget me in time i feel sure that your opinion will be of great value to me steve as an engaged man no matter what the circumstances you are not being fair to your fiancee if you date another girl if you are very sure that you no longer care for the girl you're en- gaged to it would be nothing less than sheer folly to go ahead with the marriage better to hurt her now than let her gradually realize that she does not possess your love it is tragic when after a five-year courtship a young couple are nearer a breaking point than the consum- mation of their hopes and dreams on the other hand if you take stock and try to analyze your emo- tions as well as your mental atti- tude you may find that what seems to be love is merely the kind of mutual attraction that often springs up without the slightest warning between two young people whose tastes are mutual i suggest that you stop seeing this other girl for a few months before you take any serious steps toward breaking your engagement the friend in need  any girl seriously interested in a young man would be concerned about his prospects and anxious to see that he got ahead in life dear mrs brown i am fifteen years old and my parents are very strict with me they say i am too young to go out with boys but i am allowed to have the crowd come up to my house when i am invited to a dance i always refuse because i haven't a boy friend i could ask to take me there is a social club my parents want me to join it a church organization and after the meet- ings the boys and girls dance and have a good time together but all the girls have their boy friends there and i would feel terribly out of place without one a few of the boys haven't girl friends but i'm not allowed to have boy friends i don't go anywhere and even though my parents say i can have all my friends over i know so few the girls i do know all have boy friends at times i feel so bad i think i'll never have any friends my parents told me that i can have dates when i am seventeen but by that time i probably won't have any friends at all if i don't get around now do you think i should join this club mrs brown perhaps this will sound very silly but so many girls of my age have boy friends that i feel sort of left out i could sneak out to make friends with some boys but my parents would find it out and then they wouldn't let me out at all do you think i should go to this club with a girl thank you in advance for any advice you give me marjorie by all means join the club child especially if your parents want you to if you feel shy about going alone why not take a girl friend with you that will help you to feel less self-conscious your parents are quite right you have plenty of time for boy friends girls of your age can find many in- teresting things to do without fol- lowing in the footsteps of much older girls in order to have some fun since you have your parents per- mission to invite your friends to your home you might give a little informal party once in a while and tell the girls you know to bring some of their friends this will help you to widen your circle of friends it's natural for girls of your age to want friends and good times but you should be careful what sort of friends you choose and what kind of good times you go in for you will never go wrong by obeying your parents dear mrs brown i would like to say a few words to perplexed whose letter re- cently appeared in your column i feel that i have been very lucky and perhaps my letter will be of help to her i have been engaged to a boy for three years he is also crippled although not so badly that he can't work at any job his handicap is due to infantile paralysis when we became engaged he had a job but didn't have a cent saved but when he had a nice sum in the bank he got sick and had a hard time he wrote me from the hospital and told me that we'd have to part as he thought i wouldn't care to be tied to a sick man but i didn't feel that way at all mrs brown and i knew how he felt about being crippled i've stuck by him for three years and now we expect to be married soon here's what i want to say to perplexed she and her fiance ought to get together and talk things over after my fiance spent all his money on doctors bills his father offered to help him take a course in radio work jim went to a school in chicago and was told that in our state the gov- ernment offered a course of this kind and others free to the crippled jim came back and upon investigation found this to be true and that the same thing is done in other states also though we don't know if all the states do this jim is now taking up printing and as soon as he is finished he has a job waiting for him in a newspaper-publishing house if perplexed will tell her friend to find out what can be done perhaps he can take a course of some kind that will enable him to work without using his feet all the time and it will also give him a chance to prove his love for her i know how you feel about your boy friend perplexed but if you stand by and try to help find a way for both of you it will bring you closer to each other and you'll be very happy  street amp smith's love story magazine i hope you will try to do all you can and i wish you joy and happiness irene thank you so much for your let- ter irene and i hope that perplexed will not miss it i'm sure it will help her to buck up and feel less hopeless sometimes it seems very hard to make plans for the future when there are so many obstacles but we never know what we can do until we try good luck irene dear mrs brown i am a girl eight- een years old smoke and drink a little but outside of these two habits i am a respectable girl the boys who date me never attempt any tricks last winter i met al he is thirty years old is a successful business man and is well-to-do financially he tells me he loves me and wants me to marry him but i'm very undecided early this past summer i met charlie and since then i have been dating both boys the last time i went out with char- lie he also asked me to marry him he is twenty-three years old and has a fairly good business of his own but i can't seem to make up my mind mrs brown which boy to accept al and i often quarrel though we make up easily enough charlie and i get along fine and seldom disagree i'm in love with both and feel i could be happy with either one however one thing that bothers me is that when i want to go some place al always complains that he's tired and this usually starts a quarrel some of my friends have told me that before al went with me he used to come to their parties and stay until all hours of the morning but when he's with me he's always tired and wants to go home early won't you please help me decide which one to accept i feel al is a little too selfish divided love al's excuse does seem to have the earmarks of a selfish attitude a man can't be tired all the time but before you go on worrying about either man has it occurred to you that when a girl feels she can be happy with one or the other of her suitors she is not in love with either a girl can be fond of two boys but when it comes to marriage it would not be possible for her to have ex- actly the same feeling toward both young men if you were really in love child your heart would do your choosing for you and there would be no guessing as to which man is the right one i doubt if you're in love at all and you shouldn't feel that you must accept one or the other as long as you remain undecided chances are that you are only inter- ested in them in a friendly fashion and i suggest that you continue on that basis with them and have other boy friends too a girl never loses out by waiting until she is sure it's love on both sides dear mrs brown can a girl be too decent this has been my problem for some time i want to explain my situa- tion and hope you can help me i am a girl of eighteen i have a lovely home and the nicest parents any girl could wish for but it seems that i am not able to get a boy friend like other girls every one tells me i am very good- looking and i am considered one of the best-dressed girls in town i haven't any physical defects and i'm not a bit con- ceited or snooty i don't smoke or drink and i simply refuse to neck or pet no matter who the boy is i never let him kiss me the first time he takes me out and most of the boys seldom come back the second time i guess i'm just a flat tire if you were me would you let down the ideals you had mrs brown it seems that only then can a girl have some boy friends for the boys won't date a girl if she's straight and refuses to be mauled over i've almost given up hope that i will ever meet a boy who will appreciate a re- spectable girl and admire me for myself am i too goody-goody i belong to several clubs and have trav- eled a little more than most girls but everywhere i go the boys are all the same still hoping stop worrying about whether a girl can be too respectable i think it's the boys who ought to worry the friend in need  about their crudeness and inability to appreciate the finer qualities in a girl be proud of your high ideals and don't try to conceal them whether some of the boys you meet believe in them or not the so-called friendships or popu- larity with boys who expect every girl to slide down to any level they suggest aren't worth a thought one of these days the right man will come along and then you will be ever so glad that you have kept your ideals and didn't change your ideas about how boys and girls should be- have dear mrs brown i am twenty years old and my fiance is twenty-three we have been engaged a little over one year and it has been the most miserable year of my whole life because walter's jealousy has made me terribly unhappy i have been absolutely true to him and i love him dearly but honestly mrs brown he is killing my love he doesn't trust me out of his sight and if i as much as leave the house for a minute when he isn't with me it's just plain war he can think up more things that i might have done than i could ever have time to do he expects me to come straight home from work and stay in unless he takes me out i can't even speak to some of my old friends if i happen to meet them on the street if we go to a show and i see some one i know and smile in greeting he's angry for the rest of the evening and sulks like a baby but he can give every pretty girl the most searching look and i mustn't mind i've tried to talk and argue about his jealousy but it has no weight with him at all it's getting so i can't stand it and i would break the engagement to-morrow even though i know i would never be happy without him or love another as dearly but i know that he would be heart- broken too we have stopped going to parties and to some of my girl friends homes because of his insane jealousy why can't he see that he is simply killing my affection for him mitzie i don't want to sound pessimistic but more often than not it's a most difficult job trying to cure a man of his jealousy and you have all my sympathy mitzie when a man is as jealous as your fiance it shows that he is afraid some other man may come along and that you may fall in love with him psychologists have explained that jealousy is a feeling of inferiority which arises from the idea that the sufferer is not as good as the next person and that he is being looked down on this of course is silly and childish i suggest that the very first time you find your friend in good humor you try to talk this over with him tell him in a friendly but frank and definite way that you do love him but if he insists on continuing to express such groundless jealous spasms and accusations he is bound to kill your affection and respect try to make him understand that unless he treats you with the trust and respect due you you can't pos- sibly go on loving him if you two succeed in reaching an understand- ing i'm sure you'll both be much happier he should try to realize that even if you are engaged to him you can't expect to stop being hu- man and avoid all your friends that's unnatural and certainly un- reasonable to keep happy and in- terested we should have friendly contacts with others and if the worst comes to worst -which i hope it doesn't- and he still refuses to see your viewpoint then maybe it would be better to call it quits until he finds his way to better understanding dear mrs brown my family life was never a happy one there was always a fight going on in the family and i could never go out without getting bawled out when i returned bringing friends home was out of the question the house was always messed up and things were never in order if i  street amp smith's love story magazine did tidy up the others would upset the place in ten minutes besides i was al- ways afraid that my friends would be in- sulted by my folks attitude toward them at eighteen i felt i couldn't stand it any longer and i ran away and married a man i thought would be good to me i was not in love with him i have not found real love yet i didn't know my husband very well before we were married and i was frantic when i found out that he was careless and lazy i could not go home to my folks because they wouldn't have anything to do with me and leaving him was out of the question because i had no place to go three months after our marriage my husband quit work because he had a fight with his boss and as we had hardly any money i found work waiting on people in a delicatessen store then my husband stopped looking for work he'd stay in bed all day until late afternoon and then go out with his men friends of course i had to give him money and pay rent too besides seeing to it that we didn't starve one year later i fainted at work i had a complete nervous breakdown and my mother thawed out enough to take me home with her they made my husband stay away from me and didn't even let him in the house to see me as soon as i could get up i got a divorce i don't know how i ever pulled through all the i-told-you-so's from every one but don't you think that if they had treated me right at home in the first place all this would never have happened my mother and dad won't let me go out with young men who have jobs and earn their living because they are always preaching that one unfortunate marriage was enough i've learned my lesson and am going to wait for love mother treats me all right but she's always lecturing and won't let me go anywhere except to work i'm so tired of it all as things stand that i feel anything would be bet- ter than to have to listen to talk and more talk must my life be made miserable be- cause i married the wrong man mrs brown heartsick as long as you allow yourself to be rather spineless my dear i'm afraid you're going to be stepped on a good deal more than you have been has it occurred to you that you literally drifted into an unfortunate marriage because you lacked the en- ergy to fight against your family's treatment of you and after you realized that you married the wrong man you didn't have enough gump- tion to lift a finger to set things straight although you were support- ing yourself and could have easily made a change by leaving now you're of age you're making your own living and yet you haven't the courage to stand up for your- self and insist that your mother leave you to choose your own friends and let you go out a little more instead of insisting on your rights you're coddling your grief and taking no steps to assert your- self and why because you don't seem to have sufficient courage to live your own life as you want to live it i'm afraid that unless you snap out of it dear you're going to con- tinue being unhappy you shouldn't be afraid to reach out for the things you want in life ls-e try some of these remarkable seed novelties japanese rose bushes the wonder of the world japanese rose bushes bloom
