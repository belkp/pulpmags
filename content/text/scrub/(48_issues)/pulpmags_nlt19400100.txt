laugh with you  gypsy sal by  mary brown salvatia bertovi stood just under the flap of her tent watching the droves of people as they thronged in through the gates every foot of the circus grounds was crowded now lions roared for the customers bene- fit the merry-go-round churned with shrill american melodies men on platforms bellowed about the great- est wonders of creation -- fire-eaters wild men from borneo bearded wo- men and tattooed men salvatia watched the opening day of the benoit circus a girl of nine- teen in a white tulle ballet skirt with a glittering rhinestone brassiere around her high-peaked jutting bosom always the benoit circus opened on the grounds just a kilo- night life tales  meter from versailles always her heart pumped like mad and her big black eyes widened and her small red tongue came out to moisten soft red lips and so salvatia watched and her heart beat like mad she did not hear pietro come in through the rear of the tent she did not know that her fiance was there until she felt his arms go around her waist he whispered salvatia  salvatia  and his mouth touched her cheek pressing her head back seeking her lips despite herself salvatia went a lit- tle stiff she thought to herself sometime when pietro takes me in his arms like this i shall go limp with joy i shall go out of my head with loving him it will come in time i have not made a mistake in promis- ing to marry him but so far it had not come nor could she understand why her blood stayed so cool when pietro kissed her and caressed her lovingly pietro was very handsome and young and gypsy- dark his tent where he managed the rifle shooting was always crowded with women asking to be taught how to shoot for pietro had fire in his eyes she salvatia bertovi was very lucky in- deed to have won the love of this great dark man whom so many wo- men wanted she thought all this as pietro's arms drew her closer as his mouth closed over her own and as his hands slid around her waist pressing her to him tightly pietro looked down into her slim dark face his black eyes burning over that soft beauty he said i shouldn't have come there is so little time before your act is on be- fore i'm needed at the rifles once i hold you like this i can't let you go she understood she tried to pull out of his embrace but pietro held her firmly he said evenly salvatia do you love me when i'm with you i think yes when i'm away and can see things clearly i think no salvatia said coolly i love you pietro but her voice lacked warmth her eyes did not glow as rosalie benoit's blue eyes glowed when she looked upon pietro and salvatia thought rosalie really loves pietro even though she is ashamed of loving a gypsy and salvatia knew as pietro gazed at her that he was mentally comparing her coolness with rosalie's warm emotions that he was weigh- ing them both one against the other and that he was finding her salvatia lacking there's time for a few kisses pietro she whispered huskily pietro crushed her to him put his  night life tales mouth on hers with such force that her lips parted she was not surprised then that her heart did thump that her knees trembled and that a pulse throbbed unmercifully in her throat the flame of his love swept her up into a moment where she was blind later pietro put salvatia out of his arms and hurried back to his con- cession his thoughts were of busi- ness now not of love why doesnt love come to me i was made for love  but there was no time to wonder she hurried out of the tent into the late summer afternoon the fair grounds were as hot as all oven steaming with people the men stopped short with a clatter of their wooden shoes as salvatia sped toward the main tent and the little groups of waiting performers behind it she felt those masculine eyes upon her and wondered if among the peasants or the paris gentlemen there was one man who could touch off the spark of her lambent love and then suddenly salvatia stopped short her black eyes wide her mouth apart and her bosom swelling sud- denly with an emotion that was strangely akin to love--for it was hate she stood there tense and stiff staring straight in front of her at a raised platform facing a tent where a tall slim yellow-haired giant in an american cow-boy cos- tume -- chaps blue polka-dot shirt handkerchief knotted at the throat-- was calling to the passer-by waving his ten gallon hat at them see the greatest wild bear in the world watch me wrestle with the wildest bear in captivity a rocky mountain grizzly only ten centimes the show begins at once monsieurs et mesdames only ten centimes the tall blond man on the platform was sammy richards the american and salvatia hated him four years ago he had been with the benoit cir- cus as a barker four years ago she had thought that she loved him she had stayed awake nights wondering how it would feel to be in his arms to have him crushing her gypsy lov- eliness close to him she had even gone so far as to make up a pretext that would take them walking in the woods in the moonlight but even though sammy's blue eyes had blazed even though his breath had gone short in his throat that love- ly dance had not made him forget that she was after all a gypsy girl and therefore a social caste beneath the other members of the circus he had gone away after the season to america his home--to some strange place called hollywood where he said a fortune awaited him but before he had gone he had done the one thing that made salvatia hate him she had gone to his tent that last night she had stood there in the semi-darkness with hunger in her black eyes with love trembling on her full lips she was his woman he had only to reach out and take her in his arms instead he had looked at her closely  at the inward curve of her waist her slim perfect legs and he had said unmoved salvatia i saw you edging through the crowd today don't pick pockets be content with what benoit pays you she had stiffened with hurt pride with resentment all the gypsies pick pockets she had said evenly there's no harm in it but there is salvatia one of these dumb frenchmen will catch you at it night life tales  one of these days and you'll find your- self in prison    you and your father and pietro just because all the gyp- sies pick pockets you don't have to promise me that you'll cut it out salvatia and then without giving her a chance to answer he had practically pushed her out of his tent had said run along to bed now salvatia like a good little girl because she was too furious to trust words in her mouth she had flung herself into a dance    wildly    her hips swaying her whole body swaying rhythmically with her agi- tated steps pietro had thrown aside his accordion he had come to her through the moonlight you are my woman he had said huskily i did not know it before he had slipped his neck beads about her throat had kissed them in place in gypsy bethrothal fashion and had crushed her in his arms the next morning sammy left and as if to prove to herself how much she hated him salvatia moved through the circus crowd and picked every pocket she saw she had been picking pockets all the four years of sammy's absence getting satisfaction out of her nimble fingers and her defiance of his advice she hadn't been caught nor would she be even though her father and her mother had been and were in jail in paris now pietro had just missed being caught but pietro was too slick    slick with his own cunning technique  night life tales and at night when they emptied purses and laughed over some of the contents salvatia found a wild satis- faction in it we're gypsies pietro there is no law for us we do what we wish to do don't we we defy whom we choose she would whisper and there would be such a fire of hatred in her eyes that pietro seeing that strange flame would confuse it with love and would crush her to him and now salvatia looked at sammy richards who was back after four years there was sawdust flecked on his breeches and on his polka-dot blouse from the floor of the cage in which he had wrestled the bear there was sawdust in his blonde hair and on the side of his face in that moment he looked over the heads of the people and saw her he nodded to her coolly looking down upon her    a gypsy  as if from a mountain top salvatia bit her lip and she seemed to gasp with indignation she tossed her glossy head up proudly swung around on her heel and edged her way through the crowd picking pock- ets as she went out of the tail of one dark eye she could see sammy watching her disapproving her heart began to pound and her knees trembled beneath her as she hurried on to the big tent she hated sammy it was fun doing something he loathed that night after her last perform- ance in the tan bark ring salvatia got into her gypsy costume and min- gled with the crowd her nimble fin- gers busy with pockets she delighted in sammy watching her from his platform scowling down at her from his six-foot-three and it came to her as she stood there even as he yelled out for customers to watch him wres- tle with the bear that she could hurt him not with love--but with hate she went quickly over to sammy's platform leaned negligently against a cypress trunk and with deep mal- ice in her eyes she consistently night life tales  laughed at everything he said to the crowd she said derisively loud enough for sammy to hear i've seen that man do his act it looks real almost as if he were act- ually tussling with that grizzly it's a nice act    but only an act that old bear is as tame as any cat that ever curled up on a hearth people began to laugh they looked up at sammy and laughed in his face and moved to other side-shows sammy climbed down off his plat- form and came up to salvatia his jaw was grim his blue eyes furious what sort of a lousy gypsy trick was that salvatia bertovi he de- manded evenly and he stood there in front of her tall and blond and whitely american in his anger salvatia's heart began to pound beneath the tight blouse of her gypsy dress her knees shook one against the other hatred was delicious she hadn't felt as alive as this since she could remember she threw back her dark head her black eyes burned their hatred against his face you are a fake sammy richards  she said coldly four years ago you were a barker for benoit now you come back wrestling a bear you have but to look at that old grizzly to know that he is as tame as any kitten you have but to look at you to know that you couldn't even wres- tle me somehow even hating him as she did she couldn't endure him looking at her like that he had never looked at her like that before and so she said fake go back to your cage and wrestle with that tired old bear i think you have two customers wait- ing and then she spun around on her heel and left him with quick little steps she hurried across the circus lot she headed straight for poetro's rifle range which was closed now she thought wildly i'll go into pietro's arms i'll stay in them for a long while and tomor- row pietro and i will be married there is no need to wait any longer she slipped around behind pietro's tent and would have gone straight through the opening but the sound of whispers inside stopped her made her stand there in the moonlight lis- tening despite herself pietro was saying softly in a hurt voice salvatia does not love me rosalie for four years i have never been sure of her but now i know she doesn't care perhaps it's be- cause your yellow hair dazzles my eyes when i'm with her perhaps its because i've offered her only a part of my heart since most of it belongs only to you rosalie    then salvatia heard pietro say in that throbbing voice rosalie are we always to hide our love like this salvatia listened no longer with a little sigh she struck out toward the woods where she could sit in soli- tude and think where she could stare up at the moon and try to puzzle out why hatred had become so much more important in her life than love hating sammy was more important to her than loving pietro    and so she had lost pietro she was clear across the circus  grounds walking slowly when she heard footsteps behind her when she heard sammy richards say in a furi- ous voice salvatia he came up behind her caught her slim bare shoulders in his hands and swung her around to face him he shook her until her teeth rattled in her head and until her eyes felt as if  night life tales they were being wrung from their sockets he stormed out you stay away from my platform tomorrow do you hear if you don't i'll call the gendarmes the first time i see you slip a finger into a pocket    you or your beloved pietro i'm going to be with benoit all this sea- son and i'm not going to have you starting this fake business on the road do you understand that salvatia tossed her dark head up- ward gypsy chieftain blood stirring in her veins proud and hot fake fake and her strong young arms locked themselves be- hind his back when he broke that hold she slid another upon him back of his neck wrestle she spat at him if you can wrestle wild bears you can wrestle salvatia who is only a woman      woman sammy cried not a woman  a gypsy hell-cat salvatia gritted her teeth and tightened her hold they wrestled furiously they tumbled to the ground rolled on top of one another their legs thrashing in the air their breaths mingled their arms locked when salvatia realized that he had indeed been wrestling that huge bear in the cage that he was a far cry from a fake    and when she realized that the man held on to her even when he could have easily broken her hold    she went limp in his arms sammy bent nearer her not speak- ing his hand came out from his side and caressed her thick dark hair he moved his palm over her face feeling her slim straight nose her lips the soft line of her chin and looked into salvatia's wide burning eyes he said i did not want to love you sal- vatia that is why i went away you're a gypsy men can not trust gypsies only another gypsy would know how to manage you  to tame you salvatia whispered you manage and tame that bear sammy i'm not so strong as he it seems that neither of us knew our own minds said sammy for i went to california to forget you salvatia i made lots of money there not with my bear but with singing i trapped that bear in the rockies i wrestled him because i knew that one day despite myself i would come back to you    that i would have to be strong to be worthy of you      salvatia's lips turned up in a slow smile you understand women sammy    especially gypsy women  and then she didn't say anything more she even ceased to think for sammy had her in his strong young arms sammy's mouth was crushing down on her own in an endless kiss she didn't even think of pietro in that exquisite moment pietro who was thinking of her    pietro who was holding rosalie in his arms who was threading his fingers through her golden hair and who was listen- ing to rosalie saying softly breath- lessly pietro we'll run away tonight salvatia won't care earlier this even- ing i saw her hanging around that american gorgio telling people what a fake he is and all the time love burned in her eyes just as i saw it burning once four years ago when he was a barker for mon pere pietro you want me too don't you    oh pietro darling what does it matter if mon pere will be furious with me photograph photograph photograph photograph photograph photograph photograph photograph scrambled yeggs by  art nunce a little frenchman at the office of the bal de legion d honeur was adamant his waxed black mous- tache danced excitedly on his upper lip indigo eyes sparkled i am sorry monsieur he re- peated i cannot do nossing for you zere is not one ticket to zee bal zey have all been taken by zee legion d honeur and zere guests i am sorry eddie quince gave vent to a labial noise closely approximating the fa- miliar bronx cheer nuts  he mut- tered i beg your pardon monsieur the little frenchman said forget it froggie you're sure you can't get me into the shindig i'm a gentleman of the press a pained expresson floated over the frenchman's face if i could mon- sieur i would be tres happy but mon dieu what can i do zee members and zere friends have all zee tickets  night life tales eddie scratched his head how about letting me see the admission list so i'll know who's going to be there i've got to send some sort of a story back to my paper the gentleman of the press label eddie had assumed was nothing more than a label he had been a news- paper reporter back in kansas city but it was so long ago he had forgot- ten what it was all about his main purpose in posing as a newspaperman was to gain admission to the ex- clusive bal de legion d'honeur the little frenchman brightened oui monsieur of course zat i can do he scuttled off returning with counties sheets of typewritten names nine out of ten were prefixed chevalier eddie ran his eyes down the list they stopped at the impres- sive cognomen his highness victor san remo vallento et entourage d'allsia who's he eddie queried zee crown prince of alesia mon- sieur and where is alesia the frenchman shrugged zat i do not know monsieur his highness is now at zee vendome hotel there was a strange glint in eddie's eyes he copies down the royal dignitary's name thanks a lot he said the vendome was one of paris most expensive rococo hostelries bold as brass eddie walked up to the desk asked for the crown prince the clerk eyed him who shall i say is calling monsieur a representative of the paris edi- tion of the new york bulletin ten minutes later eddie was ad- mitted to a suite of rooms on the sixth floor of the hotel as he entered the drawing room he stopped short stared straight ahead of him there reclining on a low damask-covered divan was a gorgeous dark-haired female she was wearing a thin spun-silver negligee draped loosely about her body i--i beg your pardon he mur- mured the girl looked up from her mag- azine her black eyes flashed from long curled lashes her mouth car- mine red and moist smiled a greeting bon jour monsieur you have come to see zee crown prince she sat up eddie's heart thumped like a trip-hammer a month in france had given eddie a pretty fair idea of the local crop of beauties they were plenty spiffy all things considered but this gorgeous creature french or alesian what- ever that was had the parisian cuties backed off the map for class er--yes eddie mumbled i -- i'd like to see his highness the girl swung her shapely legs off the divan your name monsieur she night life tales  queried rising for a long moment eddie found it difficult to reply your name monsieur she re- peated a faint smile playing about her voluptuously encarnadined lips edward quince eddie managed she undulated out of the room svelt hips swinging eddie felt the palms of his hands beginning to mois- ten if a bare half hour before some- one had told him he was going to rest his eyes on a brunette venus he would have laughed in that someone's face anxious moments went by eddie possessed of a swell plan for getting into the bal almost forgot the pur- pose of his visit now with the stun- ning femme out of sight it returned to mind everything would depend on whether this high-mucky-muck from alesia was anywhere near eddie's size and build if he happened to be short fat and roly-poly or tall gaunt and angular it would be just too bad the curtains separating the draw- ing room of the suite from the one adjoining parted and the beautiful brunette returned i am sorry monsieur she said but his highness cannot be dis- turbed he is resting in preparation for zee ball tonight i am his sister can i help eddie licked his lips he made a mental note to find out where in hell alesia was if this beauty was any sample of the feminine alesians that was the place for eddie quince er--yes it's about the bal eddie gulped i just wanted to ask him about his costume and--well--and get his viewpoint on things in gen- eral you know we do that with visiting celebrities  night life tales she nodded oui i am aware of zat monsieur i am sorry i cannot help you zee costume is zee secret as for anything else i do not know eddie backed to the door he was reluctant to leave but in a case like this it paid to be prudent if luck was with him he would have ample oppor- tunity to meet this venus on an equal footing thank you very much he gasped goodbye she followed him to the door out on the street eddie glanced at his watch five o'clock if anything was to be accomplished he had very little time in which to accomplish it he looked into his wallet almost two thousand francs that was  in american money a hell of a lot to pay for admission to a masked ball but he was determined to crash the gates of the exclusive shindig no matter what the price and now too there was an added incentive a dark- haired incentive eddie doffed his thinking cap for the time being stepped into a cafe for an absinthe frappeit was six- thirty when he returned to the lobby of the vendome slumped down in a chair behind a potted palm kept his eyes glued on the elevators an hour of watchful waiting brought reward the gorgeous brunette swathed in an ermine wrap came out of the elevator on the arm of a man approximately eddie's height and build he too was wearing a voluminous opera cloak but eddie could see the striped trous- ers of a colorful uniform and a gold braided military collar both the girl and the man had black dominoes over their eyes eddie quivered with excitement he was certain this was his highness the crown prince of alesia he mem- orized the gold spinach on the mans patent leather peaked hat it had an old rose crown and was festooned with garlands of braid a second man in uniform not as gaudy as the crown prince's followed the royal couple through the lobby eddie watched them all get into a cab and drive off he grinned and rubbed his hands in gleeful anticipa- tion now it was all up to him it is too well known a fact to war- rant undue explanation the parisian taxi driver will sell his soul and the soul of each member of his family for the almighty franc acting on this truism eddie sallied forth from the hotel picked a likely-looking driver and engaged him in conversation for how much will you rent me your uniform and your cab he ques- tioned the driver's bushy eyebrows arched for how long monsieur all night five hundred francs eddie computed rapidly that would be  no too much i'll give you  francs ah but monsieur it is against zee law supposing i am caught eh what zen i'll get you out three hundred francs what do you say it was five times what the cabbie would earn he knew it and eddie knew it a little more bantering back and forth and the deal was closed a bare half-hour later eddie in the driver's gray uniform slipped behind the wheel of the cab you will return it to  rue sabien by dawn monsieur the cabbie questioned anxiously maybe before then frenchie toodle-oo with a great clatter of meshing gears the ancient squeaking night life tales  vehicle rolled away narrowly missing a traffic police- man and a lumbering omnibus eddie reached the maison of the legion of honor drew up before the canopy stretching to the curb an epauletted doorman hurried to the cab eddie leaned out he pressed a folded hun- dred franc note into the doorman's hand speaking low and rapidly he described the crown prince of ale- sia's uniform height weight and gen- eral appearance as best he could tell the gentleman there is some- one to see him make it clear that it is important if you succeed in bring- ing him out i will give you another hundred francs the doorman blood brother to all other doormen in every part of the world knew his onions for cash in hand he would perform miracles he nodded and vanished into the maison eddie stepped out of the driver's seat put the collar of his coatup around his face he opened the back door of the cab waited anxiously sure enough out came the crown prince in full glittering regalia three rows of medals shimmering on his chest he paused uncertainly under the canopy zis way monsieur eddie said his heart was in his throat the crown prince stepped forward he looked around puzzled who wishes to see me he questioned a gentleman inside zee cab mon- sieur eddie blurted the crown prince stooped entered the open door eddie using his body as a shield against the doorman jerked a leather-covered black-jack from his pocket swung it tapped the unsuspecting crown prince on the back of the head he slumped into the seat without a sound eddiet slammed the door shut hurriedly gave the doorman his second tip wrove off he stopped the cab on a dark street ten minutes of work and the crown prince was bound hand and foot with stout rope his mouth ef- fectively gagged eddie stripped him of his resplendent uniform ran the cab to the bank of the seine rolled the still unconscious crown prince into the grass behind a thick bush it was a warm night and he was certain  night life tales the royal visitor would suffer no ill effects that done he raced to  rue sa- bien and routed out the cabbie who had rented him the hack before the astounded eyes of the man he re- moved the driver's uniform and sub- stituted the outlt of old rose and braid even to the black dominoe over his eyes now drive me to the maison de legion d'honeur and i will be through with the cab the unsuspecting doorman bowed eddie in to the exclusive bal no sooner had he stepped into a room thronged with brilliantly costumed people and alive with the rhythmic strains of music than a hand fell on his arm he turned to look into the bright masked eyes of the gorgeous brunette she was wearing the cos- tume of a ballet dancer tight and scant where have you been hugo she whispered i was worried eddie's lips smiled he made no reply preferring to take no chances of detection he eased her into his arms and danced her away suddenly a chilling thought came to him she was the crown prince's sister if he attempted to make love to her she would know something was wrong hugo she placed her lips close to his ear francois will be ready soon had we not better go to zee lounge eddie nodded the girl slipped her arm in his together they walked off the dance floor into the palm-strewn lounge seated themselves in an over- stuffed love seat she leaned towards him offered her parted red lips eddie had always been taught to act first and ask questions after he acted kissing her you still care for marie don't you hugo darling she murmured so that was her name--marie ed- die disguised his voice and managed a faint oui he was about to con- tinue where he had left off when an- other man in uniform hurried up dropped something in marie's lap and beat a hasty departure the girl tensed come we must go she pulled the bodice of her costume away slid something into the aperture and rose hurriedly ed- die caught a gleam of white the sheen of which looked like pearls why was she secreting pearls there was no time to ask questions marie fairly dragged him out to the coatroom before eddie knew it he was alone with her in a taxicab and night life tales  she had ordered the driver to go to the vendome once the cab moved away from the maison de legion d'honeur marie breathed a deep sigh of relief ah sucre i am glad zat is over i was so nervous hugo before eddit's gaping eyes she shrugged off her wrap lowered the straps of her costume eddie got- goggle-eyed when he saw what was nestling in her bosom marie held it up it was a stunning pearl necklace shimmering with all the pure fire of its dozens of big pearls not bad hugo eh she ques- tioned is it not worth at least one million francs eddie's mind whirled he hadn't the faintest idea what this was all about but he had a premonition he was getting himself into plenty of hot water francois will meet us at zee train marie said we must get rid of zese costumes immediately it will not be long before zee gendarmes will be looking for us jewel thieves it hit eddie smack in the nose jewel thieves they weren't members of royalty at all they were crooks posing as mem- bers of royalty right now some weal- thy dowager was missing that neck- lace at the bal eddie had half a mind to stop the cab and get out another look at marie's voluptuous beauty changed his mind and anyway the cab was drawing up before the vendome still masked they both walked through the lobby took the elevator to the phony crown prince's suite we must hurry cheri marie said once they were behind locked doors eddie caught her in his arms if he was taking the chance of being nabbed as a jewel thief he had to get something out of it he bent her back kissing her full on the lips timeless minutes later eddie re- moved his mask the girl's face drained of color she sat and stared like one transfixed i'm a detective eddie lied it's too bad you had to get mixed up with that gang of yeggs open-mouthed marie gaped she could not utter a sound eddie crossed to a phone he called police head- quarters reported the recovery of the pearl necklace told them where they could find the fake crown prince and his henchman that done he turned to marie as for you-- she threw herself at him pleading please monsieur do not have me arrested hugo forced me to do it eddie held her close shut up he said quietly there's only one way i can save you how monsieur by marrying you then we can tell the police that we worked together to capture those thieves other- wise-- marie said nothing but her actions shouted her answer  night life tales laugh and we'll laugh with you i must admire girls who know enough to keep on saying no but for a date i must confess i like the girl who murmurs yes why must women always wear funny gadgets in their hair metal curlers scratch like heck little boys who
