she wai an yerold cornfed honey with plenty of trick up her kimona ileetewhen the had a kimona on she was built like the hind quarters of an elephant this gal sal tinker and probably she was just as tough but when i ran cross her one day in a clip joint down on main street she was whin ing like a calf that had been forced on to a skim milk diet before its time sal laid claim to being responsible for the word prostitute being part of the dictionary and i dont doubt but what she was right she looked old enough to have been one of cleopatras chamber maids but she couldnt raise a nickel on her own rusty charms even if sal was more or less out of date and wind broken she was still a winning horse for she had under her con trol four or five young hens that were still in the peeping stage and quite eligible enough for any monkey shine from turning a hand spring to turning a sucker inside out and wringing him dry one of these blandishing females was the cause of my extemporaneous visit to sweet sue sals place of business that eventful day on orders from the district attorney it seems old j p something or other had stepped out of bounds a trifle he was lean lank and handsome as sals girls would have said but he was unlucky enough to have been burdened down with a wife but old j p was in his second child hood or close to that stage for he was be ginning to feel his oats once more at a time when he should have been making sure his insurance policies were all in good shape a few shots of sals furniture polish started those oats to sprouting faster than bees from a punctured nest and that was sals cue to sic one of her trained pussies on to the dizzy gent she played her shots well for she pick ed an eighteen year old corn fed honey to carry on the good work with instruc tions to trim this christmas tree right but the corn fed had a few tricks up her own kimona that hadnt been born yet in sals heyday and she picked j p as a likely looking customer to try them on her name was sue and she earned every letter in it for she began by lead ing the docile j p upstairs over the drinking room to a two by four bedroom she called her own but j p was groggy sue let her ki mona flap open enticingly her volup tuous breasts bobbed around in front of his nose and a trifle farther down her shining body there was a navel display that only his vest buttons were review ing beyond that a pair of dainty silk panties half covered the remainder of the charms that were now working the old bozo into a fever sweat j p had never seen anything so beauti ful at least he admitted as much to the crafty susan but the little corn fed must have soaked her tongue in lau danum before she went to work on the old bird for he passed into the arms of morpheous before his excess boiler pres sure had a chance to blow off at least that was what he told the d a sort of confidentially the next day when he came to his senses and went down to headquarters he thrashed things out with the d a behind closed doors and when he left an hour later he was a wiser man both financially and morally a short time later i got the dope also behind closed doors it was in the shape of leather wallet crammed full of money but it wasnt worth the paper it was printed on yes it was queer money several thousand dollars of it sal was slated for a housecleaning at that minute the d a was plenty sore because j p was the corner stone of his office something had to be done and damn quick so armed with the wallet and instructions to make sal replace every dollar of that dough with honest to god currency of the realm i sauntered down main street keyed to the point where i was ready to run the old war horse and her three ringed circus out into the sticks if necessary but sals joy parlor looked more like a corner in the public library when i arrived business was at a standstill and the numerous tables scattered round the room were sans any customers except the chesty sal herself she was reading a copy of a book that i hadnt thought up til now she had ever even heard of yep it was a bible and huge blops of water were balancing themselves precariously on her flabby cheeks perhaps hesitating to inspect the abyss below that lay be tween her breasts now resting on the table dumfounded i stood there scratching my head while i wondered if the old gal was really reforming or had picked up continued to page miss her photo came i from vienna and the stamping of the cattle on the big boat it came over upon shook off the caption telling who she is no doubt a movie act ress or dancer model or what havent we copyright dora vienna austria century photo sweet sue continued from page i the book by mistake then remembering that i was on business i tossed the wallet on the table in front of her and said you sucked the wrong lemon last night sal theres five thousand dollars of fancy engraved paper in that wallet and the d a wants you to redeem it pronto or else youre quits here under stand but good old sal never even sighed she turne a black puss where you aant hair to arnuclriithhst drawn lor itory book by bruce patterson slanghouse cindy continued from page and just then the

go into so he married the girl i lost my eraser drrrni lor iotry bnk by bruet ptttrton on a spacious balcony just outside as hiram could see by looking past a pair of halfopened florentine doors distinguished looking men chatted with equally distinguished looking women the sporting chance by harold ward illustration by bob gon jr iram akley and martha sneed had been keeping company for several months when jabez sneeds attempt to corner the agricultural imple ment market of sac city terminated with disastrous results when the wreckage was cleared away jabez found himself the owner of a house decorated with mortgages a ledger filled with bad accounts and a pique against the world in general whereupon he splattered his brains against one side of a newly papered bedroom with an old colts re volver and his creditors started fighting over his assets before the undertaker had finished his melancholy rites he be queathed to martha his love a thousand dollar insurance policy and a strain of sporting blood inherited from some long torgotten progenitor in spite of the fact that hiram was the village cutup martha loved him with oldfashioned devotion she would have married him in a minute had he said the the sporting chance word but alas for her peace of mind he never said it hiram it was hinted went to a legerburlesque show every time he made his annual visit to new york to buy shoes for the emporium of which he was proprietor likewise he oiled his hair waxed his mustache played pennyante and chewed peppermint lozen ges which in sac city is prima facie evi dence that a man drinks whisky or eats onions this accumulated mass of bucolic devilishness made hiram the object of many a whispered conversation at sewing society meetings and incidentally a man to be shunned by all sac city maidens who hoped to preserve their unsullied reputations hence marthas association with hiram ostracized her in sac city and she found herself upon the death of her father alone in the world and seemingly doomed to a life of spinsterhood in a town where scandalmongers make moun tains out of mole hills over night martha realized this so did hiram in fact he rather enjoyed his bad reputa tion but martha being a wise damsel knew deep down in her heart that hiram was not never had been and never would be a real honesttogawd sport and she felt if she once got the matrimonial hook in his gills that she could straighten him up with a jerk the trouble was to hook him for hiram was wise beyond his years and having broken her heart as he supposed turned his gaze towards a fluffyhaired blond from a nearby town if martha had shriveled up and died of a dislocated heart hirams cup of happi ness would have been filled to overflow ing his reputation as a real gol darnit would have been made and all the girls in sac city would have worked overtime flirting with him but martha was not an ordinary girl she declined to shrivel besides she was a regular reader of zippy stories and knew all the ropes so while the town gossips were busily engaged in raking skeletons out of the fluffyhaired blonds closet she cashed her insurance policy pocketed the money and slipped away a month after her disappearance hiram received a letter from her telling him that she was in new york working twentyfour hours a day as a model for rolf armstrong norman rockwell and other artistic lights hiram sat up and took notice he had never thought mar tha especially beautiful but he realized that possibly familiarity bred contempt he dug her photograph done by sac citys best photographer out of his bu reau drawer and inspected it carefully yes he decided she was pretty strange that he had never noticed it before all of the sporting blood within him surged to the surface hiram too read zippy stories and he knew that models are the alpha and omega of naughtiness he ex pected to make his annual pilgrimage to the city within a few weeks and he felt that his acquaintance with martha would allow him to open the muffler and hit the high places in a way to astonish the natives she might even visit a cabaret with him and all the blase new yorkers would point him out and ask each other who the handsome man was over there in the corner with the pretty little model marthas next play brought hiram up standing she sent him a photograph decolette bearing saronys imprint merely one of the number of little studies for magazine covers she wrote for your own personal inspection only for people back home are so funny you know she also suggested that as it was nearly time for his annual trip to the city he pay her a visit while in new york then followed several pages of gossip in which she told of prominent authors illustrators and actors she met by harold ward daily of studio life and bohemianism in general oh martha had hiram going all right she knew that he would do just what he did doseize the bit in his teeth date his trip ahead two weeks and send her a wire that he was starting next day hiram was so excited upon his arrival that he indulged in the unaccustomed luxury of a taxi and hastened to marthas address it wasor seemed to hiram palace an attendant in gorgeous raiment piloted him to an upper floor in a gilded cage a dainty maid with a white cap and a french accent ushered him into mar thas presence she was entertaining that evening it seemed for the apartment half drawing room half studio was filled with people in evening dress on a spacious balcony just outside as hiram could see by looking through a pair of halfopened florentine doors distinguish ed looking men chatted with equally dis tinguished looking women upon his entrance martha gave a happy excited little squeak and rushed towards him arms outstretched then greetings over she ushered him about the spacious room introducing him to various celebrities of whom he had readauthors artists poets musicians hiram was dazed he gazed about the room taking in the gold spanish leather hangings the rich cur tains the sarouk rugs the rich prints on the walls the sheraton chairs after which he did some rapid mental arith metic almost immediately the maid served refreshments from a tray and what hiram took for an excellent grade of hard cider from a bottle as the bubbles mounted to his head he recovered rapidly from his bashfulness and in less than no time was cutting capers with jake lubert and irvin snobb he even called david selasco by his first name and danced a set with lyndia pinkham while hank wilstach played the piano in fact he was feeling his oats as they say in sac city when the party broke up and the guests took their departure at marthas request he remained until they had gone now she demanded as she snuggled down beside him on the settee tell me all about yourself and the folks back home hirams answer was an attempt to fold her in his arms but she gently repulsed his advances he was surprised why i thought he blurted out that all models were immoral martha interrupted well im not hiram did some more rapid calculat ing he appraised the furnishings mar thas gown everything she had never looked so radiant to him before he realized all of a sudden that he wanted her it may have been the bubbles go ing to his head but that has nothing to do with this story he turned upon her suddenly then how the dickens he exclaimed did you pay for all these things these here rooms must rent for near a hundred dollars a month a hundred a week she returned laz ily and youve got a hired girl i only pay felice thirty dollars a week hiram thirty dollars a week for a hired girl that cant hardly speak english he shouted his eyes blazed martha are you making this money honestly what do you mean she returned angrily nothing only ive heard how they treat models here in new york and they pay well but martha you hadnt ought to be here in the city all alone exposed to the temptations and everything and you are so darned pretty too why didnt you the sporting chance stay in sac city and marry me why you never asked me hiram would you if id asked you i might have will you now theres a preacher lives down the street just a block she answered and ive heard he keeps open all night like everything else in new york two days later when the bubbles had cleared from hirams aching brain and he had completed his buying they were speeding homeward for the first time since his arrival he left her for a few minutes while he enjoyed a cigar in the smoking compartment during his ab sence she drew a small account book from her mesh bag and rapidly conned over the entries the were itemized as follows carfare to new york board for two months sarony for photos dresses shoes rent of apartment two weeks felices wages two weeks twenty ham actors and actresses at each to impersonate artists authors etc rent of dress suits for same refreshments including champagne for hiram total she leaned back and meditated only fifty dollars left out of dads insurance its a good thing hiram didnt postpone his trip until the usual time or the money wouldnt have lasted well it was a sporting chance and i took it and she tossed the little book out of the open window oh i say old thing whos this person star ing at us so deuced hard why percy i do believe thats the well known gentle header by jove mary you dont say frightful looking egg eh what hush
