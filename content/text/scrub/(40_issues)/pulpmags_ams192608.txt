brandt literary editor editorial and general offices s park place new york n y extravagant fiction today cold fact tomorrow impossible facts by hugo gernsback ften while reading one of our modern scien tifiction tales we are wont to explode at some highly impossible plot concocted by some ingenious author and often we receive a let ter from some reader who vents his opinion in no uncertain terms that such and such a thing cannot be within the realms of possibility as we mentioned several times it is difficult to ascertain today just what is possible and what impossible for the most impossible things have become commonplaces before condemning anything as impossible therefore we should be most careful and a lot more tolerant than we are some of the most recently improbable things are now facts for instance if some one should come along and tell you a wild tale about ice boiling hot you would probably laugh at him nevertheless professor p w bridgman of the carnegie institute in washington while subjecting water to a pressure of pounds to the square inch found that under such tremendous pressure water first becomes solid turning into ice although it is nearly boiling hot not only is this impossibility a fact but we all know and have been taught that water can not be com pressed very much just the same dr bridgman has com pressed water to per cent of its original volume when you stand in the hot sun you are pretty sure that our luminary is sending down a goodly quantity of heat which makes it so uncomfortable for you on a hot summer day tell the man on the street that the sun sends abso lutely no heat to the earth and he will be ready to entrust you to an alienist nevertheless the impossible fact re mains that the earth receives no heat whatsoever from the sun because the earth and sun are both immersed in a vacuum if you have ever seen a vacuum bottle you know that no heat can be transmitted through a vaccutn if you do not believe this statement go to the top of a snowcapped mountain where you are nearer the sun than at sea level and you will find that instead of the air being much hotter there it is much cooler that is so because the sun sends us not heat rays but light rays which light rays are trans formed into heat when they strike a physical body such as our atmosphere which then retains the heat but five miles above the surface of the earth on the hottest summer day the temperature is below freezing it is impossible for a living being to live for any length of time without food how long can a living being go without food four years impossible you say never theless a number of bugs can live nearly four years without taking any food whatsoeveran impossible fact but true even a snake can live two years without food which brings us to an inquiry from one of our authors who wishes to know if it is possible for life to go on without atmosphere our answer to that question is yes just because a human being or any other living creature on earth can not live without airthat is without oxygen diluted with nitro genit does not mean that life on some other planet or even on our earth is impossible without air we know that nature has the peculiar trick of adapting living organisms to practically any conditions it is possible to freeze fish and keep them frozen for months after which they can be thawed out and revived it would seem to us therefore that some form of life is certainly possible without air what this form of life would be we have no way of knowing such a creature would in all probability have neither flesh nor blood but that does not preclude the possibility of its existence most insects have no flesh or blood for that mat ter but they manage to get along very well indeed recent observations on our satellite the moon have given indications that although it is devoid of practically all atmosphere signs of life have appeared here and there if there is life on the moon and i for one really believe there is then whatever life there is must go on with prac tically no air furthermore to aggravate the case that particular form of life must passthrough a rather uncomfortable cycle every few weeks in the first cycle the moon is subject to a gen erous amount of heat wherever the suns rays strike the surface of the moononly to be plunged into the most ter rific cold imaginable when the sun sinks below the horizon because the moon has no atmosphere the little heat which is absorbed by the rocks or theground vanishes almost im mediately after the sun stops shining and the cold of inter stellar space sets in we do not know what form of life can survive such a terrific and sudden change of climate but it is quite likely that there are creatures evolved for such an existence also if there are such beings the possibility of any circulatory system in their bodies is remote be cause such liquids surging through their bodies would of necessity be frozen during the cold period but perhaps we are wrong here too maybe there are such liquids and suh a circulatory system if the creature freezes during one cycle perhaps it is thawed out in the hot period and life goes on the same as it does on earth if it is possible for living creatures to live at the bottom of the ocean under a tremendous pressure of as high as pounds to the square inch then it is very likely possible for life to exist under worse circumstances iiniinimrmninuiiiirmrmiiurnii niriiiiijimtiiluiiiiiiniiiuuiirnimiuritumnniiiiiuiiiiuininmnnnininir mr hugo gemsback speaks every monday at p m from wrny on various scientific and radio subjects of space ij jarrett p serviss author of the moon metal the second deluge e ve watched the meteors out of the windows while edmund kept guard at the peephole we must have come almost within striking distance of a thousand in the course of an hour but edmund decided not to diminish his speed m a columbus of space chapter i a marvelous invention dxiund stonewall was the most ingenious man that ever lived in my private opinion he was the greatest human being that has ever appeared on this earth i say this de spite the fact that against my will and without my knowledge at the start he took me and two of our friends in common on the wildest craziest most impossible and incredible adventure that ever imagination conceived i ought to hate edmund stonewall for what he did to me and to my friends but in fact i rever ence his memory let me tell you the story and then you will see the reason that underlies my feeling toward him in the first place he made the most wonderful invention that ever the world heard of in fact until now the world never has heard all about it and i shudder yet when i think of it it was of course based on electricity for every body knows now that electricity is at the bottom of everything it came out of that discovery which made so much excitement at the beginning of the twentieth centuryradioactivity what is radioactivity heaven only knows but it came near being the death of me it has robbed me of my dearest friends and i dont know but that if stonewall had kept on it might have put a finish to this old earth of ours stonewall was always bothering himself about power and energy and what not he knew machinery and engines as a boy knows craps and marbles but he was dissatisfied with everything men are fools he said they might be like gods they ought to run the globe and steer it where they like you remember the old keeley motor well edmund believed in it but said keeley had got hold of the wrong end and would never make it go that way all the while he was ex perimenting himself he had money from a rich uncle i guess and he built himself a laboratory and once in a while he would invite jack ashton henry darton will church and me to come and watch some of his experiments it was all greek to us but it never failed to make us stare we saw some wonderful things there that people knew nothing about edmund took up tesla too with his communication with mars idea but after a while he dropped that and then came radioactivity radium and thorium and atomic energy when the discovery of radium in uranium ore and other things came out the rest of us would never have known anything about it but for edmund we used to skip that part in the papers and i cant say that his explanation made it much clearer but anyhow he made the thing very in spiring to our imagination listen to this boys he said to us heres professor thomson declaring that a single grain of hydrogen contains in its padlocked atoms enough energy to lift a million tons three hundred yards high but professor thomson doesnt know how to get at the energy and neither does professor rutherford nor lord kelvin but somebody has got to get at it and i guess it will have to be men but what would you do with it if you got it edmund asked jack in his goodnatured drawling manner edmunds eyeb shone strangely but he replied only i would do what archimedes dreamed of none of us knew anything about the dreams of archimedes and we dropped the subject but edmund stonewall did not drop it he simply went to work at it he used to be at our club every evening but after he got this new idea we would not see him for weeks on end and when we did see him he was as mum as an oyster but what a look he had in those deep eyes somehow with all his eccentricity we never connected the idea of craziness with stonewall he was different from other human beings that was all one evening after a long absence edmund sud denly turned up at the club and mighty glad we were to see him we couldnt understand his talk half the time but it charmed us just the same we never laughed at his extraordinary ideas there was a depth in him that awed us this time he showed an animation that we had never noticed before well boys he said shaking hands all round ive got it got what drawled jack the interatomic ener gy under control ive ar rived where a certain professor duncan dreamed of being when he wrote that when man know that every breath of air he draws has contained within itself power enough to drive the work shops of the world he will find out some day some how some way of tapping that energy ive tapped it indeed said jack well as i asked you once before what are you going to do with it i have just been telling youthat we never thought of making fun of any of stonewalls ideas but there was something so extravagant in his words and manner that we all fell into jacks halfbantering mood and united in demanding yes edmund tell us what you are going to do with it  unintentionally we nettled him and without knowing it we probably laid the foundation for the astounding thing that happened to as he did not rt his story is a classic by the wellknown scientist and writer professor serviss it is one of the first real scientific spaceflying stories ever written and remains otie of the best the story was originally published in and caused a small sensation at that time about that time radium and atomic energy theories came into public vogue and this gave a great impetus to the imagination even today seventeen years after the story was first published it remains a scientific masterpiece it being unyiecessary to make any corrections whatsoever to bring it up to date with true prophetic vision professor serviss has penned a masterpiece that will remain so for generations to come there is not a paragraph which is not packed full of in terest this story will keep you in constant suspense amazing stories reply for a moment while his eyes flashed and his face darkened then he said slowly if you will come over to the laboratory ill show you what i am going to do with it a talk at the club nothing could have suited us better ever since edmund had shut himself away we had been curious to know what he was up to we all got our hats and walked over to the laboratory he led us directly into the back yard which we were surprised to find walled and roofed so as to form a huge shanty edmund opened the door and ushered us inside i tell you we were startled by what we saw in the center of the place was the queerestlooking thing you can imagine it was not anything that i can well describe i will call it a car for that is what it most resembled it was about eighteen feet long and ten feet high and broad round like a boiler with bulging ends it seemed to be made of polished steel edmund opened a door in the end step in he said and unhesitatingly we obeyed him all except church who wras always a skeptical fellow and who for some reason remained outside edmund turned on an electric light and we found ourselves in an oblong chamber beautifully fitted up with fancy wood and with leathercushioned seats all round the sides the walls shone with polished knobs and handles sit down said edmund and ill tell you what ive got here then missing church he called out to him to come in but there was no answer we concluded that church thinking the thing would be too deep to be interesting had gone back to the club ed mund presently resumed as i told you a little while ago ive solved the mystery of the atoms ive power illimitable at my command if i chose to build the right sort of apparatus i could drive this old planet of ours against the moon and wreck it but im not going to damage anybody or anything im simply going to try a little experiment excuse me a moment thereat he stepped outside and we looked at one another wondering but still having too much con fidence in edmund to really set him down in our minds as unbalanced we rather thought that he was going to show us some wonderful thing as he used to do in the laboratory something we couldnt rnderstand but that would be interesting to look at we were not prepared for what followed we heard edmund outside in the shanty making a noise that sounded like the opening of a barn door then he reappeared entered the car and closed its door we watched him with growing curiosity there was an odd smile on his face as he reached at and touched a polished knob instantly we felt that the car was rising it rocked a little like a boat in wavy water we were startled but not frightened a visit to edmund stonewalls laboratory ccttell edmund what kind of a balloon is v v this jack asked in his careless way its considerable more than a balloon was the short reply we saw him touch another knob and felt that the car had come to rest though it still rocked gently then edmund unlocked a shutter at one side and disclosed a manypaned window of thick glass we all sprang to our feet and looked out below us were roofs and the tops of trees were about two hundred feet up said edmund what do you think of it wonderful wonderful we all exclaimed but persisted jack what are you going to do with it again edmunds eyes flashed and he said youll see the scene out of the window was beautiful the city lights were nearly all below our level and away off over the new jersey horizon i noticed the planet venus near to setting and as brilliant as a diamond i am something of a stargazer and i called ed munds attention to the planet as he happened to be standing beside me fine isnt she he said finest world in the solar system and schiaparelli says shes got two sides to her one side always daylight and the other always night i was surprised at his exhibition of astronomic lore for i had never known that he had given any attention to the subject but a moment later all this was forgotten for edmund suddenly pushed us back from the window and closed the shutter going down again so soon asked jack a little banteringly as before edmund smiled going he said simply and put his hand on one of the knobs pressing it gently we felt ourselves moving very slowly thats right edmund jack put in again let us down easy i dont like bumps annihilating gravity we all expected at every instant to feel the car touch the cradle from which it had started but we were mistaken what really did happen can better be described in the words of will church who you will remember had been left outside in the shanty i got the account from him long after ward he had written it out and put it in a safe as a sort of historic document here is churchs narrative omitting the intro duction which read like a lawyers brief when we went over from the club to stone walls laboratory i dropped behind the others because the four of them took up the full width of the sidewalk stonewall was talking to them and my attention was attracted by some thing uncommon in his manner i cant de scribe it very well but there was an indefinable carriage of the head which suggested to me the thought that everything was not exactly as it should be i dont mean that i thought him crazy or anything of that kind but i was convinced that he had some scheme in his mind to fool us i bitterly repented when things turned out as they did that i had not whispered a word in the ears of the others but that would have been difficult and besides i didnt think that the a columbus of space matter was anything serious nevertheless i determined to stay out of it so that the laugh should not be on me at any rate accordingly when the others entered the car i kept away and when stonewall called me i did not answer as he closed the door of the car for the first time the impression came to me that it might be something serious but it was then too late to interfere i was greatly astonished when with out the slightest apparent reason the car began to rise in the air i hadnt taken it for anything in the nature of a balloon and this wasnt the kind of practical joke i was looking for though if i had not been so stupid i might have guessed it when i saw stonewall open the roof of the shanty it was with much trepidation that i saw the thing which really looked diabolical with its polished sides glinting in the electric light rise silently through the roof and float mysteriously upward i felt relieved when it stopped at a height of a couple of hundred feet and i said to myself that they would soon drop down again and perhaps after all they would turn the laugh against me for being afraid a narrative of one of the participators tut in a little while the car began to move x again slowly rising and shining like some mailclad monster in the light of the arc lamps below an indefinable terror commenced to creep over me and i shivered as i watched the thing it moved very deliberately and in five min utes had not risen more than five hundred feet suddenly it made a dart and seemed to shoot skyward then it circled like a strange bird taking its bearings and rushed off westward until i lost sight of it behind some tall build ings i ran out into the street but could not catch sight of it again they were gone i almost sank upon the pavement in my helpless excitement a police man was passing officer officer i said have you seen it seen what asked the bluecoat twirling his club the carthe balloon i stammered i aint seen balloon i guess yer drunk yed better git along home there was no use trying to explain matters to him so i entered the shanty again and sat down on the supports on which the car had rested i remained a long time staring up through the opening in the roof and hoping against hope to see them come back it must have been midnight before i finally went home sorely puzzled in mind bitterly blaming myself for having kept my suspicions unuttered i got to sleep but i had horrible dreams the next day i was up early looking through all the papers in the hope of finding something about the mysterious car but there was not a word i watched for several days with the same result i cannot describe my feelings my friends seemed to have been snatched away by some mystic agency and the horror of the thing almost drove me crazy then members of their familiesluckily none of them were married began to come to me with inquiries what could i say still believing that they would come back i invented a story that they had gone off on a hunting expedition but when a week had passed and then two weeks without any news i was in despair i had to give them up remembering how near we were to the coast i concluded that they had drifted over the ocean and gone down it was hard for me after the lie i had told to let the truth out at last the authorities took the matter up and ran sacked stonewalls laboratory and the shanty without finding anything to throw light on the mystery after a while the sensation died out the papers ceased to talk about it and i was left to my loneliness and my regrets a year has now passed with no news i write this on the anniversary of their departure my friends i know are deadsomewhere what an experience it has been when your friends die and you see them buried it is hard enough but when they disappear in a flash and leave no token behind it is almost beyond endurance chapter ii a trip of terror take up the story from the point where i dropped it as minute after minute elapsed and we con tinued to move we changed our minds and con cluded that the inventor was going to give us a longer ride than we had anticipated we werent alarmed for the car traveled so easily that it gave one a feeling of confidence but we were a little indignant to think that edmund should treat us like a lot of boys without minds or wills of our own see here said jack at length id be obliged if youd tell us just what youre about ive no objection to making a little trip in your car which is certainly mighty comfortable but id at least like to be asked whether i want to go or not edmund made no reply but busied himself with his knobs first he pressed one and then another suddenly we were all jerked off our feet as if we had been in a trolley with a green motorman at the handle we felt ourselves spinning through space at a fearful rate still edmund said not a word but while we staggered to our feet and steadied our selves with hands and knees on the leathercushioned benches like so many drunken men he clung to his knobs and pushed and twisted the car slowed down then and the motion became more regular the beginning of a lecture uttxcuse me said edmund quite in his nat tl ural manner the thing is a little new yet and ive got to learn the stops by experience but theres no occasion for alarm maybe there isnt replied jack but will you amazing stories be kind enough to answer my question and tell us what youre about and where were going id rather like to know henry and i felt our indignation rising and henry broke out see here ive had enough of this if you cant tell us what it all means just go down and let me out i decidedly object to being carried off in this manner against my will and knowledge by this time edmund seemed to have got things in the shape he wanted and he turned to face us he always had a magnetism that was inexplicable and we felt it then as never before his features were perfectly calm but there was a light in his eyes that seemed electric it was my first intention he said to makethis expedition alone in case i couldnt persuade you to go along but you provoked me a while ago and i made up my mind that id take you anyway im not going to do you any harm and youll thank me for it before were through but where do you propose to take us asked jack who had rather more selfcommand than the rest of us ill show you replied edmund and that for the time being was all that we could get out of him there was manifestly no use in making a fuss we knew nothing about the management of thecar and couldnt even understand what the power was that moved it edmunds talk about interatomic energy was to us like calculus to schoolboys we were in his hands and depended absolutely upon him he could do what he liked with us if we had overpowered him what should we have done next i saw that the only possible thing was to humor him besides knowing him as we did i couldnt feel that he meant to bring us to any harm as i have told you we never thought him crazy and we didnt think so then he evidently knew exactly what he was about and we had to trust to him whether we wished to or not as i turned the thing over in my mind i became calmer i thought that we could get something out of edmund by quietly showing some interest and questioning him about the machine what are all these knobs edmund i asked they control the driving power he replied in perfect good humor but like a schoolmaster ad dressing pupils who he knows cannot entirely fol low him i push or turn one way and we go i i push or turn another way and we stop or go back so i concentrate the atomic power just as i choose it makes us go or it holds us motion less or it carries us back to earth according to the way i apply it the earth is what i kick against and what i hold fast by any other body in space would serve the same purpose as to the machinery youd need an education in such things to understand it youd have to study the whole subject from the bottom up and go over the experiments that i have made i confess that there are some things the fundamental reason for which i dont know the real reason for myself but i know that i have this power in control and if i had professor thomson and professor rutherford here id make them open their eyes i sure wish i had been able to kidnap them so you admit that youve kidnaped us said jack but he said it i was glad to see with a smile if you want to put it that wayyes edmund responded also smiling well boys said jack turning to henry and me we may as well make the best of it so far as i can see edmund has got us in his aerial craft and well have to complete the voyage what ever it may be perhaps youll treat us to a trip to paris edmund id like that immensely better than that said edmund paris is small potatoes compared with what you are going to see and so indeed it turned out a comfortable beginning of the trip finally we all got our pipes and tobacco and began to make ourselves at home we dropped the subject that had been uppermost in our minds and talked of other things jack always full of reminiscences entertained us with stories so hours glided by till most of us began to feel sleepy ill have to keep the first watch said ed mund and all the others too this night so then were not going to land tonight asked henry no not tonight edmund replied you may as well turn in you see ive prepared good bunks he lifted the tops of some of the benches along the walls and turning them outward showed us beds already made up i believe ive not forgotten anything that can make us comfortable he added arms instru ments clothing furs andlots of good things to eat we looked at one another in surprise but nobody spoke though the same thought probably occurred to eachthat this promised to be a pretty long trip judging from the preparations arms edmund had said what in the world should we need of arms was he going to take us off to the rocky mountains for a bear hunt and clothing and furs but we were really sleepy perhaps the motion had something to do with that although now it had become almost imperceptible at any rate it was not long before all three of us had taken edmund at his word and leaving him to manipulate his knobs as he saw fit we turned in he considerately drew a shade over the electric light and then noise lessly opened the shutter covering the window when i saw him doing that i was strongly tempted to rise and look out but i didnt do it instead i fell asleep the earth spread out like a map when i woke windows were open on both sides of the car and sunlight was streaming in through one of them henry was still asleep jack was yawning in his bunk just preparing to rise and edmund stood at one of the windows staring out i quickly made my toilet and then went to edmunds side good morning he said taking my hand look a columbus of space out here and tell me what you think of the prospect i put my face close to the glass and my heart jumped into my mouth where are we i cried out jack hearing my agitated exclamation jumped up and ran to my side it was truly enough to take away ones breath we seemed to be at an infinite height and the sky was as black as ink and ablaze with stars although the sunlight was streaming into the window behind us i could see nothing of the earth evidently we were too high for that it must lie away down under our feet i thought so that even the horizon had sunk out of sight i had that queer uncon trollable qualm that comes to every one who stands on the verge of an abyss straight before us so i presently became aware was a most singular appearance in the sky i thought at first glance that it was a round cloud curiously mottled but it was strangely changeless for a cloud and it had moreover a certain solidity of aspect tjiat could not consist with vapor good heaven cried jack catching sight of it whats that thats the earth it was edmund who had spoken and now he looked at us with a quizzical smile breakfast on board far up above the eastern hemisphere a thrill shot through me my mind went into a whirl i saw that it was the truth he had told for as sure as i sit here at the moment that edmund spoke the great cloud rounded out before my eyes the deception vanished and i recognized the outlines of asia and the pacific ocean as clearly as ever i saw them on a schoolglobe in another minute i had become too weak to stand and i sank trembling upon a seat jack whose eyes had not accommodated themselves to the gigantic perspective as rapidly as mine remained at the window declaring fiddlesticks what are you trying to give us the earth is down below i reckon but in a little while he too saw the thing as it really was and then his excitement equaled mine in the meantime henry awakened by the noise had run to the window and had gone through the same experience our astonishment and dismay were too great to recover from but after some minutes we gained a little selfcontrol in heavens name edmund jack at last ex claimed what have you been doing nothing very extraordinary edmund replied coolly at least nothing that ought to seem ex traordinary if men had not been fools for so many ages they might have done this long ago theyve been wasting their time with steam and coal and a hundred other petty sources of power when all the while they had the limitless energy of the atoms under their thumbs and didnt know it its the interatomic energy that has brought us out here and that is going to carry us a good deal farther before we are through we simply listened in silence for what could we say there was not the shadow of a doubt about it we were out in the middle of space and there was the earth hanging on nothing like a summer cloud heaven knows how far away it might have been a million miles for all we could tell a speed of miles a second tteve made a pretty good run during the vv night said edmund finding that we were speechless you must be hungry by this time for youve slept late lets have breakfast so saying he opened a locker took out a folding table covered it with a white cloth turned on a little electric range and in a few minutes had ready as appetizing a breakfast of eggs and as good a cup of coffee as i ever tasted it is one of the compensations of human nature that it is able to adjust itself to the most unheardof conditions pro vided that the inner man does not find itself neg lected the smell of breakfast would almost recon cile a man to purgatory anyhow it reconciled us for the moment to our situation and we ate and drank and fell into as cheerful good comradeship as a fishingparty after a big mornings catch when the breakfast things had been cleared away we began to smoke and chat frequently inter rupting the talk however to take a turn at the window staring at the spectacle of the world we were leaving behind us edmund got out some binoculars and with them we could recognize many geographical features we could see japan and the philippines spots near the shore of the pacific we recognized the crinkling line of the snowy himalaya mountains and a great white smudge over the ocean showed where a storm was raging and where good ships were no doubt battling with the waves beneath i noticed that edmund was continually going from one window to the other as if watching for some thing and there was at times a look almost of ap prehension in his eyes he had a peephole in the forward end of the car covered with thick glass and he frequently visited it even while we were at breakfast i had observed that he was not easy but kept jumping up and running to look out at last i asked him what are you looking for edmund meteors he replied shortly meteors out here of course youre something of an astronomer dont you know that they hang round all the planets they didnt let me sleep last night they kept me on tenterhooks all the time i was half inclined to get one of you up to help me we passed some pretty ugly looking fellows during the night you know this is an unknown sea that we are navigat ing and i dont want to run on a rock and wreck the ship but we seem to be pretty far from the earth now i said and there ought not to be much danger its not so dangerous as it was but theremay be some round yet ill feel easier when ive put a few more million miles behind us millions of miles when we had imagined that the earth looked as though it might be a million miles away it was merely a passing thought which didnt impress us with its real immensity but now when we heard amazing stories edmund say that we actually had traveled such a distance the idea struck us with overwhelming force meteors on all sides tn heavens name edmund jack called out at what rate are we traveling then just at present edmund replied glancing at an indicator on the wall were making twenty miles a second twenty miles a second why i exclaimed thats faster than the earth goes in its orbit yes just a trifle faster edmund replied smil ing but ill probably have to work her up to a little better speed in order to get where i want to go before our goal begins to run away from us ah thats it put in jack thats what i want ed to know what is our goal edmund where are we going before edmund could reply we all sprang to our feet affrighted a loud grating noise had broken upon our ears at the same instant the car gave a lurch and a blaze like a flash of the most vicious lightning streamed through one of the windows blank the things shouted edmund springing to the window and then darting at one of the knobs and beginning to twist it with all his force in a second we were sprawling on the floor ex cept edmund who kept his hold our course had been changed with amazing quickness and our startled eyes beheld huge misshapen objects dart ing past the window here comes another cried edmund seizing the knob again i had managed to get my face at the window and i certainly thought that we were lost only a few rods away rushing straight at us was a vast black mass shaped something like a dumbbell with ends as big as houses tumbling over and over itself and threatening us as it came with annihilation if it hit us as it seemed sure to do i knew that we should never return to the earth unles it might be in the form of pulverized cinders chapter iii the planetary limited but edmund had seen the meteor and quicker than thought with a turn of the knob he swerved the car and threw us all off our feet again but we would have been thankful to him even if he had broken our heads for he had saved us from instant destruction the danger was not yet gone however scarcely had the huge dumbbell which edmund assured us afterward must have been composed of solid iron from its effect on his magnetic needles passed be fore there came from outside a blaze of lightning so fierce and penetrating that it closed our eyes as if the lids had been slapped shut a collision exclaimed edmund the thing has struck another big meteor and they are ex changing redhot compliments he threw himself flat on the floor and stared out of the forward peephole then immediately he jumped to his feet and gave us another tumble he had changed the course once more theyre all about us he said were like a boat in a raging spring freshet with rocks tree trunks and tossing cakes of ice threatening it on every hand but well get out of it the car obeys its helm as if charmed why i got away from that last fellow by setting up an atomic reaction against it as a boatman pushes his pole against an icefloe a trip to venus in the midst of our terror we could not but admire our leader his resources seemed boundless and our confi dence grew with every escape we watched the meteors out of the windows while edmund kept guard at the peephole we must have come almost within striking distance of a thousand in the course of an hour but edmund decided not to diminish his speed for he said that he found he could control the car quicker when it was under full headway so on we rushed dodging the things like a crow in a flock of pestering jays and after a while we began to enjoy the excitement it was better sport than shooting rapids in an open skiff and we got so confident at last in the powers of our car and its commander that we were rather sorry when the last meteor was passed and we found our selves once more in clear open space after that the time passed quietly we ate our meals and slept as regularly as if we had been at home there was no night for us because the sun shone in at one window or the other all the time yet as i have said the sky was jet black and the stars glittered everywhere round us when we wanted to sleep we put up the shutters keeping watch only through the peephole which as it did not face the sun admitted little light we kept count of the days by the aid of a calendar clock there seemed to be nothing that edmund had for gotten once the idea suddenly came to me that it was a wonderful thing that we had not all been smoth ered with bad air breathing the atmosphere of the car over and over again as we were doing and i asked edmund about it he laughed thats the easiest problem of all he said look here and he threw open a little grating in the side of the car in there he explained theres an apparatus which absorbs the carbonic acid and renews the air it is good to work for at least a month which will be more time than we need for this expedi tion there you are again broke in jack i was asking you about that when we ran into those pesky meteors what is this expedition where are we going taking rifles to venus rell since you have become pretty good vv shipmates replied edmund i dont see any objection to telling you we are going to venus a columbus of space going to venus we all cried in a breath to be sure why not weve got the proper sort of a conveyance havent we there was no denying that as we knew that we had left the earth far behind and had already traveled some millions of miles it didnt after all seem to be a very crazy idea that we might actually go to venus but how far is it asked jack when we quit the earth edmund replied venus was rapidly approaching inferior conjunc tion you know what that is albert addressing me its when venus comes between the sun and the earth the distance between the two is not always the same at such a conjunction but i figured out that on this occasion allowing for thei circuit that we should have to make there would be just twentyseven million miles to travel at the average speed of twenty miles a second we could do that distance in fifteen days fourteen and onehalf hours but of course i had to lose some time going slow through the earths atmosphere for other wise the car would have caught fire by friction like a meteor and i shall have to slow up again when we enter venuss atmosphere so that i dont count on landing on venus in less than sixteen days from the time of our departure weve already been out five days so eleven re main before i hope to introduce you to the in habitants of another world the inhabitants of another world this idea took us all aback do you believe there are any such inhabitants asked henry i know there are said edmund otherwise i wouldnt have taken the trouble to come of course said jack stretching out his legs and pulling at his pipe whod go twentyseven million miles if he didnt expect to see somebody then thats what you put the arms aboard for i remarked yes but i hope we shall not have to use them strikes me this is a sort of a pirate ship said jack but what kind of arms have you got for answer edmund threw open a locker and showed us an array of automatic guns pistols and some cutlases getting close to venus tvecidedly piratical cried jack but u see here edmund with all this inter atomic energy that youve got under control why in the world didnt you construct something new something that would just knock the venustians silly and blow their old planet up if it became necessary it seems to me that automatic arms though pretty good at home are rather small pump kins for invading a foreign world with i didnt prepare anything else said edmund in the first place because i hadnttime and in the second place because i didnt really anticipate any fighting i hope that we can get along without that you mean to try moral suasion i suppose drawled jack well anyhow i hope theyll be glad to see us and since its venus were going to visit i expect that the ladies will be perfect houris for beauty im glad you made it venus instead of mars edmund for from all ive heard about mars with its fourteenfoot giants i dont think i should care to go there we all laughed at jacks fancies but there was something thrilling in the idea too for here we were unless we were dreaming actually on the way to venus i tried every way i could think of to test whether it was a dream or no but do what i would i came always to the conclusion that i had never been more wideawake in my life both jack and i were sufficiently romantic to find a great charm in the thought of visiting another world but henry was different he always looked at the money in a thing edmund he said i think you have made a fool of yourself what good will it do you or us to go to venus here you have got an invention that will revolutionize mechanics you might if you had exploited it as you ought have made the greatest millionaire look like the smallest kind of an atom but instead of developing the thing in a businesslike way you rush off into space on harebrained adventure that depends upon the point of view and the mental makeup edmund replied calmly to me venus is infinitely more interesting than all the wealth that you could pile up between the north pole and the equator am i not the columbus of spaceand you my lieutenants he added smil ing besides just wait until we return to the earth i dont promise to give my attention to moneygetting then but i may revolutionize a good deal more than mechanics yes if we ever do return said jack a little lugubriously poor jack none of us knew then what was in store the time ran on and we watched the day hand on the calendar clock soon it had maiked a week then ten days then a fortnight we were getting pretty close but up to this time we had not yet seen venus edmund had seen it he said but to do so he had been obliged to alter the course because the planet was almost in the eye of the sun and the light of the latter streaming into the peephole blinded him a mysterious display of flames in consequence of the change of course he told us we were now approaching venus from the eastflanking her in factand she appeared in the form of an enormous shining crescent i shall never forget my first view of her we had got within half a million miles and edmund was very nervous about meteors again he said they were probably thicker round venus than around the earth because the former is nearer to the sun and everything crowds up as you approach the center of the solar system con sequently he would only allow us each a brief peep at the planet because he wanted to be all the time at the lookout the peep that i got was sufficient that vast gleaming sickle hanging in the black amazing stories sky was the most tremendous thing i ever looked upon soon afterward edmund changed the course again we had not come upon the expected mete ors in any great numbers and edmund said he felt safe now in running into the planets shadow and making a landing on her night hemisphere you see venus as schiaparelli had found out doesnt turn on her axis once every twentyfour hours like the earth but keeps always the same face to the sun the consequence is that she has perpetual day on that side and perpetual night on the other i asked why we didnt land on the daylight side but edmund said his plan was safer we could easily go from one hemisphere to the other he declared but it didnt turn out to be as easy as he thought i hardly expect to find any inhabitants on the dark hemisphere he said it must be fearfully cold theretoo cold for life to exist perhaps but one can never tell anyhow i am going to find out well just stop for a look at things and then the car will carry us round to the other side we can thus approach the inhabitants who i am sure exist on that side from behind as it were and that will give us a chance to reconnoiter them a little and plan our arrival safely if venus is rightly named said jack im for getting where the inhabitants are as soon as pos sible when we swung round into the shadow of the planet we got her between the sun and us then she completely hid the sun and appeared like an immense black circle blacker than the sky itself but all round this black circle appeared a most beautiful ring of light thats her atmosphere said edmund lighted up by the sun from behind but for the life of me i cant tell what those great flames mean descending into the cavern of venus he referred to a vast circle of manycolored flames that blazed and flickered with all the hues of the rainbow at the inner edge of the ring of light it was the most awful and at the same time beautiful sight that i ever gazed at thats something altogether outside my calcu lations edmund averred i cant account for it at all perhaps they are already celebrating our ar rival with fireworks said jack always ready to take the humorous view of everything thats not fire edmund responded what it is i cannot say but well find out i havent come all this distance to be scared off our approach was so rapid that the immense black circle grew hour after hour with portentous swiftness soon it was so large that we could no longer see its boundaries through the peephole were within a thousand miles said edmund finally we must be close to the upper limits of the atmosphere the atmosphere of venus is denser and more extensive than that of the earth and if we rush into it we shall be burnt up by the effects of friction ill have to slow down he slowed down a little more rapidly than was comfortable it was jerk after jerk as he dropped off the power but at last we got down to the speed of an ordinary expresstrain being out of the sunshine now we had to use the electriclamp to illuminate the car at length we got so close that the surface of the planet became dimly visible we were settling very slowly by this time and as we drew gradually nearer we began to notice singular shafts of light that seemed to issue from the ground beneath us as if it had been covered with so many iron foundries by jove cried edmund i believe there are inhabitants on this side after all i certainly dont believe that those lights come from vol canoes im going to make for the nearest one and will soon know what they are accordingly he steered the car for one of the gleaming shafts it grew brighter as we ap proached and threw a faint illumination upon the ground around it everything seemed to be very flat and level as if we were dropping down upon a prairie but no features could be clearly made out in the gloom edmund boldly approached within a hundred feet of the light and with the slightest perceptible bump we touched the soil of venus its probably frightfully cold outside said edmund and well put on these things by way pf precaution he dragged out of one of his innumerable re ceptacles a lot of thick fur garments and gloves as if we were going among the eskimos and made us put them on while he dressed himself in similar fashion then he handed to each of us a pair of big automatic pistols telling us to put them in our sidepockets these preparations having been made he cautiously opened the door after having as he said electrically anchored the car to the ground the air that rushed into the car as the door was opened almost hardened us into icicles it was colder than ten thousand icebergs it wont hurt you edmund exclaimed it cant be down to absolute zero on account of the atmosphere ive kept it so warm inside the car that youve become potboiled youll soon be used to this come on and he led the way out after glancing round us for a moment we cau tiously approached the shaft of light it issued from an irregular round hole as we drew near the edge we saw that there were rough steps at one side of the pit leading downward in another instant we were frozen stiff not with cold but with amazement my heart for a moment stopped beating standing on the steps watching us with eyes as big and luminous as moons was a creature shaped like a man but more savagelooking than a gorilla  a columbus of space  chapter iv the caverns of venusan inhabitant for two or three minutes the creature con tinued to stare at us motionless and we to stare at him it was so dramatic that it makes my nerves tingle now when i think of it his eyes alone were enough to scare a man out of his senses as i have said they looked like full moons they were so big so round and so lumin ously yellow it was the phosphorescent yellow shot with green that you sometimes see in the eyes of a cat or a wild beast its great hairy head was black but its short stocky body was as white as that of a polar bear its arms were long like an apes and it had a look of immense strength and activity edmund was the first to recover from the sur prise and then he did a thing that seems absurd when i recall it well hallo you he called out in a voice that made us jump as if it had been a thunderclap in that heavy atmosphere the sounds struck the eardrums like triphammers the effect on the creature was electric a film shot across his big eyes he made a sudden move ment uttered a queer squeak that seemed ridicu lous coming from an animal of such size and in an instant more he had disappeared stumbling and tumbling down the steps hurrah shouted edmund weve conquered a hemisphere in fact the evident terror of the creature im mediately heartened us all our fear vanished and following edmund we rushed for the hole and began a hurried chase down the steps we noticed that the air was decidedly warmer round the mouth of the pit and as we descended the temperature rose after a while we pulled off our arctic togs and left them on a shelf of rock but we didnt leave the automatic pistols then we proceeded downward it was an awful hole for depth the steps rudely cut wound round and round the sides like those in a cathedral tower except that the shape of the pit was not regular it looked like a natural formation perhaps i thought the throat of an extinct volcano though there being no mountain that didnt seem prob able either but the steps were certainly of arti ficial origin the awful tenants of the cave when we had descended several hundred feet we emerged suddenly into a broad cavern the temperature had been rising all the time and here it was as warm as in an ordinary room the cavern was i should say about twenty yards broad and eight or ten feet in height with a flat roof over in a corner i saw a hole down which the steps continued there was not a living thing visible but there was light coming from what looked like a heap of coal burning with great brilliance in the center of the floor a strange but not unpleasant odor filled the place and as we paused to consult we all spoke of the curious exhilaration which we had experi enced almost from the moment of setting foot on the planet edmund said it was due to the dense atmosphere which undoubtedly was heavy with oxygen it certainly had a good deal to do with our rising courage and our insensibility to fatigue notwithstanding the precipitancy of our long de scent we did not draw an extra breath as we looked about us seeing no one edmund declared that it was necessary to go on we cant give it up he said weve got to find the inhabitants and now that we have seen one of them we know pretty well what to expect come along he led the way down the steps in the corner they wound round just like the others and again we descended a long distance perhaps as much as three hundred feet then we reached a second cavern larger and loftier than the first and there we found them there never was such a sight it made our blood run cold again notwithstanding our initial triumph which had been so cheaply won ranged along the farther side of the cavern vis ible by the light of another heap of bright coal were twenty or thirty of those creatures standing shoul der to shoulder with their great eyes glaring like bullseye lanterns but the most frightful of all were their motions the venustians terrified by one pistol shot you have read how a huge cobra rearing on his coils sways his terrible head from side to side before striking well all those black heads before us with their lantern eyes were swaying in unison only the motion was circular three times by the right and then three times by the left those heads circled in rhythmic cadence while the lumi nous eyes made phosphorescent rings in the air intersecting one another in consequence of the rapid movement it was such a spectacle as no man ever beheld in the wildest dream it was baleful it was the charm of the serpent paralyzing its terrified prey we felt it in an instant and our brains began to whirl i found myself staggering in spite of all my efforts to stand firm and a kind of paralysis ran through my limbs presently all moving to gether and uttering a hissing whistling sound they began slowly to approach us keeping in line each shaggy leg lifted high at the same moment like so many soldiers on parade while the heads con tinued to swing and the glowing eyes to cut linked circles in the air but for edmund we should have been lost he spoke to us over his shoulder in a whisper boys take your pistols and kill as many as you can but dont shoot unless they make a rush ill knock over the leader in the center and i think thatll be enough so saying he raised his pistol but as for the rest of us we could no more have stirred our arms than if we had been marble statues as the creatures approached another step ed mund blazed away the report was like an earth quake it shocked us into our senses and almost out of them again the weight of the atmosphere amazing stories and the confinement of the cavern magnified and concentrated the sound until it was awful the fel low in the center that edmund had aimed at was hurled to the ground as if shot from a catapult the others fell as flat as he and all lay groveling the big eyes filming and swaying wildly but no longer in unison the charm was broken and as we saw our ene mies prostrate our courage and nerve returned i thought so said edmund coolly its the sound that they cant stand im sorry i killed that fellow for the report alone would have been suffi cient this atmosphere acts like a microphone you have heard the voices of these creatures which are hardly louder than whispers their ears are evidently not made for sounds of any magnitude i shouldnt wonder if i had burst every eardrum in the lot after all he continued after a moments thought it is perhaps as well that i took one life probably it would have had to come eventually and now we have them thoroughly cowed if they had ever reached us they would have torn us asunder in a moment with those muscular arms the food of the natives and their cooking as he spoke edmund boldly approached the grov eling row and pushed with his foot the huge white furry body of the one he had shot the bullet had gone through his head at edmunds approach the creatures sank even lower on the rocky floor and those nearest to him turned up their moon eyes with an expression of submissive terror and sup plication that was grotesque though unmistakable he motioned us to approach and imitating him we began to pat and soothe the shrinking bodies until understanding that we would not harm them they gradually acquired some confidence in us in short after a while a relation like that of masters with the most submissive slaves was established in the meantime the crowd in the cavern in creased others of the creatures attracted perhaps by the noise coming in continually through side passages those who had been present at our ar rival explained the situation to the newcomers as we could see and it was evident that our prestige was thoroughly established as we became better acquainted with these crea tures we found that they were not as savage as they looked their heads and the larger part of their faces were covered with black hair but on their bodies was a white silky fur why the dif ference of color existed i could never imagine the reason for the great size of their eyes appeared evident it was the prevailing darkness of the side of the planet on which they dwelt with those eyes they could see in the gloom like cats they were surprisingly intelligent too in their way their construction of the hundreds of steps leading down into the caverns and their employment of a kind of coal for heat and light showed that but this was not all we found that in some of the caverns which were connected with one another by winding passages they cultivated their food which consisted entirely of vegetables of various sorts all unlike any that i had ever met with on the earth water dripped from the roofs of these caverns but there was no light except that derived from the burning coal yet the vegetation though almost colorless seemed to thrive astonishingly a necessary killing phey had many ways of cooking their food and although there yet remained a good sup ply of stores in the car edmund thought it advisable for us to accustom ourselves to the diet of the in habitants we found it decidedly agreeable and without ill effects of any kind the only brute animals of any size that we could discover in the caverns were some doglike creatures about as large as terriers but very furry the burialground of the community we discov ered when they came to dispose of the fellow that edmund had shot it was a large lone cavern sit uated at a long distance from the one which we had first entered we thought we saw indications of some kind of religious ceremony when they put their slain comrade in the ground and then for the first time we recognized the women we were astonished by the evidence of a monogamous rela tion among the sexes which was furnished by the fact that one of these women manifested by her sorrow a special grief which we thought could only be accounted for upon the supposition that she was the wife of the dead person she held two or three little ones by the hands and we were fairly moved to tears by the spectacle edmund being particularly affected i almost wish i had never come here he said bitterly since the first thing i have done is to kill an inoffensive intelligent creature not so inoffensive either put in jack if you hadnt killed him where should we be now but it wasnt necessary edmund insisted the noise alone would have sufficed dont borrow trouble said jack sympathetical ly you did the best you knew and heaven knows what we should have done without you but i noticed that edmund was afterwards very gentle with the poor creatures who seemed to bear us no illwill feeling probably that we were supe rior beings who could do as we liked i have spoken of them as a community and i may say here that we afterward discovered that all this part of venus was sprinkled over with simi lar communities somewhat resembling separate tribes each tribe occupied a group of caverns by itself and there seemed to be but little intercourse among them they seldom went out of the caverns except to perform a very remarkable ceremony which led us into a danger that put streaks of silver on my head where no gray hair was due for many years yet but of that later the most surprising discovery that we made in the cavern was a big smithy it was really noth ing else edmund had foretold us that we should find something of that kind he based hispropnecy on the fact that there were rude tools and utensils of metal in the caverns he examined the metal and pronounced it iron all the planets are largely composed of iron he said these people here primitive as they seem in many ways have found out how to smelt and a columbus of space make various articles of it they must have a blacksmith shop and im going to find it it wasnt longperhaps two days time after our arrivalwhen we came upon the place it was in one of the side caverns and we actually found several of the savage smiths at work with furs fastened over their ears to ward off the sound they were turning out long sharppointed tools the purpose of which edmund divined in a moment theyre to dig coal with he said and he was right the strata of rock were filled with seams of a very hard coal and these people dug it out to keep their fires going it was the best coal that i have ever seen infinitely better even than anthracite but where did they get their fire to begin with asked jack perhaps by friction like our savages on the iearth edmund replied perhaps they got it down below i added what do you mean by that asked jack i know what he means interposed edmund better than he does himself perhaps venus there is reason to believe is not as old a planet as the earth consequently its crust is not as thick it may be that the internal fires do not lie so deep i shouldnt be surprised if that accounts in part for the comfortable temperature down here when the surface above us is so terribly cold owing to the absence of the sun our discovery of the smithy seemed to have set edmund to thiifking after musing a while he said this is a most fortunate thing for us well have occasion to employ the skill of these fellows and to teach them something new for our own benefit hows that i asked the strange sledge trip proposed cctts this way i want to take some of these fellows along when we start for the daylight ride of the planet i can find my way well enough with the aid of the stars but these creatures may be useful to us in other ways but we cant take them in the car which is full enough already luckily the power of the car is practically un limited and it could draw a whole train if neces sary now im going to carry them along in sleds dragged after the car and ill make the sleds of iron since theres no wood to be had its another lucky thing that this part of venus is almost a dead level a sort of rolling prairie as you have observed covered with a kind of icy shingle which is just suited for runners trees cant grow here and if there were ever any rivers they became frozen solid ages ago but why not make the fellows walk asked jack theyve got good legs walk said edmund why man weve got at least five thousand miles to go before we reach the edge of the sunlit hemisphere and i dont pro pose to spend several months on the way with the sleds drawn after the car we can make the journey at the rate of a hundred miles an hour all right said jack the sooner you start the better as far as im concerned i want to find the goodlooking people of venus these dont suit my taste henry after his manner said nothing but as i saw him looking about i got the impression that he was calculating the millions that might be made out of these ironmines on venus edmund never reached a decision without starting immediately to put it into practise he now began his prepara tions for the journey to the other side but they were quickly interrupted in a most dramatic fashion while we were occupied in the smithy as i call it showing the native smiths how to fashion the runners and upper parts of the proposed sleds we were interrupted by some one coming in and call ing our assistants away from us they all ran out and we after them on arriving in the prin cipal cavern we found a singular scene the earth seen from venus two natives whom we did not recognize as having made their appearance before were evidently in charge of some kind of ceremony they wore tall conical caps of polished metal cov ered with curious hieroglyphics and had staves of iron in their hands they marshaled all the others numbering several hundreds into a long column and then began a slow solemn march up the steps the two leaders produced a squeaking music by blowing into the ends of their staves women were mingled with men and even the children were not excluded we followed at the tail of the procession our curiosity at the highest pitch at the rate we went it must have taken nearly an hour to mount the steps as we emerged into the open air the cold struck to our marrow the natives covered with fur didnt seem to mind it but we ran back to the shelf where he had left our arctic outfits and put them on then we ascended again and emerged into the night finding the crowd assembled not far from the entrance to the cavern the frosty sky was ablaze with stars and directly overhead shone a huge brilliant planet of amazing beauty and close beside it a smaller one the earth said edmund pointing upward and the moon it was indeed our planet and her satellite i cant describe the feeling that came over me at the sight but in a moment edmund interrupted my meditation a ceremonious procession of the venustiana cct ook at that he said lthe natives had formed themselves in a great circle under the starlight with the two lead ers standing in the center all the others dropped on their knees and the leaders raised their long arms toward the sky and gazed up at the zenith at the same time uttering a kind of chant in their queer subdued voices by jove theyre worshiping the earth ex claimed edmund indeed she looked worth worshiping never have i seen so amazingly splendid an object she amazing stories was twenty times as brilliant as the brightest planet that any terrestrial astronomer ever beheld and the moon glowing beside her like a great at tendant star redoubled the beauty of the sight its just the time of the conjunction said edmund this is their religion those fellows are their priests the earth is their goddess i understand it all now i wouldnt have missed this for a world suddenly the two priests began to pirouette as they whirled more and more rapidly their huge glowing eyes made phosphorescent circles in the gloom like those that had alarmed and fascinated us when we first met the creatures in the cavern they gyrated round the ring of worshipers with astonishing speed and all those creatures fell un der the fascination and drooped to the ground with eyes fixed in evident helplessness upon the two performers an impending sacrifice of one of th travelers from the earth now for the first time i caught sight of a square object that seemed to be a stone rising a couple of feet above the ground in the center of the circle at this instant the spinning priests having drawn close to the ring of fascinated worshipers made a dive and each caught a native in his arms and ran with him toward the square object that i have described its a sacrificial stone cried edmund theyre going to kill them as an offering to the earth and the moon the truth flashed into my mind and froze me with horror but just as the second priest reached the altar where the other had already pinned his victim with a stroke of the sharp point of his staff his captive suddenly recovering his senses and terrified by the awful fate that confronted him uttered a cry wrenched himself loose and run ning like the wind leaped over the circle and dis appeared in the darkness the fugitive passed close to us and jack shouted as he darted by good boy the enraged priest was after him like lightning as he came near us his awful eyes seemed to emit actual flames but the runner had already van ished without an instants hesitation the priest shot out his long arm and caught me by the throat in another second i felt myself carried in a bound as if a tiger had seized me over the drooping heads of the worshipers and toward the horrible altar chapter v off for the sunlands dreadful as the moment was i didnt lose my senses on the contrary my mind was fearfully clear and active there was not a horror that i missed the strength and agility of my captor were astounding i could no more have struggled with him than with a lion only one thing flashed upon me to do i yelled with all the strength of my lungs but they had become accustomed to our voices now and the mad dened creature was so intent upon his fell purpose that a cannonshot would not have diverted him from it he got me to the altar where the preceding vic tim already lay with his heart torn out and press ing me against it with all his bestial force raised his pointed staff to transfix me with my dying eyes i saw the earth gleaming down upon me and will you believe it my heart gave a glad bound at the sight she was my mother planet and the thought that she might help me in my extremity rced across my brain but the dreadful spear had already begun to descend i could see the sweeping muscles under the lithe fur and i pressed my eyes tight shut bang something grazed my shaulder and i felt the warm blood gush out then i knew no more arecovery from a swoon in the midst of a dream of hpyhood scenes a mur mur of familiar voices awoke me i opened my eyes and couldnt make out where i was i must still be dreaming i said to myself and closed my eyes once more then i heard edmund saying hes coming out all right i opened my eyes again but still the scene puz zled me i saw edmunds face however and behind him jack and henry standing with anxious looks but this was not my room it seemed to be a cave with faint firelight on the walls where am i i asked back in the cavern and coming along all right edmund answered smiling back in the cavern what could that mean then suddenly the whole thing flashed back into my mind so he didnt sacrifice me i said shivering at the thought not on your life jacks hearty voice broke in edmund was too quick for that but only by the fraction of a second said ed mund still smiling what happened then i asked my recollections coming back stronger every moment a good long shot happened said jack the best i ever saw i looked at edmund he saw that i wanted the story and could bear it and his countenance be coming serious he began when that fellow snatched you and leaped intp the circle i had my xur coat wrapped so closely around me not anticipating any danger that for quite ten seconds i was unable to get out my pistol i tore the garment open just in time for already he was pressing you against the accursed stone with his spear poised im used to quick shooting and i didnt waste any time finding my aim even as it was the iron point had touched you when the bullet crashed through his head the shock swerved theweapon a little and you got only a scratch on the shoulder which might have been a columbus of space more serious but for the thickness of your arctic coat the dead priests and a life saved cctthe fellow fell dead beside you and under the a circumstances i felt compelled to shoot the other one also for they were both insane with the delirium of their bloody rites and i knew that our lives would never be safe as long as they remained fit for mischief im sorry to have had to start killing right and left like this but i reckon thats the lot of all in vaders wherever they go its our second lesson and i think it will prove final when their priests were dead the rest had no fight in them in fact they never intended to harm us but nobody knows what those two chaps might have led them into my conscience is easy about them anyhow how long have i been here tasked two days by the calendar clock said jack yes edmund assented two days i never saw a man so knocked out by a little shock for your wound wasnt much i fixed that up in five minutes you must have been scared to the very bottom of your soulnot that i blame you how ever but look at yourself he held a pocketmirror before me and then i saw that my hair was streaked with gray but we havent been idle in the mean time ed mund went on ive got two sleds nearly com pleted and tomorrowearth timei mean to set out my wound was very slight and the effects of the shock had all passed off during my long spell of insensibility in an hour or two i was aroused busy with the others i found that edmund had already picked out the natives that he meant to take with us they were a dozen huge fellows who he had discovered pos sessed more than average intelligence among them was one of the smiths the best of the lot and for convenience edmund had given him a name something resembling that by which his comrades called himjuba starting the sled trip among his other apparently infinite stores of useful things in the car edmund had a roll of small strong steel cable and this now came ad mirably into play the two sleds were pitched one behind another with a piece of the cable and a line about a hundred feet long connected them with the car the latter could thus rise to a considerable height without lifting the sleds from the ground the sleds were provisioned from the stores of the natives and we took some of their food in the car also not merely to eke out our own but because we had come to like it the fellows selected to join our expedition made no objection on the contrary they seemed proud to accompany us and were evidently envied by their comrades the scene at starting was a strange one about five hundred natives the entire population of the group of caverns belonging to their tribe which were distributed over about a square mile assembled at the entrance to our cavern to see us off as we started the natives on the sleds being unused to the motion clung together like so many awk ward white bears taking a ride in a circus their friends stood about the illomened sacri ficialstone waving their long arms while their huge eyes goggled in the starlight jack in a burst of enthusiasm fired four or five shots from his pistol as the reports crashed through the heavy air you should have seen the crowd vanish down the hole the sight made me wince when i thought that they must have gone down like a cataract all heaped together but they were tough and i trust that no heads were broken the effect on our twelve fellows on the sleds came near being disastrous i thought that they would leap off and run and no doubt they would have done so but for the fact that edmund put on so much speed that a new terror instantly took the place of the old one instinct taught them not to jump when the ground was spinning away under them at the rate of sixty miles an hour edmund brought jack sharply to book for his thoughtlessness give me your pistol he said in his old mas terful way which nobody that i ever sqw could stand against jack was almost twice his size but he handed over the pistol like a rebuked schoolboy when you learn how to use it ill give it back to you said edmund and that closed the incident the plan of the sleds worked like magic a hundred mile an hour sleigh ride after their first fear had vanished the natives began immensely to enjoy the new sensation edmund worked up the speed as he had promised to a hundred miles an hour and even for us in the car it was a glorious spin but there was one danger that had to bs guarded againstthe mouths of the cavern as i have told you the natives were divided into tribes each tribe being in possession of a group of caverns these caverns were undoubtedly of natural origin but why they were not more uniformly dis tributed over the surface i cannot say anyhow the fact was that perhaps forty or fifty pits would be found scattered over a mile or two of ground and many of them connected by under ground passages and then there would be a long distance without any caverns all seemed to be inhabited and to that fact we owed in a great measure the safety of the sleds the shafts of light issuing from the caverns were so many beacons in the endless night telling us where the underground settlements lay and so we avoided running the sleds into the holes although we had one or two narrow escapes as it was twice edmund insisted on stopping at a group of caverns to make the acquaintance of their in habitants on both occasions we descended into the caves and found the creatures at home whether they would have received us so civilly if we had not taken juba along i cant say amazing stories juba the veiiustian intercessor invariably he acted as intercessor and in terpreter and i guess our reputation suffered no belittlement from his accounts of our prowess it was evident edmund said that there were dif ferences of dialect in the language of the various tribes which puzzled juba somewhat but he also said that he was now convinced that there existed among these people an unexplained power of com municating thought which had no connection with the utterance
