saturday night in happy paris marcelle abadie yawned lazily and moving across the room to the radio snapped on the switch and twirled the dial to her favorite station her every motion was languid mechanical alphonse she murmured her voice a bare shade higher than the soft tone of the music have you ever been told that as a conversationalist you are an exceptional bore the man seated across from her leapt to his feet and regarded her angrily nom dun nom then you consider it boresome to listen to a mans declaration of love bedtime tales marcelle shrugged her lovely shoulders i am very easily tired she confessed lightly then in a piercing explanatory manner oh ce nest pas ca du tout it is the mere repetition of the thing over and over monotonously until i do not think that i could bear another amorous protest have i not impressed you with the fact that i intend to marry money much money and that i refuse absolutely to countenance a placid parisian existence do not be a fool ma cherie an expression of pain darted across alphonses features and he reached for her hand consider matters in the light of reason although i will admit that you are the most beautiful nurse in all paris and a thousand and other little things like that i hardly think that you will discover it a simple matter to find a millionaire patient who will be proud to marry you et ne pourquoi pas she interrupted in a crude pretence of surprise you have no idea to what extent i would go to convince a rich man that i am his intended mate he fell back before her calm assurance youyou cannot mean that mais oui i can she insisted in a calm businesslike tone appropriate to her words suppose that i married you alphonse what would life hold for me other than a futile struggle against overwhelming odds in the capacity of wife of a very ordinary writer whose income does not even approach a substantial figure i would feel that i had lived entirely in vain i cannot and i will not be provincial regardless of the price the ambitions which i have cherished for seven long years refuse to be smothered and even the wholehearted love of a man would scarcely be adequate to fill the gap in my heart which their abandonment i have promised myself that it shall be would occasion the world is large and my playground i want to travel to see things to do things and to enjoy the luxuries which life denies the average woman if you were in a position to offer me these things i would fly to your arms in the traditional melodramatic fashion but she hesitated and her eyes sought the floor youyou common fille de joie alphonse ground the words between his teeth and reached for his hat on the table you are a fool marcelle and if you persist in that ridiculous attitude you will receive a series of lovely bumps which should hammer a bit of sense into that pretty little head of yours i am going he moved to the door when you have decided to forget the cinderella fancies send for me and we shall plan bedtime tales our honeymoon until then i shall employ my hours of liesure to better advantage than heretofore good night good night marcelle clenched her hands and glared at him in lofty disdain a sudden flush of temper drew the warm blood to her cheeks you need not entertain the slightest hope that i will ever plead with you to return she started but the sudden jangling of the telephone in the corner of the room cut through her words and with an impatient gesture she strode across to it and lifted the receiver to her ear eh bien marcelle abadie you are needed at once mademoiselle a call has just been received from the country home of monsieur pierre cantrelle at aixlesarbees would you care to accept pierre cantrelle the wealthy sportsman who earned more newspaper headlines than the chamber of deputies the most soughtafter eligible within a thousand kilometers certainement she endeavored desperately to conceal her anxiety i will report for duty within an hour she turned from the instrument her eyes seeking out the figure of her guest so that she might gloat over him and torture him with the possibility of eventual success but he had already gone she wondered if he had heard coute que coute the sooner she banished thoughts of alphonse from her mind the happier she would be better indeed to dwell upon the prospect of exercising her wiles on the reputedly handsome sportsman alighting from her conservative little italian roadster before the imposing mansion of pierre cantrelle she walked swiftly up the narrow tiled walk to the steps mounted to the high jacobean porch and pressed on the bell a minute passed no reassuring footsteps came from within another minute still no reply she pushed again on the buzzer qui est la the scarcely audible whisper drifted to her ears from the ancient speakingtube directly in front of her she placed her lips to the apparatus a nurse from lhopital de cicely a moment of silence then entrez silvousplais i am alone on the second etage the voice seemed to break and i doubt if i cancreep back to my room she understood the symptoms weakness claimed the sufferer whohad been obliged to lift himself from his bed and stagger to the speaking tube the door yielded to her touch and throwing it open she leapt with surprising agility up the winding staircase to the upper landing of the house where are you here i succeeded a light suddenly flashed on from a room a little to her left and illuminated the darkened hallway i must have overestimated my strength things went rather black for a second or so but i managed to crawl back she stopped across the threhold and considered the pyjamaed figure on the bed youre feeling better she asked with a professional smile very much so he assured her i must confess however that i scarcely expected the most beautiful girl in all paris toto nurse me you must not exert yourself monsieur cantrelle her accent was polite to the verge of ineptitude and with a sigh of resignation he lowered his head to the pillow now she continued kindly furnish me with a few details to begin with i would like to know if you anticipate a visit from le docteur tonight he thought for a moment i hardly believe that docteur robellin will return until morning he said you see he hesitated again for a full minute i suffered a mild attack of ptomaine poisoning and discovering myself alone in the house i put through a hurry call to the physician his arrival proved timely and i weathered the storm with no serious effects other than a session of weakness and nausea which have just about abated robellin insisted that i allow him to engage the services of a nurse as a precautionary measureand here you are cest tout marcelle lifted her eyes from the makeshift chart which she had prepared any medicines to administer none he flushed guiltily and she wondered whether he had childishly hidden the bottles but by the way nurse what is your name mademoiselle abadie she said swift ly then obviously relenting marcelle abadie his eyes roved to the ceiling quelle nom pour quelle femme he said softly she placed a cool restraining finger on bedtime tales his lips you will do well to cease speak ing now she admonished bluntly i am going to take your temperature and if you have even so much as a single degree of fever you will be obliged to remain silent throughout the night dieu que non he opened his mouth and allowed her to place the thermometer beneath his tongue the merest semblance of a smile hovering about his lips her eyes met his for a brief instant held them and fell her lips tightening as the realization came over her that her cheeks flushed crimson it had been im possible to stare into those level brown eyes without wavering and the sensations evoked by his handsomely irregular profile were those which unwittingly betrayed themselves her fingers trembled as she withdrew the thermometer and denoted the figure attained by the mercury ninetyeight degrees no doubt his pulse was also nor mal but she dared not trust herself to the extent of touching his wrist what is the verdict he lifted himself from the pillow and placed his hands on his hips she turned her back on him and moved to the table near the bedside you will be yourself by morning she announced with forced placidity he glanced suspiciously at her i know that it is a holiday butyou are not going he asked suddenly as though the very suggestion frightened him her composure had returned and she faced him squarely not if you wish me to remain you are not entirely hors du danger monsieur and holidays mean but little to a nurse he nodded seriously if you ventured so much as a single step from this room i am certain that i would have a dangerous relapse draw up a chair and let us talk frankly a chat with you will do more good than harm if you refuse i will no doubt endure a sleepless night very well she snapped back uncompromisingly although her heart sang with elation at least she had awakened bis interest in the shadowy briliance of a single bedtime tales chandelier he regarded her strange emotions coursing through his body he had never seen anything so beautiful so desirable i never knew that a woman could be so lovely he said solemnly and touched his bedewed forehead with a handkerchief her lips parted in a glowing smile love makes all women beautiful she whispered dimpling and blushing very prettily love he remained before her his breath coming fast do you mean that i love you mon amour her soft voice thrilled him and he quivered in anticipating of her caresses from the first minute i saw you i loyed you exultantly sure of herself marcelle drew his head down to her and kissed him full upon the lips her warm fingers caressed his cheeks and moving upward stroked his curly black hair with a motion so tender as to lull him to a sense of absolute security you are going to learn the true hidden meaning of the word love she promised looking at him for a moment and then dropping her eyes his lips narrowed into a slim straight line i believe that i am beginning to learnalready he announced tightening her masterfully in an arm which had ceased to tremble then kiss me she stared pleadingly into his eyes kiss me and teach me the meaning of your kind of love she nestled in his arms her head resting upon his shoulder her eyes closed the meaning of all love he said softly forcing her head backward with a hand which cupped her lovely chin this is love his own mounting passion answered hers in a kiss of terrible ardor which touched her to the very depths of her soul dawnthe dawn of a new day and of a new lifemarcelle lifted her head from the pillow and allowed her glance to roam about the chamber which would in the future be her own her life mate although the unexpected success of her scheming had left her somewhat dazed her selfish material impressions darted again to the fore piercing the spell of unreality which enveloped her and she smiled with smug complacency she doubted very seriously that pierre could awaken in her the tender affection which she still felt for the struggling writer alphonse fortier but at any rate she might learn to care for him to some extent the luxuries with which he would be in a position to provide her would adequately recompense her for the slight discrepancy her heart still sang as she arose from the bed and donned the prim white uniform which she had so carelessly tossed aside the night before she would allow pierre to sleep as late as he wished n doubt he felt completely fagged good morning ma cherie his voice loud and clear cutting sharply through the stillness however assured her that her concern had been needless good morning she moved to the side of the bed and lowered her lips to his you had better rest a

remained silent listening intently to the regular pace of the newcomer as he ascended the stairs approached the room bon jour the door opened slowly and a tall distinguished man stepped across the threshold marcelle gazed at him in frank admiration handsome to the point of actual beauty with a figure which radiated elegance and position he re garded them with sparkling eyes i am happy to that

gaston is this the crescent beauty parlor sitting at her office desk temporarily forgetting the rows of typewriter keys which faced her doris steele spoke into the telephone the reply must have been in the affirm ative because her next words were will you ask nelly if she can take for a shampoo and a wave at four oclock this is miss steele speaking yes thats right steele steele bedtime tales doris hummed snatches of a catchy song as she waited for the answer guess i ought to change my name to jones or something she thought i always have to spell it for everybody hello she swerved back to the telephone mouthpiece she can all right thank you glancing at her notebook at exactly the point where she had left off a few minutes before her fingertips resumed the staccato hammering of the keys it was saturday morning and she was in a hurry to finish her work before the office closed at noon doris had a date on ice for that eve ning an extra heavy date with her best boy friend kilbur gray who was taking her to a dance out on long island it was only recently that doris had be gun to patronize the beauty shops her dark brown hair liberally streaked with bronze tints was naturally long and wavy when she arrived in new york from her smalltown home and she had always been accustomed to giving it an occa sional shampoo with her own hands one day in the office rest room a girl had remarked you ought to get your hair bobbed why asked doris the idea had never occurred to her because youre the type for it looks good now doesnt it sure but it would be real swell if it was bobbed doris thought it over maybe the girl was right on her way to the subway the next morning she noticed the crescent beauty parlor around the cor ner after office hours she dropped in to the crescent and made several inquiries the result could be seen a little later when she emerged hat in hand and headed gleefully toward the apartment house where she occupied a oneroom bathkitchenette suite your skin is glorious sweetheart wilburs gaze were avidly traveling on and on over a rapidly expanding territory bedtime tales thereafter it was a difficult matter to persuade doris to wear a hat i just love it when the breeze blows through my hair she would explain soon she realized that bobbed locks need frequent attention and she became a regular customer at the crescent nelly was the staff hairdresser who kept doris head in good trim cut and arranged in a fluffy style the bronze elements in her hair seemed to be more pronounced than the brown thus giving a piquant air to her personality that was more than nordinarily attractive nelly was quite proud of her pretty patron whos your girl friend asked another operative after doris had left the shop on the evening of her first visit isnt she cute murmured nelly her hair has never been bobbed before shell be a steady customer of yours now you get all the breaks the other retorted complaining why didnt they turn her over to me you catch all the goodlooking ones but i get the hens and crows nelly laughed complacently and dis appeared into her booth doris insisted upon trying many dif ferent ways of fixing her new bob critically seeking to find out if there was a mere becoming type it was nelly who advised her to adopt the bushy fluffi ness in back exposing all of her creamy white forehead and tiny ears her boy friends raved about it the girls in the office were jealous even the one who suggested it would be real swell all of which was a sure sign that it was alluringly fetching doris was on time for her four oclock appointment when she minced down the aisle of the beauty shop several pairs of eyes trailed her until she vanished behind the curtains of nellys booth whisking off her dress she sat down clad only in a sheer silk chemise that was simply the whipped cream on the cake of her glowing young charms youve got to do better than your best this afternoon she warned nelly smil ing im stepping out tonight hes a lucky boy whoaver he is looking young man in new york mmmmm doris sighed that takes in a lot of territory said nelly new york is a big city and youre going to say there are a lot of young men in this town retorted doris i know but this one is different if you know what i mean what makes him so different nelly liked intimate conversations with her customers on topics that dealt with the emotional side of human nature oh you want details laughed doris youll have to use your imagination its a hard thing to describe but he just makes me feel different when im with him thats all goose flesh all over more than that say did you ever have a pinsandneedles cramp lots of times nely smiled and went on with her work during the shampoo doris said little it was after her hair had dried and the waving operation was about to start that she remarked im going to wear an evening gown to night how do you think ill look you can wear one said nelly youve got the skin and the figure youll look lovely wilbur likes me in it thats the best looking young man i suppose of course doris murmured innocently she pulled down the front of her chemise and put her finger on an in finitesimal spot almost invisible on her chest what is this nelly i no ticed it this morning when i was dress ing in the course of nellys investigation she pulled the chemise considerably lower than was necessary a generous por tion of doriss firm young breasts came into view oh its only a little blackhead said nelly testing it with a fingertip i can fix that in no time suiting the action to the word the blackhead vanished under nellys skilled manipulation of a loopholed instrument then she suggested let me see if youve got any more arms and shoulders and neck were ex amined minutely but there was nothing to mar the satin sheen of flesh any on your back nelly continued the examination better be careful be cause evening gowns have hardly any back to them these days the chemise interfered with the thoroughness of the inspection so nelly pushed the shoulder straps down went the garment around doriss waist youve got the loveliest skin nelly must have thought that the gown was going to be a very daring model because her hunt for the blackheads which she failed to find went far afield finally she faced doris there you can wear janything or nothing now your skin is perfect her eyes swept the gracefully rounded con tours youth was expressed in every line and curve breasts that were as perfect as the skin that formed a natural brassiere topped with cherryred nipples stood out boldly bedtime tales youre a sweet little thing whis pered nelly you ought to take good care of yourself not many girls are blessed with a shape like yours doris laughed it is cute isnt it the chemise still lay bunched about her waist i hope i never get fat doris con tinued id hate it except that id like to fill out a bit here her hands went up to her breasts fondling the delicate roundness what an idea said nelly its funny about people here you are want ing to develop a big bust and here i am trying to reduce mine doris glanced at her the long white coat successfully hid nellys figure are you big there ill say i am how big plenty declared nelly i have to buy oversized brassieres i was always fullbreasted even when i was a kid oh let me see exclaimed doris im pulsively nelly obligingly opened her coat securely imprisoned within the confines of a mesh bandeau with ridges of flesh escaping from the sides and top her bosom strained impatiently mmmmm murmured doris you are big arent you in the deep valley betwen those bulg ing mountains there were several dim ples and through the lace mesh darkly red shadows could be seen surrounding each pointed tip you havent seen anything yet com mented nelly a flip of her finger un bedtime tales hooked the brassiere instantaneously doris saw the most voluptuous develop ment that she had yet observed theyre marvelous nelly stretching out a hand she touched each breast gingerly at first then more inter estedly why in the world do you want to re duce oh i dont know too much of a good thing is sometimes not so good the boys love them that way dont they do they asked nelly laughing what do you know about the boys i know that much anyway doris whispered nelly let the front of her coat flap loosely as she resumed the hair waving job she didnt bother to readjust her brassiere nor did she stop to rebutton what lotion do you use on your skin she asked oh you should use something to keep it soft and pliable what for instance we have a lotion thats wonderful ill show it to you after im through with your hair it keeps your skin just like satin id like to try it and you should have a body massage once in a while tones up the sinews and the muscles and makes the flesh springy and lively did you ever have one ive had a facial massage said doris i mean a body massage all over doris stressed the question incredulously sure replied nelly it

york you want to look and feel your best ill give you a massage and fix you up with the lotion neverything no you wont declared doris do you expect me to spend my weeks pay in here this afternoon who said anything about the cost well how much well come to that later beautiful id be willing to give you a massage for nothing if i owned this shop but you dont own it laughed doris nelly leaned over her whispering con fidentially thats very true but who knows what goes on inside my booth nobody bedtime tales it was nearly seven oclock before doris turned the key in her apartment door in the interim she had been subjected to the most bewildering variety of beauty treatments she hadnt dreamed that such things were possible undressing quickly she paraded before her mirror excessively proud of her ap pearance her skin glistened pinkly and the fragrance of her impregnated the at mosphere it was while she was admiring herselt that margie snowher girl friend with whom she now shared the

and reached in the closet for a negligee a pink silk combination did not even pretend to conceal the duskiness of her brunette charms fullfledged and luxuriant have you got a date tonight asked doris its saturday night isnt it whove you dated and where are you bedtime tales going to have your wild time frank samson is blowing me to a show and he says he knows of a new speakeasy with the duckiest

was heard above the sound of rushing water thats her favorite pastime hunt ing for blackheads wilbur gray rang the bell promptly at nine oclock doris was ready and his neart was not to be blamed for pumping his blood heat edly through his veins when she pranced into the living room and greeted him youre more gorgeous every time i see you thanks do you really like this eve ning gown doris turned arid pirouetted before him the bodice was simply strips of velvet diminishing in width until they became very narrow straps over each shoulder the schism between her pretty breasts clearly defined caused them to stand out even more prominently in back there was a sweeping vista of bare skin down to the flowing hip line the gown was such that abrassiere could not be worn with it and the consequences were obvious when the eye took in the ensemble its swell said wilbur swathed in a fur coat doris seated her self beside him in his roadster and soon they shot across the bridge threading their way through traffic until they set tled down for an easy loping ride along the winding long island roads wilbur had a flask and there were sev eral convenient pauses in quiet country lanes after the third attack on the flask he put an arm about her shoulder his fingers barely touched her neck oooooooo doris exclaimed your hand is cold here get yourself warm she made a slight opening in the front of her fur coat through which he slid his hand it was surprising how warm it became in the twinkling of an eye but it was surprising that his fingers began to move in a surreptitious arc doris felt the creeping sensation and when his hand discovered the swelling bedtime tales breast for which he was searching amid the vast area of fur she murmured now wilbur be a good boy i only suggested that you get your hand warm thanks for the suggestion he whis pered gently toying with the softness that lay beneath his palm this other hand is cold too the re mark brought a smile to doriss red lips she looked at him thrillingly may i warm it well i dont want you to suffer from frozen fingers she said then you couldnt drive the implied consent was sufficient for wilbur in a second or two his arms vanished from sight amongst the fur doris snuggled closer give me a little kiss he breathed were going to a dance arent we or is this going to be a petting party his hand was coursing up and down her back in a way that sent repeated thrills chasing each other in rapid succession another hand was wandering in another direction that was capable of distributing a greater variety of thrills wed better be going wilbur well be late oh lets stay a little while how about that kiss only one thats all but the moist parting of her lips pro longed it to an extent that made it many kisses rolled into one doriss heart beat in a furious flutter and her response was soulful when their lips melted apart she sigh ed in bliss im mad about you declared wilbur and ive got an idea lets pass up the dance and elope as their mouths met and clung tenu ously once more she whispered wheres the nearest minister darling toward dawn in a tiny hotel in another state where marriages can be consum mated without

laverne three oclock and alls well so far george taylor put his watch back in his pocket and filled his lungs with the keen night air he he was standing on a small ledge railed in like a miniature porch that jutted out from the side of the house a tortuous winding street typical of the older part of paris lay below him inside the dwelling behind the curtain ed windows and drawn shades sounds of revelry cut into the stillness and came floating to his ears speaking of wild parties george mused lighting a cigarette this one certainly reminds me of a tornado back home he had arrived in paris only a few days before after winning a scholarship which entitled him to a years postgraduate work in the science of medicine he had taken rooms in a pension in the latin quartier of the city and had scarcely unpacked his belongings when he receive the invitation to the soiree that he had forsaken for a moments breathing spell in the fresh air phew he whistled blinking his eyes leaning against the rail his brain be gan to rid itself of the surcharge of wine and cocktail fumes that were making him feel woozy and befuddled eo he decided to stay out there in the air a little longer but he had no sooner reached this deci sion than he heard a feminine voice di rectly behind him ah monsieur i have been looking all over the place for you isnt the party enjoyable he turned to look into the dancing eyes of a titianhaired charmer who was his hostess bedtime tales im having a wonderful time he de clared then why are you out here all alone for no particular reason he prevaricated the window was open and i came out for the view it is worth while she murmured shutting the casement that extended from floor to ceiling as she did so george saw the white surface of a bare back that the decolletage of her gown uncovered to the bend of her hips and when she swung around to face him he was confronted by a similar expanse of pale skin except for peaked strips of velvet that cupped the softness of her breasts has monsieur a cigarette for me asked lucette cailleaux her crimson poppy mouth opening in a flushed smile a short upper lip shaped like the lower so easily george had been admiring lucette all evening he had danced with her once or twice but she was such a popular part ner that he was crowded out too fre quently a pungent perfume mingled with the crispness of the air as she swayed forward to accept the flame of a match for the cigarette that she placed beween her lips and george was agreeably disturbed by the pressure of a warm thigh just above his knee isnt it a bit chilly for you without a cloak he asked mischievously she blew a puff of smoke directly into his face and laughed mon sieur will keep me from freezing no cest pas a soft arm was creeping about his neck george glanced at the casement window he hadnt been in paris long enough to stop worrying about jealous husbands suppose that window should be pushed suddenly and an irate torrent of gallic malediction commence to pour down on his head where is francois he queried lucette laughed again fear not mon sieur that we will suffer any interruption francois at this minute is thoroughly oc cupied and interested tres beaucoup with a blonde and a brunette who are sitting in his fat lap trying to curl three hairs on the top of his bald head her mouth was almost touching georges lips her breath was very sweet and hot impregnated with the odeurs of wine per fume and smoke he found it not at all displeasing reassured that francois was not likely to burst upon them with uxorial wrath george let his hands play up and down the smoothness of her back she pressed closer kiss me mon george her fingers seized his face and drew him as she tip toed the better to take complete posses sion of his lips and he glimpsed more than the curling tip of a lively tongue avidly expectant it seemed to be minutes later when she slowly released his face and gasped de licious monsieur georges mind was in a whirl he took a deep breath tell me madame is that what is called a french kiss lucette smiled and tilted her head co quettishly isnt a kiss the same honeyed meeting of the lips the world over george looked daringly into her eyes yes and no dont people kiss that way in amer ica she seemed very much surprised sometimes said george it depends upon who is kissing and who is being kissed you understand oui oui but it should be a meeting of souls as well as lips monsieur other wise there is no meaning to a kiss one shadowy eyebrow slanted upward and she shrugged her shoulders yes yes of course he agreed her arms were still coiled around his neck he was sitting sideways on the railing one leg dangling free the exotic heat of her enveloped him like a misty fragrant cloud and as she talked he felt her move sinously nearer a kiss should be tasted ne cest pas like one toastes wine upon the tongue she continued in a low mumur certainly assented george his hands were wandering over her now he had completely forgotten the possibility that francois might appear on the scene and francois might appear with the softness of the contours yielding so delightfully be neath his fingers her breasts were small in comparison with the fullness of her hefty hips curving in and out most in triguingly lucettes lips were moistly demonstrat ing what was her clinging conception of a tasty kiss as she slowly insinuated her helf against him until every line and curve fitted perfectly georges enthusiasm was growing apace his blood already heated with the wine that he had consumed now was racing like molten lava in his veins under the exhil arating spell of her kiss mmmmmm monsieur she moaned her lips tore away from his only to plunge into his mouth once more with greater avidity than ever george felt his knees giving way wobbly under the ecstatic strain suddenly she wilted limply in his arms and would have fallen had he not held her so tightly so possessively bedtime tales and at that very instant the excited voice of francois could be heard lucette lucette he called she squirmed away i must go mon sieur her eyes were aswim with emo tion lover she whispered planting a swift impulsive kiss on his lips before she vanished through the casement window george was panting he wished that there was a comfortable chair out there on the ledge so that he could sit down to recover his equilibrium what a girl he muttered holding a light to his cigarette it was his first amor ous experience in paris and he marveled at the passionate impetuosity that had overwhelmed him i need a cocktail he said but he hadnt taken a step toward the window when it opened and willowy brunette charms embodied in the person of a lovely femme staggered out and almost collided with him a glass was in her hand and some of its contents spilled oh monsieur pardonnezmoi she laughed gaily adding i did not know that anybody was out here george was glad that she hadnt thought of taking their hectic rendezvous a few minutes ago and he grinned as he won dered what the brunette would have done if she had stumbled upon the fiery tab leau i was just going in for a cocktail he said here monsieur please take mine she offered it seems as though i have had far too many already oh no no he demurred go ahead and drink it ill run in and get another she blocked his passage smiling please monsieur take this one see i shall sweeten it for you she touched the rim of the glass with her bloodred lips and the sharp point of a snaky tongue dipped itself into the liquid then swiftly circling his neck with her arm she held it to his mouth at exactly the spot where the sweetening process had taken place george drank thirstily thanks he murmured it was a drop of honey monsieur she whispered and there is an ocean of it where that came fromher parted lips moved about the edges of his nibbling biting moistureladen hot georges arm about her waist encom passed a slimness that seemed as if it might be brittle if it were not so resili ent but his hand upward bound met a breast that was amazingly fullfleshed then slipping downward his fingers found hips that were boyishly small the party sounded very very far away to george as he gave himself up whole bedtime tales heartedly to the thrill of her kiss and the exploring of her beauties which were a study in contrasts at last she let her lips dissolve ahh she sighed it was the most luscious kiss ive had tonight a fingertip stroked his cheek monsieur would like another cocktail perhaps id like another kiss oh but you are greedy no thirsty she pinched his nose playfully mon sieur shall have both kiss and cocktail and as many of each as you desire a million billion trillion george was fascinated by her colorful personality you will wait here she murmured approaching the window i will bring the glasses cocktails before kisses non left alone once again george chuckled i guess thats why they call this town gay paree he hadnt taken three puffs of his cigarette before the brunette re appeared a glass in each hand she sipped one darting a tonguetip in it her eyes sparkling thats mine he declared reaching for it monsieur likes honeydew i see she sidled up to him offering her mouth whether the kisses tasted better with the cocktail or the cocktail tasted better with kisses george couldnt make up his mind but there was a tempestuous merger of lips before and after each sip and when the glasses were empty she began to teach him variations in the tricky art of oscu lation in the midst of a particularly long and especially succulent kiss she trembled like a reed in his arms whats your name he asked a mo ment later soothingly sophie monsieur she answered sigh ing i am sophie la rue they call me the idol of montmartre everybody knows me no wonder said george resuming the kiss it was progressing steadily toward an other crescendo of fiery flares when they heard someone fumbling with the latch on the window and a shrill voice said diable sophie smiled because she had slipped the catch that locked the casement when she came back with the cocktails it is sara mon ami she has such a temper that she will break down the win dow if it does not open i had better see what she wants disengaging herself from the interlac ing hetwork of georges muscular arms bedtime tales sophie unlatched the casement and let it swing wide a girl with a blazing bush of the reddest hair that he had ever seen peering out into the dimness of the little balcony at the sight of sophie she said excitedly ahha so there you are ma bebe mais oui i am here replied sophie calmly what of it our host francois is beside himself searching for you from cellar to garret continued sara he swears that you promised to dance with him and the pros pect seems to have gone to his head with all the wine he has swilled she laughed and waved a hand go to him dearie and comfort him before he is completely insane sleeky tigerish eyes were focused upon george as sara rambled on they were heavylidded eyes glinting feverishly and eggwhite of her complexion if monsieur will excuse mesophie was saying i did make a promise to francois that i should keep au revoir she stepped inside as sara stepped out on the ledge bon soir monsieur said sara smil ing at george or perhaps i should really say bon matin look the dawn is break ing thats right said he oh it is cold ne cest pas a shiver rippled through her let us go in mon homme would you care to dance with me i was just about to propose the same thing he countered with an interested grin the balcony gave directly on to a nar row piazza and beyond it was the draw ingroom where several couples were drift ing about in a pretense of dancing but paying more heed to each other than to the music sophie was there hugged by francois bedtime tales on chairs and settees more couples draped themselves in lesser or greater de gree of wanton abandonment in accord ance with the stage of satiety of their amorous inclinations george paused in the doorway with sara amusement showed on his face as he glanced about the room everywhere he looked there was a piquant exhibition two white arms around a manly collar all else invisible except a silken kneecap a gleaming thigh clasped by a flowered garter two faces welded in a soulful kiss masculine fingers frantically trying to solve the mysteries of a brassiere lace fringed panties and other lingerie of all the colors of the rainbow and a bewildering variety of sizes and shapes in breasts that were pointed pinkly redly or darkly he heard sara laugh and looked into her slinky eyes monsieur might prefer a cozy corner instead of a dance she purred lopping her arm with his there is a settee just big enough for two non she pointed to the end of the piazza almost hidden in the shadows he saw the little couch invitingly vacant im glad you suggested it he said sitting beside her oh you should not be bashful or back ward mon ami saras lilywhite hand seemed to be counting the buttons on his vest we are friends ne cest pas i hope so murmured george inanely dropping his eyes to the swelling mounds so frankly disclosed by the brevity of her corsage an individualistic perfume heav ily spiced by musk emanated from her with the allure of the orient in its odeur she leaned back against a large cushion on one side of the settee one hand still flited nervously about him the other was resting like a lilywhite bird on his shoulder v monsieur didnt feel the chill on the balcony no saras lips were perpetually open whether or not she was talking laughing or silent and george was thrilled by her habit of constantly poking a salmontinted tonguetip between the edges of her pearly teeth it was as characteristic a gesture as her muskladen perfume it is never cold when sophie is near she commented smiling her kiss is a living furnace monsieur oui george felt a bit embarrassed he had always felt that it wasnt gentlemanly to kiss and tell so he simply said is it sara laughed lightly you are a diplo mat mon ami but you wouldnt be di vulging any secrets to admit that you en joyed the kiss of sophie she herself would boast of another conquest it is her privilege said george but let us talk about you mamselle your hair is very pretty her fingers had slid along his shoulder and were now toying with the lobe of his ear you like red hair monsieur it is strikingly attractive sara looked pleased it has always been as you see it now i was redhaired baby george thought that she still was is that a dimple he asked placing a hesitant hand near the bend of her elbow mais out and here is another she lifted the other elbow there are many more aussi where he pursued courageously for instance she whispered pull ing down the front of her gown ever so slightly in the valley between her breasts george saw a perfect dimpled recess but his eyes did not overlook the red carnation buds on the adjacent hill tops he bent his head to kiss the dimple distended and crystal hard it was as and then his lips travelled to first one and then the twin bud both becoming bedtime tales though he had dipped his face in a bowl of perfume sara drew in a hissing breath through clenched teeth ending in a gasp that ex pressed her joyous reaction to his caress oh monsieur i should faint if you did that again george put it to the test sara didnt faint but her hissing sigh and the grind ing of little teeth together were even more eloquent than if she had lost conscious ness and finally a muffled scream of sheer delight caused him to look up quickly sara had thrown her curly red head back on the pillow eyes shut tightly lips thrillingly aquiver the hollow at the base of her throbbing throat might have been an exaggerated dimple and georges kiss found it sweetly warm it was an easy matter then for him to claim her mouth and in the rhapsody of her de lirious response there was nothing want ing in the momentary lull that sometimes occurrs between stormy guests george heard her whisper there are as many dimples cheri still to be discovered ill kiss each one he replied if you will show them to me sara laughed enticingly wouldnt it be ever so much more fun if you searched for them yourself seek monsieur and you will be sure to find george played the game of hideandseek with a thoroughness that was its own rich reward it was broad daylight when george climbed the stairs of his pension rattled the key in the apartment lock and un dressing quickly crawled wearily into bed murmuring seven oclock and alls well so far move over closer to me

were whooping it up celebrating the occasion in their own ex clusive fashion they danced cavorted and played like school children on a pic nic and the walls of the moulin echoed back their shrieks of laughter but even more than the hilarious guests florette carvel lovely proprietress of the establishment celebrated satisfied pa trons meant increased business and in creased business meant a substantial bank account oh it was good she reflected to feel independent to know that ones exist ence did not depend upon the generosity of others bedtime tales her glance rested upon a party of six that occupied a ringside table headed by the parisian artist of note monsieu rene volland the sextette were literally rais ing the roof their voices sounded clearly over the hubbub of countless other voices and their dances were wilder and more impassioned they had ordered lavishly everything on the menu from capons and anchovies to roast duck and caviar and demanded that they be served the rarest liqueurs from the cellars of the moulin what a magnificent time they were hav ingand what a magnificent bill they were running up she smiled in satisfaction as four of the party arose from their chairs and stag gered to the checkroom for their cloaks leaving only rene volland who was ap parently too drunk to notice their de parture and a short fiery brunette at the table plorettes eyes narrowed and a flicker of hatred shone from them as she con sidered the remaining pair the minutes ticked away slowly finally without a word of farewell the brunette slipped away from the now sod den parisian and the door of the moulin closed behind her retreating figure rene volland was very much alone his head slumped forward on his chest and he slept florette smiled grimly the scene had been set to her liking and the final act of the play would provide her with the thrill that comes once in a lifetime four oclock the master of ceremonies had made his little bedtime speech and the waiters were in the act of assisting inebriated patrons to their limousines rene volland slumbered on he awakened to the touch of a feminine hand on his shoulder and lifted tired eyes misericorde cannot a man sleep he hesitated sharply and strove to steady himself long enough to solve the identity of the woman who had roused him what do you want florette maintained a severe counten ance it is the time of closing monsieur she said i am sorry he nodded dizzily certainement you want me to go i presume yes she tendered him the check your indebtedness amounts to two hun dred and fortysix dollars and eightynine cents monsieur the announcement sobered him two hundred yes monsieur your party ordered quite lavishly as the numerous empty champagne bottles should convince you but it was not my party he protested i came as an invited guest florettes lips narrowed to a thin line regardless of whose party it was i am legally entitled to hold you responsible for the bill she said i will therefore be pleased to accept a personal check useless he shrugged his shouders i have no money the collapse of fer rando mills stock has reduced me to ab solute penury florette thought for a moment before she replied ordinarily in such cases i have recourse to the police she ad vised gloating over his evident perturba tion but in this instance i will be more generous you are monsieur rene vol land and i admire your work i am mademoiselle carvel proprietress of the moulin we shall bargain paint my por trait tomorrow and i shall be pleased to issue you a receipt in full mademoiselle is very kind rene itfted himself to his feet you may come to my studio tomorrow florette signalled to two of the waiters who had remained in the background dur ing the enactment of the scene you will stay here monsieur valland she said quietly these two gentlemen will es cort you to the room which you shall occupy for the remainder of the night kindly provide them with the keys of your studio so that they may go at once and procure your palette easel and what ever accessories you may require as i shall report to you tomorrow morning at nine i will expect my fulllength portrait to be finished by six in the evening but mademoiselle he stared at her in amazement that will be impossible nothing is impossible to a determined woman she gave back viciously i shall not exact of you a masterpiece but only a simple sketch which will bear your signature good night monsieur good night mademoiselle and with a little cry of helplessness he fell back into the waiting arms of his escort rene was awakened at eight on the following morning put through a series of invigorating treatments by a masseur par excellence and served with an ex cellent breakfast for the first time in his life he felt almost physically fit after a night of dissipation and he looked for ward to the adventures of the day with a newborn sense of anticipation mademoi selle carvel was a strange creature but a devilishly thorough one imagine her insisting on a picture done in less than eight hours he set up his easel in the most desirable spot and prepared his paints it would be interesting this attempt to portray on canvas the lovely features of his hostess bedtime tales there was something about her that ap pealed to him something that called out for recognition for the sudden opening of the door startled him and he turned to consider the in trudef mademoiselle carvel stood upon the threshold a pleasant smile transfigur ing her lovely features her long black hair rolled down her shoulders in waves of jet that scintillated in the reflected sun light from the window lending a bizarre contrast to the mandarin robe of bright est orange which draped her body good morning she greeted him you are ready good morning he bowed slightly all is in preparation will you kindly be seated here she moved to the chair which he had designated as an improvised dais then without hesitating a moment she slipped fell to the floor in a heap at her feet revealing in every detail the unbelievable loveliness of her creamy body only a filmy wisp of silken veil remained to con ceal her magnificent proportions rene gasped in amazement you wish me toto paint you like that mademoi selle he cried scarcely conscious that he spoke she smiled at his discomfiture why otherwise should i remove the greater part the gown from about her shoulders it of my clothing monsieur am i so proud of my shapeless body that i should exhib it it with impunity no no he said pencil in hand you are superb mademoiselle never before have i seen such perfection in the femi nine form never that will be quite sufficient she in terrupted you will kindly work in sil ence bedtime tales her cruel retort cut him to the quick and squaring his jaw he commenced to sketch her sangfroid had completely un nerved him for two hours he labored without a minutes respite he sketched the outlines of her form filled in those details which he considered of paramount importance and shaded other details with that almost uncanny ability that had made him fa mous quite often he had been obliged to cau tion her as to the importance of remaining immobile but while he inwardly sym pathized with her for the strain under which she labored to comply with his re quest he did not comment on it he feared the reply which he felt certain she would deliver she groaned slightly and an uplifted arm dropped slowly to her side her eyes closed rene considered her sharply made moiselle he started but the pallor of her features cut him short florette had fainted hurrying forward he lifted her into his arms and deposited her on the long couch beneath the window then with a cadmness that surprised him he moisten ed a handkerchief in the bowl of flowers on the table and spread it over her fea tures she stirred just a little and her eye lids fluttered mademoiselle he leaned over and placed an arm beneath her head you are feeling better she nodded and her eyes opened in finitely better but oh so tired that is to be expected he explained you have undergone a frightful strain it does not matter her gaze centered on him alcide my dearest ii

so full of love as to drive all thoughts of the past from her mind the caress of an adolescent youth she thought so pleasantly different from those of the men who had sought her favors bedtime tales my little sweetheart his face could be no closer to hers yet she had the feel ing that he was drawing nearer ever nearer her emotions were further stirred by his proximity it had been ten long years since she had enjoyed the strange sensations of actually wanting the arms of a man about her or desired kisses that were more than kisses cupping her face between fingers that trembled he kissed her again ardently delightfully she did not resist him her head was in a whirl and the blood pounded furiously in her ears her eyes closed tightly in order that she might bet ter feel his strength his nearness florette ma cherie he said softly wont you try to understand how utterly unbelievably precious you have always been to me his breathing became lab ored and he crushed her fiercely to him i do

had been so delightful so wonderfully unreal to linger in the seventh heaven of reciprocated affection ii dont deserve this happiness florette whispered shattering the sweet silence that hung between
