for husbands byrussell holman chapter i when the five most ex pensive medical spe cialists ever assembled under one roof gave john r harlan up for lost and the old gentle man preserved their reputations by passing gently away two days later the broadwayaftermidnight set lost one of its picturesque members not old john r himselfmy no he had always been too busy guarding the harlan millions and the halfcen turyold banking house of harlan amp co to give ear to the jazzy call of the wild no john r had led as calm and comstockian a social life as a brooklyn tinsmith if the financier had ever experienced an urge to dash out and sow a wild oat or two the seed had all been passed along to his son jackthat is the jack of the pre era during jack harlans prepschool days at lawrenceville he first began to plumb in vacation periods the fizzy world that lay behind the blinking lights of broadway and learned that almost any chorus girl would forget almost anything for a goodlooking youth with a quota of the harlan fortune lining his pockets by the time he reached freshman year at princeton jack had graduated into leading ladies and stars and as an alternative to the footlight cuties was gadding about from cabaret to cab with the flapper society set his first year out of college jack devoted exclusively to his two worlds of pleasure musical comedy queens passed the word around that he was a nice kid underdressed dowagers titled him a wild quite irresponsible young man my dear flappers felt a thrill at being seen with such a hand some don juan and john r harlan after trying threats pleading and blus ter to get his son to settle down in the banking business gave up the task having completed broadway the westchester roadhouse sector and greenwich village jack set out gaily for paris under some such alibi as studying art purposing to do most of his studying at the folies bergere and the demimondained cafes of the quartier latin a cablegram reached him on the day he landed at cherbourg it announced the sudden serious illness of his father jack caught the next steamer home arriving in time for ten minutes of conversation before the stricken man lapsed into permanent unconsciousness during those ten minutes jack har lans attitude on life abruptly changed the old man used his last seconds on earth to pour his heart out to his son carefree jack had always loved his father and he had never before realized what harlan amp co meant to a harlan a week later the young man rode soberly down to wall street in the sub way and walked into the stern stone banking building of harlan amp co he presented himself to amos farraday the senior vicepresident and his fathers closest friend and announced that he wanted to learn the business farraday was pleased though skep tical and took jack for a trial no place for husbands in a year jack harlan had disap peared and john r harlan rising young financier had stepped into his place jacks frivolous past was as dead as if he had suffered a stroke of mental aphasia farraday and the others were frankly astounded but young harlan had brains he had inherited much of his fathers natural flair for finance and once his veneer of frothiness was rubbed off by hard work his progress was not so astonishing as it seemed there was no question about the hard work jack never appeared at the twelvetilldaylight resorts when he went to the theater it was to sit in a box with farraday or some other safe andsane business acquaintance in two years farraday was giving him responsible work to do then johnjack seems out of place now went to war as a lieutenant of artil lery he came back with his ambition to take his late fathers place in harlan amp co unchanged farraday was getting old the name of john r harlan began to appear upon the directorates of some of the harlan companies once more chapter ii it was about eight years after he had thrown the jazzlife overboard that john married he was twentyeight a fullfledged partner in the harlan bankinghouse if wall street had once laughed at the idea of wild jack harlan succeeding to his fathers position in the world of money it had since changed its tune john had inherited the harlan money and keenness better see old harlan which for many years had been a kind of slogan in financial circles and which for a time had been altered to better see farraday was now better see young harlan during johns renascence amos farraday once convinced that he was in earnest had been friend as well as mentor farraday who was a widower often invited john out to dinner at his big house in upper fifth avenue or at the union league club they would continue their discussions over long black cigars which john at first dis liked heartily to smoke but decided were rather more diplomatic than ciga rettes at dinner one evening at farradays john met margery my daughterhome from welles ley for a holiday farraday introduced her frank pride in his voice a few months previous johns pulse would have raced at the sight of such a girl as margery and he would have started glibly adroitly to interest her at that his heart skipped a beat or two but harlan quickly brought it back to normalcy by assuring it that there was no room in his present scheme of things for girls especially very pretty girls with creamy skin and large blue eyes and golden hair as smooth as velvet like margerys he attacked his grapefruit earnestly and said little more than the conventions required she went back to college and it was not until her summer vacation began six months later that john saw her againthis time at the farradays sum mer home on long island sound he spent a weekend there and discovered some reassuring things about mar gery she wasnt a flapper her stockings reached above her knees and she didnt don spinstershocking thighhigh bathingsuits nor smuggle cigarettes out in the canoe with her she was rather seriousminded though not op pressively so and quite keen for things like family good taste and morality she was small trim and completely beautiful john decided that even a sober young financier was quite safe in not battling no place for husbands the overwhelming impulse to fall in love with her a month after he returned from the war to harlan amp co he took up with margery where he had left off the setting was an engulfing divan in front of a crackling fire in the farra day livingroom he moved closer to her i say margeryi guess you know i love you john once so skilful with women fumbled and added brightly dont you margery the yellow glow from the logs showed was mildly excited like wise a little troubled as if this were an agreeable but disturbing thing with which she had expected to conjure some time but she answered bravely i know you do john then al lowing her heart to usurp her tongue ii love you too john and yielding her lips to his and her soft body to his embrace when john had departed margery invaded her fathers library she climbed upon the arm of the great leather chair in which farraday was perusing a financial journal john has just asked me to marry him she announced her father smiled as if this announce ment were neither displeasing nor un expected im glad he said simply and then looking at her more closely but why so seriouslooking about it margery placed an affectionate arm around his shoulder why its something i should be se rious about isnt it dad of coursebut you love john yes margery slipped half into his lap dad wasnt john once sort of wild didnt he use to play the broad day cabarets and go around with actresses and all that mrs schuyler hicks was telling me the other day dont believe what those old frumps tell you margery i dare say the boy was somewhat of a highflyer in college and the first year or so after he got out what youngster with too much money isnt but he settled down when his father died and ill vouch for it that hes been pretty near a model young man ever since you dont think theres a chance of johnswellbackslidinglonging for a touch of the old life do you dad i should die if farraday laughed and kissed her cherry mouth i should say not johns one hun dred percent business now dont worry your little head about such things if you love him marry him so she did they journeyed to bermuda on their honeymoonjohns first long outing in many yearsand by the time they re turned their cozy new home at long hills in jersey within easy commut ting distance of wall street was com pleted chapter iii john harlan decided that he was ideally happy he had one of the nicest homes in plutocratic long hills he thought no woman could possibly be so naively charming as margery and harlan amp co was going like a house afire margery managed the corps of ser vants like a little blonde napoleon johns wall street journal was always by his breakfast table the butler awaited him at the door with his hat and stick in the morning so that there was no possible chance of his missing his train and collected them at night the harlans played billiards golf and doubledummy bridge together for six months without a single altercation this is probably a record there was a single disturbing thing about margery even about this john didnt quite know whether to be an noyed or flattered no place for husbands he became aware of it first at a sat urday evening dance at the long hills country club mingling among the smart crowd on the clubhouse veranda john was introduced by a neighbor with slightly malicious aforethought to a nineteenyearold flapper named gladys greyson gladys possessed a long slender chassis black curly bobbed hair flirty eyes and a weakness for goodlooking men older than herself she had ab sorbed two rather hefty slugs of gin out of her last partners flask i bet you shake a mean toddle mr harlan she gushed immediately upon sizing him up as a new and excellent prospect come onles go a negro band imported from broad way was emitting spasms of synco pated din gladys tugged at johns elbow she placed an expectant arm about his shoulder he felt that there was no help for it so he danced as they wove in and out over the crowded floor gladys rested a flushed cheek against his chin and john won dered if she intended to fall asleep in his arms then he caught a glimpse of margery dancing sedately with a whitehaired gentleman and the eyes of margery were upon gladys and gladys partner and the eyes were quite horrified and reproachful margery said nothing about it until she and john were preparing for bed early sunday morning did you enjoy your dance with miss greyson john she asked inno cently cant say that i did he answered promptly she was half boiled he wondered why his wife had taken the trouble to discover the flappers name there were several other occasions he of necessity held polly armitages hands while he was teaching her the proper way to grasp a niblick and a troubled reproachful look came into the eyes of margery who was standing near he had discussed investments with rich vivacious mrs paton in a rather dark corner of the clubhouse veranda because there were no vacant chairs anywhere else and margery discover ing them had betrayed by her manner that she thought they were talking something less impersonal than bonds it dawned upon john that his wife was jealous in a vague wellbred way of any woman who paid unusual atten tion to him she seemed to feel that he needed protection against their de signs real or fancied not that mar gerys solicitude made him impatient he loved her the more for it and vowed that he would not cast as much as an appraising glance at another woman even though flapperdoms loveliest were to toss themselves at his curly black head chapter iv john harlan had bad news he hadnt possessed the nerve to spring it upon margery at dinner the evening previous they had not spent a single night apart since their wedding and he knew that she would feel as badly about it as he did so he saved the news for breakfast when the necessity of mak ing his train would get it over with quickly ive got to take a little trip to cali fornia soon margery dear he said across the table to her as casually as possible why john are you ill alarmed oh nobusiness one of our big subsidiaries the pacific fruit com pany is to be reorganized somebody from the office has to be on the spot to handle the thing your father doesnt feel equal to the trip so ill have to tackle it im awfully sorry margery told herself firmly that she was no weepy victorian bride no place for husbands where in california dearsan francisco and when do you start john tossing aside his napkin quite ignored the sedate butler and easing around the table lifted margerys tulippetaled chin in his hands and kissed her upon the lips its los angeles dear and i must start day after tomorrow itll be hot as the dickens going out on the santa fe but its the only route margery looked up at him cau tiously you wouldnt like me to go with you i really dont think it would be wise dear he said sincerely eight days in stuffy pullmans for fortyeight hours in los angeles with the tem perature there about a hundred and tenyou wouldnt like it she agreeda bit reluctantly the next night she helped him pack his bag and in the morning accompa nied him in to the pennsylvania sta tion in new york he kissed her goodby many times but just before the ruthless gate clanged between them she thought of something more john los angeles is where the movies are isnt it you wont fall in love with any of those pretty stars will you behind her banter john recalled later there was a somewhat anxious tremor chapter v john described his four days in a dusty pullman minutely to margery in letters mailed from chicago kansas city dodge city albuquerque and los angeles arrived at his destination he dis covered to his chagrin that the re financing of the pacific fruit com pany would be a far messier matter than he had anticipated four days of intensive conferences in stuffy rooms and the end was not yet johns brain was fagged and in need of stimulant the other banking men being congenial old boys and appreci ating harlans importance were quite willing to entertain him during his few leisure hours but he thought it wise not to accept he expected every day to be his last in los angeles and he did not wish to make any encumbering engagements evenings he spent in his room at the luxurious hotel envoy thinking up new things to write to margery and working on the re financing papers at ten oclock he turned in the blistering heat of the day having been succeeded by the cool sleepable evening that the california boosters cherish so highly so far outside of business acquain tances he hadnt spoken to a soul harlan naturally friendly and gregari ous was in need of a familiar voice and a little nonbusiness companionship which is probably the chief reason why he didnt follow his first impulse and turn an arctic shoulder to peggy du bois when she tripped by on her way to a vacant table and discovered him dawdling over an afterdinner cigar in a comparatively cool corner of the envoy diningroom why jack harlan cried halting peggy recognition suddenly leaping into her lively black eyes havent seen you in a pups age john had always possessed a roth like memory peggy du boisfol liesplayed around with her when he was at princetona game good scout well after all why not he was three thousand miles away from home and lonesome she was diverting and as young and pretty as ever he could at least talk with her for a moment he intended to say how do you do miss du bois but as he rose and her friendly face came closer he heard himself greeting her cheerfully why hello peggyhad your dinner she hadnt and accepted the chair opposite him no place for husbands john leaned back and allowed her to do the talking she chattered amiably through the oysters and heavy expen sive stuff to demitasse and cigarette her language was slangily picturesque it was a relief to johns figuresfilled brain peggy was in the movies she told himhal harris comedieswore a onepiece bathingsuit and cavorted spicily before the camera at venice and other beach resorts her present job was somewhat of a comedown for her she assured him but times be tough and ladies must live how about you jack she in quired youre married arent you ive seen pictures of you and her in the sunday picture sections shes awful cute ive heard about the big league things youve been pulling off in wall street too broker friend of mine here in los angeles says youre the smartest banking man in america lordimagine that and a couple of years ago i was getting stewed with you at bustanobys and stuffing in wheat cakes at the fiftyninth street childs at four in the morning and keeping just enough sense in my head to prevent the taxi driver from robbing you of your last nickel oh boythe world do move and some go up and some go down but honest jack i am proud of youwhen i find your photo in the paper along with a lot of other stiff bosomed gents i show it to the other girls and state well mesdames not long ago iin personwas playing around with that wealthy lad at first this vivacious ghost from his past visibly disturbed john it didnt seem honorable for him to be dining with an exchorine and listening to jazzful memoirs of their past he had long since parted with all that but it was good to hear a friendly voice and he hadnt heard anything like peggys stimulating patois for several years he paid the check and said same old peggy arent you come onlets dance in the middle of sweet lady peggy sighed and declared you always were a wonderful dancer jack he was pleased as a kid why hadnt margery ever told him that when they parted at about eleven peggy asked why dont you come out and see me work jack i look spiffy as ever in my dishabilly youve never seen movies in the making have you come tomorrow impossible peggyim sorry im counting on finishing up tomorrow and leaving for new york she pouted invitingly it seems a darned shame to have to leave you so soonafter not seeing you for ages a sigh and a frenchy shrug well if you should have a second to spare hal harris studio selma avenue hollywood is the address ask any body you see how to get there she was stopping at the envoy for the night and wondered half hopeful half amused if he would kiss her at the door he didntand passed on to his own room chapter vi johns business conference the fol lowing day lasted until noon then further action was postponed until the next morning pending the arrival of an important banking man from san francisco harlan wondered what he would do with himself in the meantime after writing his daily stint to margery he had resolved to think no more about peggy du bois but over a lonesome cigar at lunch he permitted himself to toy with her suggestion that he visit the studio he framed an alibi harlan amp co handled the financing of several motion picture concerns it was his duty only thirty minutes from movieland to view something of the no place for husbands industry at first hand his conscience was quite alabaster as he hired a ma chine at two oclock and bade the chauf feur to drive to the hal harris studio a swift run over a hard dusty road and john was walking under a high wooden arch onto the harris lot he entered the door marked office in a low singlestoried building near the door a shirtsleeved young man with a cold cigarette stuck between his lips was clacking a typewriter he looked at harlanlooked againand stood up respectfully how do you do mr harlan he smiled his best though evidently won dering what the blazes the banker was doing there john was taken rather by surprise how did you know me he asked rather pleased i guess any wideawake newspaper reporter would recognize john harlan by sightand i used to be a reporter before i went into publicity work were you looking for anyone in par ticular mr harlan john hesitated he felt a little em barrassedmuch as he had when a callow lawrenceville boy he dropped backstage for his first chorus girl there was no need he thought of tell ing this press agent all his business perhaps peggy wasnt around i thought id like to see some movie making from the inside he explained this studio was the handiest the press agent scented publicity possibilities were shooting some interiors out on the studio floor he suggested id be glad to show you around john nodded and the p a led the way through a pine door at the back of the room the studio interior was a broad ex panse of wooden floor bare except for one set in a far corner things seemed to be quite lively over there electricians were jerking around banks of klieg lights mounted on wheels a girl in the smeary yellow makeup of the movies and wearing a daringly cut pink bathingsuit passed and smiled at john the press agent asked his visitor to wait a moment in the middle of the floor john didnt mind he was boy ishly interested though a line of kliegs barricaded the set off from the rest of the studio the publicity man came up briskly with a tall stoopshouldered man in puttees he was swarthy and had a mustache like that of the villain in a bill hart shootin film mr harlan this is mr siegel our director and western manager for hal harris productions introduced the p a honored to think a big man like you would visit our little studio drawled siegel bootlickingly regarding john with a jaundiced and rather shifty eye like to watch us work a little they escorted their visitor across the studio floor and through the klieg stockade the set which was built to represent the lobby of a summer hotel was bathed in a strong white light john walked over a soft carpet a cushioned divan occupied the center of the lobby and there were soft cushions on the carpet around it draped at ease upon the cushions was a group of pretty girls clad uni formly in rather startling pink single piece bathingsuits they eyed the visitor with mild curiosity suddenly one of the girls sprang up from a cushion and hurried over to john he recognized the lithe form of peggy oh you decided to come after all jack she approved thats fine you always were a game sport siegel frowned and the p a opened understanding eyes peggy calmly ap propriated harlan ignoring them both no place for husbands and prepared to cast a little bomb among her fellow mermaids well girls she announced grandly this is my friend the famous wall street banker jack harlan whom you have heard me mention before john wished that she would be a little more tactful but he found himself shaking hands with more names than he could possibly remember a little sea of creamy legs trim hips and pink toes seemed to be churning around him they must higgle into their costumes with shoehorns he thought the old familiar smell of greasepaint was in his decorous nostrils back in the merrymerry world of makebelieve home and harlan amp co three thousand miles away he tossed back his head and laughed like a boy at one of peggys sallies i bet hes a good scout he heard one girl whisper he liked that and ac cepted peggys invitation to a seat on the divan peggy slid down beside him the other girls grouped around them too bad you didnt bring your bathingsuit jack laughed peggy theyre going to cut loose the water power in a little while and wash us out of the lobbysiegel thinks thatll make a nifty scene the other girls chimed in with rollicking comments johns boyish laughter was infectious why didnt you ever become a movie actor jack joshed peggy gosh youve got wally reid skinned a mile for looks you said it peggy the dignified mr harlan retorted the producers dont know what there missing when they pass me up at that instant something flashed into the brain of the press agent standing interestedly near and he drew siegel excitedly to one side a moment later the drawly voice of the director came to johns ear you wouldnt mind us taking a little pic ture of you would you mr harlan john calmed down a bit and a little of his usual reserve asserted itself i was just joking of course i really must be go oh come on jacklet em shoot a still show us youre a second rodolph valentino urged peggy the other girls boisterously agreed jack looked from one gay feminine face to the other well he admitted i suppose it will be all right but he really hadnt weighed the pro priety of it in his mind for a second and in his present exhilarated mood nothing no matter how rash would have feazed him he had slipped for the time being from the proper john harlan margery knew into the wild jack harlan who used to wait at the new amsterdam stagedoor for peggy siegel spoke to the cameraman the bathing beauties pressed more closely around john and he smiled into the dancing eyes of pretty peggy at a word from siegel the camera man turned the crank a few times and the intimate tableau was recorded on celluloid a few minutes later john took his leave of peppy and her companions and jumped into the hired roadster at the curb during the ride back to los angeles the foam was slightly blown off and john wondered vaguely if he had been dangerously indiscreet he was quite sure that margery if she knew of his adventure would be wild chapter vii the tinkle of johns room telephone woke him at eightthirty the next morn ing the message that came over the wire in the excited voice of peggy brought him down into the lobby of the envoy with the speed of a fire chief bound to a blaze in an orphan asylum peggy pushed him to a corner settee i have a ten oclock call at the no place for husbands studio she warned her pixie face un naturally grave so youll have to get this quick part of it is my faulti shouldnt have invited you out to the studio and it was up to me to warn you that this company im working for is kind of a shyster flybynight outfit siegel for instance i wouldnt trust as far as i could see him hes ng well after we finished work last night i happened to walk through the outer office and i heard siegel and the press agent laughing over something your name was mentioned so i lin gered around and listened in gosh this is sure a tough thing to spring on a mans empty stomachbut jack those highbinders are planning to work that shot of you and me and the girls into the picture were just finishing the fillum is called the gay million aireso you come in fine siegel and the pa think its a great stunta bathinggirl comedy with a wellknown guy like you in the cast you got to hand it to emit is course they dont dare advertise your name but they can noise it around pri vately and after one person has seen the picture the newsll spreaddont worry about that youll be packing em in all over the country peggy even permitted herself a smile it was a nice little family group wasnt it all us girls in our cute little bathing suits i hope you havent a jealous wife jack jealous he exclaimed through set teethhe had been thinking of mar gery peggyits awful his brain was whirling like a ferris wheel the damnable luck of itone little skid off the straight and narrow an innocent one at thatand here was a misrepresenting compromising pic ture threatening to tell the whole world including margery about it margerydear suspicious margery would be horrifiedworse likely she would wish to divorce him farra day would be shocked and angry all wall street would believe he had slipped back into the wild irresponsible ways again confidence in him would be irretrievably shaken terrible he was thoroughly aroused and he snapped to peggy whats this man siegels gameblackmail perhaps said peggy better come back with me to hollywood and see after you have your breakfast dont want any breakfastcome on seizing his hat and her arm in nearly a single motion he dashed out of the hotel with her and across the curb to a freelancing taxi he shouted direc tions to the driver and plied him freely with lucre to insure the maximum of speed in twenty minutes the boiling ma chine jerked to a stop in front of the hal harris studio in hollywood john threw some more silver dollars at the driver and he and peggy hustled through the studio gate and up to the door marked office this harlan unceremoniously yanked open neglect ing to knock the young cyclone rather took by surprise siegel and the press agent who were conferring near the latters desk ah good morning mr ha this from the drawling siegel with an at tempt at businessasusual what have you done with that pic ture that you took of me yesterday john hurled at him tossing diplomacy to the dogs the smile of the smug siegel van ished and the publicity man looked a little frightened at their visitors vehemence wont you have a ch another attempt by siegel ive no time to sit down wheres the picture why mr harlan siegel drawled with an attempt at sly conciliation i thought you understood that the picture no place for husbands was to become our property if youll remember you gave us permission to take iti have witnesses i knowbut i didnt think it was going to be part of a movie i under stood it was just aerprivate pic ture you got it under false pretenses you made no restrictions about its use siegel persisted you were talk ing about being an actori only took you at your word john saw that he was dealing with a fox and that there was no use wasting fancy language he was not sure about the law in the case but he was sure that he didnt want lawyers and their little playmates the newspapers mixed up in it once let it get to the ears of margery he turned abruptly to siegel how much do you want for the picture whyi dont get you bluffed the director johns short laugh was derisively mirthless yes you dohow much money to turn over the picture to me and forget it the director sitting on the edge of the desk and nursing a bony knee in his clasped hands was exasperatingly slow well mr harlanbelieve me or notif you was to offer me a million dollars i couldnt be bribed every tuesday night we ship the film weve shot during the week to mr harris office in new york he sends what he wants to the laboratory to be developed its cheaper that way siegel shrugged his narrow shoulders well yesterday was tuesday i expressed your pic ture with the rest of the film to new york yesand you and that smart press agent doped out a nightletter to harris telling him how the fillum was worth a million dollars with mr harlan in it i heard you peggy interrupted scorn and anger in her voice and eyes youre a fine bunch of bum sports you ought to be in san quentin she caught at harlans arm come on jack you cant get any satisfaction out of this slick fish the only true word he said was that he ships fillum to new york on tuesdays she urged the undecided john toward the door turning to siegel long enough to announce haughtily you can tear that ten oclock call of mine upim through with wearing tights for four flushers like you a visibly distracted john and peggy piled into the waiting taxi and sped back toward los angeles now dont worry jack encour aged peggy on the way you just hustle back to new york quick as you can and see harrishe has an office on seventh avenue bluff him a little and then if the old crab dont come throughflash a fat bundle of bills in his faceand youll get your debut in the movies back fast enough i hope to god youre right peggy wailed john from the depths of the seat into which he had slumped moodily as they reached the residential out skirts of los angeles he suddenly re membered that after all he had come to california on business he pulled out his watch and saw that it was eleven oclock ill have to go to the meetingi can just make it he said maybe the damned business will be finished this afternoon and ill be able to start right back east too bad that los angelesnew york aeroplane line hasnt started yet sighed peggy encouragingly chapter viii for the time being johns tide of ill fortune changed the arrival of the san francisco banker armed with au thority papers and a hearty dislike for los angeles caused the business to be concluded about five in the after noon and the new officers of the pacific fruit company duly installed no place for husbands at eight harlan worried and im patient boarded a transcontinental pullman for the east by the second day he had concluded that the trip would last forever he perspired and swore freely ate very little and slept hardly at all he snapped at genial trainmates who recognizing the famous john harlan tried respectfully to pick an acquain tance he glared at flappers who openly admired his good looks from behind magazines he quarreled with all the waiters and made a lifelong enemy of a prominent chicago banker who had been attending the pacific fruit reorganization eight times john refused the latters invitation to be the fourth man at bridge margery was waiting just outside the grilled gate at the pennsylvania station when the train slid in at eleven in the evening faithful margery john felt like a criminal as he forced a sickly grin into his face at the sight of her and hurried up followed by a sleepy redcap with his bags margery looked as fresh and pretty as a daisylightblue sport suit white socks and sandalscool as a clover club amid the perspiring station throng every strand of her velvety blonde hair in place gad fancy losing such a woman as that thought john worth a thousand peggys what a dumb bell he had been he kissed her why has anything been the matter with you john margery asked at once looking into his flushed face closely have you been ill you didnt write me about it john laugheda rather poorly done laugh why ive been fit as a fiddle he lied you look great he meant that lets get home as quickly as we can that was about the extent of his garrulousness for the night all the way across the ferry in the limousine and through lightdotted jersey city and newark and over the open country to long hills he sat morosely and answered her eager questions with monosyllabic grunts several times she looked at him curiously and in the semidark her face began to take on a worried look also theres something wrong with you john she declared bluntly when they were preparing for bed she put her two white hands upon his shoulders and looked intently into his face which he was trying vainly to camouflage no theres not dear he protested too vehemently im finebut tired at ten oclock the next morning he visited the new york office of hal harris productions intending to get quick action margery had started asking solicitous questions again at breakfast he must look more suspicious than ever by daylight she had even made a semijoking remark about the movies you didnt meet a movie star in los angeles that you liked better than your wife did you john and she had watched him closely for the answer that was bad when a tough little officeboy ad mitted him into hal harris presence harlan found himself facing a flashily dressed stoutish man with a prominent nose and a voice several shades too loud he pulled a greasy black cigar from his mouth long enough to ask john to sit down he had evidently recognized the banker at sight for he spoke his name i guess you know why im here harlan began abruptly harris shrugged his fat shoulders i dont know mr harlanmaybe you want to buy my companyyour father bought my other companyhe waited until i was nearly broke and bought me out and then kicked me out no place for husbands that was a fine way to treat me wasnt it the semimalicious light in hal harris eye did not augur well john learned where harlan amp co had ac quired one of their motion picture interests the banker pulled himself together as well as the past hectic week would allow him maybe i would consider buying you outa little share in your company anywaythe picture business is a very poor just nowprobably you could use a little money harris laughed ominously not a nickel john cleared his parched throat all right now that weve settled that mr harris how much do you want for that picture siegel inveigled out of me in hollywood or would you rather i turned the matter over to my lawyers mr harlan the movie man said slowly ill admit i know what youre talking about i want you to see this situation from my standpoint as well as your own you are one of the best known millionaires in this country people say that you had aerrather interesting past at one time i believe you were rumored to be engaged to a follies girl named peggy du bois my director wires me that he has a moving picture showing this same miss du bois and you and some others well what am i going to do the pictures worth how much cut in john it was a fearfully hot day and he was per spiring like a stoker harris pulled himself ponderously out of the chair mr harlan he said your father put me out of busi ness once and i dont owe you any favors i wouldnt sell you that picture for all harlan amp co owns and thats final john threatened cajoled and offered to bribe for a few moments longer but he saw that further argument was futile finally he walked slowly to his car and was driven downtown he thought of consulting a lawyer but became panicstricken as he imagined the publicity attending a law suit during the next week john ap proximated the mental tortures of a prisoner in the death house at sing sing and a bridegroom facing the wed ding ceremony combined he had the heart for very little work farraday inquired anxiously what was the mat ter his secretary regarded him curiously as he dictated in faltering ac cents and almost chewed his pencil in two he went to see harris againtwice but the producer was obdurate and margerymargery kept asking questions had something dreadful happened in california that he was hid ing from her her eyes were always upon him he took to reading the moving pic ture columns in the newspapers think ing perhaps there would be a hint as to when things were going to pop one morning he gasped as going in on the train his eye caught this item new hal harris sensation hal harris the comedy man is said to be preparing a picture for release that will be an absolute sen sation it is called the gay mil lionaire and one of the best known millionaires in america it is rumored makes his cinema debut in the comedy together with peggy du bois and the other famous harris bathing beauties john took off his hat to cool his swimming head the dike was about to burst when he reached his office no place for husbands he thought rather irrationally of flight and instructed his secretary to call up a number of european steamship com panies about sailings speeding across the jersey meadows that evening in the homebound train he caught sight of a newly pasted bill board in shouting letters it read hal harris latest and best the gay millionaire the comedy knockout of the year with the bestknown millionaire in america and the famous harris bathing girls its a riot john agreed grimly with the last line when he reached home margery took one penetrating look at him and wanted to telephone at once for the doctor you simply must tell me whats the trouble with you john she declared is there sosome other woman her blue eyes were halffilled with tears john stalled her off desperately all evening swearing eternal and ex clusive love and devotion every few minutes and stole away the next morn ing for new york without awaking her the end he felt was very near chapter ix john harlan sat slumped in his chair gazing dejectedly over the tops of the lesser skyscrapers into the busy traffic of the north river he did not hear his secretarys voice until she came very close to him and said distinctly for the third time mr harris on the wire sir john only half caught the name as he lifted the receiver off the hook mr harlan came harris husky voice strangely pleasant if youll drop up here right away theres a chance we can do something about that picture business fairly flinging the receiver back in its place john was out of the office like a whirlwind he hailed a taxi and fidgeted madly on the seat until he reached his destination the waiting harris looked like a corpulent sphinx have a seat mr harlan he in vited john who had recovered his equilibrium partially obeyed well announced harris ive changed my mindill sell you the picture and name you a liberal pricetwenty thousand dollars john winced the figure was steep but he dared not think twice about it he swallowed hard took his check book from his pocket and scribbled for a moment he held the check out to ward harris and demanded cautiously wheres the film the producer reached under his desk and brought up a circular tin you wont have to open it here he grinned ive written out a receipt and ill guarantee that this film contains the negative of your pictureand the only one there is without wailing to verify this john turned over the money and clutching his precious can of film close to him was whisked in an elevator to the ground floor in the taxi he sighed he already felt like a new man when he reached the harlan building he handed the driver a crisp twentydollar bill and his best smile amos farraday looked up from his desk as his junior partner hurried by why john was actually whistling farraday was greatly relieved john gaily dismissed his secretary for the day though her desk was piled high with work when he was alone he regarded the can of film on his desk no place for husbands quizzically curiosity began to take possession of him he chuckled like a youngster with a new electric train he wondered what he looked like in celluloid no harm in seeing he could burn the film in a few seconds so after a cautious and unnecessary look around he opened the tin and pulled out the rolled celluloid holding an end of it up to the sunlight that came streaming in through the window an exclamation of surprise escaped him why the film was as black as ink he couldnt distinguish a thing deciding that the trouble was that he didnt know how to look at the thing on an impulse he rang for a boy ask mr hurlburt to step in he instructed the youngster young hurl burt was the member of harlan amp co who had charge of their moving picture financing branch and was alleged to know everything about the movies erclose the door please hurl burt began john hurlburt did so im thinking of buying one of those little moving picture projection ma chines prevaricated john ive al ready gotten hold of this film but it doesnt seem to be any good i thought perhaps you could tell me whats the matter with it he handed the strip of film over for hurlburts inspection the latter walked to the window and held the film up to the light as john had done after a moment of squinting he turned around somebody has deceived you har lan he said this film has been spoiled its undeveloped negative thats been exposed to the light and is no good whatever where did you get it oh someerthanks old man john made sure to take back his film ill get after the chap i bought it from when hurlburt was out of the door john called harris you lied to me about this film he began heatedly its blackno good how do i know whether im in it or not ill stop payment on that dont get excited mr harlan he heard harris mocking voice i know its spoiledthats the way you wanted it aint it it saves you trouble if you want to know how it happened the negative came in the office from our studio undeveloped my damned careless officeboy opened the can while i was out and the sun got to it and ruined the whole pictureafter we had the publicity and advertising started and everything but look here mr wild jack harlan youre pretty damned lucky to get off so easybe cause i dont mind telling you that if it wasnt for that officeboy who has since been fired i never would have sold you a foot of film for love nor money and john when he had replaced the receiver agreed that he was lucky he smiled and called up a ticket speculator contracting cheerfully to pay twenty five dollars for two seats to the most expensive show in town having the call switched to the hotel biltmore he ordered a private diningroom for that evening then he got margery on the wire john harlan intended to celebrate fittingly his return to the straight and narrowfor life a movie studio observed john to himself when everything had been perfectly arranged is no place for hus bands the flapper fools them byphilip somers to those who sat nearby on the roof of the ho tel belleford the girl in the mousegray frock seemed a smart littie flapper her suede pumps barely touched the tiled floor and the expanse of silken sheerness beneath the table revealed legs that were slim and shapely her saucy head was ringed with bobbed brown hair and her eyebrows were finely penciled the man opposite was a totally dif ferent type his complexion was as swarthy as the girls was pale and his hands were as heavy and pudgy as hers were delicate each puffed at a ciga rette in a long holder and they both had sampled the contents of a silver pocketflask the girl was idly blowing smoke from her red lips and listening to what her companion was saying in a low guarded tone of course i hadnt figured on find ing you here he said but its cer tainly good to see you the going must have been goodto judge from the class of your costumeand the fact that youve rooms in a house like this she smiled and shrugged her slim shoulders the going was good she confessed before bill was blown up by a bomb while trying to lift that necklace from the yegg who stole it her expression hardened and a cruel look came into her deep brown eyes she had never forgotten the pang of bills death and despite the lenient sentence she had been given because she had informed on the fellow crook who contrived to kill him madge the mouse was still an outlaw at heart so bills dead the man said too badbut he was foolish this rough stuff never pays in the end my methods are different ive lived like a lord in rio and in havanafleeced em in shanghai and frisked em in paris and always in such a smooth way that there wasnt a chance to be caught madge the mouse smiled bitterly they gave me a year and a half she said in spite of the fact that i squealed on the fellow who finished bill that was all the thanks i got from the cops and i havent any desire to go to the pen again besides bill left me fairly well fixed and it hasnt been necessary to try any crooked work since i got out of jail never again i suppose he chuckled teasingly thats what they all say but a true crook never reforms its the excitement i guess we always want itworse than dope or hooch i tell you im off the crime stuff she insisted with a negative shake of her head some day i may decide to steal a millionaires heartbut ill only dip into his purse by means of matri mony or alimony suggested her com panion now see here madgewe were always good friends i always fancied bill too and id like to do you a good turn and give me a chance to do another turn up the river she suggested con temptuously saug the flapper fools them nonsense he protested ive a little proposition to make that ought to sound good to you they all sound goodtill youre caught madge observed with quiet sophistication oh come he protested im reg istered here as j buckleigh hunt and ive the coin to finance whatever i choose if youre going down to atlantic for a vacation what do you say to a little small change to help out with expenses just how much is small change madge inquired with a show of inter est and a twinkle in her eyes mr hunts fat neck shook with silent laughter as he whispered shall we say about five thousand easy gobut how easy get she parried suspiciously simplest thing in the world mr hunt assured her with your scenery and upstage manner you can pull the stunt like a breeze i furnish full information and pay all ex penses but suppose something goes wrong she reminded him i dont care for another rest in the reformatory dont be absurd he snapped im patiently my plans are always so plain and simple that nothing can pos sibly happen you wont even have to deal with the fences ill pay you your sharecodright here in the hotel tell baby brighteyes all about it nice man madge smiled at him and hunt chuckled inwardly as he saw that he had won in fact he felt himself in luck to have found madge the mouse he had known her of oldand her dead husband tooand he was well aware that she was one of the slickest female rogues who ever used a rouge stick and disarmed suspicion completely with her innocent air ii half an hour later a trim little figure in gray alighted from a limousine in front of an exclusive shop in chestnut street a liveried footman opened the door and madge the mouse sprang out with a juvenile air of eager anticipation several mere men in passing by paused to stare after her and madge was conscious of envious looks from a number of females whose fascination was far less great than her own inside the jewelers she looked about until her eyes met those of a goodlooking young male and a moment later he was con ducting her toward the rear of the store i really havent much time she said with a shade of regret in her voice but were going away today so im afraid ill have to hurry her escort bowed and seemed to re gret that his charming customer must depart so soon he would have liked to show her the entire stock of treasures the many cases contained madge was aware of her conquest and turned upon him a pair of eyes that had laughing mischief dancing in their depths you see she confided leaning close to the salesman it was only this morning i persuaded dad that i simply must have a new diamond barpin if i dont buy it right away hes sure to change his mindso show me the prettiest ones you haveand not too expensive please about how much would you care to pay came the courteous question and the salesman held his breath while waiting for her answer it almost stunned him when it camenot because of the amountbut because of the thought of this flapper flipping away such a sum with apparent carelessness oh not over ten thousand she said with a gesture that was almost apologetic the salesman bowed and begged her the flapper fools them to be seated then he hurried away to the vaults in the rear of the place and madge sat on the chair staring with a bored expression at the tips of her tiny shoes the young man returned and displayed a bewildering number of bar pins each more alluring than the other yet despite their sparkling brilliance and really rare designs madge did not seem to be impressed by them this one at eight thousand is a beauty the salesman enthused it was done in our own studios and the stones are flawless it really doesnt look like much madge shook her head now that one isnt badin fact its rather different the salesman placed upon a velvet cushion the pin she indicated and nod ded when he realized she knew some thing worth while when she saw it the stones were even finer than in the pin he had suggested and the mounting was exceedingly novel be sides it cost a thousand dollars more i think ill take that madge an nounced consulting her wristwatch with sudden recollection of her haste ill just pin it on and be running she stopped abruptly as though puz zled at the change in the expression on the young mans face then she burst out laughing and put one little hand on the sleeve of his cutaway coat as though to reassure him you didnt think i wanted to charge it or have you send the bill to papa she pealed merrily of course you dont know me the salesman nodded his head in perfect understanding and regretted that what she said was the case of course i did not think he be gan awkwardly but her eyes silenced him of course you did think she con tradicted thats what you receive a salary forisnt it well dont worry ill pay for it then she turned away from him and bending down felt beneath her abbreviated skirt for a moment the salesman looked discreetly away but did not neglect in that moment to keep one eye on the barpin madge had chosen but now her glance met his again and a slight flush came over his fea tures as she counted out on the table top nine onethousanddollar bills there was just one remaining in her dainty fingers and she held it up to him with a look of girlish triumph in her eyes dont you dare breathe a word that i didnt spend it all she pleaded if dad knew i had this one left hed want it back again he lets me buy what ever i want but hes as stingy as can be with spending money the clerk gasped as he took the bills and then a perplexed look came over his face madge was watching him closely and he did not wish to make the slightest false moveyet he was not in the habit of selling such costly jewelry to unknown customers who paid cash for it if youll wait just a moment please he requested politely i shall have to report the sale to the cashier and show the pin at the office before i can let you take it you mean that youre not sure about the money madge sniffed contemptu ously then with a seeming effort she controlled her impatience and asked the man to make haste he didto the best of his ability but as he had foreseen the cashier wished to have the bank next door pass upon the genuineness of those bills a messenger was dispatched for that pur pose and the salesman loitered in the vicinity of the cashiers cage until the report should come back he had put away the other trays and the pin madge had purchased was safe in his hand the flapper fools them his only anxiety was lest he might of fend the girl and as the messenger did not come back when five minutes had ticked away the salesman was growing more and more uneasy he did not want to affront such a desirable patron ninethousanddollar sales did not occur every day and never in all his life had he been privileged to wait on so dainty a miss then the bank boy returned and nod ded his head the money was quite all right so the salesman hurried to madge to inform her of the fact and deliver to her the pin but to his chagrin he founda most angry young lady pacing back and forth in a furious flapper flutter as he reached her side she glanced again at her wristwatch and then into his face with a look of utter scorn ive changed my mind she said with a haughty air keep your old pin and give me my money back the clerks knees almost gave way beneath him the manager was watch ing and saw that something was wrong so the salesman knew he would be in for a reprimand if he permitted the girl to go without making a purchase really he began im very sorry you ought to be madge hurled at him with the tears coming into her eyes ive never been so mortified in all my life the idea of keeping me standing here while you go to find out if my own fathers moneys good hed come down here and give your old boss a good talking to if i let him know that but you will appreciate the flus tered salesman floundered in confusion wondering who on earth he had insulted so clumsily ill appreciate your returning my money at once she snapped and turned her back on him there was nothing else to do so the salesman went back to the cashiers cage after the nine thousand dollars the manager sensing that there must be a misunderstanding approached him and a brief colloquy followed mean while madge was growing madder and as the manager turned he saw the little fury coming toward them diplomat that he was he took the matter in hand and with a bow present ed the girl with the roll of bills she accepted them with an angry sniff and thrust them into her handbag fumbling around inside for a dainty lace hand kerchief with which she dabbed at her moist eyes we are of course grieved that the pin is not satisfactory the manager began the pin is perfectly satisfactory she bit out the words its that pin head boy who waited on me the salesman felt his heart sink and his eyes stared at her like those of a pet dog who has been unjustly whipped by its mistress really ah miss he stammered and the manager frowned at him se verely but the apparent misery of the youth seemed to soften madge i suppose im a silly little goose she accused herself and i wouldnt for the world want to get you into trouble if the sale means anything to you ill take the darned old thing only hurry please she added with a glance at the clock at a nod from the manager the salesman presented the pin he did not wish the girl to change her mind again she took it carelessly in her hand hold ing it in one palm while she reached again into her bag for the nine thou sand dollars do you want to count it or take it down to the mint or wherever dad gets it from she shot at them with an im perious stamp of her foot because i the flapper fools them havent all day to fool around your old store the manager accepted from her the handful of crumpled bills and without seeming to do so made sure nine were there he also ascertained something else so swiftly and unobtrusively that even the salesman did not observe what he did yet he satisfied himself of a blue pencil mark on the face of the top most bill nothing further will be necessary he said courteously to madge i trust the pin will be entirely satisfactory otherwise we will be glad to have you return it poof sniffed madge if i get tired of it ill give it to my maid then the liveried attendant opened the door and the clerk and the manager bowed and stared as the girl crossed the sidewalk and entered her limousine iii as the jewelers footman was about to close the door madge signaled him to wait do call to the gentleman over there she said smilingly and pointed to a swarthy heavyset person strolling down the street the chauffeur waited her orders and the footman darted away to return in a moment followed by madges friend oh mr hunt she exclaimed ex tending her hand how wonderful to see you so unexpectedly do let me give you a lift dad will be delighted to know youre in town mr hunt seemed charmed and stepped into the car seating himself heavily at the side of the girl tell him to drive to the hotel belleford madge directed the footman and touching his hat the flunkey closed the door well asked mr hunt guardedly as the car moved slowly down chestnut street through the traffic it went all right madge told him but im shaking like a leaf as you figured they would they sent the money to the bank to find out if it was good the time it took the man to get back seemed longer than the stretch i spent in jail sh warned mr hunt maybe the chauffeur can hear this car isnt mine of courseonly hiredso i cant be sure of him say said madge nervously as the limousine turned the next corner and headed south i dont like this business a little bit once sentenced twice shy i guess she tried to laugh but the effort was not successful dont be silly objected her com panion youve done it beautifully just as i knew you would no i havent eitherand im afraid youre going to be dreadfully angry she confessed contritely whats wrong hunt demanded with a snarl in his voice and a suspi cious look in his shifty eyes i had to sacrifice one of the genuine bills she explained and hunt gave a smothered exclamation of anger i thought of the possibility when i was waiting for them to give me back the money she told him and when they handed it to me just as i thought might happen there was a tellers big bluepencil mark across the face of the bill on top maybe it was a trap and maybe notbut i wasnt taking chances i dont get you he said with a frown then youre stupid she snapped i slipped one bill out of the phony pile and handed him nine counterfeits with the marked good one on top just so he wouldnt look at the others i crumpled them up in a wadand it was a good thing i did i caught old skeezicks looking for that pencil mark damn said mr hunt sincerely the flapper fools them that thousand comes out of your share old dear madge shot him a look of contempt i didnt think youd be as cheap as that she sneered but i always said that bill was the only real gentleman crook cut it growled hunt that chauffeur may get on well let him snapped madge im through with youmy cheap skate friend heretake the pin be fore the bulls grab the car and pinch us both she tore the diamond bar from the front of her frock and hurled it into his lap hunt was furious but he caught it before it fell to the floor and with quick appraising eyes satisfied himself that it was of sufficient value in fact his anger softened a little as he caught the glint of the perfect stones now see here madgehe tried to conciliate her as he slipped the jewel into his waistcoat pocket im through with you she repeat ed and you neednt waste your breath since youre a piker ill not argue with you i get four thousand bucks thats only fair madgeit was your fault he whined oh i might have known it she shot back at him and peeled four bills from the roll in her hand there take the rest of your coinyou four flusher you want me to run all the risk and then you welch on your own proposition the money hit him in the chest she had already reached out for the handle of the door then as the car slowed down at thirteenth street at a traffic policemans signal she threw it open and stepped out on the running board ah say madge he said with a sudden sense of uneasiness dont act like that lets chin it over but she shook herself frantically from his grasp dont you ever dare speak to me again she cried aloud her eyes flam ing as she sprang to the street and ran to the curb passersby stared at her in amazement and gazed toward the li mousine to see mr hunts choleric face peering from the open door he shook his fist at her and then paused abruptly as his eye discerned a police man walking toward madge he slammed the door furiously and took up the speakingtube with a shak ing hand but to hunts surprise madge turned to the policeman with a confident smile beaming through her sudden tears he began to wonder whether after all madge had turned honest and was going to spill the beans she could do it too with the pin in his possession but madge only put one little hand on the bluecoats arm and shook her head in answer to his inquiry oh noplease she begged almost piteously i really shouldnt have con sented to ride with himand mother would be just furious if she ever knew ill run him in if you say so the officer offered or punch his damn head he added as he looked down ad miringly at the frail trembling creature who clung to him so trustingly oh you mustntreally she in sisted looking up at the trafficman with an expression of anguish in her eyes you wouldnt want me to be scolded would you of course not the officer said with an angry glare in the direction of hunt cowering in his limousine then he signaled for the traffic to proceed id like to blackjack one o them old birds for getting gay with a little kid like you oh dont make a scenepeople are staring so she whispered and hung the flapper fools them her head do get me a taxicab theres a dear the officer did and gallantly helped her in she gave him a winning little smile and reaching into heir purse pulled out a fivedollar bill do take thisjust as a small token of my grati tude she insisted youve been so very kind then the cab sped up thirteenth street and the officer sauntered away with the thought that he would rather have kissed those pouting lips than have the fivespot which nestled in his pocket you cant blame them old guys after all he observed to himself why wasnt i born rich instead of goodlookin iv madge the mouse watched her dainty step as she paid the chauffeur and hurried into broad street station the checks for her bags were already in her pursehaving been sent from the hotel that morningbut she paused at the ticket window to purchase a pullman seat for atlantic city she meant to take the train that left in twenty minutes although she had changed her mind about going down to the shore however she wished to be away from philadelphia as quickly as possibleand it was just as well to be seen taking the oceanbound train then looking carefully around to make sure she was not followed she went into a telephone booth and called up the hotel belleford for several minutes she spoke over the wire and then hurried upstairs to the train floor just in time to avoid the attendants shutting the gate in her face a porter had checked her luggage through to new york so madge was was not encumbered with any burden save her beaded purse covertly she peered inside and satisfied herself that its contents were intact then she sat demurely in her seat until the train slowed down at the north philadel phia station as the car came to a stop madge walked with a careless air toward the vestibule and while passengers were getting on she stepped off a quick dart into the waitingroom and she was out of sight an interval of another five minutes and the girl was again in a pullman seatthis time bound for new york she gave a little sigh of satisfaction as she took off her saucy toque and handed it to the porter to put in the rack overhead it had been fun to take another fling at the game she thought she had quitbut the best fun of all was beating a clever crook at the game he had devised by this time she thought the house detective at the belleford would probably have com municated with the jewelry shop prob ably too he was at that moment con ferring with j buckleigh hunt she never had liked the manand he had dared to criticize her own dead bill no man could get away with that and not pay for it but even so she would not have tipped off the bulls anonymously if hunt had not been so mean about that thousand dollars as it was the crafty mr hunt was likely to make a sojourn in a highwalled country spot just outside the quaker city madge herself was vacation bound not to atlantic city as she had related but to europe where she meant to rest for quite some time her passage was bought and her passport made out under a name that no one would ever associate with the former madge the mouse in fact except for this accidental slip to day she had played straight ever since her release from a new york prison its funny she giggled to herself as she stared out of the window no the flapper fools them body stands to lose a thing except old j buckleigh the jeweler will get his barpin backand ive four thousand to spendthanks to the fact that hunt hadnt nerve enough to pull the job himself then she opened her handbag once more and smoothed out four genuine billsher share of the swagless the single one she had given to the store manager as a matter of precaution lets seethats right she calcu lated and rehearsed the transaction over again in her keen little brain first i have ten reallytruly thousand dollar billsall in a nice little stocking bundle beside them in my purse i had another package just like itonly uncle sam didnt print that paper the first time i hand the jewelry chap the genuine moneynine thou sand dollars that leaves me the one bill id saved by selecting a cheaper pin than hunt had in mind then when the salesman comes back and ive changed my mind twiceim supposed to slip him the spurious stuff hunt felt sure that having examined it once theyd take the bills a second time with out questioning them she paused in her observations to congratulate herself nice nut id have been to try such a trick as that what she had done instead was this while the clerk was absent verifying the real money she divided the spurious package in half on the top of one bundle of five counterfeit notes she placed the genuine bill still in her pos session then she waited in due course of time she learned that the original money was real which of course she had known all along then she changed her mind so according to plan the nine genuine thousanddollar bills were returned to her and slipped into her bag with ap parent carelessness but madge was never careless for the fraction of a mo ment at that point in the transaction her handbag contained nine genuine bills it also hid two packages of similar ap pearance one was composed of five counterfeits and a genuine banknote the other had five utterly worthless bills to secure the barpin again she must hand out nine billsand she was not taking chances on being tripped up in that she had noticed the bluepencil mark on the topmost billbut to rely on returning that alone would be much too risky her long slender fingers moved with the skill and swiftness of a magicians wand and presto she had in her bag two packages and not three one of these she gave back to the store man agera little crumpled wad in it were five counterfeit notes and four genuine onesthose of treasury parentage be ing outside of course the sight of the marked one and the feel of the other four had satisfied the jewelry man and madge had departed so when she stepped into her limou sine her bag still held six genuine thou sanddollar certificates she peeled off five and crammed them into a hole in the lining of her bag the four coun terfeits and one genuine thousand she meant to give to hunt having planned beforehand her method of getting out of the limousine and ridding herself of mr hunts soci ety she felt that one of the real bank notes would do to deceive him be sides she shrewdly surmised the sight of the barpin would divert his thoughts and throw him off his guard he would also imagine naturally that she meant to return with him and further discuss the matter at the hotel but hunts unsportsmanlike attitude had robbed her of an extra thousand hidden away in the torn lining of her the flapper fools them bag it had forced her to give him one of the spendables she hoped to keep for herself in its place she still had in her possession one of the counterfeits and that made her furious until her sense of humor came to her rescue four thousand really isnt so bad for a little job like that she reflected as she made her way along the aisle to the retiringroom by this time to morrow ill be on the briny deep where no one will know the differenceand unless im much mistaken friend hunt will be in a cell if he squeals on me hell prove that he was the master mind then she tucked the four pretty treasury notes into her stocking and proceeded to roll the spurious one into a little torch from a gold cigarette case she extracted a perfumed egyp tian roll and proceeded to light it with the incriminating bill an imprisoned debutante drops two notes from her window one is found by a burglar and one by a handsome young man both go to her rescue and complications follow learn of them by reading crosby georges

a man perpetually alert for the police they were blue and harmless his clothes were not those commonly associated with the profession of removing from the dressers jewelsafes and necks of ma trons the jeweled fruits of their hus hands toil he was not attired in shapeless trousers he wore a suit of blue serge the trousers of which bore a crease as sharp as the prow of a battle ship no nondescript cap hung rakishly over one eye instead a black derby of extreme style in regard to brim and shape was fastened at the precise angle recommended in the what the man will wear columns of theatre pro grams he did not look like a secondstory man and for a very good reason he was no secondstory man yet this balmy evening in late au gust he was carefully climbing up a short ladder which was resting against the wall of a house he had never before entered archie drewe was not enjoying the exercise ladderclimbing was no hobby of his his taste ran to the col lecting of antiques and rare pictures he was intensely interested in the flora of the caribbean islands he loved a quiet game of chess and yet this even ing he had abandoned the very latest book on the subject of caribbean flora and a most intriguing chessproblem to go ladderclimbing the answer was of course romance it was the bright eyes of a fair lady that were drawing him up the ladder it was the soft voice the liquid tears of a beautiful woman that were impelling him to this adventure so contrary to his quiet routine of life but archie told himself that it was not so much love for his hortense that was responsible for his presence here this night but pity for her archie had a heart that suffered with every suffering creature and hor tense lute had moved it tremendously when she had told him of her hus band oh hes a brute she said tone lessly all day and half the night hes absorbed in his workhis work she ended with a tragic clenching of her two bejeweled hands archies mild eyes watered slightly in sympathy you poor kid he said his stupid work repeated hor tense tensely archie had only recently taken up residence in the quiet suburb of ash croft consequently he knew neither the husband of hortense nor the nature of the work that had come between hus band and wife but even one hasty glance at the slim firm figure of hortense at her beautiful dewy eyes thoroughly convinced him that what ever the lifework mr lute was en gaged in it ought to be abolished by law poor girlie he uttered sympatheti cally and found himself patting her hand the call for help thus encouraged hortense con tinued her woes she found it exceed ingly romantic to meet a young man from her own suburb in a smart city tea room for the purpose of talking about herself and do you think im allowed a word in my own household she asked no everything is run to suit my pre cious husband everything is run to suit his convenience im no better than a slave of his whimsa slave said hortense passionately there there everything is bound to turn out all right sympathized archie patting the other hand the upshot of this conversation and several others of like nature was that archie began to feel himself in love with hortense at least that was the only way to explain the glow that occurred in the region of his heart whenever he met hortense in the city and when she mentioned that clandestine meet ings in the city were getting harder and harder to manage he asked if he couldnt see her in her own home some time when mr lute was not present hortense blushed faintly that would be so romantic urged archie please say yes after an hour and a half of impor tunities on his part hortense gave utterance to the precious mono syllable she was immediately plunged into doubt as what archic must think of her for being so easily persuaded to grant his request after he had assured her for the twentieth time that she was to him the dearest sweetest and purest woman in the world she displayed a livelier interest in the idea of archies coming to see her come wednesday night if my hus bands out ill place a japanese lantern in the library window if its lit youll find a ladder in the garden go up the ladder to the window ill be waiting for you in the library why cant iercome in through the door inquired archie the servants would see you ex claimed hortense in horror and the news would be all over town by morn ing but if they see me climbing up on a ladder began archie ill see to it that theyre all busy in some other part of the house said hortense and as the library window is quite invisible from the street youre absolutely safe and so having seen the japanese light in the window and found the lad der archie was on his way up to his rendezvous as he mounted the ladder he per spired gently it seemed to him he was only too conspicuous it seemed to him it would be only a matter of a few mo ments before a rude hail from the gar den below would cause his blood to freeze visions of a rough handling on the parts of the brutal mr lute swam before him this is the last time i ever do any thing as idiotic as this he informed himself grimly as he continued his up ward progress romance or no ro mancenever again just then his clutching fingers found themselves scraping on stone he raised his head he saw that he was at the very sill of the library window with infinite caution he raised him self until his eyes were level with the sill he saw only the japanese lamp standing on a table close to the window the light from the lamp dazzled his eyes he could see nothing beyond die lamp slowly he mounted to the sill he seated himself across its breadth he began softly to push open the window his heart stopped beating a wild the call for help shiver coursed through his blood he sought to squeeze himself into as small a volume of space as possible then he forced himself to turn his eyes down ward to investigate the cause for the dull thud he had just heard come up from the fragrant spaces below his eyes straining through the dark confirmed his worst fears the ladder had slipped from the window and was lying on the ground below hopelessly out of reach for a searing instant archie was sure he had been discovered that someone in the garden had pulled down the lad der but as no threatening sound rose from below he concluded mourn fully that it had been some chance abrupt movement of his own that had cut off his retreat now that it was impossible to go back archie began to wish he had never left the comfortable safety of his own rooms to go on this mad adventure he thought longingly of his chessboard and the beautiful colored plates in the flora of porto rico after all a wo man was only a woman but a real hobby was a joy forever archie sighed even if he wanted to go back he couldnt it was absolutely necessary to go on to further thrills whether he enjoyed thrills or not he decided that he did not he resumed his task of opening the window it rose with only one squeak to blanch archies face cautiously he lowered one leg over the sill and waited for something to happen nothing did only the soft breathing of the night wind through the trees and his own hard breathing came to him he threw the other leg over the sill then he stood erect and parted the taupe silk curtains that en closed the window from the room he found himself peering intently into the small sinister opening of a blue black automatic ii hahands up quavered the shaky voice of a man archie put them up he blinked dazedly at the man whose skinny fingers gripped the weapon he was a short man a thin man a meeklooking man an undignified man in the worn purple dressinggown he was wearing apparently he was quite as much frightened as archie the automatic wavered dizzily in his hand pput that thing down gasped archie from between dry lips itits liable to go off sssit down there stammered the other man indicating a chair with his free hand ssit down there oror ill plug you he ended loudly he waved the gun at archie wildly archie plumped down upon the chair if the chair hadnt been there he would have sat down upon the floor his legs would no longer support him in the style to which he was accustomed but even in his distress one corner of his brain was busy with a startling question was this meek little man the brutal husband of whom hortense had com plained so piteously archie concluded that he must be he certainly was dressed as if he belonged in this house thenhortense had deceived him in order to win his sympathy she had painted her husband as a cruel monster when in reality he was a timid mouse like little man why he seemed more afraid of the weapon in his hand than even archie was this reflection restored archies self confidence amazingly by the time mr lute had backed up to the big mahogany table in the center of the room and gaspingly reached for the telephone archie was in full control of himself just a moment he bade the other man theres a mistake somewhere the call for help keep where you are shrilled the little man in terror im not respon sible for what happens to you if you move ill let lead into you the con trast betwen the deadly words and the meek tones in which they were spoken moved archie to smile police headquarters gasped syl vester lute into the phone i tell you you are making a serious mistake said archie forcefully in a panic the other man jigged the receiver up and down police he questioned into the trans mitter this is sylvester lute talking no elbron place ive got a big crook up here a desperate character please come right away good lord groaned archie panic now seized him he started up his eyes roved all over the library for some avenue of escape he saw two walls lined with shelves crowded with books ordinarily archies eyes would have lingered lovingly upon these shelves for judging by the looks of these volumes there were among them many old manuscripts and first editions old books were a passion with archie but just now his eye passed rapidly from this exhibition of treasures and his glance started upward in the space above the low book shelves archie saw two hanging can vases one was evidently a turner the other a titianno concluded archie quickly it was only an imitation the color wasnt handled correctly there was too muchgood heavens how could he think of this when his liberty was in danger archies eyes flew to the third wall against this stood a large cabinet filled with objets dart even in his frantic glance archie observed a sevres vase an indian chibouk and several marvel ous translucent chinese glasses if you persist in moving around i i shall be forced to use extreme meas ures came nervously from the little man at the table archies attention turned to this man in spite of his own agony of mind he was forced to laugh at the pitiable funk of his captor at the sound of the laugh sylvester lutes hand convulsively closed upon the automatic the finger on the trigger trembled archie paled his brain spun with the wild need for some way to get out of this accursed room there was only one way he concluded swiftly he must get that gun out of his captors hand the rest would be easy but how could he get the gun away in fiction and in the movies it was always a simple matter for the underdog sud denly to wrench away the weapon from his captors hand but in this case he didnt even know how to begin archies brow wrinkled with the mighty problem of how to free himself a tiny ghost of an idea crept forth he assumed a calmness he was far from feeling all right ill behave he said as nonchalantly as he could i know when im caught and youve caught me but let me ask you do i look like an ordi nary burglar to you the other mans gentle eyes opened wide idont know ii havent given the question any thought he stam mered archie smiled grimly was this in offensive creature the man who had destroyed hortenses happiness was this the monster who neglected the despairing woman for his work archies jaw dropped light flooded his brain of course mr lute neglected his wife for his work archie believed it archie understood it if mr lutes work was the collecting of objets dart the call for help and pictures and old books as it evi dently was why he was perfectly justi fied in neglecting his wife for it archie would doubtless have done likewise if he had a wife he drew a horrified breath why if hortense divorced this man and married archie she would be constantly quarrel ing with him over his hobbies as she doubtless did with the mild mr lute in that moment archies heart went out to the little man who was holding the automatic pointed at him in him he beheld not a wifebeater a destroyer of feminine happiness but a gentleman of learning and good tastea fellow collector having made this pleasant discovery archie found it easy to proceed ill be frank with you im not an ordinary burglar said archie i didnt come for your money or your jewelry he broke off seeming to discover the imitation titian for the first time by the way thats an awfully clever copy of the titian owned by rensler pratt he remarked with a wave of his hand at the picture the little man started its nothing of the sort he ex claimed excitedly its an original a clever copy repeated archie coolly the color is good but titian never isolated and enchanced a patch of color like that cloud in the foreground that technical trick must be the prop erty of the artist who copied it the jaw of the little man dropped perceptibly but i must compliment you on that bust continued archie pointing to a roseandblack porphyry bust of rame ses iii that graced the top of a book case its a genuine eighteenthcentury egyptian he ended the little man was obviously pleased i know it he said earnestly ive got even better stuff than that in the cabinet he boasted giving way to his collectors delight of discussing his pos sessions at the peters galleries i picked up a marvelous piece of basalt sculpture from cairo a female figure with a hieroglyphic inscription on the front stated archie who had often seen that piece on display yesyes gasped mr lute how how do you know about it thats my profession said archie and as for this particular piece i ought to know all about it i came here to steal it from you iii sylvester lute gazed at archie in dumb astonishment archie went on with his lie quite calmly i love collecting he said sincerely but i havent the means to indulge my desires i make my living by obtaining for collectors who have the means any particular object they desire i have no scruples concerning the means by which i obtain the objectwhen a collector refuses to strike a bargain with me but argued mr lute you didnt bargain with me for this piece oh i took a fancy to this piece for myself i could never pay you the sum you might rightfully ask for the rame ses so i determined to use the infalli ble means i have employed before to get possession of it his voice changed it became low and trembly you collectors who have only to sign your name to a check to possess whatever you desire can have no notion of the feeling in the heart of the man who can only long to possess beautiful things you cant understand mr lute was visibly affected his hand loosened its grip upon the weapon his eyes softened what a pity i he murmured shaking the call for help his head sorrowfully what a pity you dont know what it is to want a beautiful thing and not be able to ob tain it repeated archie i do said mr lute believe me young man i do see that porcelain tureen on the top shelf of the cabinet there is the mate to that in the house of a man i know ive wanted the mate for years my collection is abso lutely incomplete without it and the man who owns the mate wont part with it at any price he sim ply wants to spite me hes just pig headed why dont you hire me to get it for you asked archie boldly mr lute held up his other hand as if pushing away temptation that would not be ethical he faltered is it honorable for him to refuse to sell you the mate argued archie you must meet his weapons by similar ones give me the commission i guarantee perfect results ii dont know faltered mr lute ill do it for nothing cajoled archie if you dont turn me over to the police mr lute made a gesture of refusal but there was a gleam in his eye the fanatical gleam of a collector on the trail of a real bargain i dont say i consent he wavered butif i do what proof have i that you will actually do as you say my word of honor as a collector said archie with simple fervor and he resolved to part with everything he possessed if necessary to obtain that porcelain tureen for mr lute well thenperhapsperhaps good exclaimed archie with real emotion at his deliverance his heart went out to mr lute what a generous fairminded man was this husband of hortense not in many years had archie met a man with whom he had so much in common and this good man was the man whom hortense had so often accused of being hard to get along with archie couldnt believe it in that moment every shred of feeling he had left for mrs lute went up in invisible smoke the moment after archie saw a sud den change in mr lutes expression the little man looked scared his eyes directed at something behind archie were humble and respectful archie turned in his chair he saw hortense lute in a mag nificent black gown standing in the doorway contemplating with astonish ment the sight of her husband and lover in amiable conversation iv hortense exclaimed her husband getting to his feet hortense exclaimed archie to him self doing likewise advancing into the room without noticing archie she addressed her hus band there are two policeofficers at the door downstairs she said they say they received a call for help from here i dont understand aa mistake im sure spluttered mr lute ii sent no call for help then it might be well for you to go down and explain to them recom mended mrs lute in an icy tone that caused a shiver to run down archies spine he had never thought her capa ble of using that tone to her brutal husband poor fellow yes my dear said mr lute meekly iim sure mrermr brown will entertain you while im away as he left the room hortense eagerly went over to archie how did this happen she asked in her most romantically tense manner i got your signal said archie mis the call for help erably pointing to the lantern still in the window one of the servants must have lit it without my instructions whispered hortense does my husband suspect who you are why you came here he takes me for a burglar said archie under the compelling eyes of the woman he once thought he loved he reluctantly explained youre wonderful breathed hor tense in admiration when he had con cluded im terribly sorry you were disappointed when you came up the ladder butill meet you in the city tomorrowthe same place archie gulped he rallied all his forces he might as well have it over with now ii dont think wed better meet each other like that any more he managed the beautiful eyes that had led him so far astray showed incredulous aston ishment ii like your husband continued the honest lad he and i have many tastes in common i cant become friends with him however if i continue at the same timeyou understand dont you evidently she did for she uttered a choked cry its simply wonderful continued archie with enthusiasm hes interested in everything that i ampictures curios books old manuscripts and every thing and he has the real collectors spirithe wont allow anything to balk him when hes after some particular addition to his collection ive never met a man more to my taste stop commanded hortense do you mean to say that you prefer my husbands friendship to mine ii dont see why you and i cant remain friends toojust friends stam mered archie well i do raved hortense and at that moment she was not at all beauti ful do you think im going to receive you in this house quietly calmly as if nothing had ever happened between us just because youre as crazy as my hus band about old daubs and pieces of clay she paused for breath but before she had obtained it her husband came into the room v his face bore a satisfied expression i persuaded the police it was all a mistake he said genially he broke off however as he became aware of the tension in the air whats the matter here he asked bewilderedly ill tell you said mrs lute beside herself with the fury of a woman scorned youve let yourself be made a fool of by this man do you know why he came here tonight through the win dow why yyes he told me stammered mr lute and you believed him shrieked mrs lute who was hardly conscious now of what she was saying well ill tell you the real reasonhe came to see me no gasped mr lute no repeated mrs lute hys terically look at him and then decide if what im saying isnt the truth mr lute looked archie could not meet his eye mr lute stiffened he straightened to his full fivefeettwoandthreequar ters he looked searchingly from his wife to archie and back again he pointed commandingly to mrs lute and then to the door leave us he demanded she stared unbelievingly her husband repeated his command a halftone higher mrs lute trembled saug the call for help dont do anything rash sylvester she begged in a parched whisper leave us commanded the little man majestically for the third time she half walked half stumbled to the door vi outside the library door she stopped there she waited breathless and tense and yet she was pervaded by a happy glow her pride was flattered because there behind the library door two men were bitterly quarrelingabout her it was a situation to please any woman but as the moments sped her joy in this situation ebbed why didnt sylvester come out and tell her what had happened why wasnt there the sound of angry voices what was going on behind the door she dared not think of what might be going on there and yet she could think of nothing else she had never seen sylvester so aroused in his red rage he mighthe might attack archie drewe hortense calmed herself that was preposterous archie was a younger and stronger man sylvester would never venture physical combat with the odds so strongly against him then she gasped her brain reeled she had suddenly remembered that there was an automatic lying on the table within easy reach of sylvesters hand so that was why sylvester had ordered her out of the room he was going to shoot archie for a moment hortense thought she was going to faint with a tremen dous effort she retained consciousness crouching against the wall she waited in agony the piercing sound of a shot oh if she could only scream what a relief it would be an eternity passed the same deadly silence prevailed continued to prevail hortense now breathed in tortured gasps why was there no sound a horrible supposition flamed through her mind the men had killed each other or at least battered each other uncon scious she could contain herself no longer she must see what was happening be hind that door her trembling hand found the knob it was some time before she could sum mon sufficient strength to turn the knob slowly inch by dreadful inch she drew open the door she gazed into the room with dilated eyes she gasped with horror at the sight that met her eyes what was happening in the library was far worse than anything she had imagined crouching outside the door even as she gazed she realized with a deadly sinking of the heart that there was a far stronger bond between her husband and her former admirer than existed between her husband and her self or archie and herself neither of the men stirred as she stared at them sitting opposite each other at the table in the center of the room their heads almost touching as they leaned over the table sylvester and archie were pro foundly absorbed in a game of chess a dead mans business bydixie willson letty pinkus was a pretty little thing not awfully striking nor awfully brilliant and not in position really to be either inasmuch as she was merely a waitress in her mothers boardinghouse but letty pinkus was mighty sweet and pretty there was no avoiding that of course she was only eighteen which is sweetness and prettiness in it self but she had something entirely un forgettable about her eyes and that was what old bill cooper fell madly in love with bill cooper had never really had any thing to love in all his life he was a sailora parrotnosed sailor as rough as they make em and rich enough to get drunk all he pleased he had no family at allexcept one crook of a nephewand like every old sailor though he had had eighty sweethearts hed wanted no one of them more than a week then one day in may he met letty pinkus he was just in from salvador with his ditty bag on his shoulder and his new fireeye pinned up tight in his pocket it was really the thought of his fire eye that first made him notice letty a piece of black velvet is all very well but theres nothing for jewels like a womans white neck bill didnt know just what his jewel was it looked like an opal yet was diamondlike in clearness and some times it seemed really crystallized fire no one had ever seen another it was as large as a berry and they said bill had a fortune in it it hypnotized a man like an eye look ing at him bill hadnt wanted the thing what did an old sailor want of a queens priceless gem he hadnt wanted itnobut hed gone back and gone back and gone back to look at it till finally hed spent every cent that he had to buy it from the son of the old caveman whod gone crazy watching the lights in it letty pinkus wore a dark blouse with the neck open and when bill passed the bench where she was sitting in the park it came into his whimsical old mind that maybe the girl would try his jewel on her neck for him hed been itching to see how it really would look with some other background than his dirty hand or the grimy velvet it was tied in it was strung on a cord through a hole in one end of it he walked past her once and then went back againwalked past her again and then went up and asked her she was startled at first but bill wasnt a bad sort and after a minute she smiled and saidyes she would so bill hung the fireeye on lettys white neck then he caught his breath and twitched his fingers it seemed that the sun moon and stars were shin ing there he hadnt dreamed the thing was like that he hadnt dreamed any thing in the world was like that it was almost alive it frightened letty pinkus so much that she immediately untied it and gave it back again a dead mans business bill laughed pinned it into the vel vet and told her he was hunting a boardinghouse mothers got one she suggested at sixtyfour james street six dol lars a week but bill didnt go he found the fourdollar place where his pals were and it was as all right there as it usually was only letty pinkus came into his sleep so much that next day he packed his bag and hunted james street after all letty opened the door for him oh she smiled ive waited for you since yesterday bill grinned almost out loud i wasnt comin he saidbut i got thinkin about you letty blushed a bit shyly invited him in and took him upstairs to the second floorfront say put on my stone again will you he asked her i never seen any thing all my life long as purty as that on your neck he tied it on awkwardly and while she moved about with towels and a blanket he watched every flash of the radiant thing like a bit of flame then she gave it back touching it half fearfully she told him supper would be ready at six and ill bring some hot water she said bill left the door open so he could hear her feet on the stairs he picked up a flower shed dropped out of her belt he shut his eyes to bring her face back into the roomthen rather sud denly he slouched back against the wall and shut his fingers tight around the bedpost but after a minute he straightened up again and brought a scrap of scrubby paper and a pencil from his pocket at a quarter to six letty pinkus took a tin bucket of hot water upstairs bills door was ajar she knocked softly then pushed it open and went into the room a minute later mrs pinkus down stairs at the stove in the kitchen felt lettys hand on her arm cold as a touch of snow her face was utterly bloodless mother she gasped that old sailor is dead and he was all slumped down in the chair by the window drink had got his heart at last there was a crumpled yellow flower in his hand beside him was a scrap of dirty paper across which was scribbled i want this here letty pinkus to have my jewel signed bill cooper may twenty ii billy king at a rear table in shoofs cafe brought out his wallet and counted the bills he hadone five and two ones he was a slick young loafer pickpocket by professiona grafting sort of chap whod never done an honest turn in his life there you are kid he said to the dark fellow with him go as far as you like but right heres all ive got you know yourself that things have been damn skinny lately the kid laughed shortly yeh damn skinny for me he re plied but i got one thing doped out all right i aint going broke no longer with you owin me seventyfive bones and goin around yourself with silk socks and a mustache billy twisted the ends of the criti cized mustache and laughed from one comer of a cigarette mouth you got one green hundred in your vest he remarked i saw you put it there a dead mans business yes the kid replied for sellin my mothers old show clothes and shes goin to get every cent of it too me im so broke at im cockeyed and i want what you owe me down now well go ahead collect billy said nonchalantly heres seven go after the rest anyway you want to the kid reached for the five and the ones and folded them into his pocket billy king picked up a newspaper pushed himself against the wall and looked up the sporting sheet the waiter shuffled past them with ham and fried potatoes fella was askin fer you last week billy the waiter remarked as he passed hooknosed old salt with a scar on his eye billy crunched the paper on his knees and looked up quickly what not uncle bill he ex claimed is he back and me tryin to fret myself earnin some money hes the unc i was named for and me and him is the whole family if i can find him any place im sittin pretty he laughed shoved up his chair and got out of it and the kid backed away from the table and followed him down the street and across the market to the shambled twostory frame affair in pell street where billy remembered old bill had hung out billy only hoped the grog had been flowing freely for he knew well enough that when old bill was sober he had no love to spare for this one piece of family though bill was a rough one himself his idea was that only good effort de serves good reward on which principle billy king deserved much less than nothing which was exactly as much of old bill coopers honestlyearned goods as old bill cooper ever intended billy to have at the door of the sailor shack billy knocked hard and waited until the slovenly woman who kept the place answered yes bill cooper had been there but hed left a week before for some place up in james streetsixtyfour she believed so billy and the kid went to james street letty pinkus wasnt home nervous little mrs pinkus let them in when billy asked for the old sailor she was startled at first then she took up her apron and wiped her eyes at the corners god bless me hes dead she said died awful sudden and we give him up to the mate of his ship it has shook us up awful his comin and goin billys breath came in chunks for a minute well where did hewhat did he do with his money he asked im the only relation hes got little mrs pinkus shook her head i do know as he had any she in formed him the mate said he spent all he had down in africa for the gem he give letty thats worth a terrible lot she put down her apron and twitched her shoulders a little the whole affair was still disturbing to her they say we wont be keepin boardinhouse next week when letty sells that dimond the kid plucked billys coattail lets see it he suggested any way we ought to look over bills clothes and stuff mrs pinkus stepped back inside why yes come right in she said and smiled sympathetically at billy whose lame expression she took to be grief at his uncles demise its a ter rible shock aint it come right in the parlor letty aint here but ill show you the dimond its only fair you should see it billy and the kid pulled off their plaid caps and followed mrs pinkus a dead mans business into the parlora dark room with a dark lot of furniturean organa standand a vase of glass roses mrs pinkus went into a room farther back and presently returned with a small wad of velvet he wrote on a paper that letty should have this she explained as she untied it i guess she just struck him when he died he was holdin a flower of hers and then on the dull velvet square she suddenly disclosed the jewel like a drop of flame the kid leaned forward and ex claimed sharply god look at it he whispered whats the thing made of gingerly he touched itthen picked it up in his fingers we put it under lettys spy glass mrs pinkus volunteered and it burns you to look at it she watched nervously as the kid fingered it and tears came up in her eyes it seems like it cant be real she quaveredthat just for that there little thing i neednt be workin so hard all the time and my letty havin some dresses and pretties shes such a good girl its right that she should but i never thought shed get it in this world folks dont aint it wonderful we always been just did he leave any clothes billy interrupted or some papers where did they take him they took him away mrs pinkus replied all the sailors did some place ill put this here thing back and get you the address she tied up the velvet and left them a minute then brought back a paper widi the address of a sailors home thats all i can tell you she said it was heart trouble terrible sudden and nobody with him they proved it was his writin on the paper to letty then took him away and thats all i can tell you billy thanked hershe patted his shoulder and told him she felt for him left all alone and i hope theres no hard feelin for letty she added it may look liket ought to been yours but of course a mans last dyin wish is what god means should happen half an hour later billy and the kid stopped at cuffs corner for beer the place was deserted they took the last table and billy sat with his back to the door they finished their beer and their sandwichonrye then billy shoved the crumbs and the glasses aside and from inside his coat brought out that little bunch of velvetuntied it and against the gray of everything else old bills wonderful stone quivered like the drop of a soul the kid brought his breath sharply through his teeth and reached out to take it but billy with slim fingers sim ply slid the radiant thing out of sight of course old bill was no uncle of yours he remarked the kid sniffed dont worry he said shortly i aint pickin no dead mans pockets and whats more you aint goin to get away with it neither billy made a queer noise in his throat what cha mean he laughed i spose ill have ghosts runnin after me the kid rolled a cigarette and tapped it on his finger i dont know nothin about ghosts he said but im tellin you one thing i never been fooled on the last thing a man wants hes goin to get the old lady was right i aint much on re ligion but a dyin mans wish is what god wants should happen it may be damn long or damn short till its fixed but you cant get away with no dead mans business a dead mans business iii billy king lived over flannigans tobacco shop by a railroad bridge the kid lived with him that morning when die sullen light of five oclock was just coming in through the fallendown shutters billy got up and dressed fussed around the kids clothes a bit sewed that hard little kernel of jewel in his own vest lining then softfooted it down stairs and out into the first gray of daytime when it was nine oclock he got a fellow to trust him for a new suit he shaved off his mustache and moved up to harlem three hundred blocks from the wharves it was noontime before he ate then he picked out a beansmelling bakery across from the house hed selected to room in there were only three others inside the tables were quiet but after a minute something happened that by fate should come to every man only once but that really seems as frequent a state as birth and death and the sun coming up a girl came into the place whose presence made billys blood tingle instantly she was slender quite small with a mop of black curlscurls just to her shoulders thicksoft like a childs and her eyes were black too and her skin creamwhite she sat down across from billy and ordered a sandwich he watched while she ate and then followed her out she stopped at a stand for a paper he stopped for one too and she smiled so a bit farther up the street he spoke to her he asked if shed dropped a goldpencil in the restaurant of course she hadnt and said so but he gave her his said he had found it and she might as well keep it she asked his name and said she thought shed seen him before he told her he was jim woods from minneapolis and hed never been in new york till that morning he wanted to know her name too and she laughed and said everybody called her babe he asked if he could see her again and she said shed be down at the bakery for supper so billy went up to the room he had rented in clara caseys square flat and began to wonder if he was going to have all the trouble of falling in love again babe wore a little cornflower dress at suppertime she was already there when billy went in at six and shed left a place beside her that he promptly took she had a dash of scarlet on her lips like a kiss painted there and the something was about her that men dream of when they are waiting for the girl theyve never found billy walked home with her after supper across a little park to the apart ment where she lived with her aunt he wanted to take her to the picture show where the dauntless pearl white was saving a city from flood so she ran upstairs and asked her aunt and an hour later they followed a flashlight down the aisle of the blue palace billy king had been fairly born to broadway his sun since he could remember had been the white light of fortysecond street to fiftyninth and he had managed to make business good enough so that with his natural good looks and his air of sang froid he had had a small share of most every little broadway doll there was hed had perfumed kisses from uptodate lips and hed gone into the plantation with girls who flagged all the attention there was but hed never before sat by a girl whose fingers in his really made any difference some people come into your heart a dead mans business like a tidejust a little at first then a little bit morebut some like a flood drown you all in a minute and babe with her dark eyes came that way to billy three days later in the bakery at supper they were laughing and count ing out ricepudding raisins when minnie the blonde little clerk fairly breathless came in from outside and rushed over to billy say mister she stammered the police is after you theyre over at claras huntin all through your room get out of here quick billy flashed up from the table babe caught at his hand after you she cried why how can they want you billy thought fast the old lady had followed him down he snatched a fork from the table stabbed into his vest picked out that burning drop of jewel and thrust it into babes hand say keep this he whispered sharply be here at twelve and ill try sure and meet you well beat it together just sit tight if they come nobodyd think that youve got it babe opened her fingers and saw what she held why what she said breathlessly where did you get it you stole it you stole it she looked at him wideeyed ill be here at twelve billy whis pered sit tight sweetheart then he brushed past her out to the street and across it but the policemen were on him babe saw them duck after him into the crowd saw him knock past a fruitstand and dive down a basementthen she sud denly dropped her head into her arms and sobbed wildly her fingers closed over that glorious thing he had given her minnie came to console her be still now she said gently nothings goin to happen to him hell get away dont feel so broke up dearie babe looked up still sobbing but laughing through tears oh its just that im happy she saidoh im happy iv two hours later billy king a smear of dirt across his face and in the com pany of two rotund policemen arrived at headquarters im damned if i know what you want he insisted coolly ive got nothingdone nothinggive me a and then he saw the kid waiting for him hello billy the kid smiled i hated like hell to chase you but honest billy it

the kid was satisfied hes crooked i know the kid said but i guess i can get the rest out of him some time thisll do so he set up cigars thanked them all brushed billys coat offand they left the place together neither had much to say for five minutes or so billy pulled down his cap and slouched along waiting for the kid to talk but when he didnt and the silence began to hurt both of them billy spoke himself what time is it kid he asked i got to get back up to harlem by twelve a dead mans business the kid laughed yes i seen her yesterday when i was trailin you he replied shes some little peach i dont blame you billy looked at him sidewise say you didnt tell anyone about thatstone he asked after an awk ward minute the kid clucked his tongue against his lips whome he said why should i i told em you picked off my hun dred thats all that was my grief old bills on his own job and dont you forget it and now its he pulled out his watch its ten after eleven if you want to know it was the slipping of his watch back in his pocket that reminded him of a paper he carrieda note for billy oh say he said feller from the sailors home brought this up to flannigans yesterday the note was on bluelined tablet paper written in a round childish hand dear sir mamma found some letters of mr coopers so theyre at the sailor place if you want them a terrible thing happened mamma lost the diamond

did he get even or did the girl outwit him youll find out if you read when dealing with a woman in saucy stories for august th the house of the missing bysinclair gluck synopsis of preceding chapters the young sister of jack clayton has disappeared in new york after weeks of fruitless search a man from a secret bureau of investigation calls on the brother and tells him that thirty young society girls have disappeared in the past year that this bureau was organized to run down the gang responsible for the kidnapping and asks clayton to become one of the organization the man moore also tells clayton that there has been a leak in the bureau of late as the rooms of some of the members have been ransacked suddenly moore goes stealthily to a curtained window revolver in hand there is a loud report a bullet has grazed claytons cheek and an unknown man staggers from behind the curtains moore has shot him through the heart they find that claytons wound is from a strange weapon like an airgun carried by the intruder larry claytons servant an exburglar calls a policeman known to moore who removes the body and promises secrecy clayton goes with moore to the headquarters of the bureau and becomes a member he and moore are to work as partners though before others they are to appear strangers they are to pose as men of wealth and position and try to find a clue to the kidnappers among the members of society for the first time in his search for his little sister margaret clayton feels hopeful but he returns to his apartment to find that his desk has been ransacked chapter vi the first clue the house in which moore had taken his rooms was back toback to claytons apartment house and was of the or dinary brownstone type so common in new york it once had been occupied by a single family now owing to changes in the neighborhood and ever mounting rents it had been split up into apartments moores rooms were on the second floor the basement was occupied he told clayton by a grocer his wife and two children the first floor served as of fice and home for a young doctor while the second floor had been subdivided into two smaller apartments of three rooms each with a bathroom common to both of these two the front apartment be longed to a returned soldier and his somewhat shrillvoiced french bride moore had rented the back part of this floor consisting of a bedroom a small kitchen and a drawingroom the third floor was unoccupied but was similiar in design to the second the house was a large square one each apartment on the second floor being selfcontained and welllighted with the common bathroom between lit only by a small shaft and skylight above the door to moores rooms was just at the head of the stairs and opened into his drawingroom this room looked out onto the back garden socalled as did his smaller bed room beyond his kitchen was the same width as the hall and was the continua tion of it but opened into his drawing room and not into the hall so that the the house of the missing rooms had a single door into the hall this was fitted with a yale lock the common bathroom was of course the difficulty and was probably the reason why he had found the rooms empty with the somewhat embarrass ing sociability of some old southern and a few old new york houses this bath room had three doorsone into the hall one into the front flat and one at the back into what was now moores bed room of these only the door into the hall was now in use the other two being nailed up there was only one doorbell to the house which rang in the basement for a small monthly gratuity the grocers wife or one of her numerous children opened the door for all visitors the tenants had keys when clayton crossed over to help moore install their private telephone he found him waiting at the front door of the house he ushered his partner proudly into the drawingroom fur nished in seedylooking plush the door was open into his bedroom beyond and the first thing clayton noticed was a lot of telephone wire lying on the floor ive put one instrument in already moore told him and i have the bat teries and the instrument for your end well put that in later im a bit of an electrician and the job was an easy one as for my own instrumentim going to keep it in my clothescloset and keep the closet locked you see it will have a buzzer but not a loud one so that you can get me when im here but mostly i imagine ill be calling you up you see ill have to have a fashion able studio or something somewhere to carry out my role of the dilettante lounge lizard this place would never do as my official residence from a social point of view but it ought to be handy as an earth perhaps whats the idea of keeping the phone in the closet well someone will have to take care of the rooms and i dont want a cleaning woman messing about it trust nobody is our motto old boy and my end of it oh that doesnt matter so much you can trust larry cant you well put it in your bedroom and you can tell larry not to let anyone else in there hows that thats all right i should think clayton told him now suppose we go over to my rooms and finish the job on the other instrument and then we can do the wiring later when alls quiet right and clayton i forgot to tell you that you have an account with the guaranty trust on which you can draw up to any amount within reason dont forget that because you may need it you wont need to itemize your expenses i fixed that up with the chief now lets go they spent an insane sort of a night first of all they installed the other in strument batteries and induction coil in claytons bedroom with an additional buzzer in larrys room for safety they had no trouble in getting the thing into working order though the outside wiring was difficult as they had to work silently and in the dark the same week marked the debut of moore and clayton in the social game moore took a studio in greenwich vil lage furnished it superbly dabbled in sculpture and invited his evergrowing circle of friends and acquaintances to come to tea discuss art and view what he described to his partner as his atrocities clayton followed moores advice and took to himself the pose of a disillu sioned worldling of esthetic tastes night after night they held long con versations over their telephone compar ing notes so as to avoid each others tracks as much as possible in this way they seldom saw each other the house of the missing however clayton came across moores traces once or twice in an swer to a charming letter from mrs fumeau he called and did his best to convince her that he had given up all hope of finding margaret he was cynical disillusioned and selfcentered to a point where he wondered that she could stand having him in the house however she was most charming and sympathetic introduced him to a num ber of her friends and invited him to become a regular caller at her house in the east sixties mrs fumeau had a distinct charm of manner arising from her perfect confidence in herself and her power to please and clayton found her circle a wide one and promising for his purpose here one afternoon much to his amazement he overheard two femi nine social butterflies discussing moore you know my dear he must have heaps of money to keep that place going and he never works except at his sculpting and im sure he never makes any money at that they say hes fearfully dissipated cut in the other but i thought he was charming such a bored air and so perfectly selfpossessed he told me that i understood him as no one else did yes i dare say answered the first unsheathing a claw he really needs some pure young thing like you to take him in hand and reform him its such a pity to see him going to pieces like that at this point clayton moved away overcome by his emotions but he re peated the whole conversation to moore later on and advised him to seize his chance of reform if she gave it to him but it was about ten days after they first launched themselves upon society that moore got what he believed to be their first clue clayton had come home late from a small private dance bewildered and bored by the shifting panorama of small intrigues and light loveaffairs impos sible to avoid seeing he sat in his bedroom slowly undress ing and wondering what future lay ahead for these girls when some of that charm was gone when he heard the familiar buzz of the private line this must be something special because they had already compared notes of their evenings plans at dinnertime moores voice was tense hello clayton good damned glad youre at home old man i think theres something stirring at last great what is it well you know i went up to a party on riverside drive tonight my host made his pile doing construction work for innocent and confiding suburban municipalities now i guess hes trying to drown his memories in one of the finest cellars in new york and finding plenty of friends to help him i never saw him before and i never want to see him again except in the way of our business but i got what i think is a clue there and thats the main thing go on im listening it was just before i left id gone to one of the bedrooms used as a mens cloakroom to get my hat when a young fellow blew in looking for his hat id already spotted him as a wellknown young rip with a lot more money than either wits or decency and id been casually introduced to him in the early part of the evening but now he fell on me like a longlost friend not a bad party eh said he but the women arent up to much too damned standoffish for my taste only the same old booze too gee you oughta been on the party i was on th other nigh say i thought i wasn heaven i tried to shake him off and get out of there but he wasnt having any wai a minute i wan tell you bout it he said in an injured tone so i waited the house of the missing he held a waving finger before me and went on i was like pardise i tell ya i dunno wha they gave us but i was lost to the worl till the next mornin they kep me there all nigh where was it i asked him damned f i know somewhere outa town but ol babylon and cornith hadnt a tiling on that party i paid two hundred dollars to go an i wouldnt amissed it for a thousandgirls an divans and strange things to drink that gave ya the most wonerful dreams gee what a party they tel me special that i wasnt even to mention it but thats only a avertising dodge ya cant fool me that was one of the conditions made me swear not to tell before theyd take me he went off into fits of laughter here someone else came in just then moore continued and i noticed that the newcomer stared pretty hard for an instant at the young hopeful i dont know why anyhow this fellow had some more to say that convinced me he might be useful sounds like drugs doesnt it clay ton cut in wait said moore when this young fellow had stopped laughing i pumped him gently about the party i dunno he said what they gave us musta been some kind of drug for i had a rotten head the next day i asked him again where it was search me he answered they took me there in a closed car an brought me away in one mighta been anywhere amost at this point moore continued the fellow looked up and caught the newcomers eye and it seemed to sober him he smiled in a sickly way and began a wild search for his hat the other man went out right after that but i had a good look at him and i think i know who he is anyhow the young rip wouldnt talk any moreseemed scared and soberedand i came away but i got the young fellows address from him whats your idea clayton asked why follow him up and try to find out who asked him to the party then work it so that you or i get an invita tion sounds promising you bet it does said moore any how ill follow it up tomorrow ill try to get in touch with the young rip and wheedle some information out of him but i knew youd want to know about it first besides its as well to keep in touch with each others move ments i think this young fellow lives on west fortyfourth street in the branscombe ill go up there tomorrow afternoon right good luck any news at your end moore in quired not yet and they rang off chapter vii the girl in gray the following afternoon clayton had an engagement for tea with mrs fur neau she had told him to come early ostensibly because they were to have a quiet talk over some plans for amateur theatricals since their second meeting clayton had made a good deal of an effort to please her and their friendship was on a more or less intimate basis at this time it had not been necessary to pretend to much admiration for mrs furneau was a charming woman but where mar garets fate might be even slightly con cerned clayton had none of the scruples he might otherwise have felt he had made his admiration for the lady more evident than was perhaps necessary hoping for the time when their growing intimacy might give him the house of the missing the opportunity to question her suddenly about his sister and possibly learn some thingif there was anything to learn his former suspicion of her faded as he knew her better so about half past three he pulled himself together assumed a most cynical and disillusioned expression and set forth for her house their conversation that afternoon be fore the arrival of her other guests was of a personal nature and consisted mainly of subtleties of which the lady was a past mistress once however she referred to the subject never absent from claytons thoughts jack she said after a pause and speaking a little wistfully he thought have you really given up all hope of finding your sister she reached out and touched his hand delicately to soften the reminder if she could clayton nodded whats the use ive looked everywhere and its hope less dont lets talk about it dont worry about it but let me go to the devil in my own way he smiled bitterly and glanced away from her but when he looked back again her eyes were on him with a keenness of scrutiny that he had never seen in them before there was a little furrow between her pretty brows too but she contented herself with it doesnt seem like you somehow perhaps not he retorted but when there isnt a single shred of a trace to go on what can i do she hesitated a moment i didnt ask just to hurt you i expect mrs fawcett here this afternoon later on it was to her house that i took margaret to luncheon that wretched day you re member and i did not know whether you would rather see her again and per haps question her further or go away before she comes she left you remem ber soon after margarets disappear ance on one of her globetrotting jaunts or something and i thought per haps oh i dont mind seeing her again if thats what you mean he answered though he had never even thought of questioning mrs fawcett very closely except to verify the fact that margaret had left with mrs furneau a little after five he realized that perhaps he load been careless there but as for questioning her again he added whats the use mrs helen furneau shrugged her shoulders well i thought id tell you anyway i appreciate that shes a queer woman mrs fur neau went on she used to be ultra conservative before her husband died but since shes been wandering around the globe with nothing in particular to occupy her shes taken on a crowd that even i would call queer and i dont believe anybody ever accused me of con servatism she laughed whimsically naturally clayton pricked up his ears at that then to hide his interest he turned the conversation back to his charming hostess presently the guests began to arrive they were the usual mixed lot of artists and professionals with a rich sprinkling of foreigners for whom helen furneau had a particular penchant clayton was deep in cynical platitudes with a roundbodied and rateyed little cubist who looked as if he needed scrub bing when helen called his name she stood at his elbow and turning he found himself facing the loveliest girl he had ever seen she was dressed in grayclinging filmy stuffwith a big gray floppy hat clayton took that much in before mrs furneau completed the introduc tion then the girls big gray eyes met his gravely lingered a moment taking the house of the missing him in and fell away with just a hint of shyness she was obviously quite young and obviously out of place in that gaêlre clayton was introduced in turn to her aunt a fussy and voluble person by all external signs of the kind that rushes in and so forth that over he turned to the girl again with an inward sigh of relief if he must talk to rat eyed cubists for the sake of his search he thought there could be no harm in a few moments off duty in such obviously wholesome company while clayton made the remark or two to her aunt which convention re quired the girl stood talking to mrs furneau she was speaking as he joined them most wonderful stuff i ever tasted you must go and get them to give you some they were funny people though i dont believe i like them very she stopped as clayton came up to them clearly she and her hostess were on the best of terms the three of them talked about noth ing in particular for a moment and then mrs furneau hurried away to greet newer arrivals and clayton led the girl to a seat she came from utica he learned had never been in new york before this visit to her aunt before long he had her embarked on a description of her impressions of the people she had met in her aunts circle in the meantime he studied the lovely face from the point of view of a painter of portraits the features were almost per fect and with all the beauty of wide gray eyes straight delicate nose and crimson sweetly curving lips she had that added something expression spirit feeling call it what you will that made the lovely features really beautiful presently she faltered and colored faintly and clayton drew his eyes hastily away then more to cover the mo mentary embarrassment than anything else he reverted to the remark he had overheard wont you tell me what was the most wonderful stuff you ever tasted he inquired she laughed gayly oh my aunt took me to a funny party this afternoon before we came here there were all sorts of queer people there and ii didnt care for it very much but they gave me some of the most wonderful tea you can imagine it almost reconciled me to the people for a while i felt sort of dreamy as though i loved the whole world and then afterward she laughed a little shyly i liked them all less than ever there must have been something queer in it claytons first thought was delight at the girls entire ingenuousness but a moment later the full significance of her words came to him and he realized that here might be the clue for which he had been searching for so long how extraordinary he laughed but are you sure that it was the tea and not just a sudden mood his companion shook her head no she answered positively i know the sort of mood you mean but this was something much more distinct and engrossing why for a little while everything seemed to expand or contract in the queerest way im afraid i cant explain very well but everything there all the people and even the things in the roomseemed to have delightful and wonderful qualities andim afraid that doesnt sound very coherent she broke off laughing it is quite coherent clayton re sponded though strange enough surely but he broke off and looked into her eyes but what he was silent a moment but i wonder he went on whether i the house of the missing might become socially impossible for a moment and say something serious the lovely eyes met his in frank sur prise and inquiry and i wonder whether that sort of thing is good for one he finished she laughed thats not very seri ous mr clayton no i dont suppose that sort of thing is at all good for one but you new yorkers do not make that a criterion of your actions surely perhaps we do not he answered gravely but thats no reason why i shouldnt she demanded smiling there you go trying to keep all the privileges for yourselves i think i like new york and i want lots of privi leges clayton laughed do you expect to be here long about a month i think well you ought to see about enough of new york in that time and i hereby extend you the freedom of the city with all its privileges but i hope you will extend me one in return at this moment her aunt bustled up to them natalie my dear you must come and meet the jordans such dear people and so unusual two of my best friends you know then she turned beaming you will excuse us mr clayton miss van cleef rose gracefully to her feet in spite of a little momentary trick of shyness now and then she was clearly a young lady with a good deal of natural poise she turned to clayton for an in stant before following her aunt and the boon you ask she inquired laughing just to see something of you while you are here he answered gravely again the lovely eyes met his in sur prise he tried to make his glance ex press nothing more than a friendly in terest but a little of his growing wonder and admiration showed for an instant natalie her aunt called her a little impatiently the girl colored adorably and dropped her eyes iwhy of course if you wish it she murmured an instant later she had joined her aunt clayton stood still conscious of quick ening pulses and for an instant he forgot his mission there and the work he had set himself to do and became enmeshed in a daydream full of vague thoughts and fancies leading he knew not whither but not for long in the middle of a discussion on freud mrs furneau moved passed him with a smile that held something of meaning in it and he looked up to see her welcoming a tall woman strikingly handsome whose face he recognized at once but he should not have recognized her if her face had not been engraved on his memory by the force of association with tragedy for he remembered mrs faw cette as an ultraconservative conven tional womana woman who was socially powerful and knew itand one whose speech and attire were as con servative as her views and now she wore a long flowing art gown of the most amazing shade of orange fading into lavender she wore long green earrings hanging nearly to her shoulders her chestnut hair once so beautifully coiffured now escaped in wisps from beneath her big flopping hat and from her head to her heels she was of art arty but after a second glance clayton realized that the change in her attire was perhaps not the most striking change after all the handsome face was still hardstill held something of dominance in its level glancebut the mouth had sagged a little there were heavy lines tinder the eyes and the eyes themselves were less clear the whole face had deteriorated it saug the house of the missing was much like approaching a house handsome in the distance only to find it deserted and falling into ruins on closer inspection as a portrait painter clayton had naturally studied faces but he had never before seen so great a change in a face without a definite cause to which the change could be ascribed it was not a good face at all events of that he was very certain mrs furneau smilingly signed to him to join her and he was presently shaking hands with mrs fawcette her manner was most cordial but he did not feel that she was particularly glad to see him i hear you have been round the world since last we met he told her oh no just a fairly long stay in egypt a little off the beaten track what enthusiasm clayton re marked life is a poor shabby thing at bestso i dont see that it matters much where we spend it but i dare say you enjoyed yourself mrs fawcette had found a seat on a sofa while they were talking and he sat down beside her without an invitation oh yes thank you i enjoyed my self she answered a little sharply how extraordinary clayton ex claimed i thought that faculty was dead in most of us she turned and stared at him sus piciously well it isnt dead in me at all events she snapped although your remarks might imply that you think it ought to be clayton was secretly delighted to find that she had so quick a temper for he hoped that reaction might loosen her tongue if there was anything to learn from her he sat up as though stung my dear lady i had no thought of implying any such thing if my words sounded discourteous i beg that you will pardon them to tell you the truth you may remember that i suffered a terrible loss some months ago and im afraid that that has made me selfcentred as well as costing me my own capacity for en joyment you remember it seemed to him that his companion started slightly and for an instant his heart stood still with a sudden fierce hope but she answered smoothly enough you poor man of course i remember it but surely you found your sister again i have been away you see and he shook his head no i never found herand now i am trying to forget he glanced at his companion but she was looking down at her hands you have stopped trying to find her she inquired without looking up what is the use he replied there was a moments silence then i think perhaps you are wise she said after all she probably ran away with someone and is quite happy she looked up at him at last and i am sure you will regain your capacity for enjoyment her glance lingered a moment and for the first time he became aware of a queer fascination of which she seemed to have the power she was undoubtedly a handsome woman and her long narrow eyes could express a great deal in a queer elusive way i feel that i am regaining it mo mentarily he answered he could have taken her and cheer fully choked her for the callous way in which she had referred to his sister fascination or no fascination but that would not have advanced his cause any he was beginning to be suspicious of everyone and mrs fawcette had been one of the last persons to see margaret she smiled into his eyes then a strange elusive smile that was yet vaguely repellant the house of the missing you are pleased to be facetious she said indeed no of all interests a hu man interest is the keenest and when that interest is beautiful he sighed he felt her hand touch his for a fleet ing instant come she answered you must not flirt with me on such short acquaintance but she smiled into his eyes and when our acquaintance is not so short he demanded she rose to her feet and clayton rose too and faced her if you will permit me to lengthen it he added she laughed provocatively why then we shall see what we shall see she answered she left him then and presently he took leave of his hostess and came away he had learned little or nothing from mrs fawcette or anyone but he was not illpleased with his afternoon for at least he had paved the way for a closer acquaintance with that rather dan gerouslooking lady and he had learned something of interest from the girl in gray claytons pulse quickened again remi niscently at the thought of the girl in gray but he shook himself impatiently such things and such thoughts were not for himuntil he had solved his problem and had found margaret larry met him at his door in high excitement sure tis glad i am youre back agin sor that there private phones been ringing like mad fer the last hour ivery minute misther moore wants to know are ye back yit he must have something important to tell ye sor there there it goes again clayton gave his hat stick and gloves to larry and hurried into his bedroom yes the tiny phone bell was ringing faintly hello moore this is clayton you want me at last came moores voice over the wire you bet i want you clayton i believe were on the right track at last hows that you remember my telling you about the young drunk i met up on riverside drive last night of course well i went up to his place this afternoon on west fortyfourth streetand found everything at sixes and sevens there were a lot of young fellows of his type hanging around in the flat to say nothing of three or four peroxide blondes his man was nearly in tears it seems this chap cant be found he didnt come home at all last night and they havent heard from him in short he has disappeared he had dates with a lot of them for the morning and afternoon and evening and one of the beauties remarked tearfully that it wasnt like jimmy to break a date with a bit of fluff but there it is hes gone his valet was just about to get in touch with the police when i left what do you make of it ill tell you clayton of course i may be wrong the young rip may have been worse soused than he looked and may be sobering up in some local police station but i dont think it was that i didnt like the way the other fellow looked at him in the cloakroom last night while he was talking about that party the young fellow didnt like it either and he told me that he had been forbidden to talk about that party i think that had something to do with his disappearance of course all this is only guesswork but it looks queer doesnt it well clayton answered if he dis appeared because he talked at that party and he disappeared last night the people he offended and who gave the party must be fast workers thats just it if he has disappeared the house of the missing completely and doesnt turn up i think thats the most probable explanation and only a wellorganized gang could work that fast so it may be the same gang what about the other fellow did you trace him the man who overheard us yes but i havent had a chance to talk to him or get acquainted yet his name is vining as i thought hes a young doctor with independent means i guess hes a better cocktail mixer than a sur geon has an office in west end ave nue they say he limits his cases to attractive women but everyone agrees that he is clever i hope hes not too clever for us clayton answered but we cant tell much about it until we see whether the young drunk turns up or not what do you think well moore answered i hate to lose time but i suppose its no use jump ing to conclusions whats your news clayton told him what had happened that afternoon including the clue he be believed he had found in the description of the tea which the girl in gray had been given finally they agreed to follow each his own line for the present always keeping the other informed of the progress made indeed there was little else they could do as yet chapter viii the strange tea in spite of the promise of recent events and the possible clues which moore and clayton believed they had found the next three weeks were un eventful uneventful that is from the standpoint of their quest though event ful enough to clayton personally he was a languid and cynical guest at many highbrow and lowbrow gather ings he discussed turgenieff spiritual ism psychoanalysis free love and so forth at the one until his ears burned and polo prizefighting women politics and stocks at the other but he un earthed no fresh clues he did make a little progress how ever for one tiling he cultivated the ac quaintance of mrs fawcette until it ripened into something much more inti mate though vague and undefined she was he found an interesting woman welltraveled and wellread and better still with very definite views on most things she had a clever gift of repartee as he learned to his cost for he found himself several times considerably beyond his depth her views were strikingly glaringly liberal and she seemed to take a secret delight in attempting to shock himand she succeeded better than she guessed but he got no news from her however he formed a real friendship during those three weeksa friendship that meant far more to him however little it might mean to his quest for he arranged a second opportunity to meet and talk with the girl in gray as he liked to call her and after that he obtained her permission and that of her aunt to call upon them after that call and a theater party that he gave for them they were good friends it was his playtime before the serious part of his quest began and it meant more to him that he could express natalie van cleef took her many social experiences and the many strange specimens she met with a ready sym pathy and a sweet reserve that were in spiring to watch she was welcome everywhere as much for her lovely per sonality as for her beauty but somehow she contrived to be a welcome addition to each circle without being exactly of it she was essentially innocent without being ignorant so that the unconven tional moods and tenses with which she the house of the missing came into contact left her comprehend ing at least in part and yet quite un touched in her own sweet calm and slightly shy personality to clayton during those days she was like a breath of sea air in a crowded departmentstore or a bunch of roses on a tramp steamer before many days had passed she filled most of his waking thoughts and many of his dreams they saw a great deal of each other and had many happy days together days so happyat least to claytonthat he could never think of them without a catch in the throat and a tightening of the hands in view of what came after for as their friendship ripened he grew to realize that her mind and spirit were as sweet and lovely and gracious as her person moore accomplished little more than clayton did during those three weeks the young fellow from whom he had obtained his first hint of a circle of drug takers de luxe had in truth disappeared being a wealthy young man of consid erable social position his disappearance became a ninedays wonder but for all that no trace of him was found moore and clayton decided that their first surmisehis lack of reticence that nighthad been the cause of his disap pearance moore did however get in touch with young dr vining who had overheard that conversation and after a while suc ceeded in making his acquaintance vining apparently took to him at once and when moore carelessly mentioned the fact that he had independent means vining contrived to see a good deal of him aided and abetted by moore him self once or twice moore vaguely skirted the subject of his conversation with the young fellow who had disappeared but vining displayed a bland ignorance of any such conversation or of any place where such a party as the young man had described could be found however moore did not despair but continued to cultivate the friendship in his effeminate and lackadaisical way until presently vining knew all about his passion for new and outlandish sen sations but events were shaping themselves for both clayton and moore during those weeks the end of their period of inactivity came suddenly and at the same time to both a few days before natalie planned to leave new york mrs furneau ar ranged a little luncheon to which clayton was invited among others the luncheon included mrs fawcette clayton spent a trying two hours he had fallen almost unconsciously into the habit of being very much himself when natalie and he were alone together and his change of manner when talking to mrs fawcette and to mrs furneau must have been striking he caught natalie looking at him once or twice in a puzzled way during the luncheon but so far as the quest was concerned it would have been more costly to strike a false or inconsistent note in the ears of the older women than in the ears of natalie so clayton was forced to carry on a miserably cynical disillusioned and worldweary conversation with his hostess and mrs fawcette sick at heart all the time at the halfconcealed sur prise in natalies eyes it was a little better after luncheon however he contrived with some dif ficulty to have a word or two with na talie away from the others they had always been frank with each other and this conversation was no exception al though she was just a little cool at first imim very very sorry that you are going away he said to her are you i should not imagine that anything would have the power to make the house of the missing you either very very sorry or very very glad natalie she looked down for a moment and when she looked up again she was her usual friendly frank self well then why do you talk in that disillusioned way it isnt a bit like you clayton was silent then taking a wild leap in the dark he tried to be equally frank whatever the conse quences natalie i know it isnt like me it isnt even a real side of me but i had to do it today as i have had to do it before there is a real and vital reason and that is all i can tell you do you believe me she looked up laughing then as her eyes met his her smile faded into a look of wonder do you really mean that she demanded i really mean just that he assured her earnestly and i really mean that i simply cannot tell you any more than that butbutwhy that is absurd why cant you be yourself he shook his head despairingly natalie i have told you the truth and our friendship means far too much to me for me to lie to you of all people but i cannot tell you any more than that she stared at him for a moment or two and then he realized what a really wonderful girl she was for her hand went out impulsively to his sleeve and the eyes she raised to his were full of sincerity i believe you then she said simply and your reason does not matter he must have let some of his appre ciation show in his eyes for she flushed a delicious pink and dropped her own quickly he leaned a little nearer to her and you see i can still be very very glad about something he told her she changed the subject rather hastily do you remember my telling you about some wonderful tea i had had just before our first meeting she asked clayton hastened to assure her that he did remember that they had discussed that tea several times and wondered about its peculiar properties well mrs fawcette has promised me some more of it and she is taking me there this afternoon to the same place clayton asked her words filled him with a vague apprehension perhaps because by now he hated the thought of associating her closely with anything that had to do with his quest yes to the same place now whats the matter she added laughing well he answered frankly i hate the thoughts of your taking drugs of any kind however mild you dont be long in that crowd natalie she laughed oh but i must have some more of that tea if only to con vince myself that there was nothing in it and that my queer mood was only a mood well if you must go there i wish youd let me go with you i know its a funny request and i dont quite know why i dont want you to go there with out mebut i dont clayton felt very young and awkward with that speech but there was so little that he could tell her to warn her and he did not trust either mrs fawcette or her friends natalie looked up at him curiously you are in a funny mood today she said but if you want to come along i should think mrs fawcette would be delighted to take you before he could answer she had turned to that lady mrs fawcette she called gaily mr clayton is dying to come to the tea the house of the missing with us this afternoon do you suppose you could manage to take him then clayton saw a queer thing hap pen mrs fawcette turned as though she had been stung and glanced first at him and then at natalie with a scarcely veiled intensity that left them startled in their turn she did not answer for a moment and natalie was driven into further speech ive been telling him about that won derful tea we had there before and he wants to come along and sample it but if youd rather not she glanced from mrs fawcette to clayton in obvious embarrassment clayton thought mrs fawcette had grown rather pale but she answered rapidly enough you bad girl i told you not to talk about that tea or our host will be swamped with people coming to sample it and demanding where he got it but if mr clayton wants to come with us i shall be delighted to include him in the party and he can see you home after ward there was an almost venomous light in her eyes as she spoke but if natalie saw it she appeared serenely unconscious of the fact thank you she answered and im awfully sorry if i should not have talked to him about it naturally clayton did not feel very comfortable about his position in the party but he was determined to go and so made no demur to his lefthanded in vitation and later when they found themselves in mrs fawcettes car on the way to her friends house she seemed to wish to make amends by being very cordial to both but clay ton did not much relish the look in her eye when it fell on natalie all the same their host was a russian an aristo crat and a card from the fallen house of cards that had been russia carried by the wind of that fall into a new country and a new circle unlike most russian aristocrat refu gees however he seemed to have plenty of means the house just off fifth avenue in the eighties was beautifully if somewhat barbarically furnished with a queer mixture of occidental comfort in the shape of deep lounges and arm chairs and of oriental splendor in many and rich hangings and cushions the air of his rooms was heavy with perfume and the man himself with his pale skin deepset eyes and pointed beard gave an impression of something equally exotic they were the only guests and he welcomed them with al most effusive cordiality clayton in cluded after a few moments of general con versation mrs fawcette rose to her feet smiling droga she called to himhe was talking to nataliei have brought something to show you i am sure that the young people will excuse us for a moment before clayton had recovered from his amused surprise at the somewhat crude method of classifying him with natalie ivanovitch our host had risen to his feet with a smile and a bow and followed mrs fawcette through a pair of heavy curtains into a room beyond well laughed natalie then her smile faded and she touched his arm but im glad you came she whispered i dont think i like it here very much i thought there was going to be a lot of people at least i thought that was what mrs fawcette said natalie dear clayton whispered dont come here again without me promise he was very much in earnest and the dear slipped out before he knew it but fortunately she did not seem to notice it you are growing very dictatorial sir she answered but all the same the house of the missing i dont believe i do like it here im glad you came a moment later the curtains parted and the others rejoined them there was nothing to be learned from their hosts expression for his face was a beautiful blank but clayton thought mrs faw cette bore traces of either temper or fear and possibly both but that was all that happened they had teaand it was wonderful tea but it was just tea and nothing more of that he was certain the conversation was general and interesting enough and if natalie was disappointed she naturally could not show it clayton laid himself out to be both sympathetic and entertaining to the rus sian the moment came when he felt justified in asking him to lunch the fol lowing day ivanovitch accepted read ily enough if there was anything to be learned from him clayton was de termined to make an attempt to learn it and he believed that natalies first state ment about the tea was correct she was exceedingly healthy and not given to violent moods afterward mrs fawcette had to hurry home to dress for a dinner engage ment and clayton took natalie back to her aunts house when their taxi pulled up in front of the house it was nearly dinnertime and both had engagements but clayton de tained the girl for a moment longer listen natalie will you do me a very big favor he asked her as they mounted her aunts steps she threw him a smiling glance of in quiry it is a big favor he warned her and this is it will you promise to tell me before you go there again for any more of that wonderful tea natalie looked at him in wonder how funny you are today she said at last dont you like mrs fawcette or ivanovitch not very much i confess but i like the idea of that drugged tea even less natalie promise please she shrugged her shoulders ive got to go and dress you importunate man she laughed soill promise though i havent the slightest idea why i should at all events clayton went down her aunts front steps treading on something much less substantial chapter ix the amateur burglar after seeing natalie home from the tea at the russians clayton had gone to a dinner and theater party and had not reached his own flat until the small hours nevertheless he found larry waiting up for him with the news that moore wanted to speak to him the moment he came in moore answered at once when clay ton rang him listen old fellow he said theres some really big news for you i have had another talk with vining i took him out to dinner last night and gave him a really good time and i think he has thawed out at last at any rate he admitted that he could take me to a wonderful party if he wanted to i had told him moore went on that my one object in life was a new and unique sensation and of course when he admitted that he could give me one i devilled the life out of him to do it well clayton he finally con sented great stuff i wanted to go tomorrow night but he couldnt manage that hes going out of town tomorrow however he prom ised to take me the night after thats friday night but i am to be blind folded to travel in a closed car and to the house of the missing pay two hundred dollars for the privi lege pretty steep eh it ought to be some party clayton remarked youd think so now ive been thinking the thing over and i cant be lieve that a gang like that will give me the slightest chance to learn where i am going or how i got there they couldnt afford to and theyre probably too clever to fool that leaves two other courses open to us we can try to find out before hand approximately where they are go ing and you can pick me up on the way and follow on or you can attempt to follow me from the start but if they are the clever rogues i think they are the latter will not be easy nor the former for that matter clayton remarked perhaps not moore replied but now that we know definitely that vining is mixed up with some gang even if it isnt the one we are looking for i think we can take more definite steps to find out more about him and hes to be away tomorrow afternoon search his rooms exactly what do you say do you think hes at all suspicious of you moore there was silence for a moment then moores voice came more slowly over the wire damn it clayton i cant be sure of course he seems perfectly friendly now but he did change a bit suddenly however thats probably only my imagi nation well i dont believe that its worth while your taking a chance of running foul of him did he tell you of his own free will that he was going out of town tomorrow yes made quite a point of it but of course i was disappointed at not going to the party sooner well if hes at all suspicious of you and if hes as clever as you say he is maybe hes counting on your doing that very thing what searching his rooms clay ton youve got a head on you its just possible he answered so i think it would be better if i go then if im caught hell take me for a bur glar and not suspect you necessarily ill take larry with me and if theyre plan ning to surprise me maybe ill give them a surprise in return besides if he does try to ambush me well know that he is suspicious of you moore agreed to this plan if rather reluctantly and gave clayton vinings address he told him also that he thought he was being followed they discussed this rather disturbing news for a while then rang off the next morning clayton summoned larry go to one of the theatrical makeup stores in the west forties this after noon he said and get two masks then clean up your kit of tools then go to vinings house and look over the lay of the land he lives on the second floor he told him the address finally larry he added meet me with your kit at fiftyninth street and lexington avenue at nine oclock to night and do not bring a gat if were going to have to injure anyone weve got to do it quietly we cant afford any kind of publicity thats all larry an hour later natalie and clayton were riding in the park and for a few hours he forgot his quest perhaps clayton will be accused of lack of feeling for that but he loved and longed for his little sister none the less because natalie had come into his life clayton had led a curiously uneventful life up to that time aside from his ex periences in the war his knowledge of women was limited to social ameni the house of the missing ties and books the light loves of the average young sower of wild oats had never appealed to him so he had to struggle against a very torrent of long ing and emotion now that he had met natalie for he was wildly hopelessly in love with her they had known each other for only three weeks but the thing had come on him like a very flash of revela tion and was unmistakable and not to be denied they say that women are aware of these things if she knew that clayton loved her natalie did not show it by word or look she was very lovely that morning the sun vied with the wind in torment ing clayton by playing hide and seek in her wayward masses of hair her beau tiful face radiated health and happiness so that passersby turned and watched her brazenly ever the lovely eyes looked into his clear innocent and friendly until laugh ter and badinage died on his lips and he rode beside her tonguetied and al most blind with longing to take her into his arms there in the sunlight and tell her that she meant the past the present the future and all life to him perhaps she guessed for she talked on at random and more rapidly than usual until he recovered some show of casual companionship at her door she left him with lowered eyes and only a faint goodby so that he left her house happier than he had ever been in his life by the time clayton had bathed and dressed for his lunch with ivanovitch something of the mood of the morning had passed and he was back in the spirit of his quest again he called for the russian in his little car and took him to an inn out on the peekskill road it is a beautiful place that inn and the russian enjoyed him self although clayton could not supply him with anything to match his wonder ful tea clayton had schooled himself in a line of subtly degrading conversation to spring on ivanovitch and he discovered that the russian followed his lead with extraordinary alacrity in his subtle and charming way ivanovitch gave vent to a series of the nastiest remarks clayton had ever listened to he felt that it would have been a real pleasure to throw him over the balcony of the inn into the gorge some fifty feet below clayton did his best to convince the russian he shared his views and his tasies he took a leaf from moores book and admitted that he had run the entire gamut of sensations with the ex ception of drugs and that he was too lazy to go in search of those finally he admitted quite frankly that he had heard of some wonderful tea that had been served at his house and begged him to tell whether it was really as capti vating as it had been called but ivanovitch was cautious he told clayton he had had some of that tea the preceding afternoon and that it was merely good tea so clayton let the matter drop en tirely and talked about russia and other general subjects until it was time to take him home at his door however he tried once more well monsieur i hope you will give me another opportunity to enjoy your society you are a man of the world and i hope that if you run across something new in this weary round of nights and days you will let me share it with you ivanovitch bowed smiling his cynical smile who knows perhaps i may yet be able to introduce you to a new sensation my dear mr clayton and with that they parted there had been something about his smile that clayton did not entirely like the house of the missing but he felt that if the russian knew anything about the famous revels of which they were beginning to learn he had made a fair start to learn more through him the real event of the day began when clayton met larry at nine oclock he was at the appointed place promptly and his master could see by his slightly increased girth that he had brought his kit of tools with him clayton was dressed in his oldest clothes and looked as much like a burglar as possible so that if vining saw him he would not connect him with moore or think it more than a coincidence vinings house was one of those high narrow brownstone fronts in the sixties he lived alone and his apartment was cared for by a woman who came in by the day once larry and clayton reached his rooms they were in little danger of de tection but the difficulty was forcing the lock on the front door without at tracting attention vining lived on the second floor his windows were dark but there were lights in the apartment on the first floor although there were none in the base ment so that they were in constant dan ger of detection as they stood in the little entrance however larry began fishing under his coat and calmly made ready to force the lock clayton was uncomfortable this was taking the law into their own hands with a vengeanceand if they were caught clayton could not take the law into his confidence then too if anyone came along while they were searching vinings rooms and saw the forced lock there would be a hullabaloo at once wait a minute larry said clayton there are some children coming ive got a better idea i think there were letterboxes for each apartment in the vestibule and a push button underneath each letterbox they stood quietly wating until the children had come laughing and calling nearly opposite them then clayton pressed all the bells they waited a moment and then sure enough heard the latch lifted quick larry clayton whispered put something into the door to hold it open he slipped one of his tools under the door at the bottom so that the latch could not close again and then drew back into the shadow of the steps next door they waited a few moments and pres ently heard a window raised overhead the children were still calling in the street and a womans voice floated down to them faintly drat those children then the window was closed with a bang larry drew closer to his master say have you done this before sor he de manded they waited for perhaps ten minutes but nothing happened and no one came to the front door either from inside the house or from the street then larry slipped quietly forward pushed open the door picked up his jimmy and stood waiting come on sor he whispered tis now or never clayton followed him into the house he had told larry that there was just a possibility either that some one might be waiting for them or vining might return and catch them on that ac count clayton had arranged that they should not stick together after they got into the apartment but that larry should drop behind a little and as soon as he was inside to hide somewhere where he could watch his master to act if neces sary as surprise reinforcements what clayton had heard of vining had made him skeptical as to the ease with which his rooms could be searched the house of the missing especially if there were anything there for him to conceal there was a light in the entrance hall but everything was quiet the two men passed through it and up the first flight of stairs claytons heart was in his mouth however the stairs creaked hardly at all and they reached the dark hall one flight up with very little noise larry had called with a parcel for an imaginary tenant earlier in the evening and had not only marked in his memory the stairs that creaked but had also as certained that vinings door would be comparatively simple to open as it lessened the chance of people coming in and catching them they mounted the second flight at once they were in pitch darkness and the necessity for speed coupled with the need for making absolutely no sound had keyed up clayton the amateur burglar to a pretty high pitch they were halfway up the second flight on their hands and knees fortu nately and just maneuvering a creaky step when a door opened in the hall below letting out a flood of light fortunately it came from a chandelier high up in the room beyond and did not reach the spot where they stood but it was nervous work standing or rather crouching with one knee in the air while the woman put out her light locked the door and proceeded down the stairs to the front entry a moment later they stood in pitch darkness in front of vinings door and donned their masks clayton waited while larry stooped down he heard a little scraping sound a chink as of metal striking metal and then a sharp crack that sounded as loud as a big gun in the silent hall they stood still for a moment but nothing happened there you are sor came larrys cheerful whisper you go ahead and ill foller and hide so with a little electric torch in one one hand and the other held out blindly before him clayton crept into the dark ness that was presumably vinings en trance hall after a moment he heard the front door close softly behind him and then ventured to use the torch have you ever gone into a strange house and tried to make out the lay of the land with a pocket torch the torch shows up only one tiny spot at a time and when you have swept it all over one article of furniture and made out its general dimensions you have forgotten everything else however clayton found his way through the tiny hall and into a room on the left that appeared to be a sitting room it was dimly lit with a faint radiance that filtered in from the street below and he was able to make out the distribution of the furniture one of the first things he noticed was a desk in the far corner by the window and he decided that was his goal larry was still at his heels open up that desk larry he whis pered a moment later he heard the snap of the lock now follow me while we search the rest of the place first they went back into the tiny pitchdark hall the front door was at right angles to the outside hall the little entrance hall was also at right angles to the outside hall and ended almost at once in an al cove with a sofa and some chairs in it but they found that another and nar rower hall the entrance to which was hidden by a heavy curtain passed back inside the flat for its entire length the diningroom kitchen bathroom and two bedrooms led off it in turn and the hall ended in a window at the back of the house a third bedroom lay to the right of the hall at the back as it was a corner house all these rooms had win dows the house of the missing they found nothing of any im portance to search there was no one in the apartmentthat was certain a great deal relieved clayton re turned to the front hall stationed larry in the alcove there and made his way to vinings desk in the front room to his disappointment there was very little in the desk a few old letters an in vitation or two some receipts and a couple of blank incometax return forms were all that his first search revealed but having come there with so much difficulty clayton was determined to find something and going through the desk more carefully a second time he did discover something that might be of value it was a tiny account book hid den in a little hollow under the desk blotter clayton studied it for a moment there in the silence by the aid of his little torch and presently received a shock for it was half full of names and these names included several persons he knew after each name was a series of dates followed by single figures so that a single entry read something like this emily horton august august august suddenly there was a tiny sound from the hall outside and clayton instinctively switched off his torch and slipped the little book into his pocket he turned toward the doorway which lay in shadow then he became conscious that his heart was pounding heavily for he could see that something was moving in the shadowy corner hands up clayton blinked in a glare of blinding light from the suddenly illuminated chandelier his hands were high above his head and he was staring into the unwavering muzzle of a large and effi cient looking automatic the owner of the gun stood just in side the doorway with two other men flanking him on either side they looked a very determined and formidable trio in the pause that followed clayton had time to recognize vining from moores description as the man with the gun he also had time to wonder what had become of his reinforcements in the shape of larry obviously the next move was in either larrys hands or vinings for clayton was effectually covered then vining snapped drop one hand and take off that mask to be

insinuation and in the middle of one row a very beautiful very blonde girl with a wistful red mouth and quiet blue eyes whats eatin you nita demanded her neighbor to the left and the two girls exchanged friendly glances they shared a rather shabby apart ment together and they were the two very prettiest girls in the entire chorus of a very popular musical revue and night and day were not more different than cherrie bouchet and nita gilmore cherries beauty was the sort that struck with swift admiration because of its vividly arresting qualities flash ing black eyes scarletsplashed tawny cheeks and bold white teeth but nitas held you silent with its singular white perfectiondelicate baby skin absolute regularity of feature and shining blonde hair nothing replied nita soft of voice at least ill tell you after the show cherrie cherrie thrust her with one of her swift rapier glances then ducked her head to call to a late arrival and nita again lapsed into staring silence

holy pat who wants to live a thousand years on this punk map say if she was a wise kid she ruled the big roost for her little day you take my advice she tapped nitas bare shoulder with a rather heavy forefinger she who hesitates and catch old anton if you can and with a flirt of laughter half malicious half goodhumored she was gone leaving nita staring after her with dizzy blue eyes ii the following morning the sun in quisitive old bounder stuck his nose between the carelessly drawn curtains of a certain apartment and leered at the extravagant beauty before him he dwelt with hot appreciation on cherries full scarlet lips and then he caught a handful of nitas fair hair and fingered its gold covetously the girls stirred restlessly cherrie gave a little sigh and swung a petulant arm across her eyes but nita awoke quietly and stared at the ugly bunches of purple grapes that grew on ugly yellow branches upon the ceiling and saw neither purple grapes nor yellow branches after a while she raised her left hand that had hung limply over the side of her narrow white bed and transferred her gaze to an affair of sapphires and diamonds and platinum lacework that adorned the third finger of her left hand holding it in the sun she turned it from side to side watching it twinkle and sparkle and wink with the identical curiosity of a very small girl with a bit of broken glass a sudden gasp from the neighboring twin bed caused her to bury the hand abruptly beneath the covers but cherrie was not to be fooled nita gilmore you stick your guilty paw right over here pronto i wanta

dinnerplates that had to be matched an youre not one of the handpainted goldedged kind only a sort of common little saucer with rose buds scattered on it but you wear well kid an youre not willin to take a chance with wally nitas quick color had receded leaving her cheeks pale again and the blue eyes seemingly two shades darker i love wally she said honestly and my love would probably stand poverty never having known anything else but its wally im afraid of he doesnt know how to make a living and he would hate it and he might get tired of me then andoh i couldnt bear that besides he would be giving up everything for me huh youre one of them ten twentythirty thriller heroines aint you cherrie stretched yawned pinkly and out of a twirl and whirl of bedclothes landed on her dainty toes on the rusty looking carpet well i dont wanta horn in on your affairs nita but you take my advice and look before you leap lemme remind you of one thing though if you marry old anton youll be his youll belong to him do you want his old hands to pet you he aint got no right to such a dainty young girl wally nowhes clean hes young hes full of the devil praps but his eyes are bright and his mouth aint so experienced think of that kiss ing and bekissed old mouth of old an tons think of oh stop stop will you nita was erect in bed now trembling saug she who hesitates from head to foot with anger and dis gust a veil that she had so assiduously swung over antons past was being ruth lessly swept aside by cherrie and looking into its stark ugliness was like leaning over the edge of a cliff and look ing into a nest of hissing rattlesnakes hideous disquieting black and warning she thought of old antons hands dry cold wrinkled with a million tiny lines she thought of the way they closed hard and completely over her own and his gray eyescold too greedily avidly cold and the mouth sagging into a downward satirical knowing line how many women she wondered well excuse me for buttin in said cherrie loftily pattering into their bath room protesting with ouches at the feel of the cold linoleum but take it from me its plenty and enough for a girl to marry a man shes awfully in love with the door slammed there was a sound of water gurgling into the bath tub and cherries contralto lilting in saucy song nitas head was quiet on its pillow the blue eyes brooded into space the red mouth drooped with puzzled dis content nita did not remove the shining pledge from her left hand but she tucked that hand under her pillow so that it might not touch her cheek some wo men hate to open a door and look beyond nita was trying to compromise with lifeand love and nita was having a horribly hard time doing it iii within five minutes the phone bell had rung and nita had risen on one elbow and stared at it as though it were an intruding gamin however urged by cherries hi there quit your dreamin an hand central the soothin syrup she rose reluctantly a lovely vision in trailing white and put her pretty mouth to the transmitter yes cutler antons voice sauve as satin good morning my little rosebud am i rousing you too early oh no she murmured had to get up anyway theres a rehearsal at

aftertheater supper on saturday night ill take some of you girls down in the limousine are you wearing my ring nita cutler i think id rather not wear itin publicfor a little while how long will you keep me waiting rosebud oh not long she said faintly hand at suddenly pulsing throat well au revoir sweetheart save your kisses for me save her kisses for him of course she knew how the old roue wanted them hundreds of them tight and quick on her rebellious red mouth hanging up the receiver she stood for a moment gripping with tight lingers the woodwork of the telephone when the bell again buzzed sharply in her ear wally campgay and confident sweet nita nearly forgot to tell you im going to whirl my girl about this p m in my new french car say she who hesitates shes a stunner a redion eightcylinder of a blue to match your glorious optics nita hesitated may cherrie come too no cherrie may not come too mimicked the irrepressible wally what dye think i am a cooks tourist guide or something ill call for my little eyeeaser about three toodleoo oh andnita yesfaintly love me silence but it seemed as if he must hear nita swallowing the fat lump in her throat he laughed low and exultantly and hung up cherrie entered from her bath rosy and abundant datin your human safedeposit no im going out with wallace camp cherrie winked a wicked eye at the cherrie in the mirror and continued her song to the effect that twenty two loves twenty two that afternoon at three nita in white polo coat and soft white hat looked like a particularly pretty angel beside wallace camp who looked a particularly likable young devil gliding with costly smoothness along the wide boulevard wally was exuberant and nita unwontedly still he became curious finally at her lack of laughter and stopping the car he cradled her soft chin between his strong young hands his laughing brown eyes plunging deep into her blue ones ill not carry a lovely carcass about in my blue redion now then what you miffed about oh nothing smiled nita and al lowed him to kiss her again and again upon the soft scarlet of her mouth and upon the little pulse that hammered so excitedly in her white throat and it may be stated right here that if nita did not return his kisses she welcomed them gorgeously in fact there was little or nothing of the angel in nita when wally camps arms were about her and her head was close against his blackpearl cravat pin finally she asked him somewhere down in the middle of his shirt front you want to marry me dont you wally no coon ever loved a chicken as serted wally as i love you and im willing to go the limit nita ill get a job as chauffeur or something and you can start to burn the biscuits i dont know anything about bis cuits you are so darned sweet nita sighed wally a man wouldnt dare do less than ask you to marry him would he no said nita coldly he wouldnt dare do less wally sighed again uneasily wed better go home i see clouds are gathering and on the return trip nita did not slump softly on his shoulder but sat up very erectly quite by herself like a cold little island iv on saturday night a gay exclaim ing crowd of merrymakers assembled in the drawingroom of cutler antons white italian villa this room long windowed mirrorpaneled slowly filled to overflowing with noisy guests who tossed down countless priceless cock tails and shrieked their appreciation to the crystal chandeliers wally camp was disturbed and nita was distressed to discover each other members of the party wally had been rather mixing his drinks and was flushed and resentful he looked over nitas exquisite figure her frock was of golden silk that matched her hair adorned with secretive splashes of blue that matched her eyes she who hesitates didnt know you went to antons parties theyre too noisy for a nice little girl like you nita nita turned very hot and then ex tremely cold but not too loud for you of course dont be silly suddenly suspicion struck him and he regarded her narrowly know anton pretty well dont you and as if the name called him anton himself appeared overthin yellow skinned sardonic his gray eyes circling like coldly calculating vultures over the infinitely graceful curves and apple blossom perfection of the girl a shudder swept her from head to foot could there be anything in the entire world worse than this cold old passion of cutler anton he looks at me she thought rest lessly as though id been made to order for him like louis makes his berk shire salad and she would almost have hurled back his bargain into his mean eyes had she not caught the sus picion of wallys glance my dear rosebud said anton silkysoftly supper is waiting and i am going to take you in so she accepted his arm and marched straightly beside him with not another glance for the disgruntled wally camp around the oval diningtable ran a miniature track and round and round the track speeded a marvelous little en gine with its train of cars the bag gage cars were loaded high with bur gundy french white wines and mellow old champagne and were promptly raided with shrieks of laughter but the mail car demanded the most curious at tention an envelope for every guest and in every envelope a small square card engraved in gold announcing the betrothal of nita gilmore to cutler anton in the immediate babel of laughter exclamation and congratulation nita turned to anton her face as white as the little card within her fingers i didnt know youd announce this so soon and why not darling caressing words could become almost insulting epithets on his twisting lips isnt april the proper month for fashioning future dreams and june is the month of brides will you be ready rosebud after all why wait why wait indeed surely this was bound to happen she had been a vacil lating fool her blue eyes swept across the table and found wallys horrified brown ones all his flippancies had been stripped from him suddenly like bright beads from a string his head bent low his gaze swept her face imploring a denial of this atrocious terrible joke but the evident dismay of the wide blue eyes answered him sufficiently the impos sible was possible and the incredible was true he drew a long breath then his hand closed upon the slender stem of his wine glass and he flung its contents down his throat and turned a mechani cal smile upon his insistent titianhaired neighbor he would have liked to have pushed back his chair and left the room left the house gone out somewhere in the dark quiet where he could digest this wretched and totally unexpected news he felt rather absurdly grieved like a small boy who has been playing with such a nice little bomb and the bomb unkindly exploding has knocked him silly and left him staring but to quit the big diningroom was of course impossible a torrent of jokes and conjecture would have fol lowed in his wake he wondered if anton knew that he wally camp had been hard hit by nita but one could tell nothing from fox face the old boy had his eyes riveted she who hesitates on the blonde beauty of the girl beside him how exquisitely fair she was his lilygirl he had often called her lily indeed he laughed shortly and his titianhaired acquaintance pinched his elbow and demanded the why say she complained youre actin like a reglar buckwheat fraid of strainin your vocal cords whos the joke on me he told her what i thought was a lily turned out to be a marigold youre drunk she told him and crossing a powdered arm over his black coatsleeve she seized his glass of cham pagne and drained it dry im fond of doin favors dont you lap up no more liquor tonight old thing the dinner was a long torment but all dinners end this one ended with an elaborate laughterpunctuated toast to the betrothed pair wallys lips refused to drink it over his halfraised glass he met nitas eyes they looked sick shes having a taste of her medi cine thought wally with hard exulta tion and theres more to come what a pretty fool is nita he too stood to give a toast his mouth wry and his eyes quick to catch nitas instant shrinking to the bridetobe he cried boister ously to nita the lovely the sweet the charming to nita the beautiful to beauty then the most potent thing in the worldexcept of course money to the ripple of amusement nitas cheeks stained pink and her eyes which had been appealing now turned darkly defiant v a lively negro orchestra was causing restless feet to scamper in the direction of the ballroom and in the mêlée wally free to escape at last was held back by a soft little hand on his arm he glanced down impatiently at cherrie wait for me out on the terrace wally she whispered by that privet hedge near the goatfollow blowing on a whistle i got somethin to tell you wally looked down at the girl dully he had always disliked cherrie re sented nitas friendship for this very blatant vulgar young person her clothes too were rather awful shriek ing loudly and unmelodiously for atten tion tonight the flaming scarlet of her frock outrivaled the painted cheeks and earmined lips however he nodded to escape the girls clutching lingers whereupon cherrie flew to nita who was chatting with her fiance crushing with restless fingers the little french flowers that weighted one end of her golden sash cherrie laughing caught at nitas arm come back here for nita in live minutes cutler she begged him please i want to tell her somethin secrets kindly hoof it but when anton left protesting watch in hand cherries round face grew very sober oh nita she protested softly how could you wallys hurt hurt nitas hand flew to her slender throat how where when i mean his hearts hurt you hurt it oh his heart said the girl coldly mens hearts are as easily mended as punctured tires not wallys yes wallys do you suppose if hed cared for me he would have jeered at me openly in front of everyone like he did just now thats because he loves you so cant you see nita you hurt him something terrible no murmured nita restlessly i dont think so hes like all the men we know cherrie turning like weather she who hesitates vanes to pretty faces he will forget me in a week hes crazy about you insisted cherrie stoutly i can prove it to you a swift turn of her head assured her that anton was returning down the long hall say you sit in here and keep your peepers open she thrust the surprised and resentful nita behind a screen of palms in the big diningroom which had previously been a shelter for the musicians and turned to greet anton with a bewitching smile times up cherrie wheres nita shes gone declared cherrie coolly to powder her nose she approached cutler so closely that the scarlet line of her bodice touched the black of his evening coat wont i do she asked saucily with her prac tised sidelong glance of course youll do smirked anton for an appetizer and bending he kissed cherrie full upon her provoking red lips you are a constant tempta tion cherrie he ran his thin purpleveined hand down the girls perfect rounded arm smiling at her with narrowed eyes then at the discreet cough of an en tering maid who explained he had an urgent telephone call he hastened away come on outa there cherrie ad dressed the palms the servants will be comin to clean off the dinner things say what dye think of your cutler now a perfect exhibition of senility nitas lips were actually grim once he ran his hand down my arm like that it was like a cold poisonous lizard creeping on human flesh honey he wouldnt be faithful to you for a week oh for heavens sake cherrie hush nitas nerves were jangled wires come out through the glass door down this path why i want you to listen behind that hedge thanks ive had enough eaves dropping nita youll regret it all your life if you dont i swear im doin somethin for you i wouldnt do for another livin soul honest kid itits somethin no one knows you just gotta listen you gotta nita wavered is it about wally yes i want then i shant go you will too nita gilmore you walk along this side of the privet hedge and sit on that stone seat for a few minutes im doin this for you nita you neednt said nita un graciously but she was curious and a little fearful she went nita could not see through the close privet hedge but her intent ears pres ently caught cherries breathless tones here i am wally too bad i kept you it doesnt matter said wally tone lessly nothing matters cherrie sighed you meanabout nita im rather cut up admitted wally briefly blow right between the eyes didnt expect it nita could hear cherries silk skirts rustle along the bench nearer to wally for her voice was lower i spose youll think im a pig to say im glad what wally was registering sur prise why how is that it gives little cherrie a chance at what a pause you said cherrie al most inaudibly another pause nita could fancy wallys astonished stare me he laughed shortly im not in the market my dear girl for matri she who hesitates mony or love or trifles of that sort did you think i was looking for con solation another pause how horribly exas peratingthis disembodied dialog nita craned her pretty head in every direction but the hedge was close and thick she could hear her own heart nowbeating high with a curious hope for a good while said cherrie in her low voice ive been absolutely nuts about you wally of course it was plain as paper that you wanted nita but if she wont have youim not so bad really wallyii would care a lot ill do anythingor be any thing to you honest dont be absurd cherrie you must have swiped an extra glass off that trick train of antons no no i care a lot wally ill do whatever you say then hunt up some excelsior and sleep off those extra cocktails and what nots im ashamed of you really pull ing such a skull oh wallee see here now cherrie this is all nonsense if youre in earnest im dead sorry but youll get over it as for mewell there is only one girl i hon estly care about making a fuss over was i should say another pause another rustle cherrie moving disconsolately away poor cherrie poor dear little cherrie she had done this for hernita had laid her heart open to be wounded v nita sped on golden feet back the path and around the hedge and to where wally sat near the statue of pan his head in his hands and the moonlight on his solitary figure she floated close to him and slipped a hand inside the crook of his elbow oh go way cherrie growled wally crossly very much as a sulky boy grunts go home towser to his faith ful follower but the hand remained and with it a faint perfume that penetrated wallys startled senses so that he raised heavy eyes to stare into nitas blue ones gor geous with happiness wally dear she whispered take me awaytonight now please dear i love you so for a long incredulous minute he stared then he took her by one hand and pulled her almost roughly over the bright lawn and out to the road where his blue redion stood why wait said wally vi late the following morning nita charming in blue chiffon negligee sit ting before the elaborate dressingtable in the elaborate bedroom of her elabo rate hotel suite tore open a blue en velope vickyscented just delivered

trailed over to an ivory desk and drew a sheet of monogrammed sta tionery toward her my dear cherrie you are not the only one who plays jokes fate plays them too i married wally early this morn ing and not two hours later his poor father still ignorant of wallys marriage was killed in stantly in an automobile accident while returning to his orange groves in southern california of course he has

your marriage with old anton do take care of him he looks so withered nita p s still you never can tell old anton may live to be a hundred another girl disappears instalment iii of our exciting serial the house of the missing recounts an amazing adventure that befell clayton and his partner moore dont miss this instal ment in the august th saucy storieson all newsstands august st a rogue in love byw carey wonderly when she was eighteen years old alice ainsley fell in love with maurice sutherland and in an im pulsive moment sat down and wrote to the actor expressing her admira tion and venturing to hope that some day she would appear in his company it was said of sutherland that during a transcontinental tour he left a string of broken hearts from the battery to the golden gate he was used to stage struck lovesick girls and alices letter was but one of many yet he enjoyed it and tucked it away with similar missives at the bottom of his trunk that summer alice appeared with the stock company in her home town play ing unimportant roles in a capable man ner and in september she arrived in new york with a scrapbook of notices and a burning desire to act her notices were good her wardrobe was excellent and alice ainsley was a very lovely young person attracting im mediate attention in gloomy theaters and busy offices september however is a bad month to be seeking engage ments when most of the companies are filled everyone said she was very fortunate to secure even an understudy and especially with such a star as maurice sutherland they didnt know how she had worked for that coveted position since her arrival in new york she had spent half her time between the theater where sutherland was rehearsing and the of fices of the management under whose direction he played the officeboy fell a victim to alices beauty and was ever willing to carry her card in to his boss but that gentleman refused to see miss ainsley because he had nothing to offer her at the theater it was pretty much the same mr suth erland didnt engage his company the doorman sent alice to the managerial suite yet in the end her patienceor persistencywas rewarded if you please sir its the same young lady again the doorman told suther land after the star had overheard an argument between the guardian of the portal and alice she wont take no for an answer she wants a job unseen by alice the actor studied the girls fresh young beauty noted her good clothes and decided she was well worth knowing his wasnt a fastidious soul perhaps he loved women because they were women rather than because they were lovely butalice ainsley was a lovely young woman with something of the haunting fragrance of springtime and lilacs about her and sutherland felt his pulse quicken as he looked hastily he wrote something on the back of his card and thrust it into the doormans hand give her this and say she is to take it to gladwyn the star said it was the open sesame and the next morning alice reported for rehearsal with the maurice sutherland company she was ordered to understudy diana devereaux the leading lady a creature too magnificent for words and yet too sensible ever to fall ill the other women in the company told alice that her engagement was a sinecureall she a rogue in love had to do was to report at the theater every night and draw her salary every week of course youll never get the op portunity to play the partdevereaux is too clever to give another actress a chance in her role but you must have known that darling when you signed for the job things might be worse you know and its a bad season still if youre ambitious the other girl looked at her and alice smiled gently come to think of it hadnt she achieved her ambition when she found herself on the same stage with maurice sutherland but if alice was without ambition she wasnt the sort of understudy that henry ross showed himself to be this young man who was known as hal to his friends understudied sutherland and had about as much chance of playing the part as alice had of reading dianas lines the knowledge was a bitter dose and because he found it so he thought that alice must suffer accordingly in her position misery loves company and hal ross sought alice in the theater and out of it an understudy is something like a squirrel in a cage he said once in spite of effort we never get anywhere if something were to happen to suther land i suppose the management would close the theater his words turned alice a little faint what could happen to sutherland she wanted to know what happens to all of us ross said there are germs everywhere laryngitisappendicitis but nothing will ever happen to him you can depend on it alice felt sorry for hal and we are told that pity is akin to love but suther land well all women fell down and worshipped him and alice was a woman scarcely twenty too as for maurice he hadnt forgotten alice even though he paid her little attention during the busy hours of re hearsal besides his greek profile and splendid voice he possessed an old fashioned gallantry which made him a picturesque figure on the stage and alice used to watch him from the wings with her heart in her throat and her soul in her eyes the other actresses watched him too though some of them laughed derisively afterward we get the thrilloh yes but devereaux will see to it that we dont get the man they said it was the first time that alice ever heard sutherlands named connected with dianas and never having a special liking for the leading lady she now avoided her ii because she was a wellbred young woman proud if shy alice ainsley tried to hide her infatuation for the actor from the rest of the company and even hal who was beginning to find a real satis faction in her society didnt dream that she was interested in the man rather than in the artist but sutherland knew of course he had the memory of her per sistent efforts to join the company to help him but there were other signs which led him to believe that here was another heart at his feet he liked the idea so long as women adored him his position in the theater was secure he especially liked alice she was so young and pretty and virginal once the business of readying the play was over even while he was promising himself a new affair of the heart diana deve reaux was preparing to separate maurice and alice she knew best how to do it without illusion herself knowing maurice sutherland for what he really was diana still retained an affection for the man and she didnt propose to stand a rogue in love idly by and see him make love to an other woman she could show an in terest in alice ainsley without creating comment alice was her understudy if you will come to my apartment tomorrow at four oclock i will go over your part with you line for line diana said sweetly in case you ever are called to play it you must be letterper fect else mr sutherland will be furious after all he is the star and we must work to please him so alice went to the devereaux apart ment not to please diana but for his sake she must learn everything she could against the possibility of some day appearing opposite to him in the play dianas home was small but very charming the thing which struck alice immediately was the quantity of photo graphs of maurice in the apartment from every wall on table mantel desk the actors likeness gazed back at one alice found it a little difficult to be per fectly natural with diana before the mournful handsome eyes of the star miss devereaux was businesslike yet charming they had reached the big scene in the second act when the tele phone bell rang merrily and the leading lady was forced to lay aside the script and answer the call immediately diana turned to alice with a frown marring her handsome features it is mr sutherland he is on his way up will you go in there for a moment and wait miss ainsley probably alice mistook her directions for when she pushed aside the curtain she found herself in a small alcove from which there was no escape indeed be fore she quite realized her surroundings sutherland was in the apartment his first act was to draw diana into his anns and attempt to kiss her the actress resisted him and even in that moment of pain alice caught herself wondering how any woman could re pulse maurice please dont murmured miss deve reaux and struggled to free herself he didnt understand and laughed with goodnatured tolerance what have i done now he demanded oh lord di youre forever raking a fellow over the coals tell mewhom have i been making love to now i dont know but somebody re torted diana coldly it is always some body of course laughed maurice i should be hanged and quartered for a rogue eh di you know deep in my heart there is only one woman and she is you i know you are inconstant wayward capricious diana replied im not ex actly jealous mauriceyou wrong me but i am disheartened at times with you a new face means a new love no not that either for it isnt love forget it my dear he laughed fall ing into a chair and lighting a cigarette in a long amber holder that is a purely masculine traitto sin and then forget it because it hap pens to be unpleasant diana said se verely there are some things i find very hard to forgetor forgive maurice all the girls you have made unhappy pretty inexperienced little moths even my own maid two years ago you cant deny it maurice im not going to he retorted lazily that is i take me or leave me but isnt it rather late in the day to be taking me to task this way diana what have you found out about me this time he laughed deep and low and there was vanity in the man take me or leave me this is i my dear presently she got rid of himas soon as she could she told alice afterward alice was as white as a sheet with scarcely voice enough to answer diana and when the leading lady said nothing a rogue in love more about rehearsing alice was dumbly grateful and hurried away however it didnt occur to her that miss devereaux had staged this scene especially for her benefit she was spared that agony alice went home to her boarding house and cried herself to sleep on the bed but at six oclock hal ross came to take her to dinner and for the first time in her life perhaps she was glad to see a man and showed it oh hal its you she said and held his hand so tightly that he caught himself dreaming extravagantly and blushed they were a great deal together dur ing the next week and it was only be cause his professional future was unde cided that hal restrained himself from declaring his love yet he believed that alice knew he cared for her and hoped she would wait let me get a chance at sutherlands part once ill show em all what i can do ross said setting his teeth and grip ping his hands now the managers wont trust me with a big part because ive never done anything important theres got to be a beginning to every thing but these theatrical moguls ap parently dont see it that way ive got to show them firstthough im given no opportunity to do that very thing well let me get my teeth in sutherlands rôle just once alice felt discouraged humbled chast ened i dont know whether i could play miss devereauxs part if i got a chance at it she said iii seeing alice and hal together so much and recalling the girls expression after she had listened to the scene be tween maurice and herself diana ceased to bother her head over the probability of the actors indulging in another love affair he might be smitten but alice was cured miss devereaux was mali cious enough to laugh at the idea of sutherland suffering from unrequited passion as for maurice the play had settled down on broadway for what looked like a healthy run and he found himself again with both time and the inclination to play around he had never forgotten alice ainsleys long and untiring efforts to secure a position in his company and it needed only hals attention to the girl in order to set the wheels in motion another man found her desirable there fore it was time for sutherland to act and how do you like your first new york engagement miss ainsley maurice said to her one night in the wings alice had a chair and was supposed to be studying miss devereauxs perform ance once had he spoken to her she would have blushed and stammered now she laughed a little at his question for it stirred her sense of humor i suppose it is a new york engage ment mr sutherland she told him still smiling though i have never set foot on the stage before an audience nor spoken a line out loud he laughed too an understudys job isnt very thankful is it he said however who knows when you will go on in the part we arent wishing miss devereaux any bad luck are we but youre quite prepared for any emer gency if i know the signs miss ainsley love the theater yes like new york ive seen really very little of the city with daily rehearsals but now it was his opportunity and he seized it i adore new york said suther land with the impressiveness which char acterized his love scenes i was born here have lived here pretty much all my a rogue in love life and yet i never grow tired of it never see enough of the old town un fortunately most of my friends arent of the same heart do you know what i should like to do miss ainsley he was smiling down into her eyes and while recognizing his striking per sonality he left her heart cold all the time she was thinking of dianas wordsof the silly girls he had made unhappyeven a maid since she didnt answer at once he repeated his question do you know what id like to do miss ainsley i cant imagine she faltered be cause she did guess what was in his mind id like to go on an exploring expedi tion with you sutherland cried his handsome head very close to hers id like to show you new yorklike to see it all over again with you may i he was as humble as a midvictorian lover alice had to recall the mans cool indifference and frank audacity in dianas apartment before she could be lieve her own ears what an actor he was a rogue he called himself im sorry she said with a fierce little sigh of relief but mr ross and i are going to explore new york to gether you see he is a provincial too mr sutherland and it will be rather fun uncovering things for ourselves thanks just the same he caught her up eagerly i know placesquaint picturesque corners of the town that the average fellow never discovers you cant say no miss ainsley when i beg so humblyi but no is exactly what alice did say though she added with a gentle smile im sorry as a matter of fact the stars attitude filled her breast with conflicting emotions since she doubted his sincerity even while his pleading stirred her deeply fancy maurice sutherland begging humbly yet he was ever the actor it required only alices refusal to add the requisite fuel to the flame of suth erlands passion and when he saw her leave the theater after the performance with hal ross maurice was satisfied again that he had found the one woman in all the world when diana met him he looked hag gard wildeyed like a man who had been drinking miss devereaux knew the signs once more maurice was in the throes of a great love but his life was made up of affairs of the heart and for the rest she believed he had met his match in alice then just when he faced the darkest hour when he seemed unable to work or play because of this girl sutherland came across alices letter almost two years old now at the bottom of his trunk he had always saved these billets doux finding them a pleasant help in trouble alices letter renewed his faith in himself gave him courage and led him to believe that her present attitude was merely a pose of course she cared for him what the coquette wanted was fire devotion proof to celebrate the hundredth perform ance of the play in new york there was a dance and supper given to the com pany after the show in the greenroom of the theater this handsome and spa cious apartment modeled after the greenrooms of shakespeares day in what was a new and very smart play house was located below the level of the stage and the principal dressing rooms opened off of it all the women wore their prettiest frocks for the party and there was an orchestra from one of the cabarets and a punch that would have been loudly acclaimed in prevolstead days their host was doing himself proud and friends crowded around to congratu late him but sutherland had eyes for only one person listened for only one a rogue in love voice but friends were right when they called this his night of nights maurice intended it to be that out of courtesy to his leading lady it was necessary for him to open the dance with diana but the ladys charms and the dreamy measures of the waltz left him cold and unmoved all the while he was watching alice ainsley alice who smiled so divinely in the arms of young ross she refused to look at him even while she must have felt his eyes upon her but maurice wasnt dis heartened it was all a game to bring him to her feet of course the dance stopped and an encore was demanded and given maurice and diana had held their places on the floor and now as the music started up again he claimed her for the extra diana eluded him and stepped back no you dont my dear fellow she said smiling no man may dance with me and flirt with another woman at the same time im not jealous understand maurice i merely refuse to be insulted before all these people take me over to the sofa and dont come near me again until you have recovered your senses very well no woman owned him he would take diana at her word there was a swagger to the man as he escorted his leading lady to the sofa and left her there hed show di a thing or two it was she who had cut the bonds be tween them now he was free to go to alicemorally free as well as legally so there was no reason to be advanced for refusing to dance with sutherland he was their star and he had danced with every woman in the company even the grand dame who was seventy and had grandchildren in the profession presently alice found herself in maurices arms his eyes on her face his voice low and tense in her ear if i were asked to name the loveliest creature here tonight he said and paused significantly waiting for her reply alice laughed and have you said that to each of us youve danced with thank you but i know know what he demanded eagerly she felt the color stealing into her cheeks i know you are merely being nice to me an unimportant member of your company then as he opened his lips in protest i know your repu tation as a ladies man mr sutherland and forgive you maurice looked sad why wont you take me seriously he said that wouldnt be fair alice didnt feel like smiling but she did so hoping to hold him at arms length by refusing to accept him solemnly i love you his touch was hot un yielding please mr sutherland she couldnt make a scene here before all these people i mean iti love you alice he cried cant you see it in my face read the truth in my eyes my speech you are driving me mad your indifference your flirtations with other menwith rosshave gotten under my skin and i can neither work nor sleep nor eat my friends notice this change be merci ful dear and say you carea little she shook her head gently im afraid i dont she said perhaps it would be better if i resign from the company i wont permit it then you must never talk like this again i love you so no i dont think you love me mr sutherland alice said meeting his eyes squarely this isnt love because mine is a new face because you dont know me as you do the others im sorry but you cant add my scalp to your your collection so that is it he cried his face a rogue in love ablaze you have heard rumors some one has been carrying tales raking among the dead ashes of the past it isnt that you dont love me its simply that youve listened to these lies and think you cant trust me no no she protested drawing away from him i will prove my love alice please mr sutherland people will hear you they are looking at us miss devereaux there on the divan you are mistaken and i dont care for youexcept as a great artist artist artist always you talk about my art as if there was nothing else as if i am less than man because i appear upon the stage i am man and lover your lover you shall see my dear i care so deeply and so much that i could shout my passion to the wind dont miss devereaux hal is looking there the music has stopped please let me go sutherland held fast to her arm there is something i must show you alice the musicians were silent the floor was clearing men and women gathered around the punch bowl and there was much laughing and talking and smoking for the moment alice saw neither diana nor hal it seemed to her that above all things a scene was to be avoided she knew that hal didnt like suther land whom he called a roué and a philanderer if any unpleasantness oc curred she and hal would be forced to leave the company and they couldnt afford that in the middle of the season with engagements few and far between thus it came about that alice suffered maurice to lead her to his dressing room it opened directly off the greenroom and with the door open she was within sight and sound of the party during the evening miss devereaux had held a small court in her room and other mem bers of the company invited special friends to their dressingrooms where it was popularly supposed a coveted brew was on tap really it was the sim plest thing to do and alice allowed sutherland to escort her to his apart ment the door was left wide there was only a light curtain between them and the outside world maurice sutherland lost no time but at once produced the love letter which alice had written him nearly two years ago when she recognized it her face turned crimson she didnt dream that he had saved itthat he even remem bered it since coming to broadway alice had learned that it was a common occurrence for a successful player espe cially a socalled matinée idol to receive a daily volume of notes from impulsive girls and women few actors saved such correspondence and fewer still accepted it seriously yet sutherland had kept her letter now do you still deny that you care he asked bending toward her tri umphantly instinctively she put out her hand for the missive it was just a foolish schoolgirl mash note she faltered i wrote it before i went on the stage at a time when i still believed believed what alice he asked tenderly i believed ineverything then i think she told him slowly if i havent retained my faith in every thing lies lies all of them he cried with a wide sweep of his arms as if he would annihilate armies youve got to believe in meyou must believe when i say i love you no dont it is useless you must believe his voice rose to a hysterical note i would die for youi mean it alice without your a rogue in love love life isnt worth living unless you say that you believe wait dropping the letter on his dressing table sutherland brushed aside the cur tain and rushed from the dressingroom alice was about to follow him when she noticed the letter and delayed her escape in order to claim that why not it was hers her hand went out and cov ered it a second later it was in the bosom of her gown against her heart but sutherland had returned she had delayed her departure too long sutherland was white as a sheet his hand in the pocket of his dinner coat trembled visibly when he withdrew it alice saw that his fingers gripped a small revolver at first she was frightened speechless she could neither move nor cry out and then she recognized the weapon it was the pistol which they used in the play and sutherland had gone to the propertyroom a dozen yards away to secure it he stood with his back to the door and placed the revolver over his heart do you believe me now he asked with a strange smile on his lips do you believe i am in earnest that i love you that i am willing to die for my love in order to convince you alice i am on the threshold of eternity and you must believe dont punish me for past sins dear dont let false pride stand in our way to happiness i love you you care she was very sure of the pistolrec ognized even the dent in it where miss devereaux once had dropped it on the brick pavement it was loaded with blanks of course im sorry but i dont care mr sutherland she said slowly yes i cared onceor it was infatuation that is when i wrote that silly letter later when i came to new york and secured this engagementyes i cared then too if i have changed it is your fault once i was too inexperienced to separate the actor from the man now i have met a real man and i know an actor when i meet one meaning me yes and the real manross his lips were dry his hands all atremble after a pause alice answered yes i love hal ross he is real while you you are acting even now her words brought the blood to his cheekshe was scarletangry ashamed routed his eyes flashed hatred in that mo ment then he pointed the revolver and fired the report of course was quite genu ine in the other room men and women ceased their chatter turned and then crowded to the door of the stars dress ingroom sutherland had fallen across the sill and there was a dark ever widening stain on the bosom of his white shirt she has killed him it was dianas voice high and shrill she didnt know how it happened but alice found herself in hals arms it was the prop gun the one we use in the play and filled with blanks alice said in toneless accents several of the men were on their knees beside sutherland who with eyes open had remained silent since the re port he has been shot it wasnt a blank announced these men get a doctor god knows how serious the wound is iv after they had pouredbrandy between his lips and just before the physician ar rived maurice sutherland roused him self sufficiently to make a statement it was the property gun used in the play and i shot it myself miss ains ley had nothing to do with it andi a rogue in love didnt know it was loaded with car tridges then he lapsed into unconsciousness naturally everyone wanted to wait to hear the doctors verdict they with drew to the greenroom and whispered together in corners miss devereaux shut herself in her dressingroom and it was there alice and hal ross found her a few minutes later there is something miss ainsley wants to say to you announced the young man looking very strong and handsome standing there beside his sweetheart she wants to tell you what really occurred in the dressingroom be tween mr sutherland and herself dianas eyes were cold and dry but alice spoke quickly frankly you have said that i shot mr suth erland i didnt youve heard him ad mit that and state that the pistol was in his own hand mr sutherland had been making love to me and ii re fused to take him seriously he asked me to come to his dressingroom he had something to show me it was a love letter written years ago by a silly schoolgirl to a great actoryes i wrote it to him i told mr sutherland that since then i had changed and now it was the actor i admired while the man in my life was was hal here i told mr sutherland that he really didnt care for meit was simply a case of new face new fancy but he swore that unless i believed him and cared in return he would kill him self he had disappeared a moment be fore and returned with the pistol i recognized it of course and i thought it was loaded with blanks as it is in the play when he turned the gun upon himself ii didnt stop him be cause i thought he was still acting her voice died away hal caught the sound of a sob in her throat if he dies it wont be my fault but i feel that i can never be happy again dianas brow cleared you are a sensible girl she cried and i hope you and mr ross will be very happy as for maurice she dug her teeth into her lip to keep back the tears he mustnt die she moaned then the doctor came with his verdict mr sutherland is ready to go home a few days rest and then he is a very fortunate man happily the bullet struck the steel rib of the corset he was wearing and instead of a tragedy he has merely a flesh wound mr sutherland is asking for you miss devereaux neither maurice sutherland nor di ana devereaux appeared in the leading roles of the play for the remainder of the week and so it came about that their understudies got their chance and alice and hal covered them selves with glory indeed the manage ment liked them in the parts so well that they were put under contract to head the company which was to open in chicago everythings so wonderful hal whispered alice theres not a colud except the mystery of the shooting for there always were blanks in that pistol dear how that single cartridge came to be there it was diana put it there hal told her miss devereaux saw you and sutherland go into his dressingroom and then she disappeared into hers which is just next door and listened she heard what maurice said and knew the man well enough to divine what he meant to do before he could get the gun she slipped out of her room and changed the blank for the real thing im sure sutherland knows and has for given her she was half mad with jeal ousy and was determined if she couldnt have him no one else should since it was just a flesh wound the whole inci dent is closed then he drew her into a sheltered doorway and kissed her saug heartbreak bydorothy dow who shall recall when the charm is gone

breaking a young outcast from society goes back home and finds but one friend the most popular flapper of the town how she restores his good name and his faith in himself is told in joel townsley rogerss dramatic novelette more deathly than carbolic in the august th number of saucy stories the radio roadster byhoward rockey full of surprises as camp carefree was no one imagined it would develop the thrill provided by its private radio station that summer evening carefree is one of those exclusive outdoor communities which has become a rendezvous for those who like to rough it in luxury beautifully situated in the foothills of the adirondacks it is the haven of the neveridle rich who prefer privacy at any price and seek sport as an antidote for the strain of a social season the night when it all took place was a bit too pleasant for remaining in cozy bungalows or the roomy community clubhouseat least it seemed so to the more active set a gay little group in flannels and sport togs was gathered about a fire of pine boughs but alicia gray and ted van horn strolled across the lawn to the little radio building in an effort to amuse them the wireless operator tuned in on several broadcasts but the two soon tired of listening to the start of a stupid lecture and parts of a concert or two then alicia asked the man to get nick brewsters pretentious place nes tling under the mountain at the other end of the valley and in due time doris brewsters voice came clearly through the ether nicks off somewhere in his road ster she said as alicia adjusted the headpiece over her bobbed locks im sure hes up to mischief and i thought that perhaps he might have driven over to carefree if he comes ill send him home laughed alicia im tired of flirting with the husbands of my friends by the wayspeaking of flirting doris went on did you hear that car men castleton arrived on the colosi tania yesterday no answered alicia with a twinkle in her eye surely you dont suppose that nicks gone off to meet her hardly doris admitted with amusement but you know you never can tell with these opera singers most of the really nice men i know have lost their heads if not their hearts to her at one time or another oh come on growled ted van horn shell chatter all night if you let her cut off and lets pick up some jazz from one of the new york roofs ten minutes later they were toddling on the big outdoor dance floor as the syncopation of the orchestra from the glitter garden sounded from the gigan tic amplifier the camp had installed at intervals the music changed when the radio operator sought variety of pro gram and the novelty of trotting to strains from miles away rather appealed to the crowd the sensation was almost like that of possessing magic ears for the receiving range of the station was more powerful than is permitted by the letter of the law but enforcement agents of every sort gave carefree a wide berth and many obnoxious laws were deadletters at the camp hence the sound waves brought them news and amusement from astonishing distances the radio roadster but after a little time the floor be came deserted and the couples seated themselves about the fire to enjoy a ciga rette or perhaps a cocktail from surrep titious flasks then enchantingly out of the night caught up by the tall antennas came the notes of a song which held them spell bound it was sung in a soft sensuous voice with wonderful clearness and sweetness and at first they thought the singer must be close at hand but as they listened they realized otherwise it did not originate anywhere about the camp but was coming by radiophone now it grew louder and wilder and more abandoned and as they recognized the air and its orchestral accompaniment the spell was broken a phonograph someone laughed for a moment i thought the voice was realbut its only a castleton record fillex de cadix perhaps nicks playing it to cele brate the return of the beautiful lady alicia whispered to van horn with a wink but even though it was unmistakably a talkingmachine a silence fell over the group and they listened with genuine pleasure then the orchestration sud denly ceased and the song itself seemed to grow more distinct and more ap pealing thats no phonograph said evelyn duars it must be castleton herself theyve shut off the machine and shes taken up the song nonsense objected tom trueman castletons abroad maybe shes singing in the salon of a steamer at sea suggested another absurd objected a third she landed yesterdaycame in on the same steamer with carter harrington hes been sketching in italy ever since may you know but as they sat there speculating an other aria came to their ears from the amplifier this time there was no mis taking castletons own notes they could even discern through the ether a laughing remark in the divas rich tones although whatever she said was unin telligible castleton then began a little chanson that alicia had heard her render at sev eral studio parties and which she knew the singer had never recorded for the needle discs she said as much to van horn and he nodded reminiscently once she had sung it to himnot only with her eyesbut with all of her artis tryand he had almost made a senti mental fool of himself for several minutes they were thrilled by the loveliness of the lyric wafted to them through the silence from some un known source the words were tender and tearcompellingmoving as only castleton could make thembut the song suddenly ended in a shrill pierc ing scream immediately after came a terrified flood of highpitched feminine words too rapidly uttered for anyone to grasp a masculine voice shouted something wildly a sharp crackperhaps a pistol shotpunctuated the cry then a deeper voice called help and finally a jumble of letterswxadbut the voice was silenced before the garbled combination could be understood and there was not another sound ii in an instant the campers were crowding the doorway of the camp radio office everyone was asking questions at once but the operator announced that the sending had been shut off cant you tell where it came from he was asked he shook his head not exactly he confessed so far as they knew i wasnt receiving the message they were only broadcasting and i got it just as i caught the other the radio roadster things youve heard this valleys full of amateur stations but you surely have an idea it was insisted vaguely he admitted it must have come over a threehundredmeter wavelength or lessso it couldnt be far away but i havent any means of figuring what station is meant by those letters although an official register would tell well why bother shrugged court ney blair somebodys trying to pull a joke on us everybody knows we pick up waves in the evening and theyre hoping well fall for the trick but alicia gripped van horns arm and whispered excitedly theres something about it that makes me feel all creepy she told him oh cant he catch them again and find out whether anythings wrong ive been trying the operator said but they seem to be dead alicia gave a horrified shudder but van horn reassured her he only means in a radio sense ted explained he cant catch any more waves from them just wait a minute the operator suggested ill broadcast a bit myself and ask whether anyone else heard what we did then as they stood about him he be gan to send his spoken queries through the air in every direction to be caught by countless radio sets in the valley and up the mountainside a few moments ago in his efforts to pick up the song more distinctly he had adjusted his loops to intercept it to better advantage that experiment had made him believe that the singers voice came over the waves from the north consequently he started to volley questions diagonally to the east and west of the point where he suspected the musical message had emanated soon he began to be flooded with replies and it was some moments before he could establish order out of chaos in his receiving set but gradually one by one he commenced to receive answers from various spots over the country side the song and the supposed shot and the partial sos had all been distin guished by houses equipped with anten na for miles around and the consensus of opinion was that the alarm was a hoax but the operator told van horn that police headquarters at west farming ton was now taking a hand in the hunt the campers were in a flurry of ex citement but the wireless operator shut off his amplifier so that incoming news reached no ears but his own dick duars and emlyn warren were for getting out their plane and soaring over the valley in search of what they might see but the others argued that such a proceeding was hopeless espe cially at night when the roads could hardly be seen at the altitude the two would have to maintain nevertheless the men started off for the hangars and ted van horn gave a surprised exclamation as he glanced at the memo the wireless man was writing on his pad the chief of police had traced the mysterious signal letters and advised the camp operator of the name of the man from whose set they had comeif the call was genuine without a word to the others van horn led alicia aside and told her what he had seen the name the operator had penciled was that of carter har rington whose bachelor studiobunga low was perched halfway up the moun tain not twenty miles from carefree as the crow flies ted alicia said as she gripped his arm i wish i knew whether nick has gone home somehow i cant help link ing nick with anything that concerns carmen castleton just suppose she the radio roadster really was with harrington and nick should run across them there might be the deuce of a row van horn surmised i think ill call up and ask if he is there ill use the telephone so as not to muddle in with all the radio racket thats going on in the air he did and it seemed to him that he could never persuade doris brewster to stop her chattering he gave her no hint of his purpose in phoning and from her conversation he was certain she did not know of the excitement at the camp she had not used their radio since talk ing with aliciaand nick had not come home doris was quite peevish about it because she had guests for bridge so the circumstance only made van horn more suspicious and apprehensive alicia he confided when he hung up i dont relish this business at all you know harrington and nick have never liked each otherand of course you know that nick likes carmen a lot im going to get out my roadster and beat it to harringtons just as fast as i can get there righto alicia commended its the only thing to doalthough i cant believe that nick could be such a fool nor i echoed van horn but i mean to find out of course we must said alicia and laughed when he looked at her with sud den disapproval now dont imagine for a minute that youre going alone theres no use of your arguinggo and get your car iii ten minutes later alicia and van horn snugly wrapped in polo coats were shooting recklessly down the wind ing road which leads from the plateau of the camp to the valley below although their ears could not catch the disturbance in the ether it was rippling and pounding with radio waves which were broadcasting the fact that a crime had been committed within the community message after message hurled out for all to pick up at their home stations gave warning that a crim inal might be lurking nearby and urged every citizen to join in the radio posse then in pursuit of the supposed fugitive but the only anxiety the two in the roadster experienced concerned what might have happened at harringtons studio and each felt a lurking fear that they might arrive there too late even then without their knowledge a squad of cycle police was roaring toward the scene from west farming ton overhead too a graceful shadowy biplane soared and dipped as it watched for a possible trial at escape by an aerial route van horn was making his car eat up the smooth roads taking shortcuts where he dared and detouring where he did not it was only about ninethirty when they left the camp and for almost an hour he hardly slackened the pace at which he set out once or twice they were hailed when passing some cottage but neither ted nor alicia responded to these calls now before halfpast ten they were climbing the final stretch which would bring them to harringtons house al ready its shadowy outlines were plainly silhouetted against the silverhued sky and a sudden sense of caution came to van horn duck down in the car alicia and keep covered up he shouted against the roar of the wind but she only shook her head and laughed at him attend to your driving and never mind meor youll run over the cliff i have my automatic and im perfectly able to use it that ended the conversation and a few minutes later the two of them leaped from the machine as it stopped with a the radio roadster grinding of brakes in front of the bungalow a light gleamed through the leaded panes of the window and streamed bril liantly through the open door yet save for the noises of the night the place was as still as a tomb even in the anxiety of the moment van horn blamed himself for permitting the girl to come but he could not help admiring her fearless courage in fact she was so impetuous that he was obliged to seize her roughly and thrust her aside to prevent her entering the place before him then he crossed the veranda at a bound and stepped alone through the doorway of the spacious livingroom obviously the police had not arrived and none of the neighbors appeared to have ventured up there the easels and furniture of the familiar room seemed to be undisturbed and so far as van horn could see the apartment was deserted with his gun clutched tightly in his fingers he called out loudly but no one answered him and alicia crowded be hind him into the room over his shoul der she caught sight of the feet and legs of a man protruding from under a table and involuntarily she uttered a horri fied scream van horn stepped forward quickly and kneeling beside the body found himself peering into the features of car ter harrington at a glance he saw that the artist was dead and the blood was oozing from a jagged hole in his forehead clearly there was nothing they could do for him and van horn with some apprehension began to search the place quite possibly they might be watched and he was afraid for alicia but if she felt any timidity it was not apparent with a businesslike air she examined the room while van horn peered into the alcove where harringtons bed was made up and then satisfied himself that the kitchen was empty he found no vestige of any intruder the two were alone with the corpse and the murderer was gone if carmen cas tleton had been there not even a trace of the exotic scent she used was notice able but the lid of the phonograph cabinet was raised and on the dial was set the fillex de cadiz record in mute evidence that the signal of distress had come from this very room harrington was dressed in a dinner jacket and a polo cap lay upon the rug but the studio was dusty and despite the open door the air was damp and stale no trunk or other luggage was to be found and it seemed as though the bun galow had not been occupied since the owners departure for europe some months before nor was there a car parked outside anywhere near the building van horn looked at alicia with a hopeless expression i guess im pretty sad as a detective he confessed rue fully who was herehow they got hereand where theyve gone is much too much for me and for me conceded alicia but a bullet made that woundand poor carter has no gun she turned away from the gruesome object on the floor and went curiously to the table where a radio set was mounted its clicking she said in surprise the varnished surface on which the double throwswitch rested was blistered and burned and if it had not been for the wound in harringtons forehead van horn might have supposed that an electric shock had killed him whether the dead man or someone else had been receiving or sending ted could not tell but he saw that the switch was now barely touching the receiving amplifier he pushed it all the way over and put the headpiece to his ears the radio roadster instantly the hissing and grinding from the troubled ether hurt his drums as he adjusted the keys van horn wondered whether the murderer had listenedin and after catching the hue and cry from the air had hurriedly de parted but now he wanted first to re port what he had found and not know ing the police signal he tried to get the camp theyre still babbling like fury van horn told alicia and this sets not powerful enough for me to drown them out what are you going to do she asked coming nearer to him and care fully avoiding contact with the corpse beneath the table explain to the operator at care free he answered but as he tried to call a voice came from the veranda perhaps you can explain to me just as well said a khakiclad cyclecop as he stepped through the door and covered the man at the radio set with his pistol iv soaring overhead and sweeping the moonbathed valley with a powerful pair of night glasses dick duars and emlyn warren were keeping a sharp lookout but although they flew as low as they dared the messages they wirelessed back to carefree were all discouraging yet because of the very hopelessness of the task they had undertaken they would not abandon their flight then suddenly duars uttered an ex clamation which caused warren to peer over the side as the others words came to him through the speakingtube faint ly discernible far below they could see a tiny object scurrying down the moun tain road like a frightened insect ahead of it projected two tiny feelers of light and the man with the glasses knew it was a motorcar but it was not the headlights which attracted his attention it was rather a curious flashinggreen and yellow glows like those which ema nate from a firefly in the air emlyn he called excitedly who evers in that car is taking bigger chances than we are its crazy enough for us to tempt a fall but hes running straight for the devil if he keeps up that pace along those fool roads and in another instant both aviators knew the meaning of those firefly flashes that cars equipped with a radio aerial duars went on its picking up all our chatter as it goes along then he flashed the news of his dis covery back to the station at carefree from where it was shot out again to police headquarters for the plane to land and investigate on that tree studded terrain was impossible but or ders were already humming over tele phone wires to the police substation at the foot of the mountain that started a trio of motorcycle officers in the direc tion ofthe southerly mountain road and the men in the plane kept on the alert for another view of the car for a time it disappeared from view amid the trees and turnings of the hill side but once more it emerged in the moonlight and again the telltale flashes came from it duars leaned over the side of the bas ket and dropped something from the plane toward the earth far below them it flared and as it did so a parachute opened launching a group of flarelights but as it happened the motorcycle po lice had no need of tills aid in finding the fugitive car shortly after eleven oclock they came upon it its radiator was crushed in like an accordeon where it had collided with a giant boulder at a turn in the road its lamps were shat tered and the wires erected upon the windshield were badly tangled and broken the aviators suspicion had been the radio roadster correct and the driver of the machine had evidently been listening to the repeated volleys of air waves as he raced along in any event the occupant of the wrecked automobile had competely dis appeared what had become of him was a mystery even though the owner ship of the battered machine was not in fact the police had been suspicious of its identity from the first receipt of news about its radio equipment now they did not even need to consult the license tags to recognize the once smart roadster as the yellow speed car in which nick brewster rushed about the country the officers knew that brewster was a radio enthusiast and besides they had seen him at the wheel earlier in the evening th accidentif it was onegave a different complexion to the matter how ever the course of the car was known not only because of the plane but be cause the only way it could have come was past the harrington place the question was where was brewster then one of the policemen tumbled upon his side and uttered a howl of pain his companions sprang to his aid and more enraged than hurt he held up something soft which he had found in the road it was a satin slipper with a glistening rhinestone buckle and in step ping upon its high french heel the man had turned his ankle the roadster was quickly forgotten and the officers turned their attention to a search for the cinderella whose shoe they had found it was but the work of moments before their search lamps re vealed a feminine form in the under brush by the side of the road the unconscious woman was clad in a badly torn evening gown and her hands and face were cruelly lacerated but the thing which startled the officers most as they lifted her tenderly was the fact that her arms and ankles were se curely bound strips had been torn from the evening wrap which partly enveloped her and these bonds had been drawn so tightly that she could not move some of the same soft material was thrust into her mouth and a knotted handkerchief held the rude gag in place in one corner were the initials of carter harrington v alicia and ted van horn had very little trouble in substantiating their story to the police who had rushed in upon them at the harrington bungalow the sergeant in charge would not permit ted to call carefree by radio he wished the room to await the coroners coming precisely as it was but a tele phone to the camp had promptly vouched for them and the fact that they were not present when the murder was committed neither of them desired to take the officer into their confidence regarding nick brewster but on the plea that something might be learned there he readily consented to go with them to the brewster home so the sergeant left a detail in charge of the studio and the corpse and bundling into teds ma chine they started down the mountain both alicia and ted were more than dismayed at the turn affairs had taken they feared that unless his friends acted quickly nick would become in volved even they had been somewhat doubtful despite their affection for him and if left to the tender mercies of a blundering rural police force van horn imagined nicks chances would be slim indeed instead of resenting their eagerness to help in solving the crime the sergeant appeared to welcome their wish to co operate however he was not quite sat isfied that their purpose was not prompted by some ulterior motive the radio roadster which was another reason why he felt it just as well to keep them with him for the present at least but at last teddys roadster roared up the road and halted outside the hedge of the brewster cottage as it came to a stop the sergeant leaped out quickly and ran toward two motorcycles which had just come to a halt alicia and van horn were at his heels and alicia caught ted by the arm as she saw the officers lift the form of a woman from the side seat of one of the cycles it is carmen she whispered and then at a sign from the sergeant fol lowed the little party into the house doris brewster met them in the richly furnished hall with a mixture of amaze ment and resentment in her eyes in the far corner her guests looking up from their cards rose and rallied to their hostess side im sorry maam the officer said but there has been an accident and this lady needs a doctor as quick as we can get one i dont wish to seem heartless doris said rather coldly but there is no physician here why dont you keep on to camp carefreetheres a splen did dispensary there then she caught sight of alicia com ing through the door and at a gesture from her looked questioningly into the face of the injured woman for a mo ment her body stiffened and her eyes flashed unpleasantly but a whispered remark from alicia quieted the outburst that threatened carry her into my own bedroom she said to the police and a few mo ments later carmen was lying on doris bed slowly the divas dark eyes opened and looked about and a little shudder ran through her slender frame alicia and doris and ted remained in the background and the three from the bridge table stood outside in the hall so carmen regaining consciousness saw only the police and a faint smile of re lief came over her pale features is he caught she breathed anxious ly and again the look of terror distorted her facean expression of haunted loathing that was pitiful to see who asked the sergeant sharply and all of them strained their ears mr brewster of coursewho else she said with arching eyebrows and then the tears gushed from her eyes and her body shook with emotion i never knew the man could be such a brute with a convulsive catch of her throat doris turned away and alicia led her quickly out of the room but van horn listened eagerly with nervously twitch ing fingers as the officers pressed her for further information at first she could not give it consecu tively but piece by piece the sergeant drew the story from her on the steamer she and harrington had become secretly engaged and had motored up from new york to the highview hotel they had arrived only that evening and had dined there to gether without revealing their matri monial plans then in the early eve ning harrington had engaged a car from the garage at the inn he had wished her to see the studiobungalow and to make plans with her for its early alteration what became of the hired car the sergeant asked suspiciously for some thing about the woman appeared to set him thinking mr harrington sent the chauffeur away and told him to come back for us at one oclock she answered simply and then we talked for a little and after a while i began to look at his records it was pleasant to find that he had all of my own and just for fun i put one on the phonograph then as he knew i had been intrigued by the wireless on the radio roadster shipboard he connected his radio set and we listened to that for a time but you sang yourself the sergeant persisted of course she said with a weary smile and mr harrington sent it out broadcasting is it they say then what happened demanded the sergeant carmen castleton seemed to shrink under his steady gaze must i answernow she pleaded turning her face away i am hurt and oh so tired ill call a doctor as soon as youve told me the truth said the officer bru tally but if you want this man to be caught youll have to tell it now and as he spoke he bent over the bed and with a quick movement snatched a long stiletto from carmens sheer silk stocking for a moment she stared at the glittering blade with a curious light in her eyes then she burst into a hysterical laugh that was horrible to hear a toy mr harrington bought while he was in italy she smiled with a shrug of her shoulders who would have thought i should use it how broke in the sergeant threat eningly to stab mr brewster when he tried to kill me as he did mr harrington she screamed at the officer a moan from the hallway told ted that doris had heard but forgetting her he stepped brusquely to the ser geants side but you didntwhere is he van horn demanded and looking up car men castleton recognized him how should knowor care she answered with flashing eyes i wish i had struck deeperthen he would not have carried me off in that terrible car i then she became hysterical and even the sergeant realized that further ques tions were useless vi alicia remained in the bedroom with carmen while one of the officers tele phoned for dr hazeltine but the others were standing in the big hall talking in hushed tones when the outer door opened and nick brewster walked in his face was smeared with grime and blood and from the slashed left sleeve of his gray tweed coat a darkred stain had spread he seemed weak and dazed and stared at the group before him with perplexity in his eyesan un comprehending glassy look in which consternation was mingled with horror his wife cried out in agony at the sight of him and the sergeant stepped forward to take his arm mr brewster he began you are now just a moment officer van horn butted in youre surely not going to arrest a man on the testimony of a delirious womanand besides its only fair to let mr brewtser tell his storywith the knowledge that what ever he says may be used against him he emphasized the words deliber ately and despite his half stupor nick seemed to sense their import im afraid i cant tell you much he began wearily and staggered toward a chair it seems more like a nightmare than something ive been through van horn poured a stiff drink from the decanter on the table and brewster gulped it down then he fished nerv ously for a cigarette before he tried to go on you know he said to the officer that id just equipped my car with a highpowered radio set i didnt know whether or not it would work as i hopedand i was eager to test it to night if it succeeded he turned to van horn id have made a fortune the radio roadster for i meant to send from the car as well as receivelater on his fingers trembled as he struck a match but controlling himself with an effort he managed to continue i knew the ether would be full of waves and in order to take advantage of the higher altitude i ran the old roadster up past harringtons place he paused as he felt the tenseness in the room and grew conscious of the curious almost doubting eyes that were concentrated upon him oh yes he said with a bitter laugh i heard carmens songsthrough the radio on my windshield at first and later with my own ears when i stopped before the bungalow natu rally i was surprised but i thought id drop in a moment and went up on the porch carter was at the table with the headpiece of his set clamped to his ears and carmenhe paused and looked toward his wifecarmen was standing with her back to me listening to some dance music that was coming through harringtons amplifier no one spoke and after a nervous swallow he tossed away his cigarette and went on then a terrific explosion came di rectly behind me harrington cried out and sprang to his feetyelling for help and shouting out his call letters then i heard another shotfor it must have been thatand carter crumpled up in a heap i was halfway into the room and carmen turned on me like some maddened tigress i saw her reach for her stocking and i caught a flash as her hand shot outand she stuck a long knife into mehere he indicated the arm which he could not move and the growing stain on his clothes but only the sergeant broke the silence what then i dont know answered harring ton lamely i went coldand the next think i knew i was halfway down the mountainside lying in the middle of the roadway if a car had passed it might have run over me and finished me then and therebut after a time i got to my feetand wellsomehow im here for a moment he sat staring at them then he rose and held out his hands appealingly do you mean that you dont believe methat you thinki killed harrington he cried incredu lously you cant think im a rotter like that and he sat weakly back in his chair but the sergeant of police was totally unconvinced he had carmen castle tons story and this tale seemed silly to him mr brewster he said somewhat gruffly youre under arreston the charge of homicideassault and bat teryand attempted abduction of the lady in the next room vii dr hazeltine had finished dressing brewsters wound and had confirmed carmens statement that she had caused it with the stiletto the police sergeant retained carmen was sleeping at last in doris boudoir and mrs brewster herself was sobbing in another room with alicia by her side nick sat in an easy chair in the dark ened livingroom while ted van horn stood by the hearth peering specula tively into the dying fire brewster did not even seem aware of the fact that the others had gone and he paid no attention to the man in uniform smok ing a pipe as he lounged on a bench at the opposite side of the room van horn and the others from the camp had tried to arrange for bail but it had been promptly refused and nick remained in custody although still in his home it was after four and at any the radio roadster time the police motor would come to take him to west farmington for a hearing scheduled for seven nicks head was swathed in bandages and his face was covered with plasters but the physician had said that the knife wound was not a serious one the hurt on the back of his head might have been caused by a blowor what was more likely the sergeant thought when he was hurled from the car from which carmen had also been thrown of course the dust and dirt which lit tered the bungalow would afford ample opportunity for the taking of finger prints but nothing much could be done for the remainder of the night and everyone was impatient for the coming of the dawn a grandfathers clock in the corner struck the half hour and nick aroused himself from his trance with a start outside they could hear the arrival of a car and the tread of heavyshod feet on the porch van horn swung about on his heel with a sigh of relief at least it would be easier when they were on their way counsel were motoring from town with all speed and before nightfall nicks case would be in good handsyet van horn stared at his friend with a sort of pity not unmixed with a feeling of keen disappointment then the door opened and an officer walked in with dick duars and emlyn warren still in their airplane togs say duars began catching sight of van horn emlyn and i took a car after we put up the flyer and went over to look at the wreck of nicks radio sending roadster and we found some thing which may be interesting as he spoke another officer came into the room pushing before him a sullen looking man in a blue serge suit and a nondescript cap this bird was nosing about nicks busted buggy as though that wireless attachment tickled him stiff cant a man look at a freak thing like that without getting pinched for it the stranger demanded surlily a cat may look at a king old top duars reminded him but snooping about smashed speedcars in the middle of the night requires an explanation the officer in charge of the man turned to the sergeant and came to a salute says hes on a hike for his vacation the policeman explained but he hasnt any kit or camp whats your name the sergeant demanded other questions followed nick seemed hardly cognizant of what was taking place with a bored air as though resenting the intrusion van horn tapped restlessly with his foot upon the fender before the fire the prisoner seemed belligerent and was somewhat confused in his answers to the sergeants questions at one of them a smile passed momentarily over van horns face then he began kick ing the fender again this time what he had hoped for happened suddenly its a damned lie yelled the man who claimed to be on a hike i didnt didnt what asked van horn casually looking him full in the face with a glint of amusement in his eyes what you just kicked out on that iron in the international code came the angry reply you think youre a smart alec dont you at least i suspected that you might understand that code van horn said meaningly and i was right at that now suppose you take your hands out of your pockets what for snarled the man in the cap because i want to see your right one van horn told him if you dont show it to me ill ask the officer well look at it shouted the pris the radio roadster oner furiously whats the matter with it the memory of a burned and blis tered surface beneath the throwswitch of harringtons radio set impressed itself upon teddy van horns mind he seemed to picture this man throwing that switch in haste as he heard the aerial posse crying at his heels and in a flash he saw how the murderer of harrington had burned the fingers and palms of his right band by carelessly exposing it to the heavily charged switchwires its a marvel van horn mused aloud how you escaped with your life when you ran mr brewsters car into that boulder the guys crazy snickered the man in the cap turning to the sergeant with a look of hatred smouldering in his eyes he thinks im not going to think any longer van horn promised him and walked quickly to the door of doris boudoir he knocked once then pushed it open and called out in a quiet tone carmencan you step in here a moment please even nick was watching him won deringly and there was a dead pause until carmen castletons figure was framed in the doorway for an instant she stood there like a statue her hands clutching the frame and then the color fled from her cheeks and her scream aroused the women in the adjoining room oh she moaned wringing her hands it is too terrible i never dreamed that he would follow me he threatenedbut it seemed so droll i could not think him serious she swayed and seemed about to faint and the man in the cap sprang forward like some trapped animal in a desperate attempt to escape but the two policemen had him handcuffed in an instant and his gesture had revealed to them the hidingplace of the missing automatic their first hasty search had failed to find suppose said van horn quietly to carmen suppose you tell the sergeant just who this fellow is the wireless operator from the ship she explained drawing away from the struggling man at first he was so nice and told me all about his wireless machines then he tried to make love to me and i told him i was engaged oh how could i know he would try to do such a thing the foolish things he said were too absurd to believe with a moan of remorse she ran across the room and threw herself upon her knees at brewsters feet nick she pleaded miserably how can i ever explain of course you wouldnt kill poor carter and carry me off dont brewster soothed her and put both hands on the shaking shoul ders as she buried her head in his lap dont say any more about it carmen then looking up at his wife standing with alicia in the doorway of the other room he smiled at her happily and said very quietly look after her wont you doris she needs you her friend the burglar byparker howard with a hope less shake of her blonde bobbed head doris lawton reluctantly hid the fascinating stylebook in the drawer of her type writer desk it alluringly offered the latest fifth avenue fashions direct from designer to you without the trouble and expense of a shopping trip to the city doris sighed as she assaulted the keys of her machine she copied her notes mechanically with never a thought of the sense of what she was typing its positive cruelty to females to offer flapper finery so reasonably she mused especially when said females dont happen to have the price doris did not happen to have any where near that sum shoes and stock ings and silken thingsdresses and par asolshats and handkerchiefsand a vanitycase doris needed them all here it was july and she had been able to save almost nothing against the sunshiny days of her approaching vaca tion of course the three weeks salary she would receive before leaving the office would pay her board and rail road fare to and from the modest resort she had chosen but there was prac tically nothing for clothesand without clothes doris felt she might just as well stay at home for months she had practiced count less little economies and the strictest selfdenial but her salary was smaller than the small town in which she was employed and the net result was dis couraging butterfly luncheons instead of the nourishing grub her health de manded had fattened her purse but little more than her body and she found her wardrobe all too slender for the requirements of dances and drives and beach and boating parties her deep blue eyes habitually flashed a keen intelligence but now they were on the verge of tears and the cupids bow of her lips was distorted into a pout it was unfair she felt only the day before she had drawn a number of checks from the private checkbook of her boss to pay milliners and modistes and specialty shops for the wealth of wearing apparel his wife and daughter had ordered there was nothing of the bolshevist about doris mr kenyon was a rich man and it was only right that he should be generous with his family yet it did seem hard that they should have so much when she required comparatively so little bravely she tried to put the idea out of her head and for several minutes her slender fingers hammered at the keys industriously then she made sure there were no mistakes in her mail and gathering the letters and envelopes into a neat pile went toward the private office and all of a sudden her heart went pitapat a half smile crept over her pretty features and almost as quickly faded as she hesitated outside the frosted glass door was she a coward she wonderedwould she have the her friend the burglar nerve and if she had she pondered what would the boss say in all probability his answer would be noyet doris remembered the prov erb nothing venture nothing gain it was worth taking a chance she felt and she also reminded herself that faint heart never won fine feathers yes she would ask him timidly she stepped inside and closed the door behind her the greenshaded desklamp was burning at her employers elbow and she was conscious of a frown on his weary face it was not a propitious moment to ask a favor but doris told herself that it must be now or never if she quailed this time she would never have the courage to approach him again thank you he said as she put her work in his wire basket then he looked at his watch and saw it was after six doris hesitated he was evidently in a hurry yet something within her urged her to go on mr kenyon she began in a half faltering voice i was wondering whether yes he snapped beginning to sign his name whether the firm would lend me fifty dollarsand take it out of my salary after vacation he did not look up what for came the abrupt ques tion some things i need she explained lamely without desiring to go into detail things you dont need he contra dicted you girls are all alike all you think of is making a big splurge during the two weeks of your holiday in order to do it youre willing to keep your powdered noses to the grindstone for the rest of the year no miss law ton the firm wont lend you fifty dollars or fifty cents he pushed the last letter from him and rising impatiently took his hat from the clothes pole in another moment the door closed behind him and doris found herself standing there fold ing and sealing his letters from force of habit the old grouch she exclaimed bit terly and then her sense of humor came to the rescue doris lawton youre a goose she charged herself he sus pected what you wanted right away no wonderafter all those bills he had to pay for his wifes and daughters things he cant say no to themso he says just that to you she was right walking down the paved stretch which divided the lawn in front of the office kenyon felt that perhaps he had been a little unfair in fact he hesitated an instant almost tempted to go back and tell the girl she might have the sum she wished then he shook his head shell be disappointed of course but its better not to let her have it lord eighteen dollars a week and she wants to borrow half a hundred to blow on foolishness nix ii doris was disappointed but somehow she felt no resentment as she went out into the deserted main office and put on her saucy hat deep down in her heart she knew that she could not afford even a small selection from that tempt ing style bookyet she had looked for ward to the approaching vacation weeks so eagerly she liked nice things and she loved to meet pleasant people and the really nice girls at the resort would have trunkfuls of pretty apparel oh well she sighed if he wont he wontso thats all of that i sup pose ill have to make out with what i have then she saw kenyons checkbook and a number of personal papers lying on her desk the safe had been locked her friend the burglar for the night when the bookkeeper de parted but doris knew its combination and it would not do to leave these things exposed to possible loss so she turned the knob of the vault built into the wall and switching on the electric light went in to put the checkbook and papers in kenyons private drawer the day had been warm and the win dows were still open in the main office a storm had been gathering for more than an hour and now a sharp gust blew violently into the room doris was just turning the light switch when she heard the steel door of the vault swinging smoothly on its hinges close with a clang with a startled ex clamation she sprang toward itjust too late it locked automatically and there was no way to open it from the inside standing in the stuffy darkness of the little compartment she tried to think for a moment everyone had gone ex cept stephen the janitor he would be passing through the isolated little build ing in a few minutes closing the win dows and setting the burglar alarm seeing the safe closed he would as sume that everyone had departed and it would not be long before stephen himself would go home to his supper filled with a sudden fear she began to call out wildly and beat with her bare hands on the unyielding door there was a chance that the janitor might hear her but the vault was practically sound proof and besides old stephen was slightly deaf the burglar alarm made a night watchman unnecessary and unless she could summon aid within a mighty short time doris knew she was a prisoner until morning her polished nails broke as she clawed at the lock barrier she pressed her ear eagerly against its surface hoping in vain to catch some encouraging sound from without but the only noise in the stilled vault was her convulsive breathing and the frantic pounding of her terrified heart despairing at last of summoning aid she groped her way in the darkness until she found the light switch it turned with a little click but no illumination fol lowed for a moment she wondered why and then she understood even through the brick and steel of the walls she could faintly hear the crash and rumble of the thunderstorm evidently the electricity had been put out of order by the violence of the static disturbance for a little while she cried hysteri cally and then tried to laugh at herself but she made rather a sorry attempt at that it was frightfully hot in the vault and suddenly she remembered reading of men who had been suffocated in similar situations a feeling of horror enveloped her she did not want to die yet she felt miserably helpless there was literally nothing that she could do but wait and as she sank down in a huddled heap beside the immovable steel shutter she breathed a little prayer then some time in the long measureless interval which followed she lost consciousness iii as though in a dream doris heard a clicking sound amid the stillness it meant nothing to her now and her body and mind were numbed with an over powering drowsiness one shoulder was propped up by the vault door and her bobbed head rested against it her chin upon her breast there was a faint current of air and the support against which she leaned gave way her eyes half opened then closed againand doris fell for ward with her body prostrate across the threshold of the safedeposit cham ber saug her friend the burglar vaguely as though it were far away she heard a masculine ejaculation of astonishment it seemed as though a tiny shaft of light were prying into her face but it faded as her eyes opened again and she could see nothing but the shadowy outlines of the desks and furniture of the office for a time she knew nothing at all then raising herself on her elbow she became aware of someone moving in side the vault there was someone standing close to her she could hear quick breathing and the scraping sound of file cases being opened and shut the little shaft of white light was also playing inside the big safe somewhat indistinctly doris saw a hand draw a bundle from a drawer then the searchlight snapped off again and she felt a desire to scream a dark figure was bending over her and now a hand touched her wrist it lingered a moment as though feeling her pulse and then rested directly over her heart narrow squeeze she heard a voice murmur shell be all right though now that the doors open the figure rose and stepped from the vault pausing only a moment in the outer office lucky all around she caught an amused chuckle and shuddered lest the manfor it must be a man she heardshould approach her again surely he could not think her dead but he evidently meant to leave her there as she was without even giv ing first aid that could only mean that he was thoroughly unscrupulous as consciousness fully returned she con sidered herself lucky that he did not attempt to harm her but even in that moment despite her apprehension she was stirred by the loyalty she owed to mr kenyon forgotten for the moment was his re fusal to lend her the money for which she had askedunthought of was the danger of her position alone in the building with this burglar if she could only get to the telephone switchboard and give the warning of his presence and then she wondered why the burg lar alarm had not notified the police de partment in a flash she understood the storm that had put out the lights must have disconnected the system otherwise the raised window which she could see at the opposite end of the room would have sent the message of the mans en trance over the wires cautiously and scarcely daring to breathe doris sat up steadying her self with one hand she attempted to rise just what she was going to do she was not sure but that she must do something was certain if she could prevent it the thief should not get away with whatever he had taken she did not think there was much of negotiable value in the vaultonly a little petty cash and some bonds and stock certifi cates belonging to mr kenyon butit suddenly dawned upon doris that this made it all the worse the theft of those securities might direct suspicion at her the thought made her cry aloud without considering the con sequencesand they followed swiftly keep still came the peremptory command and again she saw the white finger of light point in her direction it blinded her and she blinked her eyes evidently she made a sorry picture for a laugh sounded unpleasantly as the rays of the pocketlight illumined her pale frightened face if you make a move ill have to hurt you the man went on i dont wantt to shoot unless you force me oh gasped doris and cringed close to the floor i dont know who you are or what you were doing in that vault continued the burglar i never knew that ken her friend the burglar yon was a bluebeard and locked up ladies in his safe but if i hadnt hap pened along when i did to let you out youd have been a corpse by morning doris shuddered and found herself unable to speak she wanted to scream but she could not so completely was she paralyzed with dread just stay where you are and mind your own business advised the man no one is coming along to disturb us the storm helped me out with the safety signal but id have put it out of business myself if chance hadnt done it now im going out by the way i came in and if you know whats good for you youll keep still until im safely away then you can go or stay your selfjust as you please doris did not know what to answer she was trying in vain to formulate some planbut her brain refused to work it was too dark to see the mans face and she could only make out his figure silhouetted against the light from the window perhaps he did not have a gun he might be only bluffing but even if he was she knew she would be helpless in a struggle with him he might strangle her or leave her bound hand and foot with a gag in her mouth as she had seen crooks do to girls in the movies remember what i said came the admonition as the man backed slowly toward the window if you try any nonsenseeven after im outsideill get you later onno matter how long i have to wait with a quiet laugh he dropped out of sight doris began to consider what she ought to do there was the telephone board should she call the police or get her emplovers home on the wire then the terrible truth impressed itself upon her would either the officers or mr kenyon believe her what excuse could she give for being there herself at such an hour the story she must tellthe real story of what had happenedwould sound like simple invention and not very clever invention at that even if they should believe that the door of the vault had blown shut on her there would be a lurking suspicion as to her motive for being in the compartment after it had once been locked and every one had gone they probably would not accept her statement anyway stephen would nat urally say that the safe had been closed when he had gone home she had asked for fifty dollars and had been refused she could not identify the burglar because she had not seen his faceand of course there would be nothing to help her prove that he had ever been there her story would prob ably be regarded as a clumsy effort to conceal her own theft of whatever had been taken from kenyons private drawer in sudden panic she resolved to slip away leaving everything as it was she would go out just as the burglar had gone she drew up her skirt and mounted the windowsill then dropped the short distance to the grass beneath for a fraction of time she stood quaking in the shadow of the building then taking new courage from her very fear she darted like a frightened fawn across the grounds and down to the nar row delivery street iv there was no sleep for doris that night it had been after three when she cautiously mounted the veranda steps of her lodging and inserted her key in the lock with a feeling of guilt she had slipped off her frenchheeled pumps and silently mounted the stairs in her stocking feet yet despite her utmost caution the rickety balustrade her friend the burglar creaked and groaned as she steadied herself against it and she was not at all sure that her landlady was not well aware of the hour of her return in fact when morning finally came she was quite convinced that mrs mor ris looked at her with disapproval the hatchetfaced womans suspicious eyes seemed to read the secret which was tor turing the girl and doris gulped her breakfast with scant ceremony but even then she knew her ordeal had not really begun her feet felt like lead as she en tered the office to her surprise it was empty the safe was closed and locked but the bookkeepers desk was open and while no one sat at the switchboard the operators hat hung on the peg above herchair doris stood stockstill on the thresh old trying to get a grip on her shat tered nerves from the halfopen door of mr kenyons office came the buzz of voices and the instinct of flight grew strong in her then stephen the janitor came out of the sanctum and eyed doris as though he had seen a ghost heres miss lawton now he said over his shoulder and from within mr kenyon called her she was face to face with the dread ed moment and something told her that it was going to result unsatisfactorily she was shaking like a leaf and her hands seemed to be enormous and to tally useless somehow she managed to cross the outer office and step into the private room kenyon was seated at his desk standing beside it was a policeman in uniform and a man doris recognized as collins the local chief of police ranged about the walls were the other employees and all of them scrutinized doris with a look which brought a lump to her throat and made her fluttering heart sink within her take off your shoes came the sharp command of chief collins doris turned to him in embarrass ment but before she could find words the policeman stepped to her side and stooping grasped her ankle in an in stant he had removed her highheeled pump and placed it on kenyons desk the little idiot exclaimed mr kenyon still doris did not under stand but it was not long before she did the heel was smeared with mud and it was quickly ascertained that its size corresponded precisely with the two indentations that showed all too plainly in the earth outside the window when she had dropped from the ledge both heels had embedded themselves deeply in the earth made soft by the downpour for an innocent girl to explain that manner of egress from the building was difficult in itself and when doris blurt ed out her story she did it pitifully her voice was faltering and her choice of words unfortunate in her dazed condition she contradicted herself and she could not convincingly tell them why she had run away if she had noth ing to hide some nerve observed chief col lins she thinks she can show up here this morning and throw a bluff that will fool uswhen the whole case is as plain as the nose on your face wants to borrow money and gets turned down spiteful she throws the mail in the wastebasket doris gave a start as he indicated the receptacle which usually stood be side her desk the wind that had blown the safe door shut must have swept the letters into the basket she had forgotten them in her flight then she hides somewhere until the watchman leaves collins summed up she takes the bond and then tries to make the whole thing look like a bur glary ive heard of amateur crooks do her friend the burglar ing a lot of fool things but this is the limit with twenty thousand dollars worth of bonds in mr kenyons drawer she only takes a single hundred dollar one there was a snicker from those gath ered about but kenyon nodded his head understanding just petty spite he observed probably figured that id never miss one out of the packet eh naturally pointed out chief col lins a regular yegg wouldnt have been so modest hed have taken the lot a hundreddollar bond wouldnt pay him for his pains then doris found her tongue and a flame of fury surged within her its not true she asserted her eyes blazing as she confronted them youre quick to jump at conclusions but if id wanted to take that one little bond my self why would i have called attention to it by leaving the safe door open and jumping out the window ask me something easy chuckled the police chief what did you do with that bond kenyon put to her severely i didnt take it she protested des perately and the tears streamed down her cheeks i tell you i didntand i dont know where it is then announced chief collins i guess youd better come along with me until your memorys clearer v stunned and overwhelmed with shame doris sat in the little cell of the local police station she had been pedi greed and docketed like any other crimi nal and in the eyes of the officers and everyone at the office she was nothing but a contemptible little thief nor was there any means by which she could prove an alibino way that she could clear herself of the charge it was not alone the vision of impend ing imprisonment that sickened her it was the fact that they thought her a thiefthat never again could she look them in the face or walk abroad on the streets wherever she might go that stigma would be certain to follow her in speechless rage she had been forced to endure being searched by the stationhouse matron and she knew that the police had gone through her belong ings at home her landlady was aware of the charge against her and had said as doris supposed that she would that her lodger had not returned until the wee hours of the morning by this time the town was talking of what had happened the fact that doris had held aloof from the local maidens and swainsbecause of her diffidence in making new friendsonly aggravated the sneering spirit in which they received the news already she was convicted on circumstantial evi dence and she felt she would soon be wearing a frock of a style she had not coveted then to make matters worse mrs kenyon called at the jail she was a wellmeaning woman although some what unfortunate in her manner yet she was genuinely concerned over doris case and had come to the stationhouse despite her husbands expression of dis approval why dont you confide in me my child she had asked of doris the money in itself isnt such a serious mat terbut what you have done may ruin your whole life unless you act sensibly and make a clean breast of it for a moment doris looked at the richly gowned woman with an expres sion of fury in the depths of her eyes yes it might ruin her whole lifeyet she had made a clean breast of itand by so doing had incriminated herself did they want her to lieto confess something she had not donein order to earn their clemency her friend the burglar mr kenyon told me of your request for a loan mrs kenyon went on i can realize the temptation which dress must hold for a girl in your position but doris interrupted her angrily can you she cried contemptuously i wonder if you can and i wonder if you could resist it if you did but i tell you i didnt take the moneythat every word ive said is trueand im not going to admit something that isnt so no matter what you promise to do if i should in disgust at the brazenness of the girl mrs kenyon took her departure and chief collins himself escorted her to the motor in which her daughter was waiting it is really too bad she deplored to the official she is so young to be so stubborn and so callous yet i suppose we must expect it in view of the mod ern attitude of young girls toward lavish adornment and enjoyment of lux uries beyond their means but chief collins knew more about human nature than mrs kenyon did and his experience was wider with young men and women who had made similar slips because of their envy of others more fortunate in worldly pos sessions so he walked meditatively back into the station house and with a friendly light in his eyes paused before the bars of the cell in which doris was sitting dejectedly her burning cheeks hidden in the palms of her quivering hands now dont take on like that kid he consoled her gently maybe things wont be so bad after all i hateall of you doris blurted out unable to control her emotion sure you do agreed the chief thats only natural we all hate people who catch us doing something we oughtnt to do i tell you i didnt raged doris and i tell you you did contradicted the chief calmly we wont fight over thatbut ill tell you how you can keep on sticking to the truth and get out of this little cage doris looked up at him in astonish ment but the officials eyes were twink ling you didnt spring anything new he said did you think you did i dont understand stammered doris no queried the chief arching his eyebrows suppose you tell me the name of the young man who was work ing with you and explain what fright ened you both away before youd com pleted the haul so that was what he thought doris realized in an instant why she was being held and it only increased her helpless nessfor she did not know the burglar and could not even attempt to explain what he looked like that in itself she saw only made it seem as though she was trying to shield the man they be lieved to be her accomplice he was foxier than you the chief told her for he wore gloves and rub bersoled shoes but we found his foot prints in the grass the same as yours now youre too good a kid to tie up with a crook like thata contemptible skunk wholl slink away and leave a silly girl to get caught in his place come onout with it wherell we find him doris could only protest that she did not know well all ive got to say was chief collins parting shot youre about as senseless a little fool as i ever came across if you wont loosen your tongue you deserve whats coming to you vi when doris closed her eyes she seemed to live again all that had taken place and she found herself wondering her friend the burglar what had become of the burglar she imagined that she felt his touch again and once more seemed to shrink from him in fear in the silence of the jail his very voice sounded again in her ears she found herself despising the man as much as she loathed herselffor surely she had not been as cowardly as he yet she was going to jail because of him then she remembered his observation that if he had not happened in she might have suffocated in the safe after all he had saved her life and perhaps she ought to be thankful she ceased to puzzle over it and her weariness lulled her off to sleepa dreamless exhausted slumber from which she was wakened by the opening of her cell door there was a bright light in the corri dor and by it she recognized the chief of police with a turnkey by his side awake he asked well kid ive good news for you your old boss has changed his mind and withdrawn the charge you can thank your brother for that my brother asked doris in a daze blinking at the electric light and trying to concentrate she had no brother so it must be the burglar who had as sumed the role but perhaps this was another trap to get her to speak so she kept very still and listened with ears that could hardly believe what she heard chief collins nodded i dont know whether the storys on the level or not but since kenyons promised not to prosecute theres nothing to do but let you go do you mean that doris asked eagerly springing to her feet in a flutter yes said the chief your brother got hold of an early afternoon edition of the call and telephoned to kenyon that hed make good the hun dred dollars if hed withdraw the charge at first the old man declined to do it but your brother sent the cash anywayby a messenger who said hed been given it by a stranger who paid his railway fare from westport and gave him a tendollar tip despite her emotion doris could not help smiling there must be honor among thieves after all and the burglar was not so much of a cad as she had thought him but that isnt all collins went on and theres one other thing i wish you would explain even though ive no of ficial right to ask you now what asked doris quite as curi ous as the chief seemed to be why the devil did you hide that hundreddollar bond in the safe came the perplexed question hide it repeated doris exactly nodded the chief the bookkeeper found it this afternoon in the bin with the old letterpress books under the cabinet where kenyon kept his securities he wouldnt have dis covered it if he hadnt been looking up some old correspondence ive told you said the bewildered girl that i dont know a thing about it well maybe you do and maybe you dont grinned chief collins but its because that bond was found that ken yon decided not to appear against you of course we couldnt convict you now anyway but im not so sure that its wise to turn you loose just bear in mind young lady that its a risky business for a kid like you to arrange to meet your brother after midnight near a safedeposit vault next time you do it you may get locked in an other kind of a chamber vii tfn minutes later doris was making her way through side streets to her her friend the burglar boardinghouse there was enough money in the purse the police restored to her to pay her bill at mrs morris and then slip out of town where she would go or what she would do she did not know just now her only thought was not to be seen doris was angry through and through mrs kenyons attitude at the jail still rankled in her breast the memory of the police chiefs words also nettled her he too believed her guilty and old kenyon had only re fused to prosecute because he knew he could not secure a conviction she hated them allhated the town and the job she had lost as well hearing her enter the boarding house the landlady stepped into the hall and glared at doris in speechless amaze ment i thought you was in jail she sneered im a lady jonah and came out of the whale again doris said more amused than annoyed at the absurdly belligerent attitude of the woman youve sure been a jonah to me bemoaned mrs morris to think that a woman o my reputationrun nin a respectable house for years should get herself advertised the way ive been today i suppose now that youre a noto rious character youll be going into the movies doris taunted opening her purse she took out its slender store of bills im leavingtonight she ex plained here is what i owe you till the end of next week mrs morris reminded her avariciously this money aint no its not stolen doris flared if you dare suggest such a thing ill forget that youre an ugly old woman and slap your face youre just like the rest of the rubes in this burg your ideas are so narrow your brains could be shoved through the eye of a needle without touching its sides mrs morris gasped but subsided and tucked the money away in her apron ohi forgot she said in an altered tone a little boy was here a while ago with a letter for you she produced a bulky missive and stared at it with allconsuming curiosity but doris snatched it from her quick ly and ran up the stairs to her room once behind the locked door she lit the gas and sat down wearily on the edge of the bed the writing on the envelope in her hand was not familiar then curiously her fingers ripped open the flapand into her lap tumbled a package of bills doris stared at them with unbelieving eyesbut the crisp fee of the bank notes told her the money was real and she turned her attention to the writing the letter was not signed but she saw at once that it was from the burglar say kid im sorry you got jugged for the day but maybe this little remembrance will make up for that a little bit if youd only squealed when i beat it you wouldnt have been pinched but you were gameand ive always been a square crook im strong for a good sportand specially when shes a little pippin like you you see kid i didnt have the nerze to take anything out of the office vault after i found you there i didnt want you to get the blame so i put the bonds back and the cash wasnt worth taking anyway doris paused and a smile came over her face all the honest folks thought her beyond the pale but the burglar man was lavish in his praise and gener ous in his appreciation afteri made my getaway i got to thinking what an old skinflint kenyon is nobody but his wife her friend the burglar and daughter ever pried him loose from a cent and i sort of figured that maybe yon were monkeying about that safe because you needed a little extra change yourself so i beat it over to kenyons home and took a look in the safe in his li brary saythe old boy had in there so i just lifted it and closed the safe again and i dont suppose he even knows its gone doris gave a little gasp and then her eyes twinkled as she thought of ken yons fury when he should learn the truth of course there was nothing more he could do with her but she did not care to be in town when he made the discovery he would be mad enough to chew nails for days to come she went on with the note when i found youd been locked up i worked that brother stunt and because kenyon would do any thing for a hundred dollars he fell for it hard of course he didnt know it was his own century note i sent him by messenger too bad but he wouldnt see the joke im enclosing four hundred dollars thais your half of the swagless the hundred iron men it took to get you out of jail take it and have a good time yon didnt steal it fts a gift from your admiring friend the burglar for a minute or two doris hesitated then she stuffed the note and the bills into her stocking and began to pack up four hundred dollars would buy a lot of the things in that mailorder catalog and give her a longer vacation at the shore there was a train out of town at eleven fiftysix and doris proposed to take it but as she went about her prep arations she wondered whether the bur glar would by any chance be at the sea side hotel it would be fun if they could laugh together over the joke on old kenyon actors amuse me bycharles g shaw actors who wear ties having white borders with their dinner coats actors who continually talk about their art actors who dont know what to do with their hands actors who write their own plays actors who insist upon speaking atrocious french actors who are murdered in the first act and are espied sipping

dumbbell by helen hysell trip hagar regained his balance and stared at the baldheaded man who had pushed him away from the limousine door the man was un doubtedly old and even his white mustache appeared feeble as it drooped dejectedly over his thin loose lips yet it was he the owner of the car and not the athleticlooking chauffeur who had thrust trip aside hagar was not in the habit of lurking about rich mens limousines his busi nessor perhaps it might better be called a profession in this day of special izationhad to do with those same rich men when not accompanied by chauf feurs or other paid protectors trip was a holdup man of discrimi nation and distinction he worked at night this afternoon he had merely paused to roll a cigarette and was gaz ing absently at the blueandgold monogram on the door of the car when the owner came out of the hotel gregory and crossed the sidewalk there was no room for surprise or an ger in trips eyes as he stared through the window of the car as it moved slowly away he wanted if possible to catch another glimpse of the blue green stone that adorned the old mans left hand trip knew a dealer in antique jewelry who would pay in the neighborhood of five thousand dollars for the minibilh the historic turquoise that had orna mented a shah of persia in the year trip believed he had recognized this valuable jewel on the hand that had thrust him so roughly away from the limousine who was that guy he asked of the grinning doorman at the hotel gregory some punchconsidering he gazed ruefully after the receding car and reflected that the man was probably too old to live through the shock of being held up and robbed no doubt his heart was weakened by age the doorman continued to grin thats darius blandinghis married daughter lives here he interrupted his explanation to laugh sort of sur prised you didnt he well you never can tell about these old boys with the young ideas they but trip had sudden important busi ness at the public library his alertyoungbusinessman stride led straight to the big readingroom on the third floor of the building fifteen minutes and he had freshened his mem ory as to the history of a certain tur quoise pictured in the volume he had requested at the desk he had also dis covered that the stone was now in the collection of darius blanding once more in fifth avenue trip strolled contemplatively in the sunshine in the back of his busy mind danced the waxy luster of a bluishgreen oval dark and exquisitely colored and set in dull bronze the ring was worth five thousand dollars to berlitz the antique jeweler and trip wanted the five thousand a holdup was impractical and danger ous trip was careful to select his vic tims for their appearance of health as the dimpled dumbbell well as of wealth housebreaking was equally impractical and dangerous the ring had an air of permanence upon the mans finger as though it were seldom removed and burglars are notorious for their habit of staying as far as pos sible from the householder they desire to rob besides trip did not know a burglar he could trust and he was determined to secure the greatest possible amount of the five thousand dollars for himself his walk carried him once more past the door of the hotel gregory trip ignored the doorman but recalled his grinning philosophic remarks con cerning old men with young ideas immediately the problem was solved trip darted into the hotel and tele phoned an invitation for dinner to dora dell dora was delighted dora was al ways delighted when trip condescended to notice her but trip didnt conde scend often in his estimation dora was a dumbbell no amount of flutter ing eyelids and dimpling smiles could counteract the fact that she was scatter brained however dora was young and ex actly the type who could obtain the turquoise from blanding through senti mental channels pretty in a vain and vapid way dora believed that she was clever enough to be useful and so she was up to a certain point unfortunately trouble was very likely to begin where her pic torial usefulness ceased trip had met some of this trouble and vanquished it a few months before and had declared himself finished with dora he had at that time acquired a large amount of incriminating evidence against her therefore trip felt equal to the task of dismissing dora before she put her small mind to work on improving his plan for obtaining the turquoise the old guy looks easy he told her as they finished their dinner at chin lows restaurant all you have to do is follow him around until he notices youand any man with half an eye would notice you dora flashed him a smile and dimpled delightedly trip frowned and went on with his instructions your job is to get him to let you wear the ring while you eat somewhere bera jeweler i knowis all set to make a duplicate of it the minute he sees the color of the stone and the bronze hes had the measurements for years and he can carry the color in his eye my eyes are bluer than any turquoise that ever grew dimpled dora you told me that the first time you saw me ancient history snapped trip youre to keep me posted as to where youre going with the old boy and ill have ber my friend go there too all he needs is one little glimpse and the things done my youre getting handsome trip said dora i never saw you cut out the mush stuff this is busi ness trip was finding it increasingly difficult to be patient with dora and her dimpled flirtatiousness do you understand what youre to do dora nodded sulkily then a ques tion occurred to her how can a man carry a color in his eye thats his job sighed trip all you have to do is to get the ring for a minute and let him see it after thats done ill tell you what to do next i didnt know turquoises were worth much said dora forgetting to dimple she could not think and flirt at the same time youre a dumbbell trip muttered the dimpled dumbbell this ring is valuable its got seven pages of history in a book understand all about how some persian king found it at the bottom of an enchanted lake and how do you know this is the one inquired dora as she searched for her powderpuff it sounds like a fairy tale to me how do i know you ask foolish questions demanded trip stop thinking im weary oh said dora and her eyelids flut tered ravishingly then lets go some where and dance i love to dance with you youre so big and strong and ii a week later dora dell was dimpling for the delight of darius blanding she gazed happily about the broadway res taurant to which she had begged prettily to be taken and where she would when the time came show trip hagars friend the shahs turquoise the incongruity of our little dinner charms me miss dora said darius blanding in a pompously playful at tempt to make conversation your youth takes twenty years off my life doras eyelids fluttered as she sought for a suitable reply she had enjoyed the anchovies and she liked the music but she didnt like blanding and she didnt understand half he said she knew however that she was charming whether she talked or not so she smiled and glanced at the turquoise ring on her companions finger oh she cried in childish pleasure youre wearing a ring exactly the color of my eyes she gazed upward that he might see the color of her eyes darius blanding allowed his thin lips to relax beneath the drooping mustache youre right he smiled but this stone is many centuries older than your eyes my child dora extended her hand across the table is it ananantique she asked id love to touch something that is centuries old blanding hesitated a moment then slipped the ring from his finger and laid it in her pink palm be careful of it he admonished sharply its very valuableex tremely valuable a persian shah once numbered it among his favorite jewels im far from so exalted a rulerthough im probably much richer in dollars and cents oh murmured dora are you rich she slipped the ring on the index finger of her right hand and pro ceeded to demolish a french pastry how much could you sell it for there has never been a more beauti ful stone said blanding andi it is priceless so far as selling goes dora dimpled and gurgled over the color of the turquoise and the oddness of the setting it must have cost you a lot she said in an awed voice darius blanding frowned reminis cently then smiled in triumphant recol lection it cost the man who refused to sell me the stone his fortune and his life he said doras eyes widened and she shud dered charmingly how shewhispered he wouldnt sell it soibut a pretty little girl like you knows nothing of business suffice it to say that my financial power drove his firm to the wall and he killed himself i took the ring from his widow the expression on blandings face was not pleasant to see dora shud dered again and glanced across the polished dancing floor at a short florid man who was endeavoring to catch her the dimpled dumbbell attention gradually it came to her that this must be the antique jeweler who wanted to see the ring for a moment she gazed questioningly into his eyes at a faint nod from the man dora cried oh in wellsimulated surprise and sprang to her feet theres an old friend of my uncles she murmured to her companion ex cuse me a minute she darted away to show the ring to trips confederate is it the real one she demanded breathlessly as she held out her hand the short man rose quickly and bow ing low over her hand smiled effusively dont be so open about it he said the old mans watching you like a hawk to an observer across the room it would seem that he paid her a com pliment dora glanced over her shoulder and smiled bright reassurance to the de serted blanding how much is it worth she asked of the jeweler trip said you could carry the color in your eye can you youd better go back now he ad vised shortly how much is the ring worth insisted dora a thousand dollars again the jeweler bowed over her hand taking a last lingering look at the tur quoise on her index finger at least a thousand he assured her now run along before you get into trouble and make a date with the old boy for wednesday evening ill have the fake finished by then dora returned to her dinner purring apologies im sorry i ran away like that she said it wasnt nice andjust to prove im sorry ill let you take me somewherewednesday evening that will give me great pleasure miss dora said blanding well take a nice long driveperhaps go out to my country place for dinner oh mr blanding ii couldnt dora tried to look shocked and made a fairly convincing success of the attempt why asked blanding indulgently wed be alone andoh i couldnt go to your country homeit wouldnt be then well just drive around the city and dora paused upon the threshold of con sent blanding followed up his imagined ad vantage by a promise you may wear the shahs favorite jewel as long as you are in the car he added and smiled in satisfaction as dora agreed iii with the copy of the turquoise ring safely tucked away in the pocket of her trim blueserge jacket and the original glowing dully on the index finger of her right hand dora dell sat in the limousine beside darius blanding on wednesday evening conversation had long since lapsed for want of kindred interests and no amor ous advances had come to take the place of words they had circled central park at least five times and dora wondered why people talked of the beauty of new yorks playground they had passed dozens of amorous couples in cabs in motors and on foot dora wondered how it would seem to be kissed by a man who wore a long droop ing mustache she wondered too how the jeweler could carry a color in his eye long enough to match the shahs turquoise so perfectly that she couldnt have told them apart had she seen them together her eyelids fluttered sleepily and she suppressed a frequently recurring yawn i must go home in a little while said dora at last its getting late blanding started as though surprised at the dimpled dumbbell her presence in the car its nearly eleven oclock he said after a moment and slipped his arm stiffly about doras waist dora sighed and allowed her head to rest briefly upon his shoulder i was beginning to think you didnt like me she said softly women especially pretty women are dangerous said blanding and kissed her suddenly his drooping mustache dragged unpleasantly across her lips and dora for got for the moment her role of siren she thought only of her distaste for her ancient admirer and jerked away from him pettishly darius blanding was hurt more he was angry he moved to the far corner of the seat and barked an order into the speaking tube at his elbow the car swerved from the park and sped down fifth avenue toward the corner of thirty third street dora recalled the purpose of this ride and was instantly contrite she dared not give this austere old man an imitation of his valuable turquoise as long as he was displeased with her he might take the precaution of examining it closely before he allowed her to leave the car at her corner she grew more and more nervous as the time of transfer drew nearer with the passing of the short blocks her faith in the perfection of the duplicate ring weakened it didnt seem possible to her that a man could carry the exact color of the shahs turquoise in his eye it was such a queer color too but if she did not make the exchange tonight trip hagar would insist that she try again and dora didnt want to make another engagement with blanding she moved insinuatingly to her com panions side and rubbed her powdered cheek against his black coat sleeve she sighed softly and looked up into his face blanding sat stiffly erect staring at the athletic back of his chauffeur dora sighed again and glanced from the window they were nearing her corner in another minute she took the left hand of darius bland ing and replaced it about her waist even if you dont like me she murmured as she dropped the genuine turquoise into her pocket theres your pretty ring she slipped the duplicate ring upon his finger and gave his hand a tender pat of farewell im sorry i have to go home so early the car drew up to the curb and the chauffeur stood alertly beside the open door dora allowed her companion a veiled glimpse of her turquoise eyes and a flash of dimples as she stepped quickly to the street its been a nice ride she said thank you replied blanding good bye his tone was courteously cold and totally lacking in regret he neither asked for her address nor suggested that she telephone him with a sigh of relief dora saw the car move away from the corner carrying darius blanding out of her life it hadnt been a nice ride and only the possession of the shahs favorite jewel compensated for her trouble in making a temporary playmate of so old and tiresome a man and the moment she telephoned trip hagar of her success she would have nothing but a paltry hundred dollars in return for the boredom of being pleasant to darius blanding her small fist clutched protectingly about the ring and in her brain grew a plan whereby she could keep the ancient stone a little while she stepped into a drugstore telephonebooth and dropped a coin into the fivecent slot doras voice trembled as she gave the number of trips phone to the operator she swallowed with difficulty when he answered the dimpled dumbbell this is dora she managed to say i she faltered fearful lest the untruth she was about to utter would not ring true well said trip suspiciously ii didnt again she faltered and trips suspicions crystallized into swift anger you failed i suppose he bellowed i might have known you wouldnt have brains enough to carry through youre the dumbest dumbbell that dora didnt mind being called a dumb bell ordinarily but to be told in all seriousness that she wasnt clever enough to accomplish so simple a task as the ex change of the rings had proved to be doras slow anger was aroused her cheeks flushed under the heavy coating of powder and she glared ferociously into the transmitter of the telephone if thats the way youre going to talk i wont do it at all said dora trip deemed it wise to change his tac tics couldnt you make the trade to night he asked more civilly it ought to have been easy in the dark and every thing it was easy said dora and smiled slyly as she recalled the manner of the exchange but i thought it best to wait until i see him again onon friday friday shouted trip berlitz wants that stone not later than tomorrow night wont you ever learn not to try to think with that fleasized brain of yours dora slashed the receiver upon it hook without replying to trips final insult she had intended to give him the ring on friday pretending that she had had an other engagement with blanding but trip hagar had dared to say she could not think well she would show him that she was cleverer than he her eyelids fluttered furiously and the dimples in her flaming cheeks became deep hard lines shed show trip hagar a thing or two the turquoise was beautiful and she liked it she wanted to keep it and now that trip had acted so mean she would keep it trip couldnt make her give it up if she didnt want to and shed see to it that he didnt take it away from her by force at the door of the drugstore dora paused then hurried to the shelf on which lay a thick and dogeared telephone book in his anger trip had accidentally men tioned the name of the jeweler who had made the duplicate that dora had slipped on blandings finger if she could persuade the jeweler to make a second duplicate of the turquoise all would be well dora ordered an icecream soda and proceeded to lay her plans for showing trip a thing or two iv friday night at eleven oclock dora telephoned to trip her voice as she asked him to meet her at the automat nearby was cheerful and confident trip hastened to the tryst believing that she had succeeded in making the exchange of rings thats your duplicate said dora bluntly she passed it to him wrapped loosely in a paper napkin im sorry but there it is too surprised to be angry too disap pointed to speak coherently trip gazed across the rim of his coffee cup at doras fluttering eyelids and dimpling smile he reflected that she didnt look sorry blanding was leery continued dora energetically and he held my hand all the time i had the ring on im sorry but trip surreptitiously unwrapped the worthless bauble and eyed its waxy luster disgustedly but he was not thinking of the dimpled dumbbell the imitation turquoise nor of the mar velous skill of the imitator he was won dering why he doubted the authenticity of doras failure youre pretty peppy for a total loss he remarked for an instant dora was frightened at this evidence of trips suspicion then she rallied to her own defense why wouldnt i be peppy she de manded gaily im through being nice to that old dub forever youve no idea how youve got to make another date with him and try it again declared trip this means money sudden hatred flared in doras eyes she shuddered at the memory of bland ings brief kiss i dont care what it means she said hotly im through being an old mans darling andim through being a young mans slave she rose and strolled past the cashier through the small lobby with its soda fountain and walked alone into the de serted street trips suspicions became absolute knowledge as he gazed after her there was a flaunting assurance about the slender shoulders and wellpoised head that hinted of bravado that dumbbells doublecrossed me ill bet a his eyes fell upon the cashier ill bet a nickel shes doublecrossed me butive got to prove it v twelve hours later trip risked his liberty by appearing at the wall street office of darius blanding his business like manner served him well below the deadline where men of his profession were not allowed to go his steady nerve guided his tongue as he told the reception clerk that his name was higgins and that his business was antique jewelry entering the severely plain office of the great financier trip caught a glimpse of a bluegreen stone as blanding brushed an imaginary hair from his high forehead for an instant trip believed that he had seen the original turquoise but he could not be sure my client has commissioned me to pur chase the minibilh turquoise mr bland ing began the pseudo mr higgins brisk ly providing of course that the one you have is genuine the old man shook his head the stone is not for sale the reply was in the nature of a dis missal blanding glanced suggestively at the door trip smiled pleasantly and held his ground he was determined to look closely at the turquoise before he left the office he wanted proof of doras deception be fore he took steps to frighten her into giving up the treasure that she might not have are you sure he asked that yours is the famous minibilh darius blanding looked up quickly angrily examine it and decide for your self he said shortly as he laid the bronze ring upon the desk trips hand trembled as he lifted the ring he had a duplicate in his pocket and if dora had told the truth about her failure to make the exchange trip intended to attempt it even while the old man watched him with a sigh that was half relief and half gasping fury he laid the ring upon the desk and moved toward the door my client will be very much disap pointed he said but personally i do not wonder that you refuse to part with the stone blanding allowed himself the luxury of a chuckle the stone will never be on the market again he said tell your client that he may as well give up hope s aug the dimpled dumbbell i shall wear the minibilh turquoise to my grave he glanced affectionately at the ring as he returned it to his finger trip hagar lost no time in escaping from lower new york alternately cold with fear lest the old man discover his loss and send out an alarm and burning with anger toward dora who had tricked him and berlitz who had aided her he hurried uptown undoubtedly the jew eler had advised dora to wait a few days before turning the turquoise over to him knowing dora trip was able to antici pate her actions while the valuable stone was in her possession she would reason that the ring was safe as long as she kept it and herself out of sight she would not venture from her room excepting at night and then only long enough to eat her dinner during these brief absences she would probably hide the ring in her room rather than on her person to a casual observer on the subway trip was merely an alert young business man hastening to a luncheon engagement but had it been possible to read trips mind this same observer would have de tected no intention of wasting time in a restaurant he was concerned solely with a certain roominghouse from the front windows of which he could see the door of the house in which dora lived all he had to do was to secure that room for a week and wait until he saw dora leave the house then he would search her room find the turquoise and compel berlitz to pay ten thousand instead of five thousand for it vi without regret dora dell remained indoors throughout the sultry saturday she had proved herself cleverer than trip hagar and she patted herself upon the mental back she was cleverer than ber litz too he thought she was going to sell the turquoise to him but she wasnt the stone was hers and she meant to keep it she had thought of a wonderful hiding place for her treasurea place where no one would ever think of looking and at dark she hurried to a nearby restaurant for her dinner serenely confident that the ring was safe no matter how thoroughly her room might be searched still calm and unruffled dora returned to her room at the door she paused her quick fear quieted by the sight of a cold cream jar upon the battered oak dresser she picked her way carefully through the hopeless disorder of the room and caught up the coldcream jar her hand trembled a little as she lifted the lid and thrust her finger through the perfumed cream to the bottom of the jar then she laughed what did she care about a disordered room a mattress slashed by a razorblade a rug heaped in the cen ter of the floor and covered with the contents of her dresser drawers the searcher had not found the turquoise she laughed again and glanced into the mirror to note the pictorial effect and saw a message scrawled upon the glass with a piece of soap blanding is wise she read and her selfsatisfaction crumbled it had been easy to outwit trip whom she hated but blandinghe could call upon the police to help him it occurred to her that trip had got word to blanding in order to get even with her trip was mean enough to do a thing like thathe was mean enough to do anything hatred for the man with whom she had once thought herself in love flared anew and dora shook a small fist defiantly at the writing upon the mirror blandingll never get this ring she declared as she clutched the coldcream jar to her heart and neither will you trip the dimpled dumbbell hagar ill smash the old thing first or ill instantly her face cleared berlitz had told her the stone was worth a thousand dollars she would sell him the ring be fore he found out that blanding was wise then she would go to chicago to visit her married sister until it was safe to return to new york still earning the coldcream jar dora hurried out of the house and made her way to the dingy basement store of b berlitz behind her a cap drawn down over his forehead crept trip hagar they arrived at the store about the same time but trip remained outside until ber litz and dora were engaged in conversa tion inside the store dora stated the purpose of her call you said the turquoise you copied was worth a thousand dollars she said i want fifteen hundred lets see it answered berlitz with a flourish dora lifted the lid of the coldcream jar intent upon the business of extracting the ring from its perfumed bed she did not see the expression of horror upon the jewelers florid face she held the ring toward him smiling proudly berlitz jerked it from her fingers and dashed to the workshop in the rear of the store dora waited impatiently during the mo ment he was gone i want my fifteen hundred she shrilled as he returned then as she saw the ex pression of despairing fury upon his face she paled and her lips began to tremble why whats the matter she faltered havent you got the fifteen hundred berlitz nodded then shook his head ive got it but the street door opened and closed with a bang dora gasped in fright wheres that turquoise bellowed trip looking from the frightened dora to the jeweler and back again to dora dora nodded toward berlitz hes got it she said weakly didarent you afraid blanding will shut up about blanding wheres that turquoise berlitz opened his hand and disclosed a bronze ring set with a mottled muddy green stone gone was all hint of the exquisite color of the turquoise gone was all trace of its waxy luster trip smiled contemptuously none of that he snarled come through with the turquoise this is it sighed berlitz shes ruined it ruined it trip turned angrily upon dora what have you done he de manded roughly she has ruined the minibilh turquoise repeated berlitz nothing will counter act the effect of grease grease shouted trip his eyes fell upon the innocent looking jar in which the ring had been hidden he caught dora by the shoulders and whirled her about to face him what do you mean ruining a valuable stone like that i didnt do anything to it sobbed dora i only hid it while i went out to dinner it wasnt in the cold cream more than an hour an hour berlitz laughed sharply in grease cream fifteen minutes would have been enough trip ignored the jeweler who had un consciously assisted in destroying the tur quoise by making the second duplicate he retained his hold upon doras shoulder didnt you know that greaseany kind of greasewould soak into the stone and spoil the color he asked i didnt know anything sobbed dora except that you were mean and said i couldnt think and you searched my the dimpled dumbbell room and wrote that note andi got scared and ill say you didnt know anything and always will agreed trip hopelessly you thought i was mean when i told the truth and you thought yourself clever when you put the turquoise in grease cream and you thought blanding was wise because i said so and he stopped for breath and his hold upon her shoulder relaxed he snatched up the coldcream jar and eyed the label dis gustedly guaranteed to contain no harmful in gredients he read guaranteed not to trip lifted his arm high above his head you dumbbell once more he hurled the insult in her face as the coldcream jar crashed to the floor

wholesome and cleancut it was part of barkers duty to know by sight those crooks wanted by the police somehow he could not help but place this chaphandsome though he was and certainly not of a criminal cast of featuresin that class he did not look like the aver age jailbird and yet suddenly it came to him he gasped three years ago he re membered now it had to do with a certain affair that was still un solved a riddle that had never been answered at the time following a clue he had looked for the chap but in vain he had mysteriously disappeared if it were the same man the oppor tunity he had long waited for had come and yet barker was not quite sure a bold idea came to him he would chance it he couldnt very well arrest the chap on the suspicion that he was the man he was looking for that way he would learn nothing but if he could lead him into betraying himself the man finished his cigarette with a yawn he tossed it through the halfopen window he patted his knees as if he were going to rise and return to the pullman barker knew he must detain him the old trick of offering a cigar came to his mind he felt in his pocket he had but three left and they must do him until he got to the city have a cigar he asked thanks i never smoke cigars cigarettes do me he smiled in reply the ice was broken hard trip said barker trying another course hate it replied the man ill be glad to get home you live in st louis too said barker adding that last as a rule he preferred to let the other fellow ask questions but he had to keep the conversation going yes you in business there good this was more like it just the lost heiress the question barker had been want ing no he answered not in busi ness its my old home im a de tective did the fellows eyes narrow or did barker imagine it telling peo ple he was a detective was something barker never did if a person were guilty it threw him on his guard yet in this case in view of the scheme he had in mind it was necessary that must be interesting work said the man lighting another ciga rette yes one way of looking at it still it isnt as satisfactory as most occupations a businessman can close his desk at night and hes done for the day a thirtydollaraweek clerk may be laughingly interrupted the man well what i mean is he knows the problems of his business cant be taken up again until tomorrow but the detective is always on the job searching his mind for that subtle hint that may lead to the solution of the case he is working on sometimes he puzzles along for yearsand then never comes to a satisfactory conclusion barker settled himself in his chair he saw that the other man was in terested he continued theres one affair that always baffled me its still unsolved i dont want to bore you but would you like to hear it by all means replied the other politely it goes back three years maybe you will remember it if you were in new york at the time were you in new york three years ago the man hesitated a moment and then said without flinching no he was perfect master of himself but barker felt that he had hesitated just a moment too long yet if he had deliberately told a falsehood he had not betrayed himself too much we called it the case of the lost heiress continued barker scrutiniz ing him closely the daughter of a millionaire banker katherine corn wall by name mysteriously disap peared perhaps you remember the man gave an embarrassed lit tle laugh something he said its so long ago and theres so much of that sort of thing i suppose there are any number of unsolved mur ders robberies disappearances and so forth yes but sometimes after many years the truth comes to light a detective never gives up hope and ive always felt that some day i should stumble on the story of what happened to katherine cornwall the man was frowning but other wise he seemed no more than po litely interested hes either innocent thought barker to himself or else hes the coolest scamp alive he preferred to believe the latter otherwise what he was doing would be with out point ii i was called on the case contin ued barker being at that time on the new york force while we never found katherine cornwall still there was one clueone missing thread should we ever discover that we might perhaps know the truth elu sive at the best but im ahead of my story i went to the girls home one of these big imposing mansions not far from fifth avenue this was the morning following her disappear ance the lost heiress from what i could learn she had left the house the afternoon before to ride in the park the groom had brought her horse around to the en trance she had dismissed him say ing she would return about four oclock she usually rode alone well four oclock came and she didnt return five six the groom began to wonder if something hadnt happened to her he strolled over toward central park but could see nothing of her so he went to the stables there he found a policeman waiting with the horse the officer said he had found it nibbling at the shrubbery in the park you see miss cornwall was known by sight to the mounted po lice so he knew to whom the mare a thoroughbred animal belonged the officer when questioned said that he had seen her gallop along the bridlepath she had nodded to him as she passed by that had been about an hour before he found the riderless mare to the best of our knowledge he was the last person who ever saw her she had simply ridden into central park and vanished as com pletely as if the earth had swallowed her up and from that day to this nothing has been seen of her needless for me to go into detail as to what we did at firstthe ob vious things of course like search ing the park inquiring at the hospitals and the morgues it might have been an accident you know but nothing came of that we even went through the underworld with a finetooth comb her father a dis tinguished aristocratic old gentle man was willing to spend every dollar he had and it did cost him a pretty sum to me there was only one thing to be donediscover a motive i be gan to question everybody her parents the servants her friends all that i was able to discover was that her home life was very happy she was popular with her circle of friends had everything she desired but i asked them all not even her fiance could tell me anything she was to have had din ner that evening with him he was a prominent young attorney of ex cellent family and with something of a reputation at the bar not a hand some chap but i have no doubt he would have made a firstrate husband as husbands go both of the par ents seemed satisfied with the match the engagement had even been an nounced he was all broken up over it as you can imagine so were they all its rather a facer to have some one you love vanish without a word of farewell and for no apparent reason death is much easier to bear i should imagine so put in the man to whom barker was telling the story so far his face had been ex pressionless a mask that concealed his thoughts but the point that barker was hoping to make was yet to come from what i could find out con cerning miss cornwall he con tinued she was a healthy normal girl not given to fads from the way her friends praised her virtues she didnt seem human but that was three years ago and girls werent as silly then as they are today the man smiled however said baker i asked her mother if i couldnt look through her rooms at first mrs cornwall was averse to this a mid victorian modesty i suppose i thought it odd at the time later i the lost heiress had still more occasion to wonder she wanted to stand by ray side all the time now no detective can work that way i finally told her and asked to be left alone assuring her that miss cornwalls possessions were safe in my hands when i started looking about it seemed so futile everything was in order on the dresser was a framed portrait of her fiance as it should be other portraits of friends were about the room people with whom i had already talked in her desk i dis covered some correspondence nat urally in a case like this i looked the letters over but they told me nothing i had hoped that she might keep a diary but it seems that she was too sensible a girl for even that bit of feminine foolishness and yet i did stumble on some thing that has always puzzled me in the bottom of the desk was a picture cut from a newspaper of a college football hero i slipped it into my pocket it might be nothing more than a romantic girls fancy but it made her seem more real to me for girls do cut out of the papers pictures of college athletes and movie stars iii i inquired of mrs cornwall if her daughter knew the man she said no at least he had never been entertained in their home he might have been an acquaintance of course well i went to see the chap barker was watching the others face closely but he was gazing out of the window seemingly indifferent and yet from the way he was listen ing barker knew he was not bored he was in business with a brokers firm on lower broadway i asked him if he knew miss corn wall he told me he did not and that he had never even met her naturally i didnt tell him that i had discovered his picture in her desk butnow comes something that has led me to believe he lied to me that afternoon one day i went to see mrs corn wall good lord i was at their home so often the butler would let me in without quibbling i was wait ing in the hall mrs cornwall was engaged the butler told me then from the drawingroom came this chap i have told you about he gave me a curt nod and left the house the business i had in hand waited until i had asked mrs cornwall what he was doing there she seemed sur prised at my question as if it were an impertinence and replied that it was a personal matter and that was all i could get out of her i reminded her that i had asked her a few days before if she had known the man and she had told me she did not she explained that she had never seen him until this day that was all yet i could not help but feel that she was concealing something from me from that day her man ner changed she seemed more rec onciled to her daughters loss now we detectives work on hunches and i felt that there was something in this visit that had to do with the missing girl i also dis covered that mrs cornwall had given this man a check for ten thou sand dollars i found that out at the bank a few days later and what did you make of that asked the man one of two things either she was purchasing some stockswhich made me wonder why she didnt do the lost heiress that through her own brokeror else she had given him that money for some very definite reason perhaps for information concerning her daughters whereabouts it was much easier to believe the latter meanwhile we kept an eye on the chap his actions were above suspicion he led the life of the average new yorker was engaged to be married and we often saw him with the girl i suppose i should have arrested him and yet that was not possible there was nothing to accuse him of get your evidence first and then arrest the guilty party is the best proceeding then one day he too vanished his employers told us that he had left for chicago to go into business there but we found that was not true no one seemed to care much if he had disappeared i never saw him again barker paused and lighted a fresh cigar it was only a thread at that and yet i have always felt that he could tell us something concerning kath erine cornwall his picture in her desk his coming to see her mother his strange disappearance and the check for ten thousand dollars i have made up my mind that should i ever run across him i should arrest him on the spot thats very interesting said the young man very interesting story tell me how do most detectives solve problems do they come to it by a logical conclusion or do they stumble on the answer by accident its usually an accident ad mitted barker grumbling the one thing we need to know to make our chain of evidence complete cannot be found by deduction the man rose to go just a moment said barker i suppose you wonder why i have told you this oh not at all its because i think you are the man i have been looking for you are the one person who can tell me what happened to katherine corn wall thats rather a bold statement perhaps katherine cornwall herself could tell you that he answered mockingly at any rate consider yourself under arrest the man whistled softly to him self he glanced at the door if escape was on his mind barker laughed impossible he said unless you want to risk your life by jumping from a moving train i wasnt thinking of that said the man sit down said barker i want you to tell me what you know i want the truth suppose i do tell you will you give me your word of honor that it will go no furtherthat you will let it be your secret as well as mine barker promised iv it was all so very simple i have often wondered why you never stumbled on the one link in the chain that would have solved the mystery i call it a mystery it was to you not to me nor to mrs cornwall katherines father was an aristo crat as you say he was also an old tyrant you see there was a young man in love with miss cornwall a decent sort of a chap i believe she returned his affections but her father opposed the match there was nothing for the young people to do but elope they did she went the lost heiress riding in the park a car was wait ing she stepped in and rode off miss cornwall lived in new york all the time you were so busy hunting for her how did she escape detec tion well i once knew of a crook who lived next to the jail he was so bold about it that the police never thought of looking in the most ob vious place the same was true of miss cornwall she did however disguise herself with a wig later she and this young chap were mar ried mrs conwall who approved the match was present they have never told mr corn wall who would even today raise an awful fuss after a honeymoon in europe the two lovers returned to this country and have lived happily ever after it was all so very simple that it isnt even thrilling how do you happen to know this asked barker i am surprised that you would ask me that replied the young man from his pocket he drew forth a snapshot this is my wife he said it was a photograph of katherine cornwall and if you are stopping over in st louis the young man continued wont you come and see us after all these years i know you would like to see face to face the girl you have been looking for the past three years there is really nothing to be learned about women but man never tires of learning it saucy shots from studios by dorothy donnell calhoun everyone connected with the movie industry is busy trying to find an alibi to explain away the uncomfortable fact that in february of this year fewer people by eight million went to the movies than in the corre sponding month last year john griffith wray the director thinks the trouble is injudicious methods of exploitation the public has been plied with superlatives every new picture is claimed to be the most mar velous most artistic most costly most sensational picture ever made allit erations artful aid abounds in the an nouncements dazzlingly daring dis tractingly devilish capital letters sprinkle the advertisements as thickly as the freckles adorning wes barrys map she was mad for money she yearned for the rightful joys of youth or if you found your wife was holding hands with another man by radio what would you do mr wray believes that this ringlingo may be successful for circuses where rustics will stand forgetting that the inside of their mouths is getting sun burned while they read of the amazing bihorned amphibious bovalpus and then pay to go in and see a water buf falo but that the dignified drama of the screen can dispense with ballyhoo an advertisement of a new photoplay written truthfully and modestly mr wray claims would appeal more strongly such an ad we here submit and let our readers draw their own con clusions the new goldie gay picture without benefit of reno has a theme that was old when nero was spanked by his father for playing with matches at the age of four the star who plays the part of a schoolgirl does as well as could be expected when one considers her agethirtyseven a million dol lars was not spent on the pro duction and the management is willing to swear to this before a notary the handsome hero did not risk his life by jumping from a tower into the seawe used a tail ors dummy instead the only time the hero ever risked his life was by making personal appearances after saucy shots from studios the showing of his pictures we did not make the picture for arts sake but for the sake of our land lord ii elinor glyn the novelist evi dently believes that the recent slump in movie attendance has come from the absurd reports that there are photoplay actors who arent all they should be she plans to remedy the situation by writing a scenario called the eyes of truth which will picture the life of hollywood society truthfully showing that a moraller uprighter altogether righteouser lot of people cant be found anywhere the film will be produced by sol lesser maker of the jackie coogan pictures people who have been at hollywood have told us that sleigh riding is a popular pastime out there and surely that sounds innocent maybe elinor knowsshes lived there al most a month and one can do a great deal even in three weeks whatever is the matter mr hays will fix it mae murray was a guest at the gath ering of the motion picture directors association the other day and she de scribes the applause which greeted the new dictator of the film when he rose to speak there was a perfect fever of enthu siasm she says hays fever they all do it even the best of em one chill morning during the filming of the prisoner of zenda several of the principals in the picture were wait ing before the big set of

before we leave the prisoner of zenda we may state that the total cost of this immense picture undertaking was there is something that rings true about this statement we think it is the sixteen cents somehow that sixteen cents intrigues us more than the millionodd dollars what was it spent for coughdrops for ingram a hairnet for alice terrys golden locks a shine for barbara la marrs highheeled adven turess slippers if only press agents would tell us things like that mr ingram directed the coronation scenes of this photoplay by radiophone calling up his subdirectors scattered over the lot at the instant he needed them these in turn shouted their directions to their section of the mob from their hidingplacesfor they wore radioreceivers over their ears which are hardly what a welldressed man would wear to a ruritanian coronation follow a few other facts about this photoplay masterpiece more people contributed to mak ing the picture than the population of oswego new york fortyeight
