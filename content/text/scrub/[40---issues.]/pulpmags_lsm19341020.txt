franklin pierce carrigan thrill chaser by mary ann de forest linda carrolls gray eyes fairly smoked as she faced her sister across the breakfast table i tell you i wont she was de claring rebelliously i wont give up my own perfectly thrilling plans for this summer just to trail down to long island with you and your adoring husband bob is a peach but of course he is helene kershaw broke in sharply or he wouldnt have put up with all of your wild escapades getting caught in that speakeasy raid doing stunt stuff for the movies and now it is prac tically on your account that he finally agreed to take that kvale place for the season think of it and southampton is a pain in the neck if youd ask me linda flipped over a cup of black coffee although i will ad mit the kvale place is pretty hot even if the house party they threw wasnt and their son ted whom you insisted on my going there to meet was even less so but darling it wasnt ted i know it was courtney the older boy i remember linda thrill chaser broke in promptly and to forestall a lengthy repetition of facts the only one of the kvales who could take it when the family fortune went pfft well thats grand but since i didnt meet the hero and since he later shoved off to parts unknown and there isnt a man in our crowd who could even leave a finger print on my heart why go to all the bother of southampton and a house party it would only mean doing the same stupid things en tertaining the same stupid people but it wouldnt helene said swiftly because ive in vited the most in teresting young man lindas im itation of past de scriptions was per fect so different and absolutely thrilling well he is linda whooped then that settles it count me out because i positively draw the line at meeting even one more why theyre all just a lot of dimwit playboys turned out of col lege like so much cookies but where would you go to meet any other kind helene asked right where i am goingwest west came the astonished echo where anywhere oh dont you see im so fed up with boys like ted kvale or the whoopsmydear poet you all but had me ankling up the aisle with last winter i want to go out where bob came from where men are men renascence by lenore fisher rain melting the snow unveiling the lilies starting to grow tears melting my pain revealing my heart beating again and wild indians like you wear moccasins not cerise sandals with their toe nails lacquered to match supplemented a voice from the doorway where bob kershaw stood grinning down at the two girls but im for you in spite of em linda go west if you like but bob helene cut in pro testingly let her go he advised ignor ing his wifes frantic protest after all i understand how she feels oh bob linda had whirled about her voice was a hug you do dont you oh its not that i dont like being with you and helene but all this her glance swept the severely mod ernistic breakfast room of the ker shaws triplex apartment high above sutton place seems so arti ficial somehow and the men i play around with are so so tame bob put in obligingly taking his place at the table i know not a thrill in a carload and after a pause any definite plans linda shook her head not very only youve said so much about nevada that i rather thought id try it but bob helene interrupted desperately only to be silenced by a quick glance and her husbands prompt and why not nevada theres not a better spot in the country if youre looking for thrills there was a pause while he attacked street amp smiths love story magazine his grapefruit then he turned to linda ill tell you how about paying a visit to your uncle andy waltons firstclass outfit that lucky d ranch at echo canyon and a picturesque place if i ever saw one of course linda agreed eyes shining but do you suppose he would want me why shouldnt he loads of room fifty miles from the nearest railroad station and with no one but his partner and a bunch of cowhands around oh it sounds exciting you do think it would be dont you bob a thoughtful smile quirked the corners of bob kershaws eyes as he caught his sisterinlaws glowing reflection in the mirrored table top dusky curls shot with blue fire in the morning sun great gray eyes that alternately danced or smol dered beneath incredible lashes an impudent nose lips that were frankly painted and sweetly petu lant lovely and completely spoiled was his mental summary mostly my fault too and aloud ex citing well knowing uncle andy as i do and from all accounts of that fine young chap hes taken on as partner id almost guarantee that it would be it was linda reached the deci sion some ten days later and within the first flickering moment after she had stepped from the train at echo canyon it was a dream come true a closeup of the picture that had been lingering in the far corners of her mind for weeks the station itself a ramshackle affair set deep in a mountain fork beyond it a road twisting upward to a rose tinted sky line and to her left on the far side of the station platform a group of cowboys lounging about a hitching rail where their mounts were tethered linda stared blinked and stared again widebrimmed stetsons shirts that shrieked plaids gay ker chiefs chaps shaggy with dust highheeled boots and the men themselves ranging from short to tall all darkly tanned a half dozen pairs of eyes staring back at her fully a quarter minute elapsed before she became conscious of them one pair in particular belong ing to a slim young man standing a little apart from the rest whose pale watchful gaze caught hers with all the hard brilliance of the nickel studs on his leather chaps there was an instant of feeling oddly uncomfortable then she turned away suddenly aware of the fact that not one of the group even slightly resembled the description of andy walton and with the real ization developed an unexpected sensation of utter desolation and loneliness it was shortlived however for almost in the next breath a tall lank cowboy crossed the platform to greet her with a hesitant howdy maam lookin for some one to which linda gathered her scattered emotions sufficiently to reply yes ii expected to find my uncle andy walton of the lucky d ranch you dont say well thats funny why linda demanded because he aint here he left for chicago a coupla days ago chicago she exclaimed but he knew i was coming i wired him that i would arrive on an earlier train than i originally planned didnt hedidnt he even leave word with some one she ended a little vaguely thrill chaser oh dont you see im so fed up with the boys in our crowd there isnt a man i know who could leave a finger print on my heart i want to go out west where men are men nots i know of came the prompt reply un lessthe speaker turned to eye a roadster swirling down the mountain road unless denny can tell you something about it denny she questioned follow ing his gaze sure one of the lucky d boys thats him nownodding in the direction of the car that had miracu lously reached a lower level in safety and was racing toward them and mad as hops likely because hes late with the mail in the minutes following lindas heart did queer things and all be cause of a total stranger at first she told herself it was due to the street amp smiths love story magazine devilmaycare ease with which he drove the car the expert sureness which brought him about the final curve and to an abrupt halt almost at the edge of the station platform then the instant he sprang out she knew better the feeling went deeper than a momentary thrill it was something about the man himselftall deep chested in his cowboy regalia something about his eyes that were steelygray and keen in his lean sun burned face hi denny lindas compan ion hailed the newcomer andys niece is here miss he looked at her questioningly carroll linda supplemented stepping forward a little breath lessly linda carroll mr wal ton was expecting me yes i know but didnt you re ceive his telegram was the quick response it should have been de livered to you on the train oh a faint flush crept up in lindas cheeks it probably would have only i left the train and flew part way because she almost said because i couldnt wait to get here but changed it quickly to because i dont like trains theyre too pokey thats too bad steelygray eyes were taking quick note of the suitcases and overnight bag ranged beside her because im afraid that is the only way youll be able to leave leave linda gasped but i cant i mean ive just come and surely there must be some place to stay until my uncle returns im afraid he wont be return ing right away you see his son in chicago is pretty ill so it may be a week or more before he gets back of course you would be more than welcome at the lucky d if if what linda demanded when he halted uncertainly if he hadnt sold it to his part ner just before he left sold it then he wont be re turning to the ranch no hes quit ranching to at tend to his mine over in a place called silver city linda thought a moment then hell probably go there yes so you see i do came lindas decisive in terruption i see that the sensible thing is for me to go over there and wait for him but you cant do that denny objected you dont understand it isnt a regular city just one of those places that sprang up quickly marvelous her face was sud denly radiant i always wanted to see a mining camp the sort that grew overnight theres a hotel of sorts i suppose you could call it that how ever i dont think you ought to go fine she declared i always adore places other people disap prove of but miss carroll its all of sixty miles from here fifty by car and the rest on horseback over the roughest kind of trail i know i just came from there and you are going back now perhaps after i leave this mail sack but i tell you please she pouted dont try because my mind is made up the point is will you be kind enough to take me back with you if you insist he said shortly but i still claim its not the place for a girl no women in camp and the men a pack of hardlooking characters i wouldnt be responsi ble for what might happen to you which makes the picture per thrill chaser fect she tossed at him pertly be cause i draw the line at having any one responsible for me by the way where do we change to horses at my place great ill get into riding togs there and to his very apparent dismay she picked up her overnight case turned to the lank cowboy to add with a devastating smile would you mind awfully putting the rest of my baggage in the rum ble seat and started for the road ster at a brisk pace five minutes later they were off denny at the wheel linda beside him for the first few miles she plied him with questions but pres ently his gruff replies mostly in monosyllables stemmed the tide of her enthusiasm and she finally re lapsed into a silence matching his own one that held except for an exchange of casual remarks until they drew up at the rear of a ram bling log cabin which denny an nounced was their destination ducky place was her thought as she sped inside to change and after an appreciative inventory just the sort one reads about plenty of huge comfy chairs bear skin rugs that make you want to lie down and roll and what a fireplace im half tempted to announce that ill do my waiting right here but she didnt ten minutes later she was outside again and with the contents of her baggage transferred to dennys duffel bag and that strapped on behind his sad dle they were on their way denny grimeyed handsome in the lead why did uncle andy call his ranch the lucky d she ventured finally and because his slience net tled her what does it stand for lucky dice he replied over his shoulder because he won it on a seven up hot cat did they really shoot crap for ranches in the old days ill say and with gambling legal now the stakes are even more insane especially in a place like sil ver city where men and morals dont seem to be any too well ac quainted linda flushed you mean they gamble for unusual stakes she asked uneasily for any came the blunt retort theyre a badlooking lot and i meant it when i said it wasnt the spot for a girl oh was lindas sole comment and again the conversation lagged to a point where she was uncom fortably alone with her reflections until at last its all too utterly ab surd she told herself hinting at ridiculous things that would never happen in a civilized country hes just trying to throw a scare prob ably because he doesnt like me or perhapsher pulse quickened perceptibly at the thoughtper haps hes acting this queer way be cause he does maybe i sneaked up on his heart and he doesnt know quite what to do about it some western men are like that bob said so and the way he looks at me every now and then might mean almost anything presently to test the theory and for several other vague and unana lyzed reasons she said aloud and in her most captivating manner are you really one of those strong silent types one hears about out here or is it just a pose to put the city child in an awed frame of mind before she meets all the big bad men neither he replied coolly if you must know i am simply call ing myself an idiot for getting mixed up in a situation of this sort really little flames leaped into her eyes well i fail to see street amp smiths love story magazine how this could be termed a situa tion or develop into one you were merely returning to silver city and i insisted on being taken along when we arrive you can wash your hands of me it may not be as simple as all that was his irritating reply why not whats the weighty problem and when his answer was not immediately forthcoming she mocked one lone woman in a mining camp i expect of all the bosh i suppose you think ill have the entire population muttering in their beards well you can make a joke of it if you like was his terse comment but you may change your mind after you get there in something less than two hours linda did even the approach was desolate and forbidding an incline stretch up a barren mountain so steep that looking ahead was equally as terrifying as glancing backward then the summit and a sharp dip with the trail zigzagging down the very brink of rocky ledge to a sprawling plateau ugh scarylooking place even at dusk linda reflected viewing the dingy log buildings and scatter ing of dejected shacks maybe i shouldnt have come after all the thought grew as they dis mounted in front of a bleak two story structure labeled hotel and proceeded up the steps almost at the top linda caught dennys arm who is that man she demanded indicating a slim skulking figure who had at that moment left a group of loungers and was disappearing around the corner of the porch he looks like the same paleeyed sinister individual who was staring at me so queerly at the station couldnt be the same denny hurried her inside this is an en tirely different bunch and to the rotund individual behind the desk a front room for miss carroll andy waltons niece jake and shed like dinner upstairs oh no linda interposed i want dinner upstairs denny repeated it firmly and before she could protest further he had the key and was pi loting her to the second floor inside the crudely furnished room linda whirled on him what did you say that for she demanded im not afraid of a handful of pros pectors even if they are roughlook ing why ive eaten in plenty of speakeasies back home that were worse than anything here could be and you are privileged to eat in as many more as you like without interference from me when you re turn denny replied calmly but as long as i am under the same roof lsa thrill chaser i meant it when i said silver city wasnt the spot for a girl men and morals dont seem to be any too well acquainted there you wont go into the camp mess room indeed lindas eyes flashed and how long will that be one night only he had re moved a small bundle of personal belongings from the duffel bag and turned away im leaving for my lsa street amp smiths love story magazine place first thing tomorrow morning and ill be glad to leave here oh the color fled from lin das cheeks then youyou came licre just to bring me she faltered well you insisted on coming didnt you his eyes were stern his voice impatient as he lit an oil lamp and placed it on the shabby dresser yes and i do thank you a lot onlyher heart had left its accus tomed place and was sinking rap idlyonly ii wont be seeing you again will i probably not he was on his way out of the room however if you should want me ill be just across the hall better blow out your light pretty quick or youll be eaten by mosquitoes and with that and a brief good night he stalked out for all of ten seconds she stared after him then thoughtfully re luctantly she tossed her felt hat onto the bed and fell to unpacking there was but one interrupting a waddling chinaman bearing supper on a tray and with that finished and the duffel bag emptied she faced the prospect of a lonely eve ning with weary rebellion fine ending for what should have been a perfect day was her petu lant reflection she blew out the light tossed a pillow onto the sill and dropped upon it face on folded arms she lay there gazing out upon the dark ened landscape with things on her mind things that had never been there beforea rambling log cabin bearskin rugs two huge chairs drawn up before a mammoth fire place drowsily her fancy wove a pic ture of a tall blond young man with stern eyes sitting in one of the chairs of herself in the other flames flickering lowlower as her eyelashes grew heavier music drift ing through finally a moment of breathtaking reality as the man rose bent over her and all but touched her waiting lips denny denny she awoke to the sound of his name intermingled with raucous laughter and the tinny jangle of piano keys came upright wondering in that brief moment whether it had been her own voice calling or some one elses then having her mind suddenly distracted by a bellowed conversation from be low she turned again to the win dow to catch the full drift of its meaning a half minute ticked by while she listened heart pounding the blood flying to her cheeks then an in stant of uncertainty and in the next she had scrambled off the bed fled to dennys door and was tapping frantically its linda she whispered to the gruff inquiry inside the room she choked out oh iits outrageous fantastic i tell you i wouldnt believe such a tiling could happen but it has what has he was risen and was facing her across a paper strewn table whats wrong everything those great hulk ing brutes actually planning to roll dice for meme and calling you to get in on the game oh so that was what they wanted he was surveying her with irritating calmness at first i thought it must be some sort of joke she went on tremulously it was all soso in credible so utterly ridiculous and then she paused for breath and presently added in desperation well arent you going toto do something about it are you just going to stand there thrill chaser what do you expect me to do he inquired with exasperating equa nimity challenge the crowd sin glehanded shoot up the place oh please she begged dont be like that this is as serious as it is crazy i know i was foolish to come and that i told you to wash your hands of me but now im asking you to forget that and help me out of the mess surely there must be some way there is i could join the game if i won that would settle things but you might lose no that would be too risky she thought a minute then ill tell you why not go down pretend to be looking on then slip away and sad dle the horses i could skip down the back way and meet you but there isnt a back way he told her i looked when i went to stable our mounts then ill drop from your win dow and break your neck i wouldnt she ran over to gauge the distance then faced him breathlessly think your pony could take it if i lit in the saddle yes but but nothingthat will shorten the drop ill pack and return here give a low whistle when youre ready but linda its two stories from the ground you couldnt make it without hurting yourself there was genuine alarm in his voice nonsense stunts like that are my special hobby her cheeks glowed come on lets get go ing and suiting the action to the word she whisked from the room and across the hall to gather up her belongings presently she was back a glance at the table told her that he had left a bundle to be included in her own she stuffed it inside the duf fel blew out the light and stole to the window to wait heart pounding after what seemed an interminable time a whistle sounded faintly from below and she swung the bag over the sill an instant later she slid after it there was a moment of hang ing precariously fingers gripping the ledge then with a half twist she let go and dropped expertly into the saddle good girl denny applauded softly as she controlled the ponys plunging reaction and they started off straight on head for the ledge think theyve missed us yet linda asked after a bit not a chance theyre too busy rolling dice thenwhats that almost in the instant of her speaking a shot rang out followed in quick succes sion by four more somewhere over lindas head a bullet whined and she saw her companion clutch at his stetson denny youre not hurt she called in quick alarm no and with little thanks to some idiot he whirled snatched her ponys bridle and started the mustangs on a wild gallop but this isnt the way we came she protested as he forced her on ahead into a cut through the moun tain i know its longer but safer a bullet could pick us off that ledge like birds from a branch keep go ing and ride low its ten to one they wont follow but we cant take chances they didnt except for a brief interval on the sharp up grades they kept their mounts at top speed meanwhile two additional shots had sounded then silence fi nally when they reached a trail street amp smiths love story magazine linda remembered and she was about to swing into it denny called sharply not that way turn left im taking you over to the lucky d she pulled up short but i dont want to go there you said never mind what i said he had ridden up beside her were going just the same at least you wont be alone over there and i wont be alone in your cabin either was her prompt re minder youll be with me thats the trouble you mean it wouldnt be proper she tossed back well right now im just a little fugitive from a mining gang and not inter ested in proprieties moreover i draw the line on galloping up to a strangers door at this hour to de mand shelter especially when i can be more comfortable in your cabin where i left my baggage and with a quick flip of her reins she swung her pony impudently about and started over the righthand trail leaving denny no choice but to follow thanks to moonlight and capable mounts they made excellent time but it was almost eleven oclock when they finally reached the cabin and linda all but fell into dennys arms getting out of the saddle tired arent you he remarked when they were inside and he had lighted a lamp you ought to be after that hectic ride more cold than tired she tossed her hat onto a chair and crossed to the great open fireplace where denny had already piled a huge log onto a foundation of lighted kindling funny how chilly the nights are after that bak ing sun and presently raising her enchanting eyes teasingly to his cozy here isnt it now arent you glad that i drew the line at go ing to the ranch he didnt reply at once and then his answer wasnt in words it came in a lightning gesture as he swept her into his arms captured her lips with a swift and unnerving violence then released them only long enough to say and maybe you wont draw the line at thisand thisand this punctuating each breath taking interlude with kisses that were less scorching but infinitely more compelling finally he put her from him voluntarily left her stand ing there facing him a hand to her trembling lips oh ii hate you she burst out after a long silence and because she was so terrifically afraid she might say what was really in her heart youyoure a beast im not and you know it his eyes met hers sternly and squarely you asked for just what hap pened asked for it she scrubbed at her mouth in outraged spoiledchild fashion why i never you did he was back to the flames towering over her with your eyes your lips your attitude all daydaring me oh i know your type the east is full of them the kind that gets a kick out of leading a fellow on and playing safe at it youre just a little thrill chaser im not she whipped back then why did you insist on re turning to my cabin and why did you want to go to silver city with me in the first place because i thought it would be nice to wait there for my uncle she fibbed neatly and as for com ing back herewell i just liked the cabin thats all but i do draw the line at beingkissed she ended in sudden confusion thrill chaser then ill ask you to draw an other one that will keep us far enough apart so there wont be any danger of its happening again denny strode to the center table jerked out a drawer and snatched up a piece of white chalk with vol canic determination here draw a dividing lineindicating the middle of the room ill keep strictly to the right side which gives me the builtin bunk on the ground floor and you may have the rest with a bedroom off the balcony im sure you will like it he added with caustic politeness its a new addition with locks that make it absolutely safe in fact at a glance no one would dream there was a room up there in the brief silence following their glances met and clashed then linda tossed her head audaciously and taking the chalk marked a line up to and across the center table ending with a flourish at the oppo site baseboard and thanks for giving me the kitchen too thats a real break however ill be lion hearted and feed you at least three times a dayon your side of the table of course she finished heart doing a tap dance at the prospect but the next instant her hopes crashed for he returned stiffly thanks but i know you will be relieved to hear there will be only one meal to prepare an early break fast so well be sure to make the station in time to flag the morning train and now ill wish you good night and pleasant dreams as though they could be the thought followed linda forlornly up the short spiral staircase to her bal cony room as though i could even sleep knowing ill have to leave and with my heart breaking and it is she sobbed in despair during the interlude while she dis robed bathed and donned a man darin suit that was the direct oppo site of her mood being a chinese symphony in rainbow embroidery on an orange background denny was right i have been just a little thrill chaser but i wasnt with him it was lovefrom the first i know it now he sstepped right out of that roadster into my heart and hes there to sstay weeping she blew out the lamp slipped in between the sheets and turned miserably to hide her tears in the pillow oh i do love him i do she choked not that it will ever come to anything with his despising me the way he does but id rather die than go awayand i dont know wwhat to do oh if only something would happen in a little less than an hour some thing did she would have said that she hadnt closed her eyes but in the instant of opening them she realized she must have slept real ized too that the bellowing voice which had wakened her was strange and threatening and that dennys tone rising in crisp contrast had a frightening quality one that brought her out of bed and barefoot to the door where she could peer into the room below there was denny facing her hands lifted palms up looking very tall and grim in his wool shirt and corduroys there was a second fig ure too in leather chaps a menac ing and familiar figure holding something in one extended hand while the other hung fisted at his side it took linda all of ten seconds to grasp that the something was a gun leveled at dennys heart and that the slim young man was re ferring to herself when he said i tell you she did come with you i saw two horses ride toward that street amp smiths love story magazine in a lightning gesture he swept her into his arms captured her lips with a swift and unnerving violence and kissed her again and again oh ii hate you she cried youyoure a beast mountain and the girl was on your pinto so youre the cur who put a bul let through my hat hoping it was my skull dennys eyes were flinty his chin hard well much obliged slim but well settle that at another time right now im giving or ders came the in terruption in a snarl that made lindas blood turn to ice and sent her on tiptoe to the balcony rail this time ive got the upper hand and im going to pull a deal that will line my pockets with enough dough for a lifetime all in one nice easy swoop get me kicked out of a foremans job will thrill chaser you well both you and andy are going to pay plenty for that deal you wouldnt have been kicked out if you had been on the level you filthy cattle rustler denny fired back as for making andy or me pay what has that to do with your ridiculous demand to see miss carroll and at this hour plenty because im planning to kidnap her and take you along too just as an afterthought and to divert suspicion from myself i had the kidnaping planned right after andy said she was coming and since you chose to make that im promptu getaway from the hotel tonight with her in tow the scheme ought to work out swell especially when itll be your handwriting that goes to andy and her folks demand ing the ransom of course he added with a flourish of his gun if i get good results i may let you live to tell the tale and then again maybe i wont and you think ill write your rotten notes denny ground out why you get back there undo them fin gers and keep em high slim barked weve done too much talking already without getting any where and a little more might make me plug you first and figure how much i needed you afterward but right now i need that carroll dame a darned sight more so come clean and tell me where you hid her linda didnt hear any more her mind that had grasped every word with terrifying clarity had reached a pitch where even threats ceased to have meaning they were just so many words sliding through her brain and above them a voice was pounding do somethingnow now she stared wildly head swimming the room turning upside down and because one object was less famil iar than the rest it caught her eye and stopped spinning it was a huge cartwheel with a polished rim dotted at the spoke ends with oil lamps and hung by chains that merged into one a crude but pic turesque chandelier which resumed its rightful place as the room stopped swirling and lindas stunned mind snapped into action of coursejust the thing a leap from the balcony to the chan delier a surprise drop on that menacing figure below bringing it to the ground gun and all diffi cult yes but not impossible for she had seen the stunt pulled time and again on a movie set there was a chance to be sure that the gun might go off but more than a gam blers chance the shot would go wild perfect plan if it worked the bare flesh beneath her orange pajamas chilled at the thought of that initial leap even her fingers clutching the rail trembled but it was a pair of steady gray eyes that measured the distance from rail to cartwheel a brave heart that shut her mind to the consequences if she failed and opened it deliberately to the situation below in time to hear slim rasp out and i tell you you got just thirty seconds to produce that girl tens gone now and in twenty more youll be laid out like one of your rugs onetwo there was a whirl of legs as linda crossed the rail an orange streak shooting into space then a mighty lurch when her fingers contacted the wheel and the floor rushed up to meet her bringing bedlam with it in a mingling of shouts and oaths a gun thundering then oblivion darlingdarling it was an anguished call the pressure of ten der strong arms that finally brought linda to a wavering con street amp smiths love story magazine sciousness oh my sweet speak to me linda precious denny she whispered oh dearest youre hurt just a scratch where the bullet grazed my cheek butyouyoure all right yes she wriggled experi mentally probably a little black and blue but she raised ab ruptly on one elbow and finding herself in a huge bed in a strange room added in sudden bewilder ment where am i at the lucky d ranch we brought you here a half hour ago but details later right now im interested in only one thing did you mean it when you called me dearest a moment ago oh say you did linda he pleaded say you love mejust a little ive lived an eternity since i saw you make that terrible leap i know you did it to save my life and im no end grateful but what if something had happened to you or you she added the hunger in her eyes matching his own oh denny ive been such a little fool no darling youve been brave adorable and much too good for the blundering fellow who loved you the minute he saw you this morning but tell me you do care for me she told him lips to his arms about his neck clasping him as tightly as he clasped her while sec onds melted in the magic of kisses and it was not until minutes later that she finally thought to ask but slim dennywhat became of him and what made that chan delier come down tell me all o k he sat down on the bed and settled her comfortably against him beginning with the chande lier i might say that the idea of having it raised and lowered on a rope wrapped around nails on the side wall was my own invention and working nicely until you turned acrobat then the nails gave way and slim got the works linda paled you mean he is dead novery much alive in fact but considerably damaged and now in the bunk house being patched up by some of the boys you see a couple of them at silver city be came suspicious when slim followed us over the mountain and they rode after him when they discovered that we werent at the ranch they went on to my cabin arriving just in time to find you unconscious and me half crazy for fear you might be worse than that silly boy linda teased grumpy and stern for hours then suddenly dont he begged remind me what a chump ive been i should have told you the truth about bobs scheme right off bobs scheme linda came up right in his arms what was that a wild attempt to show you the west as you imagined it washard riding a tough mining camp rough necks rolling dice with your honor at stake he grinned in other words a possible cure for the thrill chaser the original plan called for andy to take you over to silver city on some pretext or other but when he was called away and bob wired me to arrange everything at the last minute well he had been so won derful in getting me a job out here when i needed a start that i just couldnt let him down you mean that the whole deal was a frameup staged by a company of actors on location bob got the idea when andy wrote that some movie outfit had leased his mining property for a western naturally the thrill chaser plan called for a breathtaking flip of the dice as a finish in which i would win and save you from the pack however your idea of slip ping away appealed to me more and i had planned to tell you the whole story on the way back to the ranch then the bullets started zipping and not knowing that slim was around i couldnt imagine what was up and decided not to say anything until i found out later i made such a mess of everything that i thought the only sensible move was to let you return wire helene to pull the house party as originally planned and follow you east to try my luck at winning you there helenehouse party linda faltered you know my sister and to dennys quick nod oh then you must be that interesting young man she tried to tell me about interested you mean ive wanted to know you ever since ted sent me your snapshot taken at our southampton place i even wrote helene to fix it for me when she and bob took our house for the summer your house lindas eyes were wide yes im courtney kvale didnt you know but of course not the boys here call me denny short for dennison my middle name andy suggested it when i first came said courtney sounded too park avenue for a cowboy but you are one arent you linda raised eager eyes to his i was at first later andy made me his partner and just before he went east i arranged to buy his in terest in the lucky d which means that youll be a ranchers wife now darling but you wont mind that will you he pleaded mind it lindas heart pranced ill adore it but if you really loved me so much she whispered nestling close why did you ask me to draw that horrid chalk line and tell me to keep on my side of it denny smiled a little well at the time i probably imagined i was afraid to trust myself too close to you honey but now i can think of a much better reason and that is she asked softly for a long minute he looked deeply at her then his head bent down his arms closed tightly about her and he said huskily because chalk rubs out so easily precious and in the next instant his lips flamed to hers in the burning ecstasy of first love a love which dennys kisses were promising would endure

phyllis a whitney barbara sat on a fallen tree trunk near the edge of the woods and turned her back upon the sunset what time had she for sunsets in this complete moment of humiliation now that shed had time to realize the ridiculous depths to which she had sunk she felt more ashamed than she had early in the afternoon when the miserable thing had happened from the veranda of pine lodge came the chatter of voices the late summer guests were gathering for their evening funbridge dancing a group around the piano perhaps singing oh susannah with bill hamptons deep voice in the lead barbara put her brown hands over her ears to shut out any pos sibility of hearing that voice she never wanted to hear it again never never and yet the muffled echo of it sent an unwanted thrill through her a finger of sunlight curious per cornflowerblue haps of this rebel who refused to join in the sunset rites slanted through the trees seeking her out with its rosy touch it tinted the paleblue cornflowers of her thin dress and caught a tiny gleam of red in the neat brown coil of hair at the nape of her neck barbara shrugged away from the warm touch and moved farther into the shade she wished that dark ness would come down and blot her out completely if only that ter rible laughter would stop ringing in her earsher friend adelas high and scornful bill hamptons hearty with amusement if only she could have killed her self broken her neck or even an arm so that they would have been sorry for her but just to fall from the back of an old nag like maude and land practically on her head in a soft bank of pine needles it was too absurd she flushed at the memory even then it mightnt have been so bad if bill hadnt come originally from montana where it appeared people were born with their feet in stirrups bill simply couldnt under stand any one who wasnt able to sit a horse and then to make mat ters worse there was adela who could ride like a rodeo queen the simile was bills and it had amused adela tremendously adela ash heiress to goodness only knew how many millions and accustomed to the most exclusive hunt parties in america being likened to a rodeo queen she had laughed until bills brown face had become one enor mous blush and then she had dug her heels into sorcerers sides so that he had gone off down the trail like the wild streak of lightning he was and bill had been hard put to catch her that was when barbara had tried desperately to follow and had dug her own heels into maudes well covered ribs maude who had been nibbling an appetizer by the way side had been startled and had dashed clumsily after the others with great gallumps that made very little speed and served only to deposit barbara ignobly in her bed of pine needles theyd returned after a minute or two and found her there before shed collected her wits sufficiently to sit up and pick the cones and needles out of her hair would she ever forget bills deepblue amused eyes as hed sat in his saddle look ing down at her eyes that had somehow the look of the west in them and made her feel that if she gazed long enough she might find the reflection of hazy montana dis tances in their depths hurt hed said and she could see his chest shaking with laughter that threatened to break free at any moment she was hurt she felt sore all over inside and out her hairpins were coming loose and so she was certain were her teeth and by looking crosseyed at the end of her nose she could see the big lump of earth on its tip but she couldnt sit there and ache and wait for his laughter to come adela was al ready laughing and that was bad enough she managed a smile that she knew was lopsided and clambered unsteadily to her feet oh no she said im not hurt a bit she hadnt meant to say anything so ordinary shed wanted to make some completely flip and non chalant remark that would show them how unimportant a fall from a horse could be but she wasnt like adela who could think of smart street amp smiths love story magazine wisecracks on the spur of any mo ment she just stood looking up at bill with eyes that felt suddenly enormous because of the tears that were beginning to fill them much as she wanted to she couldnt look anywhere else she stared at bill until his laughter spilled over and crushed her to the last humiliating depths your face looks so odd babs dear adela said i think maude must have stepped on it havent you a hanky bills laughter broke at that deep enormous shattering so that the very pines shook with the echo barbara kept widening her eyes be cause if she squeezed them shut ever so slightly the furious scalding tears would spill over and then bills laughter stopped as suddenly as it had begun and he took an immense snowwhite neatly folded handkerchief from the pocket of his shirt and handed it to her here he said gently take mine she had taken it from him very dignified very stiff said a polite thank you and turned about on the trail hi called adela you forgot your horse but she was running by then wildly blindly through the woods stumbling catching herself against the trunk of a tree then running on again she hadnt stopped until shed slammed the door of her room shut behind her and thrown herself on the bed to fill bills handkerchief completely with muddy tears now hours later here on the edge of the woods she could be calm about the whole affair but no less depressed from the first she had been an impulsive little fool adela had so obviously wanted to go riding alone with bill but bill had been polite enough to ask them both and she had accepted in the face of adelas disapproval adela had every right to dis approve had she not made this vacation possible by paying all barbaras expenses just for the sake of barbaras company it was wrong to suspect sometimes that adela enjoyed having her along be cause she was like a quiet brown little wren and set off adelas blond beauty to perfection thoughts like that werent loyal adela could be so very sweet and generous and most of the time she was had she not befriended barbara back in school when she was just a nobody and adela the most popular girl in their group it was just when some one crossed adelas will that the knife edge showed there was a light crackling of steps on the path behind and bar bara turned about it was adela her golden head rising from crisp white folds of organdy and a scent of jasmine following her feel better after your princeof wales she asked gayly bill and i nearly died laughing i think even sorcerer smiled just so maude didnt join in the merriment barbara said grimly then adelas expression changed come along she said more kindly wed better get started a canoe ride after dark isnt much fun when there isnt a moon barbara stood up listlessly are we going for a canoe ride just you and i i was invited for a swim but i told bill id better stay with you this evening after all youve had a bad day adela went ahead down the path toward the lake and barbara found cornflowerblue herself following indifferently so bill had invited adela for a swim well why not she was a marvel ous swimmer a spectacular swim mer with all the graceful diving and perfect strokes that went to make up an exhibition performance while she barbara had only two or three steady plugging strokes that were not notable for form but that man aged to keep her above water adela was chattering on and on about bill barbara found herself listening suddenly intent so here i am babs darling headoverheels in love and with a wild man from montana some deep secret little thing in barbaras heart winced and twisted youve been in love before she said dryly adela gave a quick backward glance over one shoulder the child grows cynical but its the real thing this time i might even go through with it and marry him and live on a ranch dont be weird hell have to give up the ranch not enough money to keep it going id get dad to give him a real job hashas bill said anything yet no of course not adela tossed her bright head thats what makes the game exciting he likes me tremendously but he doesnt know yet that he cant live without me the path dipped abruptly toward the water and they could see the landing below them framed by the sweeping branches of a willow the canoes bobbed with every ripple of the shining water and the boatman sat at the end of the wharf his legs dangling a corncob pipe in his mouth he saw them coming and stood up but adela was in no hurry she turned suddenly and looked up at barbara on the path above ill win of course ive never yet lost anything that i wanted ter ribly and i want bill i want him so much that i wouldnt stand for interferencefrom any one not even you barbara stared not even me what in the world do you mean you know what i mean do you suppose i didnt see those moon struck eyes of yours this afternoon when you sat there on the ground staring at him as though youd never seen the man before i wont have you making yourself pitiful it may be your only weapon but youre not to use it hes such a big soft ninny of a manas far as his hearts concernedthat hed fall in love with a caterpillar if he got sorry enough for one she turned about and went down the path to the landing all sweet ness now and charm so that the boatman bustled about fetching ex tra pillows from the other canoes barbara took his horny hand numbly and slipped into one of the low seats she felt chilled shocked terrified her fingers were stiff as she dipped her paddle in the rosy waters the canoe slid away from the landing and out onto the wide glassy world of the lake how really awful of adela to accuse her ofof making herself pitiful in order to attract bill ill go home tomorrow she said quietly its been kind of you to bring me here but of course i couldnt stay after this adela raised her paddle and twisted about in the seat ahead so that the canoe swayed dangerously dont be ridiculous i apologize ii lost my head for a minute it wouldnt do at all to have you leave suddenly in the middle of our stay street amp smiths love story magazine ive never yet lost anything that i wanted terribly said adela and i want bill i want him so much that i wouldnt stand for interferencefrom any one not even you barbara was silent the trapped feeling of terror was growing in her heart had there been some truth in the things adela had said had there been some special reason for her tears of shame and her wild stumbling haste in the woods a more important reason than the fact that she had been made ridiculous by her fall from a horse she wielded her paddle fiercely so that adela turned again and looked at her in surprise careful babs dont get ex cornflowerblue cited and spill us overboard the water looks icy tonight its get ting much too late for swimming at this hour though i wouldnt admit that to bill barbara controlled the motion of her paddle and the canoe slid quietly around a curve of the bank bring ing them in full view of the float and diving board out above deep water and at that first quick glimpse of the float and its lone occupant barbara knew the answer to all her questioning she was in love with bill through some cruel prank of fate the very sight of him tall and brown poised at the end of the board sent a sick feeling of despair through her body adelas eyes were upon bill too and adela in the twilight was goldenwhite and lovely and fragile her bright lips were parted and her breath came quickly as she waited for bill to see her the canoe drifted along the smooth surface and barbara found herself leaning a little to one side so that her own small brown face looked up at her from the mirror of the water what chance had a face like thata face that seemed all wide eyesagainst adelas golden beauty and even if there had been a chance even a tiny sliver of a chance she must not take it be cause of the debt she owed adela what did it matter that adela had turned suddenly cheap and rather dreadful when the debt she owed stretched back through all the years of adelas kindness she looked at the diving board in time to see bills lean hard body cut the water in a clean knifethrust of a dive bill did everything well just as adela did what a pair they would make when she barbara did anything spectacular it was only because she lost her head and followed the first call of any impulse that stirred her that was why she always ended in humiliation and shame bill pulled himself up the ladder of the float and waved one long arm at the canoe watch this one girls its new just perfected he ran lightly out upon the board steadied himself for an in stant drew a deep breath and shot into the air up and up with all the grace and vigor of his youth then over and back down but the dive was new and hed misjudged his distance barbara clapped a horrified hand to her mouth to stifle the scream that rose as bills dark head cracked sharply against the edge of the board just before he disappeared into the water she did not know that adela was whimpering wildly in the other end of the canoe she did not know that she herself had risen precariously to her feet she knew only that her whole body ached with the effort her eyes were making to see down through the center of that widening arc of rip ples then still only half conscious of her actions she kicked off her slip pers and stood up on the seat of the canoe while the boat rocked wildly beneath her then she was in the water adelas scream as the canoe went over ringing in her ears the first shock was icy deadening the surface of the lake closed above her head and she could feel the downward drag of her clothing then she was up again cutting through the water toward that ter rible place where bill had dis appeared a great breath of air filled her lungs before she plunged downward again her eyes fighting street amp smiths love story magazine the cold black depths of the lake oh god let her find him let her find him quickly before it was too late she had to find him without bill all the brightness and life would have gone out of the world she dived again and struck into his body floating near the surface she clutched at it wildly lifting his head working furiously with her feet and one free arm to keep them both on top it seemed that she would never get enough air to breathe again and bill was so dead and heavy in the water she could feel her strength slipping weakly away while her mind sharper than it had ever been worked like light ning focusing now here now there on every possibility of safety the diving float was appallingly far away and so too was the shore line she might make the float but the possibility of clinging to it and holding bill above water would be beyond her strength the thought of adela returned with a shock and her eyes swept the lake and dis covered the overturned canoe drift ing steadily toward the opposite shore for the moment there was no sign of adela it would be better then to try for land perhaps she would find shallow water as she neared shore she struck out valiantly her left arm holding bills chin above water while with her right she struggled for a slow progress her thin dress was heavy impeding her every movement her heart pounded in her ears and each gasp of breath tan talized her and made the next one more difficult she thought of screaming but dis missed the idea immediately she was too far from the hotel to be heard above the singing and the music and her breath was too precious to be wasted in futile effort one more stroke one more gasp of air one more tired drag of her left arm then the whole process must be repeated a sudden wild movement of her burden sent a splash of water into her mouth and nose she choked and released her hold for an instant backing away in the water the clarity of her horrified mind told her instantly what had happened bill had re turned to halfconsciousness and finding himself in the water had be gun the natural struggles of a drowning man she was frightened now more frightened than at any moment since that terrible crack of bills head against the diving board there had been a chance of reaching safety with bill unconscious but bill conscious was a menace to them both a tiny spot of gold far away toward shore caught her eye adela she called her voice scarcely more than a whisper adela help then bills hand closed brutally upon one shoulder dragging her be neath the water as she went down she caught a single glimpse of his staring unseeing eyes and she knew that in that instantand through no fault of his ownhe was com pletely mad she struggled fiercely against the grip that was drowning them both twisting her shoulder wildly away from his fingers once as they came to the top together choking fighting she broke away only to be clutched again and dragged under when they reached the top once more she found that she was fight ing insanely for her own lifeas in sanely as poor halfconscious bill was fighting for his and in the horrified instant of her realization a sudden cool reserve of strength came lsa cornflowerblue to her and her mind cleared what was it she had read about drowning people being easily knocked out she broke away and lifted a brown fist in the water bill floundered toward her at once and she struck him with all her might straight between the eyes he slumped at once and she caught his head and held it firmly above water the remainder of her struggle toward shore was a night mare of agonized effort of tiny gasps of air coming like knife thrusts to her tortured lungs of weary muscles striving to do her bidding in the end she was barely conscious of shallow water of mud beneath her feet and of adelas strong white arms dragging bill to safety then her knees sagged and a black wave engulfed her when consciousness returned she found herself lying half out of the water her cheek against a bank of mud her eyes staring into the mud stiffened grass of the shore edge with an effort she sat up and saw adela on the bank above her kneel ing beside bills limp body working with strong sure hands to force the water from his lungs adela glanced at her sharply are you strong enough to go for help wearily barbara dragged herself to her feet ii think i can make it is hewill he hell be all right barbara turned and stumbled to ward the path something was puzzling her knocking insistently at the back of her mind some question to which she had to know the answer adela why didnt you help me dont be a fool adela tossed her wet curly head the two of you might have dragged me down if i had besides i was half drowned myself after the sudden way you ducked me into that icy lake it was lucky for you that i was able to swim for shore and was here in time to help you in i see said barbara quietly the singers on the hotel veranda greeted her with shocked little cries as she strode suddenly out of the dusk and up the steps why barbara my dear youre absolutely soaked babs did you fall in the lake wheres adela whats hap pened and over and over again from all sides the word adela barbara steadied herself carefully against pillar of the veranda bill hampton was nearly drowned adelas all right shes giving him first aid now youd better go down there right awaysomebody she swayed a little but they were no longer listening to her words two of the boys had vaulted the veranda rail and the rest of the party streamed after them she waited a moment for her strength to return and then went to her room the tall mirror on her closet door gave back her dreadful reflection her blueflowered dress had been torn half away from one shoulder her brown hair was a limp untidy mass caked with mud along one cheek she slipped out of her torn wet clothes and put on a heavy beach robe then having soaked some of the mud from her face she went back to the veranda she was just in time to witness the return of the crowd from the lake they had lit torches of pine and the flickering light fell upon up turned faces as the group came up the hill bills face white and smil ing as he stumbled along aided by a strong shoulder on either side lsa street amp smiths love story magazine dont be a fool adela tossed her head why should i have helped you save bill the two of you might have dragged me down go to the hotel for help quickly adelas golden hair glinting in the torchlight her lovely body molded by her wet white dress two of the boys had made a cradle for her of their crossed hands and she sat in it swinging her bare feet a triump phant young princess she was talking her voice gay cornflowerblue poor kid you mustnt blame her and you mustnt laugh at her ill never forget the frightened look on her face when the canoe went over a voice in the background spoke up she might have helped you at least then adela again thats not nice of you jerry you know she doesnt swim very well i think it was marvelous of her to get herself to shore and help drag bill in when i gave out adela youre so generousa girls voice tense with worship and then bill suddenly hush shes up there on the veranda to barbara it was as though a sudden pit had yawned sickeningly at her feet leaving her with the knowledge that on all sides there was empty space waiting to suck her down she closed her eyes for an instant against the dizzy precipice so adela had done this to her kind generous adela who was her friend then she raised her lids again and her gaze fell upon bill as he came up the steps a warm flood of thankfulness filled her what did it matterso long as bill was alive and well if it was glory adela wanted very well she would give her glory she would give her the thing she wanted so desperately that she was willing to lie and cheat for it and when the giving was done she barbara would be free of adela out of her debt forever they came up the steps noisily and she waited muffled and small in the great towellike folds of her robe are you all right she asked as the two men who had been carrying adela lowered her to the veranda ill say she is bill said quickly shes got the strength and nerve of three men i must have been a handful out there in the lake barbara could see adelas eyes upon her in the lamplight from the veranda cold watchful treacherous you were a handful barbara said and adela broke in quickly never mind that come along babs and help me into some dry clothes well have to celebrate cried the girl with the worshiping voice we dont have heroines up here every day in the week right agreed jerry a party in adelas honor get you gone woman and into your glad rags adela with laughter on her lips and vigilance in her eyes came quickly across to barbara and took her arm itll have to be a party for us both i couldnt have managed alone you know come babs but barbara had no intention of leaving the security of her railing until she had taken her stand and allayed adelas fears you were wonderful she said gently ii thought hed pull you under for good once or twice adela had the grace to wince but only barbara saw bill was laugh ing ruefully you ought to have let me sink my dear im not worth one pretty golden hair of your head i cant remember a thing that happened after that crack until the time when i came to with you working over me but i must have been a terror you were barbara repeated with a reckless little laugh she must say it nownow before this growing weakness and nausea swept her away ii saw it all from the bank if she hadnt struck you youd have both been drowned but she did and then pulled you in knocked me out eh said bill street amp smiths love story magazine brave girl did i put up any kind of scrap when you got me to the bank adela shook her bright head you were limp as a rag when i turned you over to babs and you didnt even start to wake up until i caught my breath and got to work on you very gravely bill bent and kissed her full on the lips while the others cheered and barbara leaning against the rail closed her eyes against the dizziness that pulled her down she mustnt faint not herenot now this was adelas moment and she must do nothing to spoil it then somehow they had all swept away and into the lodge adela a laughing white watersprite in their midst barbara felt her way to the steps and crept weakly down them it was only a short dis tance to her log at the edge of the woods and she made it on wavering feet then she sank gratefully down upon its mossy side and closed her eyes she had done her part she was finished she could be nothing but a spoilsport at the party and if she stayed away she would never be missed the others did not want her she had seen their looks of de rision and scorn tomorrow she would slip quietly away from pine lodge and never see bill again never see him again never see his dear brown face and laughing eyes that was where the pain be gan a mist of tears came before her own eyes and suddenly she was down upon the ground beside the log her head pillowed against one soft arm while the sobs broke raggedly in her throat she felt the light upon her before she saw it and raised wet lids to its glare there was some one stand ing there turning a flashlight upon her go away she cried couldnt they leave her alone in her misery sorry said bills deep voice from beyond the gleam i didnt mean to startle you but i had to find you barbara wept into her closed fin gers oh why did you why cant you go away and let me be because bill said i had to ask you a question or two wont you try to answer me she looked up then straight into the yellow light and he moved the torch mercilessly and laid it upon the log so that its long beam fell upon his own face as well as hers there are one or two things i had to know he went on and since you saw most of what hap pened i wanted you to tell me youre quite sure i wasnt conscious at all on the beachdidnt put up any kind of fight while you were near me she shook her head wearily adelas already told you you were only conscious once and that was out in the lake the rest of the time you were just a rag doll i see he said gravely and sud denly he was kneeling there in the grass spreading something beside her on the log this is what bothers meif the only time i put up a scrap was out in the lake when you were completely out of reach how do you account for the fact that when i came to on the bank i was clutching this in one hand barbara stared at the thing on the log it was a torn scrap of blue flowered materialthe cap sleeve ripped from her blue dress there was nothing to be said no explana tion that would serve she could only look at it dumbly while her cornflowerblue heart commenced a wild pounding in her throat bill took her hands gently into his own big ones shall we go up and spoil adelas party barbara started up from the log oh noplease bills laugh was a joy to hear i knew you wouldnt want to youre too brave and sweet and honest oh no no im not i was afraid out there in the lake i was afraid you were going to drown me and i wanted desperately to live so you continued to risk your life to get me to safety just as you risked it earlier today when it was perfectly obvious that you were frightened to death of a horse thats the kind of courage we like in the west my dear thats why youre going back there with me back there with you he was laughing againa tender mocking laugh do you think for a minute that id take no for an answer sweet little barbara ive been trying to get you alone ever since i met you but adela was play ing dragon she played it again to night when i asked you both for a swim she said you were afraid of the water when it was cold and she didnt want to leave you and all the time she thought i didnt know she was lying butwhy did you kiss her to night because she all but asked for it because that was the pay she wanted and so i gave it to her right on her sweet lying lipswith a kiss that was a lie but i didnt kiss her the way im going to kiss you big arms swept about her sud denly and firm lips came down upon hers and barbara knew that never in all her gay spoilt life had adela ash been kissed like that after a long interval bill lifted her in his arms baby he whispered ive got to look after you from now on off you go to bed and youre not to get up till noon tomorrow after that well go into the details thatll turn you into a ranch wife back in montana back in montana somehow it sounded like home her head drooped wearily against bills shoul der as he carried her toward the lodge but her heart was singing an endless little song of its own and not even bill saw that in one small brown fist she clutched for a talis man a tiny scrap of cornflowerblue

mist on the very aira mist through which shadows danced and whirled and through which she saw jack standing where she had left him looking after her his broad shoulders drooping his hands dan gling in loose dejection at his sides there were tears in her eyes she brushed at them with angry fingers her lips trembled and she bit them still with pinching teeth crazy eyes crazy lips she thought wanting to cry for one of hilda brians lovers crazy heart ach ing over a man who could treat her so back in her room at last she found det henderson sprawled on the couch they shared together she sobbed out

phil that he would take money from a woman make love to her for money why jack doesnt even know hilda brian doesnt want to you all that stuff about jack it doesnt sound like him some way how did it

say what it was phil was mixed up in did he say it was going to get out did he tell you how when breathless questions that det threw at dawn through fright ened lips questions that before dawn could answer she had shrugged away with her old hard as nails air never mind forget it she said and added bitterly if all youve got against that jack of yours is an affair with hilda brian youre darned lucky there are worse things a boy at school can do than chase a woman particularly a woman old enough to be his mother thats just it dawn wailed if she were a girl my own age id know what to do but

down on them blazed at them and were gone they came at last to a place where the road forked and where a sign showing white in the moon light pointed to the dells phil slowed his car he said do i have to ask you where were go ing he grinned and dawn an swered no it would be the dells for me tonight if i had to crawl it was a sprawling logribbed house the dells set far back from the road in a grove of trees a graveled drive leading up to its brightlylighted entrance made a horseshoe curve back to the high way again but at the side fenced in by rustic shrub edged rails was a gate marked private because she had been there before dawn knew that it was through that gate one reached the home of poke brian and his wife hilda and shivering she stared at it morbidly curious anything that concerned hilda brian sent hate chills down her spine inside the crowded tavern waiters were hurrying back and forth threading their way between the close packed dancing throng there was the throb and beat of music soft laughter the clink of glasses and the snap of corks and from behind a baizecovered door the whir of the roulette wheel and the click of the ivory balls settling into their tiny groves phil found a table it was far off to the side of the room and near a door marked private too dawn knew about that door as she had known about the gate that it led to the house where hilda lived and she stared at it with the same hate chills pricking her phil gave their order and the waiter brought it put it on the table before them dancing couples passed them joggled their arms there were people from town and people from school some dawn knew and some she didnt but phil seemed to know them all and an swered their nods as he sipped his beer and followed with nervous tapping fingers the musics beat poke brian himself making his regular rounds sauntered by and stopping not far beyond them leaned carelessly against the wall poke brian was a huge man with the body of a wrestler and a hand some battered face and dawn stared at him fascinated following her eyes phil said and smiled wryly and jack laird is playing around with that guys wife a fat chance hell have if poke brian ever finds out why crazy as that fellow is about his wife hed kill them both as though drawn by dawns stare pokes eyes met hers they were small eyes steely and narrow slitted and beneath them dawn dropped hers shuddering to her plate and she thought of jack meeting this mans wife secretly of his kissing her making love to street amp smiths love story magazine with her hand over the phone dawn whispered a little breathlessly its phil det he wants to date me do you care if i go id like to show jack he cant boss me around forgotten bride her in hidden places and she wiped with shaking fingers at her cold lips all right to say she hated jack all right to try and think so but if anything should happen to him a boy shuffling up touched phils arm a haggard youngold boy with a gray face and shaking hands startled dawn raised her eyes and saw him heard his low pleading whine and phils guarded not here you fool cant you see im not alone with a shock of sick understanding dawn clutched at his sleeve phil thats dopey shaw i know him hes in my history class hes a drug fiend oh phil phil thats what jack meant thats the scandal youre mixed up in drug peddling on the campus how awful phils glass crashed to the floor dont you know any better than to blurt out a thing like that where folks can hear mind your own business and ill take care of mine then in a sullen whisper you came to see hilda brian didnt you well forget me a minute and look shes over there by the door now poke brians wife chapter ii in quick answer to phils gaze dawn swung to see the door beside which they sat open and through it came a tall woman with fair pale hair and huge gray eyes and lips that seemed to dawn in a sudden passion of envy the most beautiful lips in all the world and seeing them dawn forgot about phil forgot about dopey shaw and his pitiful twisting face forgot about everything but that those lips were hilda brians lips and that jack had kissed them as though he would ever want to kiss me again she thought miser ably as though any man would ever want to kiss any one else after kissing her in a stupor of unwilling awe dawn watched as hilda brian walked gracefully toward them watched as she reached their table and hesitated shivered to her nearness to the fragrance of her body she thought wildly shes going to stop shes going to speak to me if she does i cant stand it ill scream but she didnt she passed and reaching pokes side her low pitched vibrant tones carried back to dawns ears you wont need me tonight will you dear ive a headache and id like to lie down and something else too something that dawn couldnt catch it was whispered so close to pokes bent ear but that it was about her dawn knew for she saw pokes eyes shift to where she sat saw him smile and nod and then hilda was passing her table again and looking directly at her a straight unswerving gaze that in spite of everything dawn could do drew and held her own dawn felt her flesh tingling felt her heart a choke in her throat beautiful eyeseyes like a cool gray sea enveloped her beautiful lipsgentle softlycurving lips smiled at her such a wistful ghost of a smile a smile that pulled at dawns very soul a little wildly dawn thought its as though she were asking me to like her and she clung to the hate in her heart with frantic hands but it was so hard to hate a woman with a smile like that so terribly hard dawn felt a strange sick sense of release when she disappeared through the door once more and street amp smiths love story magazine turning to find poke brian at their table his fingers on phils shoulder she listened in dull uncomprehen sion to his blunt shortspoken words hardly realized at first that he was speaking of her this girls name is arden isnt it barnes dawn arden you are to get her out of here and keep her out why missuss orders she doesnt like young kids like her coming here and then he said some thing else in a hoarse whisper close against phils ear something about a raid got wind of it just now bet ter get along im chasing all the col lege gang and his broad shoulders were swinging down the room stopping here stopping there whispering to this one touching that one alone phil was grinning down at dawn in reckless impudent whitetoothed mocking so what he said you heard orders from the missus im to get you out and see that you stay out know where that came from dont you and whos behind that sure dawn said and her eyes were bitter jack hes seen hilda brian since this afternoon hes told her not to let me come here any more hes afraid ill say something to her maybe or she to me but ill show him she held out her arms her cheeks crimson with defiance lets dance she said if they get me out of here tonight theyll throw me out phil laughed but shook his head theres a raid due he said poke just warned me were scramming one thing i cant stand just nowany kind of fuss with the police come along gal were beating it now they had just risen to their feet dawn straining obstinately against phils compelling hands when the cry came a boys high and shrill as a girls with fright the cops scram before the last word had left his lips the lights were out cling ing to phils arm struggling in the murky darkness dawn felt a strong hand pulling at her and close against her al most in her ear she heard poke brians husky whisper that you barnesyou and the arden kid youre to get her in the house part quick here im holding the door for you in you go its steel see and theres a lock when its safe ill let you out in with you now and then the door was closing behind them a soft perfumed dark ness was enveloping them and dawn found herself pounding with futile fists against a thick paneled wall have a heart phil cautioned be still cant you if you dont know a lucky break when you get it i do didnt i tell you i couldnt afford any tieup with the cops now lsa forgotten bride you heard poke were doing what he says were waiting here until he lets us out if we wait all night how long dawn stood there sobbing pounding she couldnt have told seconds probably to her it seemed an eternity but as her eyes grew accustomed to the soft darkness and saw there the comforting security of everyday thingschairs tables booklined wallsher panic left her and some thing almost like curiosity took its place this was her roomhilda brians room the rugs she walked on the books she read might as well be comfortable phil said and found an easy chair he even lit a cigarette and in the glare of the match dawn saw his face pale and tense but brighteyed with excitement across from her on the far side of the softlycarpeted room a nook of deep set windows gave out on a terraced garden they were open for dawn saw dimly the stirring curtains and felt the cool night wind on her hot cheeks making her way toward them dawn leaned against the wide sill the moon hung its golden lantern from a stardotted sky a cricket chirped on the window ledge almost beneath her hand yellow chrysanthemums in a huge blue bowl sent their spicy fragrance through the room she pushed them aside and leaned her hand still resting against the heavy vase to stare out beyond the tree line where the highway ran a white ribbon in the darkness cars were honking on the other side of the rooms thick walls came shouts and cries and muffled laughter but in the little shrubenclosed yard below her eyes the beauty and the stillness caught at dawns breath like a sob in the magic of the lowriding moon the lawn had become a shimmering golden sea with a tiny vinecovered porch awning gay jutting out into it like a ship a ship in full sail dawn thought and she pictured herself on it with jack sailing out into that golden sea away from all this trouble and sorrow and shame she was still staring at it blinking back the lonely heartsick tears that filled her eyes when she saw the white flutter of a womans dress a woman who while dawn watched her walked slowly down the steps and out into the moonsprayed night that she was hilda brian dawn knew would have known it she thought had the night been black as pitch because of the creep ing chills that shook her there was a man with her too from where dawn leaned she could see his tall darkclothed form and the white blur that was his face and she thought with a scornful twisted lip how cheap she is meeting her lovers here at her home under her husbands very eyes lying to him telling him she had a headache and then sneaking out to meet a man if jack could see her now she thought if jack could only see her a walk of mossy flags skirted the yard and passing under the window where dawn leaned led to an out side gate watching dawn saw them leave the shadow of the porch and start down its narrow length toward her and suddenly her heart choked her and the blood pounded against her temples for the mans face wasnt a blur any more it was a darkeyed thincheeked familiar face jacks face and dawn was lsa street amp smiths love story magazine in awe dawn watched hilda brian a tall woman with fair hair huge gray eyes and lips that seemed to dawn the most beautiful in the world lips that jack had kissed as though he would ever want to kiss me again after kissing her she thought miserably leaning against the sill hidden in the shadow of the fluttering cur tains sick and faint and weak she thought if he looks up hell see me she tried to move and couldnt her feet were lead tons of lead weighing her down her body was like a frozen body it forgotten bride was so cold and white and still if she could only move away from that window they were talking and their voices drifted up to her muffled and soft in the thick soft night there was a laughhildas laugh huskily caressing and a tender darling i hate to let you go but youd better poke will be coming any minute now and its dangerous your being here like this and about the child dawns fists clenched her cheeks burned she means me she thought shes talking about me street amp smiths love story magazine and laughing i can hear the laugh in her voice about dawn ill see she doesnt come here again leave that to me i warned poke to night and suddenly before dawn could move or tear herself away those beautiful white arms had crept up and were about jacks neck and those beautiful laughing lips were whispering against his face wont you kiss me jack before you go wont you tell me you love me i need itoh so terribly my very very dear and dawn had her hands before her eyes and was praying make me blind god make me blind and deaf it was phil calling her name that brought her about in stunned sur prise she had forgotten he existed had forgotten that he was in the same room or the same world dawn he was crying as he hur ried toward her whats the mat ter what are you seeing out there in the garden ghosts but halt ing beside her his eyes followed hers and his breath became an in drawn whistle whew hilda brian and jack laird and theres poke nowhes opening the door hes coming in hes right behind us if he catches them down there those twohell kill them both and then poke was behind dawn his breath hot on her cheek and caught by the tenseness that held both dawn and phil poke was whispering too whats wrong with you kids whats going on out there move overlet me see dawn had no time to think no time to analyze the emotions that prompted her primitive facts beat against a mind suddenly as primitive as a childs down there in the moonlight be low the window where she stood was jack his arms about hilda her lips against his in a second unless she did something poke brian hildas husband would see him there and kill him kill jack and with a frightened sob and a wild crazy sweep of her arm dawn grabbed the first thing her fright ened fingers could touchthe huge blue bowl with its heavy freight of flowers and water and sent it careening madly toward the floor and pokes feet to those two people below that opened window the crash coming against the sudden silence as it did must have sounded like the crack of doom dazedly dawn was conscious of them conscious of jacks white upturned face and of his startled distended eyes swifty almost as the click of a camera lens their gaze met and held then poke the window and what lay beyond it forgotten was nursing an aching ankle and swearing softly to him self and phil had his fingers on her arm and was dragging her toward the door while across an empty dance hall where hurrying waiters cleaned and righted and sorted lay the night and phils waiting car they were on their way back to town before so it seemed to dawn she had begun once more to breathe phils hands were trembling on the wheel his lips were trembling he was laughing beneath his breath hysterical almost as a woman you certainly wrecked old poke he said knocking those flowers on him the way you did but if you hadnt gosh it would have meant murder sure as im living a double murder forgotten bride dawn began to cry harsh jerky sobs she felt like a rag wrung dry miserable forlorn she wanted to die i hate jack laird she choked i hate him phil patted her shoulder in awkward comforting youre a squareshooter he said i dont blame you for hating him but you sure saved his life and hers and he added in awed admira tion the nerve of laird kissing pokes wife under old pokes very windows sure wish i had his nerve heaven knows im going to need it he drove for a while in silence his eyes on the road before him his lips sober at last he said dawn you know all right that im in a mess and i think you know by this time what it is or guess its drugs and looking down at her pinched white face he said pity ingly heaven knows youve got troubles enough of your own you poor kid but maybe listening to mine will help you forget them ive got to

for her own trouble was too great and too near jack and poke brians wife jack and poke brians wife the words were a hum in her ears a drone to the drone of the engine at the curb before the house at last phil stopped he said well here we are at the sound of his voice and the harsh rasp of his brakes two people kissing in the shadow of the veranda steps broke apart the girl swung toward them the door light white on her face it was det seeing phil her face tightened for an instant set in stern young lines but only for an in stant then with a taunting laugh she waved at him and ran through the door phils mouth twisted into a grotesque mockery of an answering smile he tried to speak and groaned shaken out of her grief dawn stared up at him shocked at the lost misery of his eyes he put his arm about her im a rotter im a nogood i deserve what dets handing me but it hurts ii wish youd kiss me good night dawn im so unhappy dawn said im unhappy too phil and lifted her face to his and they kissed seeking comfort from each other sharing each others misery then dawn climbed wearily out so long phil and phil an swered ill be seeing you and stepped on the gas street amp smiths love story magazine i wish i had let poke brian find you cried dawn do you know that he was right behind me while you were kissing his wife do you know that if i hadnt saved you he would have seen you there and killed you both dawn was halfway up the steps leading to her sorority house when she saw jack hidden by a clump of bushes be side the balcony rail he had been waiting for her and stepping out forgotten bride held his hands up to her in a quick humbleness of pleading dawn he cried darling tonight at the dellsyou saw me i know i heard a crash and looked up and there you were staring down at

something ive got to tell you but i cant tell you to night ii cant i promised to morrow swaying where she stood dawn looked down at him and her face was frozen and white and cold not tomorrow nor a thousand to morrow she said there isnt time enough in this world nor the next to explain away what i saw and heard this night then in a flaming rush of anger red anger that blurred her sight and shook her speech i wish i hadnt knocked that jar off onto poke brians feet i wish id let him find you do you know that he was right behind me while you were down there beneath that window kissing his wife do you know that if i hadnt saved you he would have seen you there and killed you both she ran up the steps at the top one she stopped to fling back over her shoulder this is goodby i never want to see you or hear your voice again as long as i live to drown his answer she slammed the heavy door behind her but it stuck and she wasnt soon enough as she pounded her way up the thickcarpeted stairs as she clicked through the hallways and rattled at the door of her room his words were ringing in her ears and timing their threat to the throbbing of her pulses and to the angry tumult of her heart whether you want to or not he had cried after her youre going to see me and youre going to listen to me too dawn arden if i have to kidnap you to make you to be continued successful aid in preventing colds at the first nasal irritation or sniffle apply vicks vatronoljust a few drops used in time it helps to avoid many colds entirely two sizes c c fires of love by patricia ellsworth gloria slid her small trim foot into the second of the scarlet moccasins the old squaw had brought in that morning and stood up to inspect herself in the mirror a mischievous smile dimpled about her cupidsbow mouth her warm brown eyes danced she was thinking of the tall red haired young fellow with whom for the past two weeks she had been playing the old old game of love but in a new fashion gloria knew that red mckenzie was inter estedhe couldnt help being men up here in this north country were no different than they were on park avenue that is they were no dif ferent in respect to falling in love with gloria the only thing was fires of love that this broadshouldered steady eyed young alaskan had the power of hiding behind a mask of appar ent indifference whatever he might be feeling her smile faded to a look of pensive reflection gloria was won dering what kirk ralston would say if he could see her now his cynical eyes would go slowly over her outfitthe scarlet furlined moccasins with heavy wool trousers tucked into their tops the redand black plaid shirt open at the throat to reveal a vshaped section of smooth white skinand after a lei surely survey hed certainly nod his approval ripping winter sports costume glory old thing she could hear him drawl and after all it was important what kirk would think because in the endno matter how many hearts she might break in this coun try of black silent forests fierce rushing blue rivers and raw virgin goldit was kirk whom she would marry that had been tacitly set tled ever since gloria left finishing school but the tall slender girl in the colorful costume had no intention of letting thoughts of kirk hamper her red mckenzie had so far baffled her most expert attempts at heart breaking he might be interested but he refused to show it wait till he sees me tonight she thought and suddenly became aware of the rush and roar of the storm wind outside her window inside the road house where her fa ther had left her while he made a flying trip to one of his mines it was warm and cozy but out there where night was beginning to add its terrors to the tumultuous drive of the blizzard men were pitifully out classed gloria raised a beautifully mani cured hand to her wavy brown hair she patted it into place turned her head with the proud motion of a thoroughbred and again smiled at the girl in the lookingglass youre a rascal she said in a low thrilling voice and tonight as usual youre up to rascality she turned and went swiftly into the hall down wide stairseach tread made of a single hewn log and into the big room where sus pended kerosene lamps gave out a cheerful orange light at the farther end of the long apartment a great log fire roared and crackled up the chimney near the center of the room stood a large klondike stove which really furnished the grateful warmth on nights like this the room was deserted save for a solitary figure standing with its back to the stove gloria coming down the last four steps was acutely aware of the steady scrutiny of those enigmatic gray eyes she knew that her entrance was enough to set any mans heart to beating fast then her own heart did a quick little bound and began to race red mckenzie was coming toward her not only that but the mask was gone from his handsome masterful face and his eyes burned with an expression she had never seen in them before gloria he cried just that one word but gloria suddenly knew that neither kirk ralston nor any of the other men with whom she played around back in new york could have said as much in five minutes she stood on the bottom step her duskyred lips parted her cheeks flushed her eyes sparkling suddenly and amazingly she felt the wild impulse to turn and run there was something in that deeply street amp smiths love story magazine tanned resolute face that frightened her i wonder if you know how beau tiful you are he said in a low vi brant voice gloria its no use pretending this is a country where men speak the truth and you glorias feet seemed frozen to that bottom step a tiny voice within her cried fly fly youve started something you cant con trol then she was in his arms her face was against his and gloria found herself marveling at the sat iny softness of his skin he held her close in arms of steel gloria my darling he whis pered huskily ive tried to fight against youyoure the only thing in the world ive ever feared love it can be so terrible but its no use gloria had recovered the use of her lithe young muscles with a sudden twist she freed herself she stood facing him breathing deeply she knew that her eyes were still dancing that her face was flushed but that was just the mechanical reaction to being kissed by a man as handsome and strong as red mc kenzie it had been an interesting experience however this confla gration she had started must be quickly quenched im so sorry she said almost in a whisper redmr mckenzie if ive led you to thinkif youve misconstrued he was looking at her with an expression that made her falter there was amazement in it and something else gloria knew that now her face was blazing for an instant she dropped her eyes before that ac cusing stare then she forced herself to look squarely at him i thought youd remember our comparative circumstances she breathed red frowned he stirred as if he were going to take her in his arms again then he laughed a low scornful laugh you mean that you are the daughter of a wealthy man that youre listed in the social register he asked softly gloria tried to think of some other way of putting it somehow red managed to make the reason back of her conduct so sordid and ugly then she nodded and youve just been playing with me he demanded gloria wished she had never come down those wide stairs she wished shed never come to this north country almost for the moment she wished that shed never been born miserably she nodded again oh red im so sorry i didnt think you didnt think i could feel pain you thought a man like me a rough common person with no backgroundwas just something to be played with and broken and tossed aside his voice was as cold as the storm wind raging outside i see well i can take it and perhaps learn a useful lesson by the experience he turned and went striding across the long mellowly lighted room and out through a door that opened into the kitchen wing gloria stood without moving her lips were parted her eyes were wide and frightened another door over at the farther side opened and a man came through he was not as tall as red but he had enormous shoulders and arms so long and powerful that they fires of love you didnt think i could feel pain you thought a man like mea rough common person with no backgroundwas just something to be played with and broken and tossed aside he gave a scornful laugh made him look like some dangerous animal his eyes were keen and narrow he looked about as if to assure himself that there was no one in the big room except the radiantly beautiful girl at the foot of the stairs when he came across those cruel shining eyes burned into hers ah miss gloria he murmured you are beauteeful to night always you are beauteeful but now see i kneel before you gloria drew back there was something about jacques lacleve her fathers manager up here in alaska that made her flesh creep im afraid i must leave you she mur mured making a move to start up the stairs lacleve was up from his kneeling position with incredible speed and precision he glided before her bar ring her way standing so close that she could see the little flecks of scaly color in his black eyes he was again smiling that evil smile street amp smiths love story magazine this is alaska he said ab ruptly in this country men and women show their true natures my beauteeful darling he swept her up in those long powerful arms gloria twisted side wise and her white pearly teeth sank into the flesh of his shoulder with a snarling cry of pain he dropped her she sprang quickly away jacques lacleve rubbed the place where gloria had bitten him a slow smile spread over his dark menacing face little wild cat he murmured but i like you so my darling and what jacques lacleve likeshe takes he made no move to come closer gloria watched him with abhor rence as soon as my father returns she began lacleve shrugged when he returns i shall be away on business you will tell him what i have done you will have me discharged my beauteeful dar ling i have not been idle during these eight years i work for your father i have feathered my nest i am reech i discharge myself he paused and his burning eyes went slowly and gloatingly over the slender graceful figure of the girl who with flashing eyes and dilated nostrils confronted him but i shall come back he mur mured at a time when you do not expect mei shall come back he gave her a long meaning look then he was gone gloria drew out her handkerchief and viciously scrubbed the spot on her cheek where he had kissed her the wind was rising she moved across toward the big round stove in the center of the room then abruptly she paused and stood in tently listening distant bells and the fierce ex ultant yelp of malemute dogs rac ing for the shelter of the road house the door leading into the kitchen swung open and she saw the vast figure of jake thompson proprietor of the establishment usually his round plump face was wreathed in smiles but tonight he looked grave and uneasy what is it jake gloria de manded a man just came through from the mines miss he told her theres word from your father suddenly gloria was trembling she took an impulsive step toward the man what is it she demanded sharply tell me quickly dont just stand there jake thompson rubbed his chin miss he rumbled if you was to take something a drop of brandy to kind of brace you up she darted across to where he stood seized his shoulders and tried to shake him tell me whats happened she cried is dad sick he got hurt miss but theres a good doctor up there and most likely hell be all right he was un conscious gloria wasnt frightened now that the full force of the calamity had struck her she was steady and resolute ill start for the mines at once she said steadily please arrange everything but jake was shaking his head you cant possibly get up there till this storms over he protested in two or three days maybe gloria stamped her foot the fires of love furlined moccasin made a thudding sound as it struck the log floor do as i tell you she cried im periously dad needs me he may be dying there must be some one who jake backed farther into the open doorway he turned and looked into the kitchen then he faced gloria and drew the door partly shut this musher who came down was nearly trapped by the storm miss he explained in a low voice but theres one man could make it ill talk to him gloria knew she had heard of red mckenzies prowess as a storm fighter and she knew reds male mutes he had given her lessons in driving them for an instant her mind fought against the idea of asking a favor of a man who had talked to her as red had then she thought of her father uncon scious perhaps dying please tell mr mckenzie to be ready as quickly as he can and tell him this is strictly business ill pay him whatever he asks a heavy fur cap that completely hid her shining brown hair a parka furlined and warm as eiderdown mittens gloria was so wrapped away from the storm that she moved with difficulty out through the kitchen where jake thompson stood shaking his head and fearing the worst out through a door that was quickly opened and as quickly closed in that instant the bliz zard struck her so roughly in the face that she gasped and turned her head before she could turn back strong arms swung her from her feet and were carrying her she felt as helpless as a baby dimly through the driving snow she saw the stern impassive face above hers again her heart was pounding like a wild thing red she murmured its so good of you this is strictly business as far as im concerned miss red mc kenzie broke in he stooped and lowered her into the inclosed portion of the long sled out in front their sharp ears tilted forward she could see the dogs a longlashed whip whistled and cracked with the resonance of a pistol shot mush you rascals red cried the sled was flying away from the road house into the storm red ran behind the dogs yelped shrilly and silvery bells attached to their collars tinkled against the wind the yellow lights in the windows of the log building were gone on every side was the raging storm gloria nestled down into the warm space red had placed her in he had tucked heavy blankets about her she turned her head cant you ride she called no answer the dogs were stretched out racing fleetly away into the night red mckenzie ran like a panther behind the long sled suddenly gloria felt how small and helpless she was if hed only be friends she thought then felt her face burning again she hadnt been very friendly she had deliberately flirted till she caught his interest she had set herself to break through the barrier of reserve he had erected then she had pleaded the social register the dogs had settled down to their nights work for a time they went briskly up a long grade then street amp smiths love story magazine they topped the summit and gloria saw the tall figure of her compan ion balancing on the rear of the sled impulsively she spoke redmr mckenzie i wish youd tell me more about your dogs they seem so faithful and strong yes miss theyre good dogs gloria bit her lip he certainly knew how to keep her at a distance she cowered down into the sled and realized how lonely she was out here in this untamed northland at night in a storm that had sent experienced mushers running for cover timidly she looked up at him red if id been born up here if i were used to this wild country and the sled struck the bottom of the grade and red was again running behind hi tillicum hi juno he cried mush gloria bowed her head she squeezed her eyes tight shut but hot salty tears were stealing down her face they froze there and she began to sob abruptly red was again stand ing on the rear platform feet cold he inquired and his voice certainly was no im warm as toast but red abrupt and eerie there came the sound of a longdrawn shout gloria caught her breath and listened the eerie voice came again ahoy mckenzie pull up red mckenzie ignored the sum mons mush you rascals he cried another soundthe crack of a rifle shot the whine of a highpow ered bullet gloria cried out in terror steady give me that carbine red ordered she groped for it and a second cracking shot ripped through the howl of the wind a dog yelped shrilly the team whirled and in an instant they were milling and fighting red leaped among them gloria could see him cutting straps hurling something out of the track of the sled oh red she cried piteously one of your dogs never mind that he snarled back at her steady you rascals tillicumgee there you are he came swinging back and for an instant stood staring toward the back trail hes trying to snipe us miss he muttered its lucky i gave you some lessons in driving a dog team you may have to use it glorias heart was beating slowly heavily a great weight of fear crushed down upon her you mean but they were flying over the trail and red was running at her side he had thrust the carbine back into her mittened hands looking fearfully upward she mar veled at the easy endurance with which he kept up with the flying malemutes a third crashing shotand red mckenzie stumbled and nearly fell he caught at the crossbar of the sled the dogs sensing something wrong slowed to a trot and stopped gloria tried to scramble out an unsteady hand pressed her back got methrough the shoulder red muttered listen miss you can drive the dogs know the trail he swayed drunkenly next in stant he had fallen heavily to the snow he lay very still gloria facing the crisis of her young life took her courage in both hands fires of love quickly she stooped and grasped reds shoulders how heavy he was gloria had never tried to lift a man before she clenched her teeth ive got to she whispered red darling there was a crimson stain seep ing out into the snow the sight of it released an almost superhuman power in her slender body quickly she slid her arms under him and staggered erect a snarling shout from behind and gloria had lifted red into the sled she caught up the carbine whirled and fired into the darkness then the gun was back lying across reds body glorias clear eager voice rang out mushtillicumjuno mush you rascals there was a sob at the end of that thrilling command she was using the words she had so often heard red use and now she was balanced on the rear platform and the dogs were racing with tense traces down a long grade no more shots but she could hear the distant yelps of another dog team she had recognized that hoarse evil voice jacques lacleve had taken advantage of her emer gency and his team would be pull ing a lighter load than reds male mutes something loomed over at the side gloria shaded her eyes from the blinding snow set back from the narrow trail she could just make out the gloomy bulk of a cabin there were no lights in the windows gee she cried tillicum juno they were swerving they took the turn into the narrow gulch al most at full speed and dashed up to the deserted cabin red she panted red dar ling cant you hear me oh i need you so but there was no sound from the motionless figure lying in the sled with flying fingers gloria unfast ened the dogs she crossed to the cabin door and opened it the malemutes trotted into the dark in terior of the building with determined chin raised high she swung back to the sled she got down on her knees slid her round young arms under the figure of the man who had suddenly come to mean so much to her and next moment was staggering across to the open door she laid red on a bunk in one corner a threatening shout roared out suddenly you inside the cabin must i keel you all it was lacleves voice gloria crouched near the shattered window the carbine rested across her knees if she could just see him that evil head poised on those immense shoulders confusedly she found herself wondering at the strange fierce strength that steadied her nerves and quickened her muscles was this the gloria carver who had played tennis at palm beach and newport was this the careless pleasureloving young thing who had been going to marry kirk ral ston because he was the most de sirable man in her set no sound save the mighty voice of the blizzard gloria shivered suddenly gloria tensed some thing was stirring back there the dogs yelped and snarled a gun flamed and one of the male mutes lay kicking street amp smiths love story magazine gloria swung the carbine but the gun was knocked from her clutching hands a dark muffled figure was upon her it caught her in gigantic arms and whirled her from her feet now jacques la cleve was kissing her his face was crusted with frozen snow he rubbed that icy cheek against hers then again his burning lips were seeking her eyes her throat her lips red red but it was not red mckenzie who came driving upon them a huge black dog snarled once and red she panted red darling cant you hear me oh i need you so but there was no sound from the motionless figure lying in the sled launched himself like an arrow for lacleves throat drag him down tillicum gloria cried laclave evidently had figured that that one shot was enough to cow the malemutes now the lead dog had hurled him to the ground gloria panting and shaken had torn herself free from his arms as he went down red she cried red darling then back there in the darkness tillicum was snarling and worrying something gloria saw that lacleve was lying very still and that the lsa fires of love great black dog was merely menac ing his vanquished foe she raced across to the bunk where red lay and began to work furiously once red opened his eyes and tried to mutter a protest leave me youthe dogs but he lay still and silent when she lifted him into the sled then they were again flying through the storm red had said that his dogs knew the trail to the mine gloria alternately running behind and balancing on the tiny platform tried to realize that this was not just a terrible dream it was reality some where in that whirling dark ness ahead her father lay perhaps dying but the thing that brought a sob to her trembling lips was the glint of that white still face almost at her feet red red she whispered unsteadily i do love you why didnt i know it in time the roar of the blizzard and occasionally the sharp yelp of one of the malemutes on and on till gloria believed time had ceased and eternity had begun nothing but black swaying trees and then mush tillicum mush juno mush you rascals there are the lights gloria cried she sat in a warm tastefully fur nished room in doctor tollivers log house the tall ruddyfaced mine physician was bending over the bed he turned and looked wonder ingly at gloria gloria lass i dont see how ye did it redll weigh one hundred and eighty if he weighs a pound ye must have muscles of steel un der that soft warm flesh gloria shook her head impa tiently never mind me she whispered huskily is heis red its only the good that die young my dear doctor tolliver said mischievously hell be con scious any time now gloria stood up her face was radiant and dads coming along all right she asked hes doing as well as ye can ex pect itll be a good four weeks be fore he gets the use of his legs gloria stood looking down at the man in the bed her face had in it a light that made the old scotch doctor shake his head and smile a bit wistfully do ye really love him doctor tolliver asked in a voice that was almost a whisper love red i love him so that im going to stay up in this terrible country just to be with him al ways the old doctor carefully removed his glasses and wiped them then ill let ye into a bit of a secret he said the young rascal came up here five years ago from the states the next year up comes lsa street amp smiths love story magazine a fine gentleman in fifth avenue raiment looking for his son no one by the name he wanted anywhere hereabout but when he set eyes on red mckenzie abruptly the shock of red hair outlined against the snowy pillow stirred red twisted his head and stared belligerently up shut up doc he rasped thats my secret doctor tolliver chuckled ill teach ye to play possum on me and ill leave ye to whisper your own secrets remember nurse ye mustnt excite him gloria sat on the edge of the bed her eyes were wide and wondering whatever did doctor tolliver mean she demanded red grinned he pulled her down beside him tumbled her hair rubbed that smooth velvety cheek of his against her flushed one then he took her face between his strong hands and looked deep into her eyes years ago he explained there was a family of nice people who had an apartment overlooking central park and a summer home up in westchester they were the kind of people who keep their servants till theyre old and then pension them saltoftheearth people all except one member he was redheaded and at the time i am telling you about he had freckles he was the kind of boy who wants to know what is going on in those far places where the jungle crouches warm and steamy in the tropic sun or up where men of iron pit their strength against the great white si lence then one day this boy mis understood something his father did it was done for his good but he didnt see it that way remember he had red hair and a temper which up to that time had never been dis ciplined so he did what many other fool ish young fellows do he ran away he came up here to alaska and every one called him red before long he regretted what he had done but he was too proud to admit that to any one however he wrote a confidential letter to a friend and six weeks later the finest most up right and kindly gentleman in all the world made the long trip by train and steamer and for five hun dred miles by dog sled just to tell him that every one at home loved him they loved him so much that they wanted him to live his own life in his own way all they asked was an occasional letter telling them that he was well and happy red laughed a deep vibrant laugh that made something in glo rias heart begin to dance he had been a spoiled boy back in the old days but the northland taught him that real strength is gen tle never boisterous or selfasser tive red told her perhaps it made a man of him gloria struggled to her elbow her arm went under his neck and she bent over him staring into his laughing gray eyes and then another spoiled young thing came up here and the man they call red learned to love her she said tremulously but red didnt try to answer that in words what use did gloria have for words when red was crushing her close as though he would never let her go when his lips were pressed to hers in a throbbing kiss that thrilled her to the depths of her soul with a sigh of content she relaxed in his arms secure in the knowledge that nothing could ever extinguish the fires of love that burned so brightly in their hearts tender arms by elise phillips tired ward asked as they followed louisa and phil from the ear into the lobby of the piny woods manor im tired and cold and hungry jocelyn replied and im cross wards voice was heavy with sar casm as he said you amaze me oh dont be funny jocelyn dropped into a big armchair her coat collar turned up to her ears her brown vagabond hat drawn down almost to the bridge of her slim small nose your wit is about as light as an elephants foot she surveyed the people sitting and walking about the brilliantly lighted lobby and wondered why she had allowed herself to be per suaded to take this trip she hadnt wanted to leave new york she had been enjoying the parties all street amp smiths love story magazine their friends had been giving since she and ward announced their en gagement but he and phil had got ten the idea that a couple of weeks in pinehurst would be fun and whatever phil thinks louisa agrees to jocelyn told her self shes that kind of wife and ward expects me to be just like her she turned to stare at her sister standing at the desk beside phil and noticed she was getting heavier thats what marriage does to you jocelyn decided suddenly she sat up straight pushing her hat back with an im patient shove look she urged ward look at that man over there his gaze followed hers to where a broadshouldered young man in a dinner jacket sat reading a paper what about him ward in quired with a scowl friend of yours not yet jocelyn replied but isnt he the bestlooking brute you ever laid your eyes on hes got features like a movie star and that sort of cometomedarling look in his eyes im glad i came to pine hurst after all youre a flirt ward growled his hand on her chair knotting into a tight fist jocelyn whirled about to face him cornflower eyes under her curling brown bangs narrowed to slits what do you mean im a flirt cant i even say a perfectly strange man is goodlooking without your getting jealous im not jealous ward denied with sulky dignity but i do think that for a girl who has been en gaged only four weeks you give a lot of time to other men at that moment phil and louisa joined them and jocelyns retort was cut off in the flow of louisas complaints about the rooms assigned them they claim they never got our telegram she said as the four moved toward the dining room but thats ridiculous they finally gave phil and me a room on the second floor youre up on the third jocelyn and ward is on the fourth the clerk says hell try to get us a suite tomorrow they were passing the man with the newspaper and for a second he looked up his eyes meeting joce lyns briefly deliberately knowing ward was watching she smiled an answering smile flashed across the others face jocelyn had been feeling sulky but now a pleasant exhilaration lightened her spirits the man was certainly attractive and just be cause she was engaged it didnt mean that she couldnt even look at another man she became aware of ward stalk ing at her side are you making yourself con spicuous just to annoy me he de manded her good nature restored jocelyn laid a placating hand on his arm dont be cross she soothed youll feel better when youve had something to eat theres no good putting me off with talk about dinner ward re torted and jocelyn looking up into his face saw it was dark with anger her own quick temper flared and her eyes blazed as she stood still confronting him at the entrance to the dining room dont be dumb she snapped im not putting you off with any thing are you still grousing be cause i happened to say with per fect truth that that man out there is handsome tender arms its not only that man ward began its dont tell me its the principle of the thing jocelyn interrupted when any one says that i know hes trying to be disagreeable the truth is youre idiotically jealous and im not going to stand it ward surveyed her in silence a moment his features granitehard an uncomfortably hollow sensation crept over jocelyn a little pulse of fear started vibrating deep inside her she thrust out her hand with an inarticulate cry i didnt mean she began when louisas voice sharp with im patience cut her off what are you two waiting for she demanded come on and lets have something to eat ward stood aside for jocelyn with the hint of a mocking bow when you and your sister have been fed we can continue this dis cussion about what you will and will not stand jocelyn silent and apprehensive preceded him to the table where louisa and phil waited she sank into a seat and slowly peeled the gloves from her hands her eyes were on the big emerald that glowed on her third finger as she waited in silence for her order when it came she couldnt eat her throat was tight and a sense of utter weariness possessed her occasionally from under her long lashes she stole a glance at ward he was talking to phil about golf i think ill go to bed she an nounced suddenly ward turned to her wait a bit it will do you good to get a breath of air before you turn in yes do go outside a while louisa urged she thinks you want to kiss me good night jocelyn observed better come and get it over with or shell be disappointed my sis ter has a romantic soul she led the way from the long room then stepped out a french door onto a gallery running the length of the hotel the autumn air was crisp and fragrant with pines jocelyn stood still for a moment leaning against the rail drawing in great deep breaths of the bracing air ward stood behind her silent then unexpectedly his arms came about her and he pulled her into a tempestuous embrace his cheek pressed hard against the girls i love you he said his voice rough with emotion and you con tinually make a mockery of it if you loved me you wouldnt jocelyn moved her cheek the least bit so the roughness of his rubbed against her tender face his mas culinity seemed to engulf her she felt suddenly suffocated she wrenched free from his hold facing him in the dim light filtering through the windows i do love you she said speak ing slowly and thoughtfully but ive got to be myself i cant be watched and suspected all the time love to me means faith trust unless you can trust me i cant be lieve you love me i do trust you ward broke in but you make it so wretchedly hard you flirt with every man you see there are times when i think youd go off with the first one who asked you jocelyn stiffened rigid with shock so thats what you think of me she pulled the emerald from her fin ger and held it out on the flat of palm take it she cried in spite of herself her voice broke on a sob ward made no move to accept the street amp smiths love story magazine ring she let it drop to the floor and whirled toward the entrance wait he begged striding after her jocelyn i didnt mean some one had come along behind him picked up the ring is this yours the newcomer asked ward and in the moment it took him to accept it jocelyn was gone in her room she dropped to the side of her bed beating her clenched fists against the soft bedclothes the tears she would not shed swelled in her throat she would take the train back to new york in the morning she would get a job as cook scrub womananything shed never see ward again jocelyn shivered feeling herself exiled already she stared about the unfamiliar room with hostile eyes then slowly she undressed pulled a nightgown of palest blue over her head and tied its sash with a jerk she made a little pile on the end of the dressing table of her diamond studded wrist watch her gold com pact and her purse ward had given her the first two she would leave them at the desk for him with a note jocelyn picked up a sheet of pa per but could not find the right tender arms words and pushed it impatiently aside she hated ward she told herself lying in bed hands clenched at her it had been easy for them to see a lot of each other and at first his wanting to monopolize her his open resentment of any time she gave to she awoke suddenly to the sure knowledge that some one was in her room it was a man what are you doing here she demanded trying but not succeeding in keeping a sharp note of terror from her voice sides legs stretched out tense and straight under the covers she re viewed their first meeting it had been at a tennis match last spring seeing him tall and bronzed in his white flannels the men about her had seemed infantile and boring he was it turned out a classmate of phils other men had been exciting she remembered almost as exciting as the night coming home from the theater when he had asked her to marry him she closed her eyes living again his passionate kisses feeling the pressure of his arms that lifted her to breathless heights of exultation street amp smiths love story magazine and now he dared to tell her he couldnt trust her that she was no better than a cheap flirt jocelyns whole body burned with the indignity of it she flung off the blankets sat up in bed taut and furious then she fell back against the pillow sobbing she didnt know how long she had slept when she awoke to the sure knowledge that some one was in her room swiftly without giving her self time to think she jerked on the bed light then blinking in its sudden radiance she saw a pair of blackclad shoulders and the back of a smooth black head what are you doing here she demanded trying but not quite suc ceeding in keeping a sharp note of terror from her voice the intruder turned and she rec ognized the man she had seen in the lobby earlier in the evening he carried a key and a huge silver flask his hair was mussed and he swayed unsteadily howd you get in my room he asked his words coming thick and slurred im not in your room youre in mine jocelyn snapped her mo mentary fear gone in a gust of an noyance the man shook his head and ad vanced toward the bed thats kind of complicom pli you know what i mean kind of mixed up lets have a drink and see if it straightens out jocelyn waved him away in wardly she felt a renewed tremor of fright suppose he tried to make love to her suppose deter minedly she forced herself to speak calmly i dont want a drink and youve had too many already go on get out of here i want to sleep aw whats the hurry my names conroy whats yours he was she saw young and in spite of his being tight almost un believably goodlooking a boyish grin lighted his face now and be fore jocelyn realized his intention he had seated himself comfortably in the chair beside the bed in spite of herself she could not feel angry do have a drink he urged instead she took his key from him and studied its number this is room she told him and your key is for you be long another flight up he stared at her apparently lost in admiration clever of you he said id never have thought of that he got to his feet none too stead ily and started weaving toward the door on an impulse jocelyn swung over the side of the bed shoved her toes into her mules and wrapped her kimono around her id better see that you get to your room she decided if you go breaking into places like this youre apt to get into trouble the mans legs seemed to grow unsteadier as she guided him out the door and up a flight of stairs he walked along the hall with an elaborate caution jocelyn found amusing at the sound of the elevator door clanging shut she felt his arm which she had taken to steady him stiffen under her hold its all right she assured him in the tone one uses to a fretful child then she in her turn grew stiff with horror ward was coming toward them jocelyns hand dropped from her companions arm her tongue was stiff and her mouth dry with an instinctive gesture she pulled the tender arms paleblue silk of her kimono tighter about her she tried to speak failed then tried again managing a husky ward if he saw her it was impossible to guess it head high shoulders squared he would have passed her jocelyn flung herself forward catching at the sleeve of his coat with frantic fingers still without meeting her eyes he attempted to shake her off but jocelyn hung on bringing her flushed face close to his youve got to listen she panted it isnt what you think that man was in my room and thats exactly what i am think ing ward cut in his tone bleak as ice hot blood flamed in jocelyns cheeks her eyes snapped you would she cried im trying to tell you hes tight and got into my room by mistake i must have forgotten to lock the door she drew away from him stand ing stiff and straight and now that ive explained she added i never want to see you again she turned suddenly remember ing she still held the key to con roys room conroy was gone there was a sound of running feet and then conroy came into view closely followed by a tall heavybuilt man in a gray uniform seeing ward the pursuer yelled head him off sir ward went into action bringing conroy down with a flying tackle and holding him in spite of his de termined struggling until the watch man came up now then the latter said sternly i guess weve got you with the goods comisky the man whom jocelyn knew as conroy straightened his lip twisted in a sneer the last evidence of his recent intoxication was gone youre crazy murphy he snarled you havent got anything on me well see about that ill just take a peek in your pockets conroy grew threatening ill have the law on you for this mo lesting a guest shut up murphy ordered he drew from the mans pocket a wrist watch a purse and a jeweled com pact jocelyn staring gave a sharp gasp why those are mine understanding came to her and with it rage you thief she cried you werent tight at all you deliber ately got into my room to steal hysterical laughter shook her her voice rose to a shrill pitch and me helping you upstairs feeling sorry for you a touch on her arm restored her to selfcontrol take it easy miss the watch man counseled thats his regular game but weve never been able to get the goods on him before can you identify these things as yours jocelyn nodded decisively oh absolutely see theres my mono gram on the watch and compact and my name is in the purse mr rutledgeshe turned to ward for confirmationgave them to me yes i did he acknowledged without inflection of any sort at last murphy and his charge were gone and jocelyn found herself in the corridor alone with ward the quiet seemed intolerable to the girl she had quarreled with him before but this flintlike silence was worse than any words she waited a moment longer for him to speak to make some move then with an inarticulate murmur street amp smiths love story magazine she whirled and started along the corridor and down the stairs toward her room her action seemed to galvanize the man she could hear his quick footsteps behind her he was gain ing on her pulses throbbing joce lyn reached her door at that mo ment ward overtook her and crowded into the room beside her startled and strangely appre hensive jocelyn turned to him his hands were clenched at his sides his face was working with emotion jocelyn he burst out dont hate me unexpectedly her legs would no longer support her and jocelyn sank into the nearest chair instantly ward was at her feet head against her knees forgive me he pleaded after you left me i went out and tramped the woods fighting things out with myself i was going to beg you to give me another trial to promise never to doubt you again then i came in found you jocelyn felt him shudder leaning forward she slipped her arms about his shoulders cradled his head against her heart it did look pretty bad she ad mitted softly i dont blame you for thinking dont ward interrupted i was a beast i ought to be shot oh darling i love you so ill never doubt you again im just going to love and trust you always jocelyns arms tightened their hold then ward was kissing her over and over as though he could never get enough of her lips they clung together trembling inco herent with the exultation that surged through them like a ruthless overpowering tide you poor baby were you terri bly frightened when you found that man in your room he asked pres ently jocelyn shook her head not scared just mad i wanted to get him out in a hurry she burrowed her cheek into his shoulder with a little sigh i guess it depends on the man theres one here now and i dont care if he never goes i do well to keep an eye on you ward teased then his tone deep ened became serious some day he began what do you mean some day jocelyn broke in her voice warm and sweet her eyes starry isnt tomorrow as good a day as any for a wedding the gift we gathered rare orchids together for the house by the little lagoon the beach held the magic of twilight that covered the islands too soon the waves were like dancers in silver that tossed their pale stars in the spray but the night wrapped in tropical beauty brought us love then stole softly away charles bancroft the silver duke by beth farrell jans got to get out ma shes too pretty if im to grab a rich husband youve got to give me a fair chance i cant do a thing with jan hanging around men simply fall for her in rows even yesterday when she was helping sukey and looked awful all carle ton vance could see was jan im sick of it anyway youve done enough for her after all shes just a niece of papas she ought to have brains enough to get out and support herself but what would she do was aunt millies plaintive whine i dont care lutie snapped i just know shes going or i am and if i go youll be sorry she finished meaningly lutie aunt millie cried in horror street amp smiths love story magazine janine didnt wait to hear any more but slid out of the swing and through the moonflowers down the back way to anne derrys and as she went her anger grew until it shook her body with fury janine was quite sure that lutie her cousin had known she was in the swing for another thing lutie knew that her cousin janine had given aunt millie ten years of her life so that lutie could stay in an expensive french school of late janine had worked harder than old black sukey who was growing too feeble to do much trust lutie not to lift a finger although she well knew that her mothers modest in come could not keep a higherpriced servant and pay luties school bills at the same time janine reflected that this was the thanks she received lutie had been home less than a month and janine must get out janines smile was a trifle grim lutie was far from beautiful but she knew how to wear clothes and she had a keen mind and a quick tongue no one had been more surprised than janine when carleton vance had devoted himself to her rather than to lutie janine her tousled coppery hair tied with an old blue bandanna of aunt sukeys an outgrown blue gingham showing the slim roundness of her figure and floury arms busy with beaten biscuit had still claimed the rich gay young mans attention janine couldnt blame lutie for be ing peeved about it but she did blame her for acting so unsporting all this janine poured out to anne her friend as she flung herself down under the big lawn umbrella im getting out as fast as i can janine ended sullenly biting her quivering lip viciously i dont know what ill do miss days school didnt fit me for much useful work and aunt millie always said it didnt matter i was to have a home with her until i went to one of my own you cant leave jan youd never be able to get a decent job why the margaret home is simply overflowing anne said gravely mrs babbie called me only yester day to ask me to get the league together and see if we couldnt man age larger quarters for the girls her assistant is so overworked shes leaving her flat jan straightened anne right there is a job and you werent go ing to tell me about it anne laughed youd never do your aunt wouldnt even let you help us down there let alone going there to live you dont know swan town in summer its the tenement district poverty criminals in hid ing what do you know about such things and what do you know about working in a place like the margaret home well i can learn id scrub floors janine declared passion ately before id stay another week under the same roof with lutie but jan dont rush into it like this come north with me and maybe by fall lutie will be married and you can go back thanks no anne you know i havent any money and i wouldnt go as your guest if mrs babbie will have me im going to work can we go to see her now anne derry looked at janine thoughtfully she knew this mood of jans knew the sultry fires in the girls passionate violet eyes the fury twisting the beautiful mouth jan was equal to doing anything if she couldnt have her way besides she was strong mrs babbie would be glad to have her jan had run the silver duke her aunts home for years why not let her try it come along then since youre so determined anne decided and the girls went to get annes car down through lovely treeshaded beverly and across the tracks where in the narrow space between rail road tracks and docks lived the other half janine had never been across the tracks for aunt millie had been firm about not letting her visit the junior leagues pet charity the margaret home for wayward girls mrs babbie a plump motherly looking person did not ask any questions but fell upon annes choice of a new helper with open arms there was no room for janine to live at the home but mrs babbie gave her the address where her for mer assistant had stayed anne was horrified at the small attic room but jan said it would do nicely and still in her mutinous mood paid her months rent in ad vance shed have to share it with one lizette greer a factory worker when janine reached her aunts home again she found that aunt millie had gone to the country club with lutie and had not left as she usually did a note telling jan to follow janine who had been rap idly weakening grew angry once more and hurriedly packed her things then she left the house she had come to as a sad longcurled nineyearold her roommate was curiously awaiting her arrival she was a thin attractive girl with odd slanting eyes that never looked straight into janines aint you going to unpack every thing she asked when janine had unpacked what she thought suit able for swantown and left the rest in her trunk janine had known just how silly the other clothes would look in swantown those long flowered chiffons starched laces rough sports silks silver and gold slippers exquisite silk underthings shed been silly to bring them but she had not known what else to do if she could have trusted lizette janine would have shown her the clothes and told her what had hap pened but something in lizettes shifty glance repelled her so she kept silent in the days that fol lowed when she dived into the trunk for this possession or that and ex posed the lovely things lizette only looked knowing so janine guessed that her roommate had been through the trunk but she didnt care life at the margaret was hard but janine learned rapidly and mrs babbie was overjoyed because the junior leaguers had all gone north for the summer janine did not have to dodge her former friends with some of the girls she easily made friends but some remained hard and sullen to the last of them all jan grew really fond of only one buddy draconi was a beautiful blackeyed girl with curly dark hair and soft white skin it took a long time to win her confidence but when janine did buddy was pathetic in her eagerness to be friends her story was unusual as jan had suspected it would be she had been loved by two men rival gangsters and had married one to be promptly widowed by the other a friend had brought her to the margaret and as buddy said no one would think of looking for buddy draconi in this joint leastways not danny the knife it was soon after this strange friendship began that buddy burst out with i bet the silver duke street amp smiths love story magazine would be crazy about you jimmy youre his kind the silver duke jan repeated smilingly yes hes a swell like you just a night bird like the rest of us only shows up after dark a gangster see but why the silver duke janine asked carelessly not because she was interested her feet ached and so did her head and back she was sick to death of swantown and its squalor sick of the smells and people the gangsters who frankly claimed to be nothing else my buck named him that the first night he came to carminis his eyes are exactly like silver coins and he was such a real swell buck called him the silver duke and it stuck janine went on filing her nails listening carelessly wouldnt anne laugh to hear buddy proposing that janine broun have a blind date with a gangster named the silver duke certainly she had hidden janine well under the jimmy brown that swantown knew a trifle curiously she eyed her self in the narrow mirror opposite a shabbily dressed girl with ruffled copper hair cut just a little longer than a boys because the old janine had worn hers long bunched at the nape of her neck she was white and the old janine would be brown by now the pallor made her mouth startlingly scarlet oh gosh here he is now buddys eager voice interrupted jans thoughts and jan looked up with a start of dismay into eyes that were as buddy had said as cool and silvery as coins it was a long way to look too for he was well over six feet tall strong but slimhipped in his white trousers and white turtlenecked sweater he did not look different from the crowd she ran with and not at all as she had thought a dweller of swantown would look this is jimmy brown duke and shes a swell jane only shes half dead she works harder than any of the other dames around here buddy introduced them buddy just one word of laughing dismay in a warm drawl ing voice that for some reason sent a tingle through janine aw nix duke on making me talk your way but isnt she a pretty keen kid very keen somehow janine found her hand in a cool firm clasp and she was returning the dukes simle take her for a ride duke shes tired and hot buddy suggested im taking another girls turn at the telephone tonight janine wanted to protest but didnt janine broun going riding with a man from swantown never theless she found herself going down the hot street with the tall young man his hand touching her arm at the crossings she didnt even think much about her rashness in trusting herself to him in the hot darkness of swan town looking back over that night she wondered why she hadnt been afraid especially as he guided her toward the docks dark shapes slunk in and out of the shadows and spoke to the duke in gutturals the water slapped sullenly against the docks and only the riding lights of the moored freighters relieved the darkness why its a boat not a car janine said with real pleasure as her companion stayed her steps at a slip where a speed boat tugged at its moorings scared the silver duke a little janine admitted honestly dont be ill take good care of you and see that you get safely home again we can go up the shore a ways and get steamed clams and cold beer at a place i know dance too if you want to janine nodded and he picked her up and put her into the boat as easily as if she had been a doll the boat went like the wind seeming to leap into the velvet night away they roared out of the bay and up the coast line janine drew in great lungfuls of the fresh air and gradually the tiredness the horrible weariness left her at a dock miles up the coast the duke shut off the engine and they floated to anchor beside a long dimly lighted building music reached out gay hands to them and janines feet tingled to be dancing once more even though it was with a swantownian the building was crude on the outside but inside there was an ex cellent floor with tables all around the dimly lighted room a good orchestra and an oyster bar that went the entire length of the room duke might have been carleton vance himself he was so courteous and janine forgot that he wasnt some new boy whom she had met in beverly oh well she was just jimmy brown now and girls of swanton went with men like the silver duke and danny the knife like it the duke asked bend ing his tall head as they finished their cold beer and fried oysters to join the dancers i love it it was nice of you to invite me buddy practically shang haiied you into it janine laughed no she didnt i could have said i had a date truth is im fed up on this lonewolf business and keen on having a pretty girl to dance with i thought if young men didnt have those tilings it was because they didnt want them observed janine innocently surely there are plenty of goodlooking girls just aching to go places the face of the man looked bleak and his mouth became a grim line jan looked at him in surprise now he looked like the other men of swantown and she had thought him different then he laughed maybe there arent too many jimmy browns in swantown he said lightly you cant tell me you were born there not very far from where i stay now janine said quietly i had been away working but i had to leave so i came to the margaret when i heard there was a job open there i should think youd be too goodlooking to be out in service you wouldnt be a comfortable per son for other girls to be with under the same roof janine looked quickly at her com panion but he was plainly not try ing to flatter her for he was look ing thoughtfully over her head evi dently thinking ever what she had said that was the reason i left an other girl made her mother fire me janine admitted the door swung open and a group of young people rushed in and took possession of the bar janine started for at their head was lutie who should have been at their northern summer home her cousins companions were strangers to her lutie pounded on the bar ac tion we want action janine winced hoping lutie street amp smiths love story magazine luties

well for goshs sake see who hes toting say big boy you neednt go to the kitchen for dates janines cheeks were scarlet with embarrass ment she looked up at the duke but he had shaken lutie off and was smiling down at janine as though they were alone janine caught her breath at the miracle of that smile it did queer things to her lutie was staring too and slowly turning scarlet he looked at her and

swantown beverly and the campau swantown put out a hot hand reeking of asphalt as they left the docks and the speed boat behind janine shivered a little it was for a girl like lutie she had chosen this life lutie wasnt worth it she should have ignored her taunts and stayed where she belonged and that wasnt prowling about with a hiding criminal the duke with his uncanny quickness seemed to guess her thoughts for he said quickly dont worry im safe company even for a tired little girl from the margaret home this is where i live janine said quickly confused on the top floor isnt it beastly hot up there when it is my roommate and i take army cots to the roof its cool up there under the stars she paused the ride was lovely duke you made it so jimmy im going to take you often janine didnt believe he would he wasnt safe for janine broun she was afraid already he made her heart beat fast would he ex pect her to kiss him good night kisses didnt mean much to the crowd janine had known maybe if he did kiss her it would cure her of her growing infatuation she was instantly ashamed of the thought but it was too late the dukes arms closed about her hard and his face smooth and cool was close to hers then his mouth crushed down on hers hot and fierce until she gasped for breath for a moment he held her there against the virile steel that was his body his mouth taking her very heart through her lips then he released her and melted into the darkness well lizettes voice came from the darkness and she raced after janine who was rushing up the stairs baby face and the silver duke teaming up whod have thought hed fall for you buddy draconi asked him to take me for a ride on the water to cool off janine stammered because lizettes eyes looked so knowing id say he did the opposite well kid hes rolling in doremi they say he did a big job and is in hiding until they quit looking for him draconi claims hes horribly moral if thats so you better tip him off to your past even gang

the doll apartments of campau ive seen the glad rags in the trunk only id have thought you could have held your man longer janine went on to the bathroom puzzled then suddenly she laughed of course lizette would think that the city was divided into three parts beverly where the people of the idle class lived swan town and the campau which con sisted of the houses beyond the theaters where rich young men the silver duke maintained apartments for enter taining their friendsoften girls from swantown with whom they amused themselves until their fancy changed lizette had decided that janine had been discarded by a fickle young playboy well let her think it if it helped jan to hide more securely nevertheless she wouldnt go around with the duke but she didnt know the duke nor anything about the terrible heat that lay like a pall over swantown turning its streets to black rubber its skies to brassy smoke and good resolutions into thin air janine was glad to get away at night with the duke to the clean cool water where they spent the evening hours racing up the coast he seemed to have unlimited funds and janine grimly pushed the thought of their source into the back of her mind along with the other self who had once been safe in beverly buddy disappeared suddenly one night and the duke professed not to know where she had gone jan missed the vivacious blackeyed adoring buddy more than she had expected aside from anne buddy was the only real friend janine had had and it hurt incredibly to have her go without even a goodby the duke had not repeated that mad kiss sometimes he seemed to be laughing at himself about some thing often he stayed away days at a time but always he came back useless to tell herself she was janine broun of beverly she was really jimmy brown madly in love with a man who dared not show his face in the daylight hurrying along the street on an errand one day janine surprisingly met lutie face to facelutie slim and cool and elegant in her float ing flowered dress and wide hat janine stepped in surprise what on earth lutie broun are you doing down here i could ask the same only i hap pen to know lutie jeered what do you mean lutie i thought you

like the jangle of small brazen bells and her face flushed with fury lutie and the duke lutie and the duke it rang in her ears all the long evening as she sat on the edge of her cot looking up at the silver stars swinging in the black velvet sky the duke hadnt been at the margaret to bring her home tonight lutie had coaxed him away with her somewhere and if she had not hated her cousin before janine hated her now with an in tense consuming hatred that night alone in the tiny room she faced the real truth something that she had been afraid to do until now she knew she loved the duke loved him so craz ily madly that nothing else on earth mattered time not spent with him was a nightmare to be lived somehow it was nearly nine the next night when janine finished her work at the margaret the duke wasnt waiting there tonight either slowly drearily janine went home she walked up the hot reek ing stairs to her room and as she stood fumbling for her key she heard lizettes voice and with it the dukes and was instantly wildly happy once more as she opened the door lizette sprang up i asked the duke up to wait im off for a weekend at eddies mas lizette explained and hur ried out janine looked at the duke he was standing beside her open trunk it wasnt the first time she had come home to find that lizette had been rummaging in it expensive dresses and silken lingerie were strewn over the edge of it a silver slipper lay on the dingy carpet a lacy negligee was thrown over a chair all the lovely clothes aunt millie had man aged to shower on her niece were exposed to the dukes eyes lizette was showing me your things he said in an odd voice he whirled catlike and caught janine by the shoulders shaking her until her hair flew in a wild mess over her face jimmy i could have sworn you were as sweet and honest as you looked janine stared at him dazzled his eyes were flaming he cared as much as that i actually walked the floor nights swearing because i hadnt kissed you again i held off because your mouth was so untaught i thought i find you are my equalno worse for i never claimed to be anything the silver duke he caught janine by the shoulders shaking her i could have sworn you were as sweet and honest as you looked he cried now i find you are are worse than i am no good girl could have things like yours and get them by doing housework but the silver duke a man who has to hide what do you mean i mean you came here from the campau that was what lutie tried to tell me that first night and i thought she was jealous well ive learned the truth now from her from lizette and from these no good girl could have things like street amp smiths love story magazine yours and get them by doing house work go away janine cried if you think that of me you cant go too quickly before i satisfy my hunger for your mouth he cried savagely something in his face made janine cry out wait let me i wont wait he cried roughly and crushed her close to him she could feel the steely muscles that so often had made her think of a tigers she struggled to free her self from the savagery of the mouth that swept down hers couldnt and then she didnt want to all she wanted was him to keep on kissing her in this mad way time enough for explanations later tides of magic were sweeping over her carrying her away from the safe harbors janine broun had known she had become a wild thing in the silver dukes arms oh shed gladly marry him and hide with him what did she care for beverly and its calm prearranged marriages things were whirling about her and some of the madness passed she was fighting a force she couldnt understand fighting the duke and losing under his hot cruel lips then she was sent staggering back against the wall and the silver duke was gone slowly the room straightened and became just a dingy room in swan town the magic that had trans formed it was ugly passion that had nearly carried her away in its swift current janine sank down into a chair shaking from head to foot she knew now why buddy had married a gangster darkeyed vivacious buddy why janine was so in love with the silver duke she couldnt even think straight perhaps she slept she never after ward knew but somehow the hot dawn was in the room and she was draggingly dressing for another day a day without the duke for he wouldnt be back ever and she couldnt do as lutie didfollow him to explain and coax him back at mrs babbies door janine saw annes car anne was upstairs in the margaret waiting for her she cried out at the sight of janine and put her arms around her poor kid you look all in i came just in time i guess i thought you were still up north jan said dropping into a chair no we came home early it wasnt any fun without you i sup pose you know that your aunt and lutie didnt go after all thats what i came about to ask you to come home did lutie send you jan asked coldly no dont be that way with me jan your aunt sent for you lutie and carleton eloped last night and saved the trouble and expense of a big wedding his house is nearly done so they plan to stay at a re sort until it is ready your aunt al ways wanted you back but we both knew you wouldnt come until lutie left i cant leave mrs babbie with out notice janine said weakly and it seemed as though shed die if she didnt get out of swantown right away anne smiled the girl who used to work for her came back so you can leave this minute janine felt faint from relief anne studied her white face anxiously but janine rallied almost at once and in no time at all her packing was done goodbys at the home were said and the two girls were the silver duke driving away from the heat and sor didness of swantown jan was glad she didnt have to see lizette again she was filled with hatred for the girl who had lied to the duke out of petty malice maybe some day shed thank lizette but not while the pain of losing the duke was an open wound in her heart i suppose youve seen a lot of lutie anne said calmly as they bumped across the last of the tracks into beverly she bragged that she was going with some handsome thug down there janine did not reply she was drawing deep breaths of the clean air of wide shaded streets behind her was swantown and all its sor didness and heat the madness of loving the silver dukethat should be put behind her too she was once more janine broun and even lutie could not drive her back to swantown aunt millie and sukey both wept when janine got home to her sur prise it was no effort at all to pick up the threads of her former life and go on every one knew through anne that janine had been doing social work at the margaret they were glad to have her back and the chapter of the summer in swantown seemed gone and forgotten but not for janine she could be busy all day and dance half the night but in the long hours of early morning she would live over every moment she had spent with the sil ver duke in her dreams she felt again the spray on her face as his boat took them up the coast and wakened to find it was her own tears the first day after lutie and carleton returned lutie followed janine to her room and shut the door does the duke come here jan she demanded going to the point lutiefashion no i havent seen him since i left the margaret i have i saw him riding with buddy draconi she lives along the ocean at that big place that was shut so long what was the trouble be tween you two nothing he left swantown be fore i did janine answered gravely i know that too i was at his rooms that night he was packing when i got there and was in a tear ing rage about something his face was so white it scared me he seemed to have some crazy idea from lizette greer that you had come to the margaret from the campau janines violet eyes widened he told you that no i picked it out of him what did you tell him she asked in a strained voice why you fool what would i tell him i said it was so that carle ton was mad about you and that when we got engaged i made him get rid of you lutie laughed at the sight of janines face did you think id tell him that you were just too pretty to have around when i wanted to catch a rich man why not you already had carleton janine said in a strangely dead voice i wanted him too lutie coolly lighted a cigarette if he had even looked at me carleton could have had you and welcome but he didnt i even threatened to tell the police about him and he just laughed luties voice was choked with fury i dont believe he was hiding from the police so you lost him to dra coni janine refused to reply and finally lutie left street amp smiths love story magazine after she had gone janine stood for a long time in deep thought she too knew where buddy was living only the other day she had seen her on the lawn of a big house facing the sea buddy had not seen her and janine smarting from buddys abrupt ending of their friendship had taken care that she shouldnt well she was going to find buddy now and through her learn where the duke was hiding then shed set him straight about her she wouldnt have even a gangster be lieve the awful things lutie had told about her hed realized the truth once she told him her name after that she would forget him as fast as she could janine dressed in her simplest things a coat of silky blue wool with a severe nuns cape edged with silver fox a beret of the same ma terial tilted on her coppery hair slim blue pumps in her aunts small coupe janine set out to call on buddy janine was in luck for buddy was walking down the driveway of the big house she stared coldly at janine as the girl brought her car to a stop beside her well she said in an unfriendly tone cool black eyes sweeping jans smart figure get in here jan commanded her voice as cold at the note of command in janines voice buddy stared then obeyed first i want you to tell me why you left without a word buddys black eyes flashed i thought i wasnt fit company for a nice girl like you and the duke agreed so he helped me beat it if id known you didnt know anything and neither does the duke see janine said angrily did you ever hear of janine broun of beverly buddy nodded shes a junior leaguer she said sullenly well that happens to be who i am janine said coldly my cousin lutie broun came home from school and she was a scrawny little thing out for a rich husband and i cramped her style so she made her mother send me away a friend of mine knew mrs babbie needed a helper and i insisted on taking the job thats the whole story my family didnt know where i was for a long time and when they did they sent for me lutie was mar ried so i went home buddys big black eyes had grown wider and wider and when janine finished she made a little stabbing motion with her hand you shoulda bumped off that lizette greer and your cousin for giving the duke a wrong steer how come you didnt tell him the truth because i was a snob jan said honestly he was hiding from the law and i didnt want to fall in love with him its all right i just wanted you to know you can tell him ive got to get back now janines voice was unsteady and to her horror one tear after another be gan to slide down her lovely face buddy gave her a quick hug get back nothing you come along with me to supper lucky you got me when you did because danny and i are beating it out west to start over oh dont look like that i married him to get him be cause his mob got buck and then i got weak and liked him too much so were going west isnt that a joke danny the knife going straight and turning farmer but buddys tone was proud you arent with the duke then i might have known lutie was lying the silver duke again janine said slowly of course ill stay for supper buddy leaned forward and snapped on the car switch and jan drove up to the house and followed buddy in through a side door a sound in the doorway made her look up and she stared wideeyed the silver duke stood there for a moment she saw surprise and stark hunger mirrored in his face then he seemed to don a mask that shut her out were staying with some folks danny knew buddy said hustling janine into a great cool living room ill go set an extra place drop somewhere i wont be a minute janine looked around the room street amp smiths love story magazine it was a cool day so there was a low fire flickering on the hearth three kittens tumbled there buddy and kittensjanine smiled at the thought and bent to pet them a sound in the doorway made her straighten up and she stared wide eyed the silver duke stood there look ing at her for a moment she saw surprise and stark hunger mirrored in his face then he seemed to don a mask that told her nothing shut her out buddy did not tell me stam mered janine then hushed for her voice sounded strange in her own ears why did you come jimmy the duke asked stiffly i came to find buddy i wanted her to know she had me all wrong and so did you lutie lied and lizette lied lutie told me about it today those clothes and these i earned myself i am living with luties mother again as her com panion the same position i had be fore lutie came home from school why she didnt tell him she was janine broun jan never could after ward fathom but that small omis sion saved her happiness the duke came forward and turned janines face to the light his hand under her chin a thrill went through janine at his touch then she was still but her breath was hurrying hurrying i believe you jimmy i went back to find you and found you had gone but lizette was there i choked the truth out of her she admitted she knew nothing about your past that she had lied it didnt matter nothing mattered except finding you janine felt the room swing about her and at her white look the duke put his arms around her was it that way with you too jimmy did you love me enough so that the past didnt matter janines pride became a thing of dust yes yes she cried her arms creeping up around his neck would you marry me now not knowing anything more about me jimmy could we i mean without waiting days for red tape and all that janine asked bravely i attended to thati got the license long ago mrs babbie gave me your full name j m brown but she didnt know any more than that buddys laughing face suddenly appeared between the curtains buddy call that judge who lives down the street right away ordered the duke in a gay voice that janine had never heard from him before when buddy disappeared the duke looked down at janine you meant it and at her shin ing look he bent his tall head so he could reach her lips this time janine returned his kiss with all the hungry longing of the long weeks they had been separated it was heaven to feel his arms around her hurting her the hard firmness of his mouth bruising hers recklessly she put behind her all her doubts and fears buddy brought them back to earth triumphantly leading the plump judge and a tall handsome blond youth who did not look at all as janine had thought danny the knife would look in no time at all just as she was in her blue dress and blue coat and tumbled coppery hair janine be came mrs silver duke of course he had another nameneal riding it was as unfamiliar as that of silver duke had been to her a few weeks before the silver duke maybe our wedding wont be ex actly legal janine murmured con fusedly when she discovered that buddy and danny and the judge had vanished it was the first thing she could think of to say under the shining ness of the dukes eyes one letter ought not to matter she added gaining courage just try letting it matter whether im jimmy brown or janine broun the dukes arms loosened and he said something under his breath that sounded like swearing jimmy jimmy you blessed idiot why didnt you say so before there was a choked groan in his voice not that the difference of a letter matters but if i had known i would never have married you then im glad you didnt know anyway i havent a cent to my name except what aunt millie gives me for an allowance janine put her head firmly back where it had been tucked under the dukes chin you dont understand janine broun was mad to marry a man like me without knowing all about him then she loves being mad you you didnt kill any one for a moment the duke held janine close without answering then he walked over to a desk and brought her a handful of clippings read them he commanded in a harsh voice reluctantly janine bent over them it was a sordid story of a man who had killed his wife and her lover then himself and how his son the innocent member of a tragic family one neal darrel had been hounded by the tabloids until his life had become unbearable and he had disappeared that poor boy neal darrel was you duke janine asked her voice soft with pity but you said neal riding i had one friend a judge who had my name changed to riding i came down here and bought this place but the habit of hiding was too strong i lived in daily fear of some sob sister ferreting me out only in the shadows of swantown did i feel safe and that was all janine asked a great relief flooding her with hap piness you never were a gangster at all never but dont you see some day some one will recognize me as that unfortunate son of a father temporarily crazed by his wifes un faithfulness thank heaven she was my stepmother not my real mother theyll force you to live through that hashedup scandal as if i care janine said with loving scorn i wont be afraid of anything as long as i have you janine looking up into his eyes shivered with happiness as his arms closed about her and his lips crushed down on hers hot and fierce in a kiss which made their very souls one forever the fourth proposal by mona morrow as the train rolled out of the station on its westward jour ney mrs huston pale and grave sat quietly with her hands in her lap while thelma bubbling with excitement opened the various gift boxes that had been brought by her many friends what did larry want when he called you aside mrs huston in quired with more than ordinary in terest it was nothing important mother thelma answered indiffer ently as she tossed an empty box into a corner of the compartment he wanted to come along and marry me at the first stop and mrs huston eagerly prompted since thelma had offered the fourth proposal no information as to what her reply had been i told him he was just wasting a proposal on me i couldnt pos sibly see him as a husband mrs huston sighed and touched a weak hand to her irongray hair i dont know what you are waiting for thelma she said kindly and concernedly the average girl considers herself fortunate if she gets one proposal youve had three that i know of nice young men too arent you making a mistake pass ing up all these fine opportunities the man you are waiting for may not even exist he may only be a creature of your imagination youll be twentythree next month you know dont worry dear thelma laughed i wont die an old maid mrs huston made no answer her mind went back over a bridge of years she thought of her own sister roberta who at one time was pretty and charming and vivacious as thelma was now roberta had rejected many offers while waiting for an ideal who never came the years crept up and she eventually resigned herself to spinsterhood with all her heart and soul mrs huston prayed that that would not be thelmas fate abruptly stopping her exploring thelma put her arms around her mother just forget about me she said and think of yourself only youve got a job ahead of you youve got to get strong and healthy surprise new york when you get back without a seconds hesitation thelma had volunteered to go with her mother to the bar x dude ranch in montana which the doctor had recommended a six months stay the doctor felt would make a new person of mrs huston however thinking always of thelmas future mrs huston ob jected to her going along it would be a waste of six precious months of her life but thelma insisted and the idea of a nurse for a companion was discarded john cromwell the owner of the dude ranch a husky sixfooter escorted thelma and her mother down the row of log cabins to the one in which they would live during their stay he wore handtooled boots a tengallon hat and a red plaid shirt that always impressed easterners as thelma glanced from left to right taking in the immediate sights of the ranch her eyes suddenly wid ened and unconsciously her steps became shorter on the porch of one of the log cabins sat an excep tionally handsome young man of about twentyeight his darkblond hair was brushed back smartly and his strong white teeth were clamped on a curved pipe he was reading a book and was so absorbed that he never raised his head at the sound of their approach a feeling of breathless excitement surged through thelmas veins her heart suddenly commenced to race a strange and pleasing warmth en veloped her body her lips parted in a blessed smile and her eyes shone with an instinctive recognition her head nodded slightly yes that was the man she had been wait ing for that was the man whose vague image had filled her dreams for so long she had always felt that somebody like him simply must exist and that some day she would find him an insatiable curiosity seized hold of her who was he where did he come from she quickened her steps and street amp smiths love story magazine caught up with mr cromwell who was holding her mothers arm that man looks familiar to me she remarked after they had passed his cabin who is he thats mr stephen ross cromwell informed her hes here with his brother philip ross they come from chicago theyre in the steamship business mr philip is going to be here all summer but mr stephen is leaving at the end of the week the information was welcome though not very promising but there was one thing she desired to know above all others was he single she didnt want to ask the ques tion pointblank so going home to his wife she asked her heart trembling at what the answer might be no dont think hes married gladness and relief swelled her heart yes it had to be this way there should be no barriers when she found him here we are cromwell an nounced stopping at the next cabin while you were having lunch i had your trunks put inside i hope youll be very comfortable there were four rooms in the cabintwo bedrooms a living room with an open fireplace and a bath room that held a tub and shower indian blankets and game trophies hung on the walls handwoven rag rugs were scattered over the wooden floors each room was pro vided with electricity from the ranchs own power plant like all dude ranches it combined the best features of the outdoor west with many of the comforts of the east thelma suggested that her mother he down and rest while she un packed the windows were wide open and a fine sweetsmelling breeze fanned the rooms before she was half finished thelma noticed that her mother had fallen asleep that was perfect the more rest her mother got the sooner would she regain her health thelma took a shower and changed her dress from the win dow of her bedroom she saw stephen on the porch of his cabin i wonder she said half aloud if youve been waiting for me as ive been waiting for you im coming over and i hope you get the same sort of shock when you see me that i got when i saw you assuring herself that her mother was asleep she strolled out with a glad heart near stephens cabin she halted and contemplated him for a moment how are you neighbor she called out gayly he raised his head for a second his blue eyes showed keen surprise thelmas jetblack hair glistened in the sun her large expressive gray eyes shaded by long black lashes sparkled with an intriguing friendli ness she presented an exquisite picture as she stood there slim and straight then his eyes clouded how do he answered coldly and dropped his eyes to his book again dismissing her completely aghast thelma stood there in a state of bewilderment she had been snubbed it seemed incredible and shocking too after what she had anticipated something was wrong men usually warmed to her found her interesting and desirable it didnt seem possible that this man for whom she felt she had been waiting all her life shouldnt even desire to exchange a word with her it sent a little shiver through her for a moment she hesitated then thrust out her chin and deliberately walked up the wooden steps of the the fourth proposal aghast thelma stood there in a state of bewilderment she had been snubbed it seemed incredible something was wrong men usually warmed to her found her interesting and desirable porch she dropped into a chair opposite him and crossed one silken leg over the other im sure it must be something you ate she said with a friendly smile you couldnt possibly have street amp smiths love story magazine such a bad disposition mr ross his brows narrowed as he stared at her he couldnt help but notice that she possessed a rare beauty a beauty that was more than per fect features a beauty that was vitally alive but he had no use for girls especially beautiful girls i dont believe ive ever met you before he said with no eagerness in his voice you havent she answered im thelma huston im here with my mother in the next cabin i asked mr cromwell and he told me your name i didnt bring any recommendations with me but i think if youll put the book aside you might find that im not terribly boring im sorry he said abruptly but im not in a conversational mood besides i just remembered that i have some letters to write he rose to his feet tall and hand some a romantic figure with a white broadcloth shirt that was open at the throat thelma waited a few moments her cheeks stained red then got up and walked slowly back to her own cabin in all her life no man had ever been so rude to her and the crudest part of all was that she should receive this rebuff from the one man in the world whom she was most anxious to interest during the short time that she had been sitting opposite him she had felt her heart melt she had felt that every particle of her be longed to him had he held out his hands to her she would have come to him in happy surrender he was cold he was aloof he was cruel yet deep in her heart she knew that she had fallen madly in love with him that he was the one man she had been waiting for the man who could stir her without even touching her her mother was still asleep so she walked about the ranch aimlessly soon she reached the corral she leaned against the log fence and watched the antics of the horses within her cheeks still burned some one came up and stood be side her mind if i introduce my self that some one asked thelma turned her head and saw a nicelooking young man of twenty one the collegiate type rather slim with pale cheeks not at all she said although she would have pre ferred to be alone im phil ross he said im steves brother i should also add eavesdropper i happened to be in the room off the porch when you came up to the cabin i heard the whole thing and i felt sorry for you i think youre swell youre a real sort of a girl thats why i went out to look for you i want to tell you about steve hes not as rude as he pretended to be you just happened to hit him at a rotten time hes sore at all girls now and he thinks theyre all poison some time ago a girl named natalie fulton came up to our place looking for a job as a stenographer she was the prettiest thing i had ever seen steve fell in love with her on the spot when they went out there wasnt a head that didnt turn to stare at her and was he proud two weeks ago she eloped with a millionaire steve had introduced to her there was no goodby no word of regret i always suspected that she was a gold digger but steve thought she really loved him he came out here for a few weeks to forget hes bitter so you see you stepped in at a bad moment lsa the fourth proposal thanks for telling me thelma said it makes me feel a lot better i couldnt imagine how any one could take such a violent dislike to me he couldnt if he was in his right senses phil remarked with admir ing eyes but under the circum stances while that thing is still fresh in his mind its best to leave him alone her mother awoke in time for din ner and together they walked to the dining hall at one of the small tables she saw stephen and his brother phil but stephen never once looked at her she wondered what she should do should she avoid him entirely as his brother had suggested no she kept repeating to herself but how could you interest a man if he refused to talk to you if he walked out on you he was leaving at the end of the week and some thing must be done quickly it wasnt however until the next evening that an idea came to thelma she and her mother were among the last to leave the dining hall after dinner they stopped for a few moments to talk with john cromwell in reference to some spe cial food for mrs huston then they strolled along leisurely toward then cabin the idea came like a bolt from the sky just as they were approach ing stephens cabin it was a prom ising idea but the fact that her mother would be involved made thelma hesitate she weighed it carefully in her mind then feeling certain as to the outcome she acted youre making a mistake mrs huston said as thelma led her up the steps of stephens cabin this is not our cabin i know it but i want you to meet some one mother a mischievous twinkle in her eyes thelma knocked on the door stephen answered and when he be held the unexpected visitors he was dumfounded in a fit of temper he could forget himself and act ungen tlemanly toward thelma but never could he be rude to the pale sweet faced woman with the kind eyes and irongray hair who stood beside her hello stephen i brought you a guest thelma said gayly mother this is stephen ross a great book reader and a renowned authority on etiquette she couldnt resist the chance of getting even for a fraction of a second his eyes flashed anger then he turned to thelmas mother and said pleas antly how do you do mrs hus ton thelmas eyebrows went up in a delightful gesture highly pleased that he had remembered her second name wont you show mother how two bachelors live she asked pertly it might give her a thrill and shell have something to write to dad the girl was clever there was nothing to do but surrender grace fully of course he said wont you come in mrs huston thank you mr ross i hope were not intruding dont worry mother thelma said impishly mr ross just loves to have people drop in for a chat he held the door open for them philip rose from his chair in the living room a grin on his face laughing inwardly over thelmas strategy but once inside thelma discarded all attempts at sarcasm and became her own sweet natural self it wasnt only beauty that made her the most popular girl in her set that made her the recipient of three pro lsa street amp smiths love story magazine posals she was bright and clever and witty she had personality and charm but stephen refused to warm to ward her he doesnt want to like me she said to herself im beat ing against a stone wall philip brought out his mandolin and offered to play if thelma would sing in a pleasing contralto she sang a number of popular songs stephen forgot himself for a mo ment and joined in one i dont want to spoil this lovely party mrs huston interrupted but i feel a bit tired you may stay thelma but im going back to our cabin oh not alone thelma seized her opportunity quickly stephen and i will go with you he realized that she had tricked him in silence they walked to the huston cabin the air was clear and a full moon shone down upon them thank you mr ross mrs huston said i hope youll visit us sometime you two can go back now i can manage alone nicely as stephen turned to go back thelma turned with him a short distance from her cabin she took hold of his arm with a jerk and stopped him whats the matter with me she demanded do i use the wrong perfume a smile hovered on his lips no what sort of girl was thishe won dered then why are you trying to run away cant you stand me near you ive done everything but a fan dance to interest you he glared at her and shrugged his shoulders you do and say the darnedest things but you force me to she re plied id much prefer to have you make the advances what he exclaimed oh dont be so shocked im not trying to be smart im not picking on you for a little fun i love you do you understand i know all about the other girl why dont you let me help you forget her she put gentle hands on his shoulders stephen look at me please cant you see that im tell ing the truth blue eyes looked deep into eyes of gray and floundered in their depths all evening he had fought against liking this girl why should he believe that she was different all girls were mercenary didnt they speak of men as catches he was all right for natalie until she met a richer man why should he put himself in that terrible humiliating position again he didnt need a vacation he came west because he couldnt face his friends it would be foolish to get mixed up with another girl even if she was sweet and adorable but her hands on his shoulders did strange things to him the near ness of her was like an intoxicating perfume her shining eyes and her soft provocative lips drew him with a magnetism that overpowered his reserve his arms went around her in an eager embrace his lips sought hers and drank deep of their tenderness their sweetness and their fire he was stirred beyond words for thelma it was the moment of moments the most perfect kiss she had ever received good night she said softly when he released her good night her eyes glowed and her lips trembled in a spirit of ecstasy she fled to her cabin she wanted to treasure the fourth proposal that moment to keep it apart from all others to remember forever oh im not picking on you for a little fun i love you do you understand i know all about the other girl why dont you let me help you forget her she pleaded he stood per fectly still and watched her go then a fright ened look crept into his eyes and he hurried to his own cabin mrs huston was getting into bed when thel ma burst in with a cry of joy he kissed me mother he kissed me mrs hustons face beamed if street amp smiths love story magazine youre happy so am i i think he is very nice nice thelma echoed hes wonderful hes the man ive been waiting for the next morning when she dressed for breakfast she looked for ward joyously to seeing stephen she saw philip eating alone and waved a friendly greeting no doubt stephen would come in any moment but the moments dragged by and there was no sign of him she went over to philips table and asked wheres stephen he packed and left for chicago early this morning philip informed her oh she gasped staring at him with incredulous eyes do you mean that he has gone away and wont come back philip nodded his head i tried to reason with him but it was no use he cant drive natalie fulton out of his mind and what she did to him has poisoned him against all girls im sorry thelma thanks she said blinking her eyes she returned to her table and in answer to her mothers question told her what had happened but i cant understand mrs huston declared you gave me the im pression last night that you were in love with him and that he was in love with you why should he run away without saying goodby thelmas brightred lips twisted sadly briefly she told her mother the truth of her first encounter with stephen and of the scheme of which she was not so proud whereby she had gotten admittance to his cabin with her mother because of her daughters keen distress mrs huston readily for gave her i noticed that he acted perturbed she said but i thought it was due to shyness however i dont approve of your running after him and apparently he doesnt either why not forget him there are so many other men if you sent a telegram to larry hed come out here on the first plane but i dont want larry her eyes filled with tears i want stephen she sat around the cabin that morning as if in a daze his ab sence had left a terrible emptiness in her heart within her there was a mad desire to go after him but he was so far away and she dared not desert her mother it was going to be torture stay ing here day after day week after week while he took up his life again in chicago where there would be many things to remind him of nata lies treachery and to steel his heart against love what chance did she stand if he was determined not to come back to the ranch determined not to set eyes on her again she took up with philip because she was lonely because he was nice and because through him she hoped to hear of stephen philip received mail from chicago regularly but thelmas name was never men tioned all he does philip informed her is stay home and read when he gets through at the office it looks as if he is practicing to be a bachelor gosh i could ring natalies neck steve is a swell fellow hasnt an enemy in the world and now hes living the life of a hermit i wish i could shake him out of it so did thelma she felt that there was love behind that kiss which he had given her love that he was trying to stifle in time she feared she would become just a vague memory to him but how could she bring him back the fourth proposal exactly two weeks from the day be had left stephen arrived at the ranch unexpectedly an angry dis turbed and worried stephen whose mind was filled with hate for thelma say this is a surprise philip exclaimed what brought you down i want you to pack up stephen said doctors orders youre go ing to another ranch what for philip demanded im getting stronger here every day what does the old doc know in chicago i like it here and im not moving stephen regarded his brother sus piciously his desire to stay here merely confirmed the anonymous letter received by stephen which had caused him to drop everything and rush out to the ranch but suppose i insist stephen asked well talk it over later philip retorted ive got a date to go riding with thelma you know steve shes a swell girl swell girl stephen snickered in wardly he was almost tempted to show him the anonymous letter but decided not to for the moment would you mind waiting here until i returned stephen asked id like to see thelma alone for a few minutes o k but dont be long stephens jaw was set in deter mination his eyes blazed with an ger as he walked up the wooden path to thelmas cabin the sound of his footsteps which she misjudged for philips brought her to the door attired in riding breeches and boots she looked young and boyish sweet and lovely for a fraction of a second his eyes widened then they turned to cold steelblue hello stephen she cried gayly as she held out both hands to him its grand to see you again he took her hands and despite himself felt an electric thrill pass through his veins hello thelma he said coldly i want to talk to you how nice she declared ignor ing the tone of his voice mother is asleep and i wouldnt dare dis turb her lets go down to the brook they walked the short distance in silence shall we sit down she asked with an encouraging smile no what i have to say can be said standing you dont sound very pleasant she remarked while the corners of her lips curled up mischievously im not going to be either i came to talk about phil i want to tell you something very bluntly my father left his business to both of us but phil doesnt get his share until he is twentyfive meanwhile im the boss and i can cut him down to any salary i wish ill make it so small youll starve so if you think youre going to lay your hands on a fortune by marrying phil youre doomed to get the surprise of your life what makes you think i want to marry phil she asked inno cently why the idea is ridicu lous look here he said angrily you cant fool me i know what youre up to in every letter that phil wrote me he mentioned your name youve been spending an awful lot of time with him but dont think it hasnt been noticed there is some one on this ranch who knows youfrom new york prob ably and that some one wrote me a letter he fumbled in his pocket here read it street amp smiths love story magazine thelma took the letter from his hand without a trace of emo tion she read my dear mr stephen ross i believe it will in terest you to know that thelma hus ton is becoming very friendly with your brother i happen to know the young lady very well shes a little gold digger who is always on the make your brother doesnt realize the danger he is in i ad without a trace of emotion thelma read the anonymous letter stephen had received saying she was a gold digger who was always on the make and not being able to get him was now making a play for his brother vise you to take immediate steps to break up this friendship sincerely a friend the fourth proposal quite interesting thelma re marked returning the letter he stared hard at her it doesnt seem to make you angry at all he declared which proves that it is the truth youre not denying it you are a gold digger you couldnt get me so you tried to get my brother her radiant beauty the look of innocence on her face and the enigmatic smile on her lips an gered him im glad i discovered you in time he blurted out i was almost fool enough to fall in love with you myself i used to sit home and think of you remember every word you said and every gesture you made and especially that moment when i held you in my arms and kissed you as the days went by i found myself forgetting natalie thinking only of you wanting to be with you wanting to hold you in my arms again and just as i had de cided to come back here i received that letter thelma gasped you were com ing back of your own accord her heart leaped yes but now im glad i found you out youre just another edi tion of natalie ill take phil away from here if i have to do it by force it wont be necessary she an swered have you a pen in your pocket and a piece of paper she probably wanted to write a note to phil he thought very well he tore off the unwritten half of an old letter he had in his pocket and gave it to her together with his fountain pen in a few moments she rose from the ground and tossed away the flat rock on which she had rested the paper read it please she said with incredulous eyes he stared at it his brows narrowed then he gazed at her wideeyed why this is he gasped an exact copy of the anonymous letter i received and its the same handwriting too did you send it to me she smiled at him with glowing eyes yes i wrote all those terrible things about myself i wanted you to come back and it was the only thing i could think of to bring you i was afraid youd never come back his face brightened this was no natalie who stood before him but a rare and precious creature im glad it turned out this way he said with a sigh i was terribly upset when i received the letter but now im the happiest man in the world what i felt for natalie was just pride of possession i liked to display her as you would a beauti ful painting but you dearest i love you with all my heart i dont want you for the world i want you for myself only his arms went around her hun grily and his lips sought hers bless ing them with kisses thelma sighed happily she had gotten the man she had waited for strand of gold by helen addison a serialpart iv chapter viii billie awoke the next morning to look out at a dismal rainy day which exactly matched her mood to her as she lay in bed it seemed as if the trials the misery which should have been divided among many people had been con centrated on her her whole life had been miserable each bid she had made for happiness had always failed turned into misery she had thought that if she ever found her self free to marry len she would at last have achieved happiness strand of gold now she was free yet fate had made her free under such circum stances of horror and death that she was worse off than she had been be fore she was accused of the mur der of her husband with little chance to free herself from suspi cion she wondered why she was not allowed to enjoy happiness like other people in the abjectness of her misery she buried her face in the pillow and sobbed of course there was one thing for which she could be thankful they had not arrested her they prob ably felt that there was not enough evidence against her they had taken her to montycroft the night before and she was thankful for her own bed and for freedom even if it was under surveillance she rose and bathed and then went downstairs to learn what new developments there had been since the night before while she break fasted the previous nights events ran through her mind over and over the one thing which stood out sig nificant in her mind was the fact that the canoes had been set adrift but she could not prove even that after breakfast she got the paper from the front porch and half fear ful of what she might find there she opened it it was the burling ton paper first edition off the presses a little after midnight in time to come down on the earlymorning milk train the information avail able at the time of going to press had been very meager but the story had been given a good deal of promi nence the fact that the excursion ists aboard the ticonderoga had been the first to see the dead man and that their searchlight had picked out a woman running away from the body had been played up mr robinson the article went on to say was on the staff of camp arrow head it gave too a short resume of his life evidently gleaned from a longdistance call to warren on the whole it was better than billie had expected the paper was careful not to say a word about mur der only hint at it and the woman had not been recognized by those aboard the ticonderoga billie hardly had finished reading the newspaper account of the trag edy when a reporter arrived fol lowed almost immediately afterward by three more billies first inclina tion was to refuse them an interview but she very wisely decided that if she told them her version of the story first she might profit a great deal by it and if she could enlist their sympathy there was no telling how much good they might do her the reporters were still at monty croft when the two troopers of the night before together with an offi cer arrived they dismissed the re porters and then crossexamined billie for an hour or more most of the questions she had already been asked at first she was patient and helpful but as it became plainer and plainer that they wrere trying to make her confess to the murder of gil she lost all patience listen she snapped i tell you once and for all i didnt do it i dont know who did it and i dont much care and how do you like that anybody with the brains of a brainless donkey would know i didnt and at that im probably insulting the donkey she was angry and she expected them to be angry but they grinned at her as if it had all been a huge joke that turned her anger into exasperation they left soon after ward the interview as far as billie could see having accomplished nothing they were hardly out of the street amp smiths love story magazine drive when florence drove up she was a very different person from the florence who had made that other visit a lot of her languor was gone listen she said without pre liminary len is telling around down at headquarters that you and he were engaged to be married as soon as you could get an annulment of your marriage hes just pulling that to get you out of a tight hole isnt he billies anger soothed by the grins of her trooper tormentors flared again instantly on the contrary hes telling the truth i doubt if he ever did love you or was ever engaged to you you probably bought that ring yourself thats all i wanted to know florence snapped you two think you pulled a fast one on me dont you i suppose he thinks he did something big in giving me the run around well if he doesnt change his mind right off hell find himself in plenty of trouble i know a lot more than you think i do and ill talk ill get even with him if it takes the rest of my life florence hurried down the steps slammed the car into gear with a great deal of noise and shot away well billie said to herself that was certainly short and sweet id hate to be in lens shoes of course she cant really do any thing to him but billie was wrong within an hour billie had a telephone call from trooper barracks telling her that on information sworn to by florence lane they had arrested len to be held for trial by the grand jury on a charge of murder it took billie just four and a half minutes to reach the forestport jail after a good deal of delay she was led into a visiting booth where she found len facing her in another booth on the opposite side of a heavy wire screen she wondered a little at having been granted an in terview with him so easily but she found out later that every word they said was heard over a hidden telephone connection between the two booths len billie said in a choked voice her eyes bright with moisture they cant hold you for this they cant say you did it len shrugged resignedly flor ence came in and told them plenty whatwhat did she tell them that she was out on the island and overheard you and me talking you remember the night we saw the womans footprints well florence must have made those billie was beginning to compre hend we talked about your quarrels with gil and your threatening him if he didnt leave me alone and his threatening you when he caught you kissing me and the fact that if we could get rid of him we could marry she made it all sound as bad as possible especially the kissing business and my threatening him but they wont believe her it will be just her word against yours len they cant believe it well they unfortunately thought of mrs morley she overheard the quarrel there at montycroft she couldnt help it with all the shouting we did but len even that and i wouldnt deny it in fact i let them believe it was true len said it saved me the trouble of confessing ofof confessing her eyes were pitiful horrified strand of gold you two think you pulled a fast one on me dont you well if len doesnt marry me hell find himself in plenty of trouble i know a lot more than you think i do and ill talk ill get even with him if it takes the rest of my life sure they were getting a pretty good case against you i couldnt let them take you it was better that they work on me i had just as much or more of a chance of getting out of it street amp smiths love story magazine but len youyou didnt do ituncertainly then suddenly sure i know you didnt do it len his face relaxed its grim lines and he smiled gratefully thanks for the confidence billie he said with a momentary return to his oldtime manner no i didnt do it in fact i guess you must realize by now that until we found out that our boats had been tampered with i thought you had done it yourself but len youve got to deny it otherwise they may find you guilty ill deny it after im sure youre not being considered and ive got a lot of confidence that something will turn up in the meantime but billie couldnt feel his con fidence always misery had fol lowed everything she did len would be found guilty if he didnt the road to happiness would be open before her but she somehow couldnt believe that she was des tined to travel that road as she was passing the office on the way out a trooper stopped her and asked her if she would step in side for a moment another trooper sat at the desk a set of ear phones lying in front of him miss preston he said im be ginning to be more and more inter ested in this matter of the missing canoes what are your theories billie thought it peculiar that he should have changed his point of at tack so suddenly but she had no idea that the reason for his doing so lay in that pair of ear phones in front of him i have no idea she said who could have been out there some body who knew that gil would be there and im sure he kept that fact fairly secret wellthe officer nodded pleas antly more pleasantly than any of the troopers had acted toward billie since the affair had startedwell keep our eyes open and if you have any ideas let us know back at montycroft billie de cided one thing she would not give up this chance at happiness and since she loved len so much she would not let them punish him for a thing he had not done never somehow she would find a way to exonerate him she had no idea how she would do it but somehow she must the popular idea that all beauti ful women must of necessity be dumb is a long way from the truth like many thousands of others billie was a living refutation of that idea bewilderment and despera tion gradually wore off and gave place to quiet organized thought billie finally came to two startling conclusions one was that some body might have come out to the island to kill len and in the dark killed gil by mistake the second was that if mr hol land were really in love with flor ence he would have had a very good reason for getting rid of len whom florence loved billie sat bolt upright in her chair out on the porch her eyes surprised and staring once started with that train of reasoning thoughts came thick and fast where had she seen mr holland before in new york obviously or else she had seen a picture of him perhaps he was sufficiently disguised from his real self to fool her yet at the same time to have that vague familiarity why was the sight of him always linked in her mind with evil there must be some reason if her feeling that holland was crooked should prove to be correct strand of gold then he might very easily be the one who was trying to steal the treasure away from len by stick ing to the mistaken identity idea that would make a double motive for his kill ing gil whom he thought was len first to rid himself of a rival and second to get the treasure book which florence must have overheard len say he kept len billie said in a choked voice her eyes bright with moisture they cant hold you for this they cant say you murdered gil robinson i know you didnt do it len with him constantly perhaps hol land had accompanied florence on her spying trip to the island or street amp smiths love story magazine perhaps he had been following her checking up on her and had over heard the same conversation she had heard billie distinctly remem bered the two canoes which had passed her hiding place one follow ing the other she rose hastily from her chair and went out to the car if one had a hunch the thing to do was to play it for all it was worth she drove down to the local photog raphers theres a gentleman named hol land staying over at the inn billie explained to the proprietor and weve got to pick up a picture of him for a scavenger hunt it oc curred to me that you might have a snap either alone or in a group that you could let me have the photographer shook his head slowly id like to oblige you he said ive been stumped on these scav enger hunts myself but im not sure i can hes only had two rolls of films developed here and most of those were pictures of miss lane he paused thinking i tell you what he said bright ening it wouldnt make much dif ference whether it was a good or a bad picture of him would it not for a scavenger hunt well in that last roll there were several that werent good enough to print and one was of him when he looked them over he dropped those in the wastebasket you let me go out back and i think maybe i can find them then ill print up one for you billie waited hoping against hope after all a poor snap would be bet ter than none at all after a long time the man re turned triumphant a smudged light struck but recognizable snapshot of holland in his hands there he said that ought to do the trick and im glad i could help you billie thanked him profusely and then went to the post office she sent the picture by special delivery to a friend of hers who clerked in the police records bureau in new york she requested in her accom panying message that the identity of the man be telegraphed to her at once together with his criminal rec ord if any she went home then to wait very much pleased with her self the next morning she went again to see len if anything he was bluer than he had been the day be fore boy it seems good to see you he said this place is giving me the jitters why do you and i have to be dragged so deep into this mess when it wasnt our fault of course he added loyally i still think its better for me to be here than for you len billie protested and it seemed then as if that wire screen ing which kept her from taking him in her arms from comforting him was the cruelest thing in the world youve got to stop thinking about me youve got to think about yourself and try to plan a way to get out of this mess ill work as hard as ever i can to get you out but youve got to tell them that youre innocent youve got to make a big fuss about it not till im sure youre safe he told her doggedly and she knew it was useless to argue listen len she changed the subject have you still got that book with you and when he nodded and will you trust me with it ive got an idea he nodded assent gravely in stantly strand of gold when the guard comes ill send it around to you by him i had the devils own time getting them to let me keep it they talked a while longer and then billie left promising to come back that afternoon if she could she waited until the guard came out to her with the book and then returned to montycroft to find a telegram waiting for her it read looks like james norcross alias smooth jim escaped con vict stop was serving life sentence dannemora for mur der stop can you help au thorities locate him billie waited as patiently as she could until the time when she could see len again without exciting any ones suspicions meantime she telegraphed her friend in new york not to do anything until she heard from her immediately after luncheon she was again ushered into the booth where len was waiting len she said you told me once that your father was a judge did a man named norcross ever come before him james norcross len nodded sure did dad sent him up for life for murder and this norcross swore hed get even there was a lot about it in the papers at the time i was personally sort of re lieved when they convicted him why what do you know about him nothing billie assured him vaguely i was just wondering if your father was the judge cooper i had read about who was on the bench during that trial hows the food here len said a great deal about the food most of which must have made the gentleman with the ear phones very uncomfortable and having thus successfully changed the sub ject billie stayed a while longer then went back to montycroft as she rode along she was very thoughtful pieces of this jigsaw puzzle seemed to be fitting together now this made the third and strongest motive for murder in line with her theory of mistaken iden tity she called holland on the phone immediately mr holland she said this is billie preston ive got a proposi tion to make to you which will be to your advantage as well as mine could you come out to monty croft mr holland assured her that he was always willing even eager to hear propositions that were to his advantage and would she have dinner with him at the inn that night she would fine that night billie was just as care ful in dressing as she would have been if she had been going out with len she strove for a touch of worldliness in her appearance which would fool mr holland after they had ordered billie went directly to the point mr holland she said in a voice pitched so low that there was not the remotest possibility of its being overheard we might as well under stand each other at once to start with well just pretend that youre james norcross not the slightest flicker of sur prise crossed his face he laughed easily of course thats crazy but if it will please such a grandlooking girl its k with me now what i want to know is this are you or arent you inter ested in a certain treasure that len cooper knows about street amp smiths love story magazine well he spoke slowly choosing his words carefully and his eyes had become calculating slits of animated marble well just pretend that i am what about it only this im in a position to give you the information you need regarding the whereabouts of that treasure in return for what he leaned forward a little the only sign he gave of his excitement in return for something big len and i are both to go free of any suspicion of guilt in regard to the murder of gil robinson he spread his hands in the patron izing gesture of a man who talks to a child and how would i be able to do that for you easily i know that you mur dered gil robinson thinking he was len i know that this time the shaft struck home his face showed no change but his eyes became harder more cruel if such a thing were possible all right he snapped if you know so much what are you going to do about it ive got an airtight alibi you cant prove a thing i know itbillie nodded im perturbably im not going to try he looked at her wondering just what her game was well what is your game any way ill tell you when you tell me that you killed gil there arent any listeners all right i knew cooper was going to meet you and when a guy came sneaking along the path i let him have it it was going to even up a lot of things and get me the book and then it turned out to be that other punk i didnt have anything against him but so help me if you try to pin it on me i can prove oh dont be childish im not going to try to pin anything on you ive got a proposition to make and im going to make it you can take it or leave it and that will end the whole thing all right im listening well you must realize that youre standing on dynamite now that i know who you are you wont get a chance at the treasure be cause youll have to leave town and if they catch you you go back to prison for life all right they wouldnt be after you any harder for an extra murder than they are now and always will be and with the money from that treasure you could go a long way from this coun try he leaned forward again sud denly intent are you suggesting that youll give me the book if ill confess rob insons murder exactly billie nodded grimly thats the proposition if you do it nobody finds out that youre james norcross and you get a good start before i spring the writ ten confession youre going to give me she watched him anxiously as he slumped back in his chair thinking so much depended on this for her for the man she loved that she had all she could do to keep from yelling out anything to break the tension he roused himself just once how do i know you can deliver the book youve got to take my word for it that book is hidden where youll never find it ill give it to you when i get your confession again he slumped back into the chair silent and after a long while he sat up his lips set he lsa strand of gold stretched a hand across the table and so great was billies relief that she laughed hysterically o k baby youre on he said chapter ix when billie met holland the next morning she was nervous and wor ried she knew exactly what she was going to do but knowing what you are going to do and doing it are two different things especially when a mission is as dangerous as the one on which she was embark ing you got that book he de manded immediately he had two men with him as well as a diving crew and a large motor boat no billie told him calmly i went out to the island and hid that book yesterday evening and i wont tell you where till i have what youre going to give me right in my hands so you dont trust me he asked with the first grin she had ever seen on his face not any farther than i could throw this boat billie grinned in return she knew that they under stood each other they rode out to the island in the boat and billie examined the diving equipment the air motor and the auxiliary hand motor in case there should be engine trouble while the diver was below she tried to lift the massive helmet and the leadweighted shoes the diver ex plained to billie the aircontrol valve inside his helmet which he worked with his head with it he could let the air out of his suit and stay down or let the suit fill with air and come to the surface if any thing happened to him he would automatically come to the surface because with no pressure on the valve the suit would fill with air he let her feel the wrist bands of the suit so tight they almost cut off the circulation the boat and div ing equipment she found were his whether he thought he was em barked on a legitimate enterprise or not she had no way of knowing when they reached the wharf and landed holland drew billie to one side now he said wheres that book now billie mimicked him wheres that paper with rather poor grace he drew a folded sheet of paper from his pocket and handed it to billie see if that suits you he snapped billie read it through and then put it into her bag thats all right come with me she walked down to the boat house and took the book from under a loose board holland grabbed it from her didnt mother ever teach you not to grab billie demanded where are your manners any way you cant do anything till i tell you which page to look on it says that that particular ship sank about one hundred feet due north of the end of whaleback island nearest the mainland read it for yourself its on page ninetyfour holland flipped the pages reached the page he was looking for and then read rapidly billie watched him so much treasure was a high price to pay for lens freedom and for her own but she may have real ized that if she gained love no price was too great at any rate she did not seem too terribly disap pointed now holland said with a satis fied smile when he had finished read ing were getting somewhere lsa street amp smiths love story magazine i know that you murdered gil robinson thinking he was len in return for your confession ill give you the book containing the information of the sunken treasure and time to make a getaway before spring the written confession strand of gold and now billie told him ill be starting back for the mainland an instant change came over him listen baby he leered youre staying right here see you aint going to any mainland with any dynamite like the paper you got there i aint trusting you to hold off showing it till i get the dough and get out of here youre stay ing right here on this island ill have one of the boys watch you billie had to agree to that be cause there was no other course open she had been afraid of it and she had planned for just such an emergency street amp smiths love story magazine because she knew knew as well as she knew her own name that holland would not find any treas ure for a while billie watched the diving operations from a bench up among the trees one of hollands own men had been left behind to keep an eye on her but she did not show any inclination to move and gradually he wandered farther and farther away caught by the ex citement of looking for the gold billie watched him carefully waiting her chance after a while holland called from the boat and the man on shore went in search of a large block of wood billie quietly slipped away from the bench strolled along until she was sure she was out of sight and then ran for the house when holland did not find any treasure he would be after her she knew and his signed confession meant too much to her to lose it of course she could hide the paper but she had no illusions about the good that would do her if she her self was still within hollands reach he would make her give it back torture her until she told him where it was hidden she dared not start for shore because the boats were all in plain sight of the anchored div ing boat shed have to hide but that was easier said than done she had thought about it a long time before she had decided on a place even then it was a tossup whether or not she would be found she knew that first of all they would search the house so that she did not plan to stay there yet she went there first let herself in and ran down into the cellar she hid the precious paper in one of the furnace pipes and then went out the back door she looked around care fully to be sure that no one was watching and then started toward the water tower there was a metal ladder at one corner of the frame work which held the huge tank and she climbed this cautiously the tank loomed high above her its water was supplied from the lake by a windmill and it was of course maintained to furnish pressure for the house before she was high enough in the air to see the diving ship at the end of the island she had reached the protection of the tank itself and was crawling up its side when she reached the top she lay there for several minutes then she took off the trapdoor cover and looked inside the tank was full just as she had expected and she nodded grimly to herself she lay there and waited taking care that only one eye and part of her cheek should be visible from the path be low she waited hours at last she caught a glimpse of something mov ing along the path the figure of a man running two more men she slid carefully through the trapdoor into the cold water of the tank it was darkpitchdark she swam over to the far side and grabbed the ends of the bolts which held the ladder in place the cold of the water was worse than it would have been if she had been swim ming because she was not moving around she could hear the men shouting to each other near the house look ing for her she heard doors slam and knew that the house was being turned inside out at last they gave that up and began to search the island they went about the task systematically and she was glad she had not chosen strand of gold to sit in a tree as she had at first planned still a tree wouldnt make you so cold that your teeth chat tered so cold it seemed as if you couldnt stand it the cold ate at her heart breaking down her reso lution making her want to climb out where the sun could warm her the consequences of being caught by holland seemed very remote to her then and the cold seemed very real for herself she might have given in but she was working for len for len and their happiness she gritted her teeth and stayed where she was not moving hardly daring to breathe shortly she heard voices again closer and louder she realized that the owners of the voices were standing directly underneath the tower i tell you shes gone ashore one voice urged and we aint safe here a minute and i tell you she hasnt hol lands voice answered impatiently shes hiding on this island and weve got to find her we havent looked up on that tower she might be there climb up and see billies heart sank she could feel the vibration through the ladder bolts as the man started to climb well this was the end might as well make the best of it and be a good loser she had staked every thing on their not thinking of the water tower and now she had lost the man climbed higher and higher until she could sense that he was directly outside the place where she herself was hanging on he looked over the top and then called down to holland his voice hollow and deafening inside the tank nobody up on top here look inside holland com manded billie played her last card as she heard the man scrambling forward she took several deep breaths in quick succession and then quietly sank below the surface held herself down there by bolt ends farther un der water all she could do was hold on un til her breath gave out at first it wasnt hard but gradually it be came horrible her lungs began to ache a splitting awful ache yet she held on grimly at least it took her mind off the cold water her head began to ache next worse than it had ever ached before yet she held on and when the pain began to bring unbearable fiery darts before her eyes she let her breath out gradually panic over took her for a few moments longer she fought it and then she came to the surface sucked in a great gulp of air breathed again and again her head still ached and her body was weak she had no control over it there was no shout of triumph as she had half expected and when she could see she realized that there was no mans figure in the trap door opening looking in at her she had not been seen then because she was so weak and the effort had been so great because relief had flooded her at last she began to sob she fought the cold and stayed there as long as she could even after there were no more sounds be low her then she came out and lay in the sun and after a long time her shivering stopped her clothes dried far off toward shore she could see the diving boat but she dared not take any chances one of hollands men might have stayed behind in hiding she remained up on the tower un til dark then went to the furnace for the paper after that she street amp smiths love story magazine walked silently down to the beach she waited a long time before she dared run across the sand in the open shove off a canoe and start for the mainland but no one followed her and an hour later she walked into the office at the jail threw the paper onto the desk and stood there while the man glanced through it that long she held her poise and no longer she had been through too much she sobbed a little try ing hard not to and she felt a great relief in being where it was light darkness was horribly unnerving a few moments later len came in his kindly face full of love for her his eyes shining and a second later she was in his arms those strong protecting arms which had the power to shut away from her all the evil and unhappiness in the world honey he said at last tell me about it i want to know if hes tried come on and sit down she said and ill tell you but please dont take your arm from around me len ii guess i need it so his arm around her she told him and when she had finished he said you did exactly right sweet the treasure wouldnt have mattered if we had been somehow kept apart our be ing together is the only thing that mat ters and youre especially right now that we know there was no treasure but there was there is billie told him and her eyes danced but billie you said holland didnt find and he didnt he was figuring just the way youre figuring the end of whaleback island nearest the mainland and he didnt know and you never stopped to think that the two islands were joined be fore the government dredged be tween them and that the whole thing was called whaleback there wasnt any diamond island then his eyes were startled as he be gan to realize what she meant so the end of the old whaleback island nearest the mainland he said would be what is now the shoreward end of diamond island the opposite end of the two islands from where holland looked exactly billie murmured and i knew they wouldnt find anything where they were looking and thats why i hid and thats why i dared make the offer to him in the first place joyfully he drew her to him say he said just before he kissed her i not only have the swellestlooking girl in fortyeight states but shes got more brains than any three men fortyeight states and the district of columbia billie grinned up at him and the district of columbia he as sured her two dis tricts both of co lumbia a week later billie and len stood arm in arm at the shore ward end of dia mond island watch ing the same diving boat which holland had hired bringing strand of gold honey len said im glad were rich but the thing that matters is that we have each otherand love and that means everything billie over the side a heavy iron chest rusted out at one end but with most of its precious contents recoverable it awed them a little to think how much was to be theirs into what luxury they were graduating there would be o want for them now everything in the world they could street amp smiths love story magazine think of they could afford len ex pressed the thought which was there between them honey he said im glad were rich but the thing that matters is that we have each otherand love and all that means it means everything billie it means happi ness whether youre rich or poor and riches mean unhappiness with out love i know billie answered softly lots and lots of times i stop and tell myself that all the misery i had before is being made up to me now now that i have you the happiness is supreme i dont think half so much about the things our treasure will buy as i think about our life together his arms stole around her and he kissed her rapturously and we owe it to you he said huskily because you were brave and clever im glad they caught holland i would have been nerv ous if he had still been at large for a long time they stood watch ing the work going on before them and in their hearts was the beauty of their surroundings and the won der of their love it seemed to billie as if her misery were far in the past so great was her happiness now len kissed her again and held her close and forgotten was the wealth that was so soon to be theirs finally billie said almost reverently i love you len and my vaca tion sweetheart is going to be my fulltime allday allthroughmy life sweetheart from now onfor always the end my beautiful dream though all my dreams are luring and evermore strangely fair like the petals of fragrant roses that drift on the summer air whenever i meet you darling as dusk walks the ghostly dew my tremulous heart discovers my beautiful dream is you dear lass when we keep our trysting and cling by the lilac tree as you and your yielding kisses are saying you love but me the earth is a mystic heaven where all of my dreams come true because my glad heart is knowing my beautiful dream is you edgar daniel krames her great moment by floria howe bruess sylvia a voice called in joy ous surprise esther dorn sitting on a bench in the park looked at the young man who was apparently hailing her as she stared his chauffeur brought the car to a stop and the young man sprang out and crossed the road to the girl his face was eager his eyes alight its either mistaken identity or an attempt at a pickup esther thought swiftly but he looks sin cere and glad to seesylvia esther was lonely it was sun day there was nothing to do she did not care to go to a concert or show alone she had gone for a walk in the park had become tired and had sat down on a bench street amp smiths love

believed she was sylvia whoever sylvia was it would be fun to carry this along for a while he would discover his mistake soon and they would laugh it off cant a girl change her mind she asked lightly especially you he agreed smil ingly youre the most changeable person on earth youve even changed your voice since youve been gone but i like that lower note keep it he laughed softly and seated himself beside her it seems funny to see you in the park alone what are you doing looking at you esther replied impishly what a nice laugh he had and how goodlooking he was with his wavy blond hair blue eyes and tall slim figure so far he hadnt discovered his mistake there must be an ex traordinary resemblance between her and sylvia esther mused she had heard of such resemblances doubles but this was her first ex perience staying with a friend sylvia yes you dont know her that much was true esther thought for he would not know kitty kitty taught drawing in the girls private school where esther taught piano kitty had gone home over the weekend else esther would not have been so lonely kitty would be back late that evening however for the next day was monday and you returned alone youve got something up your sleeve but i am glad to see you ive missed you terribly esther wondered who he was everything about him looked ex pensivethat big car a liveried chauffeur the thin platinum

she had better put an end to this before she got into deep water what a no girl you are youd stun me if you said yes but im driving you to where youre stay ing and im calling for you to night at eight and were dining he persisted well there was no reason why he shouldnt drive her home it was a nice apartment house she lived in it would be pleasant driving in that beautiful car she wouldnt talk much mustnt let the cat out of the bag he took her arm and they crossed the road the chauffeur touched his cap to esther as he opened the car door how do you do miss wylie he said esther smiled he too thought she was sylvia whose last name ap parently was wylie sylvia must have driven often with jack esther felt a little twinge of envy she gave jack the address and leaned back luxuriously as the big car purred through the park jack talked about his summer in canada esther gathered that he was in business with his father ex porters all too soon they arrived at her apartment ill call at eight jack said eagerly about to refuse a swift reckless ness swept away esthers caution why not go kitty would not be back until ten or eleven it would be such a long lonely evening jack was so obviously a gentle man and with his sense of humor he would laugh consider it a rich joke when later on she would tell him jack crossed to the vestibule with esther and looked at the cards over the letter boxes ring apartment d tonight she said gayly ill be ready at eight youre a darling he smiled his quick warm smile katherine burrows he read thats kitty i suppose who is esther dorn a friend of kittys she said quickly goodby jack no chance for me to come up now and mix a cocktail he held her hand and bent his deepblue eyes upon her not a chance kitty doesnt keep the makings neither does esther nice little girls he laughed what a dear boy he was esther sighed as she stepped into her apart ment and closed the door behind her sylvia was a lucky girl she had jack and a mother and father and was in europe that meant money background she was not alone in the world as esther was she was not dependent on her own efforts to make a living oh well esthers brown silky head went up and the darkbrown eyes sparkled she was in for ad venture it wasnt every girl who could have a lark like this mis taken for another girlwouldnt kitty howl id better see where sylvia lives esther flipped over the pages of the telephone book wylie too many of them shed have to be careful about that tonight she street amp smiths love story magazine turned to deering here it was john deering amp son exporters the residence was on park avenue that was the address on the enve lope she had seen tonight will be my one great moment im glad i had a wave and manicure yesterday esther sang under her breath as she laid out her new dinner dress i must be careful and not talk out of turn long before eight oclock she was dressed a flame of excitement blazed in her dark eyes her head rose like a flower from the silvery gown that clung like mist to the slim roundness of her figure her slip pers were the blue of the antique turquoise necklace she wore a necklace her grandmother had worn and esthers one piece of valuable jewelry her heart beat furiously when the bell rang she pressed the buzzer to release the outside door this is like stage fright she thought as she stood in the door awaiting him jacks eyes that held the blue of ice and the blue of fire lingered on her as he approached the doorway how exquisite she was hair like softbrown threads of silk eyes the deepbrown of pansies her skin was like satin her lips like rose petals he drew a deep unsteady breath ive never seen you look so beauti ful sylvia he stepped into the living room ready in a minute jack her voice was a trifle unsteady also this is a charming room he said when she reappeared with wrap gloves and evening bag arent you going to let me meet your friends id like to know kitty and esther they have good taste i like those etchings and that clock it looks like a terry esther was about to say it is it belonged to my grandmother but she caught herself in time i say arent those hepplewhite chairs yes they belonged to

accounts for that grand id like to meet esther she showed extraordinary good taste in arrang ing her antiques im ready jack esther said anxious to terminate the conversa tion youll slay em tonight sylvia he said holding the door open for her as she passed him he bent his head and kissed the brown silky hair dont jack she said faintly thats the weakest dont i ever heard from you my dear he laughed softly it was with trepidation esther en tered the big brilliant dining room in the towering hotel if some one who knew sylvia should see her it was a risk but it was worth it to spend one enchanted evening with jack ill tell him tonight on the way home esther promised herself not realizing then that promises are often gossamer frail easily broken she sipped her cocktail eyes on his beautiful eyes sylvia tonight there are little golden lights in them perhaps its the table light it has a yellow shade has it i havent time to look his eyes held her own as though helplessly he was drowning in them her great moment she too seemed as helpless to look away the waiter finally broke the spell dance jack queried after they had finished their entree esther rose at once glad to escape from the eyes whose blue fire was burning into her heart racing through her veins the feel of his arm around her left her breathless the clasp of his big firm hand on hers sent little thrills like pointed darts coursing through her they danced in almost complete silence esthers eyes were brilliant reckless when they returned to their table sylvia i feel somehow that you like me better tonight than you ever have am i right he leaned forward eager expectant something that was young and ar dent and devastatingly alive and that had no connection whatever with caution and common sense beat in her veins again the waiter intervened as he placed the consomme before them darned waiters jack growled theyre never around when you want them but theyre always on hand to spoil a perfect moment what a gay dinner companion he is she thought as she sipped the wine a delicate chateau margaux her fingers were white delicate as lily petals jacks eyes were upon them she hoped he did not ob serve they were unsteady over the alligator pearand romaine salad with its mignonette dressing esther thought soon the clock will strike twelve for me and this will be over i must not see him again in fact he wont want to see me when he learns that im not sylvia she raised stricken eyes to jack then quickly lowered her lashes they made alluring little shadows on her soft round cheeks jack was watching them with the dessert esther knew she was head over heels in love its too early to say amen to the evening jack said when they had dined lets drive out to a place i know he urged youve never been there i believe they put on a swell floor show and its a glorious nightmoonlight star light everything turned on ill call kitty and tell her ill be late esther murmured in a phone booth she dialed the number i may be late kitty she said when the familiar voice came over the wire im stepping tonight who ill tell you about it later listen have you ever heard of syl via wylie wait a minute ill think that name is familiar kitty replied slowly kitty was an information bureau esther reflected while she waited born in new york an enthusiastic reader of the society pages she had names gossip even bits of scandal at her finger tips i remember now shes that girl thats a dead ringer for you remember i told you when i first met you at the school ive seen her picture in the papers and shes been pointed out to me several times why esther esther had forgotten about kittys remark of three months be fore when she had first come to new york is she a society girl wealthy and is she reported engaged to any one yes to all your questions shes a last years deb shes been re ported engaged a dozen times once to some english lord but it fell through i guess she cant stay put street amp smiths love story magazine they say shes spoiled and head strong did you ever hear of john or jack deering sure father and son theyre in business together exporters nice people but not society though the young fellow goes out a bit ive seen his name in society columns for the love of pete why all the questions ill tell you when i come in thanks a lot kit esther hung up sylvia was spoiled changeable jack was in love with her sylvia had been flirting with himshe was not serious but he was it all added up well esther was not hurting sylvia by taking this precious eve ning no one would be hurt except herselfbut it was worth it on the drive home she would tell him she rehearsed the words jack get set for a big laugh im esther not sylvia ive been play ing a game she could go no further it was no longer funny it was cruel put it out of your mind she told herself fiercely be happy while you may love this was love she had often wondered if love would come to her and now how strangely it had come jack was very gay and seemed to be happy esther forced the shad ows from her heart and fell in with his mood finally they left the highway and turned into a narrow road music floated out to them on the cold night air lights in a long low building twinkled and beckoned cars were parked on the side of the building their tail lights shining like red eyes the night club was filled to capac ity brilliant with lights sparkling jewels and the sheen of velvet gowns esther thought they were going to a quiet place but this was bril liant smart if any of sylvias friends are here ill just have to take it esther told herself but it wouldnt be fun if one of sylvias friendswho had known sylvia so much longer than jack had and therefore would be able to see be yond the striking resemblance should upset the apple cart esther herself wanted to tell jack she did not want another to tell him but good fortune often favors the bold esther told herself and head up shoulders back she walked down an aisle to the ringside table jack secured they spent a gay hour there an hour heady with happiness for esther everything seemed a little unreal she felt like a leaf swept away on a stream of joy she had never dreamed of jack looking at her eyes ardent dancing with jack the hard beat of his heart so near her own then the drive back a late moon silvering everything lending beauty to the drabbest object twice she started to tell him but every beat of her heart protested against shattering the magic that in closed her then they reached her apartment the revelation stillborn on her lips tomorrow nighttonight it

no social background so write your own answer i know im going to tell him tonight esthers eyes were sud denly tragic well he certainly has knocked you for a loop youre crazy about him arent you dont talk about it i esther turned swiftly from her friends searching eyes street amp smiths love story magazine better get dressed kid kitty said softly wear my velvet and my new wrap the white fox collar will look lovely on you half an hour later the downstairs bell rang esther sprang up to press the buzzer kitty dont call me esther she pleaded softly as she went to the door dont give me away there was a frantic note in her voice kitty looked at her pity in her eyes slowly the pity turned to laughter you can say im dressing if i dont meet him i cant be a party to the second part or whatever it is kitty closed the bedroom door as the doorbell sounded jack brought gardenias he placed the box on a table then caught esthers hands in his slowly she drew them away she was breathless and frightened at the shining light in his eyes while she arranged the fragrant flowers on her shoulder jack picked up a beautifully framed photograph of a whitehaired woman this is a distinguishedlooking old lady who is she sylvia why sheshes esthers grand mother so good blood there suddenly esthers heart stood still for kitty was opening the bed room door and strolling into the room jack this is

are love my one and only ive loved you from the first night we went out together ill always adore you my darlingforever and ever the chauffeur had turned the car into the park and in the sheltering darkness of the treelined road their lips met and clung in a tender pas sionate kiss that fused their hearts together for all time you you were born for summer days and flowercup perfume and all the green of april and all the gold of june you were meant for dancing every sunlit meadow through where thrushes spin their melodies beneath a tent of blue and i was born to follow you to grant your smallest need to keep your garden flowerfilled and free from stone and weed to walk in joy beside you and to tell you all the day that my love is deep as heaven is and cannot go away that ever here

taken back sim ply by saying i hate you jills mind was still whirling with thoughts of bruce and lisa when she started across the street one car skidded around her and another driver swore softly as his front wheels went over the curb but the third didnt have room to turn he office scandal lady the driver was helping her to her feet thats no way to cross the street unless you want to commit suicide jill glanced at him and saw that he was young and blond and goodlooking yelled and jammed the brakes and jill went down in a little heap lady the driver was beside her in an instant helping her to her feet thats no way to cross the street unless you want to commit suicide and in that case its not fair to make me an accessory street amp smiths love story magazine jill glanced at him and saw that he was young and blond and good looking im sorry she murmured shak ily it was all my fault a curious crowd was gathering and the man took a firmer hold of jills arm lets get in the car he urged before were arrested for obstruct ing traffic you can move on jill didnt exactly know whether she wanted to go with him or not im not keep ing you but he wouldnt take no for an answer and the next moment she found herself in the car beside him do you think im coldblooded enough to drive away and leave you here he asked her reproachfully as he started the engine im no hit andrun driver not when i run down any one as pretty as you dont be silly jill said a trifle impatiently im not hurtreally im not i was just going home theres no need of you the young man grinned then home well go after all i did bump into you and the least i can do is see that you get home safely after a moments hesitation jill gave him her address and leaned back she was still a bit wabbly then she thought about bruce and sat up straight again im awfully sorry this hap pened the young man was saying if theres anything i can do for you just tell me perhaps it was that the accident that made jill lightheaded any way she took one look at the man beside her and spoke very fast there is something you can do tonight she drew a deep breath like a diver about to take a plunge you can come to my apartment and pretend that youre my past after that she had to explain not everything just enough so that the young man wouldnt think she was crazy at the end he glanced appraisingly at jill and laughed im to be an exsweetheart resur rected for the evening i get the idea its a good one if it will give me a chance to know you better dont count too much on that jill flashed him a smile its a past i want not a present or a fu ture ive a bad memory and ill be so good that after youve given the boy friend the air youll get the past all mixed up with the future they stopped in front of the house where jill had a tiny oneroom apartment how about having dinner with me he leaned forward eagerly theres lots we ought to talk about i couldnt jill drew back hastily but you can come early tonight i want you to be there when bruceshe stumbled a little over the namearrives wait a minute you havent told me your name im hilary borden harry to an old sweet heart jill didnt quite like the way he said it im jill ainsley she spoke hast ily goodby ill expect you about eight jill was trembling with excite ment as she closed the door of her apartment she must have been crazy to think up a stunt like this but crazy or not she couldnt back out and she didnt want to shed show bruce carroll if he could go back to lisa she could have some one else too office scandal he couldnt put his arms around her couldnt kiss her and make her change her mindnot with a good looking exsweetheart in the room pasts didnt bother him thats what bruce had said welljill tossed her head scornfullyshe hoped this one wouldplenty she ought to fall in love with harry borden just to spite bruce she ought to but jill couldnt think any further she didnt dare let herself think for fear she might forget that she hated bruce carroll now and only remembered that last night she had loved him at ten to eight jill felt like run ning away any place where she wouldnt have to see either harry or bruce againever her fingers were shaking so she could scarcely hold her lipstick and her lips were quivering so she could hardly get it on straight and then the bell rang for a moment she was afraid it was bruce and for a fraction of a second she hoped it might be but it wasnt it was harry borden lady his glance traveled over jills slim figure admiringly you sure look good to me no wonder i bobbed up out of the past to claim you you can make up your mind youre not going to get away from me again of course jill knew he was only pretending and he smiled when he said it but there was something about that smile that made her feel little and alone i wont keep you long she said hurriedly bruce wont stay hes not the kind to push himself where hes not wanted and well show him hes not wanted here wont we gorgeous he took a step toward jill and she noticed with a shiver of distaste that he had been drinking leave it to me ill get rid of bruce that was what she wanted jill reminded herselfto get rid of bruce but something was wrong and suddenly she knew it was harry borden he was what was wrong she should never have brought him here jill realized then that she couldnt bear to have bruce think she loved a man like harry borden its no use she faced him de terminedly ive changed my mind i cant go through with this i cant pretend that i ever loved you you cant harry wasnt smil ing any longer you thought you could this morning and im sure you can now you asked me to come here didnt you he asked darkly you invited me to play the part of an old sweetheart well im play ing it and i intend to keep right on the sound of the bell interrupted him it was bruce jill looked about wildly she had an absurd impulse to push harry borden un der somethinganywhere to hide him to get him out of the way but harry had no intention of be ing hidden he reached out and grasped jill roughly come on lets put on an act that will convince him lets do this up right jill jerked away she ran to the door and flung it open to admit bruce carroll for a moment she thought he wasnt coming in he stared at harry borden and back again at jill jills hands automatically flew to her hair she knew how she must lookflushed slightly disheveled exactly like a girl who has just been kissed harry spoke first dont you think youre intrud ing perhaps you cant see this is street amp smiths love story magazine bruce stepped into the room but left the door open from now on this is going to be a private party he told harry curtly and youre going to be on the outside a private party he said meaningly jill couldnt say a word at that moment her thoughts raced back to that morning when she had listened to the office gossip and believing it had walked out of bruces life her heart seemed to stop beating she couldnt even breathe it was bruces turn now would he be lieve harry borden or was his love big enough to trust her bruce didnt hesitate he stepped into the room but left the door open office scandal i can see one thing he said curtly from now on this is go ing to be a private party and youre going to be outside harry began to sputter but bruce silenced him and in another moment the door was closed and she and bruce were alone it was my fault jill tried des perately to keep her voice steady i asked him here ii wanted to show you bruce wouldnt let her say any more his arms were holding her closetender understanding arms his kisses were on her lipsthrill ing rapturous kisses of almost un bearable delight bruce she whispered brokenly bruce darling ive loved you all the time bruce kissed her again are you telling me he asked joyously i knew that from the beginning he picked her up and sat down in jills big chair it was marvelous how comfortably two people could fit in one chair and now about lisa you dont have to tell me about lisa jill snuggled closer i was a jealous little idiot i want to tell you about her bruce interrupted firmly she did work after hours in the office and have dinner there and dance but he smiled down on jilli wasnt the man who was with her perhaps you remember that writer friend of mine john howard turner who ex plores odd corners of the world and then turns up every once in a while with a best seller on his travels jill nodded vigorouslyas vigor ously as she could in the tight circle of bruces arms well he dropped in one day last summer with some typing that had to be done immediately and he bor rowed my office and lisa to do it andyou know how attractive some secretaries can be soon he was bor rowing my office whether he had work to do or not they used it as a regular meeting place because lisa hadnt as yet obtained her divorce and they didnt want to be seen to gether till after she was free her divorce jill opened her eyes wide i didnt even know she was married scarcely any one did she has her divorce now thats why she went awayto get it as soon as turner comes back again theyre to be married shell stay with me till then and break in a new girl so thathe paused a moment and then finished very solemnly and ten derlywe can be married at once and to thinkjill was almost breathless with happinessi al most let a silly office scandal spoil our love ive learned one thing love isnt all romance and kisses a big part of it is trust and under standing and forgiveness bruces arms tightened about her and his eyes met hers for a long wonderful moment then slowly tenderly he kissed her and as jill thrilled to the rapture of his lips on hers she knew that always their love would be a glorious thing be cause of their utter faith in each other your stars

improve your home conditions true i can see that you have been thinking of leaving your husband from the positions in your chart but you did not give me one scrap of information as a basis of judging the circumstances your husband is not as contented as he would like to be either i do not advise a separation and it would be most unfortunate for both of you if there is an outside emotional interest on the part of either of you it would result in a permanent break the only remedy i can suggest is a temporary separationa mari tal vacation so to speak if this is done i believe you would come back together again mrs j h husband born in february that is the trouble your husband has had things coming his way too much you should have sent me your birthday also i do not believe he will ever overcome his liking for liquor and his control of the habit will have to come from within himself he is the type of person that has to learn through experience and i cannot tell whether or not you have any influence over him without your hour of birth but i doubt it he is a very stubborn and opinionated young man the only thing you can do is to continue to cooperate and allow him to work out his program for him self texas al born august noon texas it is obvious that you are inter ested only in having a home you have many capabilities among them being an artistic talent and the capacity to write you will have to make your own choice the year is a line one for you in which to do some creative work i do not think you would like stenographic work at all the young man has influence for marriage next spring and you will have the impulse too it is all right to enter matrimony if the conditions are acceptable to you street amp smiths love story magazine apxy data omitted by request how can i tell you about c there is a set of circumstances which you have to discuss between yourselves even though i realize he is hard to handle at this time he is vague and confused in his mind and does not know what he wishes to do if there is another interest in his life my advice is to ignore it the wise course is to go along and keep up the pretense forget your pride until he comes to his senses he will be more serious next year and his financial status will improve for heavens sake be tolerant if you make one false move now you will regret it and there will be no more marriage your future adjustments de pends entirely upon you and the best course is for you to appeal to his emotions he is most susceptible to love and kindness hope you work out the problem mrs m c born july kansas a m sorry but i believe this affair is over you were foolish in acting as you did and his pride is hurt your chart does not blend well with his anyway and you will have other opportunities to marry the strongest indication being in if i were you i would admit to him that i was wrong and try to renew the friendship but keep it as a friendship this man is the type to be through when he has once made up his mind and you will find yourself get ting along with him much better if you keep your relations purely upon a friendly basis mrs c m e born july p m i can appreciate your position and sympathize with you that is an unpar donable situation to have on your hands surely there is something you can do to eliminate this person from your home it should be done as soon as possible i do not blame you for your resentment has your husband no influence at all in that quarter after all it is up to him and while i know it is difficult for him to take drastic steps with one of his own family it is unfair to you wish you had sent me the birth dates of all concerned i could be more definite if you had you will be much happier next year as your personal influences are improving but i do not think you should tolerate the present state of affairs there are changes indicated for you next spring and if you are unable to accomplish your purpose before that time you should take every way possible next may otherwise you will miss the value of your improved planetary conditions l o r born august p m you forgot to tell me where you were born young lady the young man is right in putting his career before his inter est in you he is ambitious and if you care for him you should be glad that he wishes to be financially solvent before undertaking marriage his influences are good this year and i am glad to see him starting in busi ness under his present aspects i believe he will make money in your charts blend well but it is up to the young man to create the opportunity for marriage if you are a wise girl you will be sympathetic and helpful and not try to force issues just be patient i do not believe you will regret it if you wait miss m l s born november kentucky p m you certainly were right when you said that you were temperamental but you will get over that as you get older and yet you are the type of person that has to have deep feel ings and an emotional interest in anything that you do in order to succeed you should be in the business world you like the feeling that a successful commercial venture brings just how you are equipped in training and environment to accomplish this purpose i do not know the next three years will bring you accomplishment and fulfillment but the results depend upon yourself the planetary conditions are fa vorable and will be helpful if you care to use them marriage is indicated in the summer months of miss a l data omitted by request you just go right ahead with your work and wait for marriage until circumstances bring it to you there will be a deep emo tional interest in your life in but you must not force issues there is marriage in the future but if it does not come until do not worry about it you can marry next year if you like but i advise you to wait you have no idea how much progress you are going to make in the next two years in the commercial field and in you will be able to increase your in come thanks for your interest you should undertake the study of astrology as a hobby you would like it and find your self making strides in it very shortly l z born december indiana a m the reason you have lost faith in people is because you have built your belief upon too idealistic a plane and for gotten that your fellow man is human your stars and you also i would like to say that you are for tunate in having had only one year of what you are pleased to call bad luck your entire life is ahead of you and while jupiter is helpful you have to be practical and take advantage of opportunities meanwhile mak ing your own too most of your difficult influences are past and the next two and one half years look very promising wake up and get a new viewpoint be serious about your business career and coordinate your forces keep your writing as a hobby for the present but do not give up your literary inclinations you will be able to capitalize upon them in the future even if you do not marry before you are thirty you have nothing to worry about there will be an opportunity for such a step the latter part of and there is more than one marriage in your life i d r born march wisconsin a m it requires longer than i would like to get around to your letters but you readers are patient souls and seem to understand the length of time it takes to prepare our magazine for national dis tribution sorry you had to wait com paring your data with the other two charts i shall have to discard the october one he is attractive to you and there is a strong physical urge shown between you but the august person is much better suited to your temperament and he will be more likely to fulfill your ambitious and expecta tions there is no indication of an im mediate marriage for you unless you took that step this fall and you might have done so due to the strongly emotional plan etary conditions there is a strong indica tion in of an attraction and there is a definite one about three years from now miss m u born august bel gium a m i advise you to pursue both these courses the mans chart blends with yours very nicely and i believe you could have a pleasant life together if both of you make up your minds not to nag and criticize each other there is no reason why you should give up your career just because of marriage mrs g s born december michigan a m it seems to me that the current circumstances are desirable for you as there is little harmony shown be tween the two charts of course it is obvi ous that you do not wish your life to be subjected to criticism because of the un truths some one has circulated about you and you are wise to contest the action if this party had any chivalry it would be understood that you would be the aggres sor perhaps you can sell the idea and create an amicable situation try any way it is always unfortunate to have this type of thing end with bitterness it looks to me as if you two might be able to get together on this planetary conditions

pages problems on which you desire advice your letters will be regarded confidentially and signatures will be withheld although mrs brown receives more letters than she can possibly print in the department she answers all the others by mail so lay your problem before her with the knowledge that it will have her full attention address mrs laura alston brown street ampsmiths love story magazine seventh avenue new york n y it is human to yearn for the spoken word of approval love appreciation and praise from those who have it in their power to produce upon our heartstrings either sadness or happiness most men are apt to get plenty of attention from girls who love them most wives too do not neglect to make some outward show of approval of their husbands and yet many men seem to scorn the idea of re ciprocating these same little ges tures so dear to every womans heart when compliments and praise cease and a woman is allowed to become starved for attention and the little niceties the man of her heart once showered upon her dis appointment in love is not far off dear mrs brown im a young mar ried woman not yet twentyseven and have been married six years we have two darling children a boy and a girl my hus band adores them and so do i the trouble is that although i think my husband loves me as much as he ever did sometimes i am tempted to believe that most unhappiness in marriage is caused by the man taking his wife too much for granted during the first three years of our mar riage my husband used to pay me all sorts of compliments the way he did when we were engaged hed notice if my hair was done differently or when i had something new to wear and was always interested in how i spent my time hed tell me i looked sweet and even my culinary efforts werent overlooked but how different everything is now i know he loves me and yet he seldom notices what i wear how i look or cares where i go and what i do it isnt as though id let myself go as some wives do i am still considered very attractive have naturally golden hair blue eyes use make up and dress well if not better than i used to before i was married of course i long to be noticed especially by tom im not so aged that i dont care whether or not he thinks i look nice but i am losing heart mrs brown must a girls sweetheart turn out to be such a flop after marriage when it comes to love making why are men so blind once the girl they courted is tied to them for life sometimes i seem to be just about as ex citing to him as a piece of furniture my husband expects me to be interested in what he does and to show him that i appreciate everything he does for me and the children if i should ignore him as he does me he at once thinks there is some thing wrong with me he seems to want me to think that his interests are of the greatest importance and mine of none at all street amp smiths love story magazine i am sure there isnt another woman in the case mrs brown is it so unreason able for a wife to expect her husband to notice her and to show her that he ap preciates her as he used to do before marriage whenever i read about lonely wives and how some of them accept the attentions of other men i often think it serves a hus band right if he neglects his young wife to the point where she is starved for some attention as long as i love my husband and have my children to think of i suppose ill try to put up with this indifference on his part but it certainly isnt all honey for a wife once the sweetheart idea has worn off to a shadow i would love to hear from other readers and especially men as to why hus bands forget that a wife is human and needs as much attention after five or ten years of marriage as she did before mar riage almost disgusted it would seem that from time im memorial men have been used to feminine praise and have taken it for granted that such praise is due them because they have to go out and toil for their families but do they really forget that their wives also toil and that praise and an outward show of appreciation we humans find so sweet would be wel come when the monotony of house keeping is over for the day let us observe any two young people in love they compliment each other pay attention to each others likes and dislikes and are usually careful not to appear indif ferent to each others interests but what happens in so many cases after several years of mar riage judging from the countless letters that reach this department it would appear that husbands are often to blame for many unhappy marriages because they forget that wives are warmhearted human be ings hungry for compliments soft flatteries and comments of ap proval a man may love his wife think all the lovely things in the world about her but if he stints on words and actions of praise how can she know what he feels if men would only remember that a few sincere compliments mean so much to a woman one of the serious thorns in marriage would be quickly removed dear mrs brown may i say a few words to girls who are in doubt as to how they can keep their boy friends interested the main point id say is to know your man if my two experiences will be of help to some other girl here they are i went steady with a young man for a long time we became engaged but because i showed him that i did not care for the company of other boys and wanted him only he got the idea that no one else could possibly be interested in me with the result that our engagement is now a thing of the past then i met another boy i liked i thought i would try a different method with him i teased and led him a merry chase went out with other boys and he was never sure of me he finally decided that i couldnt possibly be constant so you see what you can do with one man you cant do with another some men like to be tackled and give the girl the reins to steer them hither and you while others like to be the hunters in love and feel dis gusted with highhanded tactics however i for one have decided to play highhat and wait for my phone calls even if i have to wait the rest of my life a girl has only her pride and reputation both of which men are ever so ready and willing to snatch why not give the boys a run for their money let them come after you i have had plenty of experience that showed me the wisdom of this de cision baby face your turn now family should men as baby face says be given a run for their money are they really so selfish and mercenary as to stand ready to snatch a girls pride and reputation lets hear from you dear mrs brown may i talk to you for a littie while and tell you my story about nine months ago i fell deeply in the friend in need love my love was returned of that i am certain and for a while i was in heaven i wonder now if that sense of utter happiness is ever permanent we were both weak and all the time i was conscious of the fact that i was doing something wrong that no matter how much we loved each other i was lowering myself for him it was different at least i thought so because although i am a girl i believe in the double standard in other words it was wrong for me but not for him still i couldnt break away i was foolish enough to believe that if that was the way he wanted me id do anything even go as far as to fling everything i held sacred to the four winds about this time my aunt opened her winter home in florida and i went to spend three weeks with her during that time it seems ages i discovered what i was already almost certain of that other men might amuse me but never hold me i enjoyed their company even had mar velous times but i couldnt forget under neath it all i wasnt satisfied there was always something missing and i was dis contented the evening before i left for home i chucked my social obligations and rode alone almost all night trying to find the answer to at least a few of my questions and when i returned home it was with the determination to end things i saw him that evening mrs brown and before he left i had the courage to tell him we couldnt possibly go on as we had been i didnt ask the impossible that he change for me merely that he stop calling and when he told me he couldnt i used the only argument left i told him i no longer loved him i know i hurt him horribly but i couldnt help it when he kissed me goodby he said he didnt see how it was possible to love so completely as he loved me and not have that love returned but true to his word he hasnt tried to get in touch with me since i have lots of social obligations that must be fulfilled but each time i sit across the table from some chap i see another face and every time i dance its with his arms around me i know ive literally thrown away my chance of happiness and even though what i did took strength ive not a shred of it left to carry on with mother thinks i am plain crazy to have sent him away when i care so much but she doesnt know why and i pray she never may dad however agrees with me that i am too young to become serious and wants mother and me to go to europe for a change im so sick of doctors tonics warnings about not eating enough and nervous breakdowns that i really dont care where they take me one thing i do want you to know and that is that marriage doesnt enter into this at all im too young and though this boy is two years my senior hes not ready to settle down either do you think ive done the right thing in breaking up with him even though ive done wrong according to conventions i cant say i m sorry be cause this love has given me some wonder ful moments it will be very hard to for get him but i am not sure that our love will last until we are old enough and ready to marry do you think i should wait for him and expect him to wait for me poor little rich girl it is undeniable that experience is the great dispeller of illusions espe cially when youth begins to discover that there is a price to be paid for too much freedom where loves young dream is concerned you dont say how old you are but if neither you nor this boy is old enough to think of settling down to marriage then youre probably too young to think seriously of love its sad but true that very young people are apt to mistake the novelty of an exciting romantic ad venture for real love having a crush on a boy who has captured your fancy and forgetting conven tions does not balance the scales where real love is concerned much as i would like to do so i am not endowed with mystic power that would enable me to look ahead and tell you whether or not any affection that may now exist be tween you and this boy will last until you are older and ready to con sider marriage but if you have already sent your friend away wouldnt it be wiser to leave the matter as it stands continue with your other interests and let father time take care of your tomorrows street amp smiths love story magazine dear mrs brown im a girl of twentythree and for the past four years i have been going with a young man four years my senior i am considered good looking dress well and hold a good position im not engaged to this boy and never have been but during the first three years we went together i saw him almost every night of course we quarreled now and then and parted several times but we always made up my family have continually nagged at me to give him up because he drinks and behaves terribly when drunk about two years ago he started to slap me when he was in this condition the next day hed beg me to forgive him saying he was sorry but the same thing has happened many times a year ago a man around thirty years of age came to work in our office he asked me to go out with him but i re fused one day however i had a quarrel with my boy friend and he beat me up after that i made up my mind to go out with others so the next time this new man asked me for a date i accepted he seemed so considerate and wonder ful after what i went through with the other boy that i started to go out with him quite often i know youll think me terrible when i say that this man was mar ried and i knew it the first time i went out with him was because i was so dis couraged about the other boy but grad ually we began going out three and four times a week then some one told his wife and she left him i continued to date him after a year of that i finally realized how wrong it was for me to go out with him so i gave him up i made up with my first boy friend but when he found out about the married man he accused me of pretty nearly everything he struck me and told all our friends i was cheap enough to run after a married man finally this man made up with his wife but he kept telling me that he wasnt happy and that he loved me i was still going with my first boy friend in spite of his abuse but we parted a few weeks ago because i just couldnt stand it any longer he follows me around however stops me whenever he can tries to talk to me and if i wont he slaps me hes always throw ing it up to me that i was a married mans sweetheart but this married man never made any advances to me i sent him away because i realized that it was wrong he even wanted to get a divorce and marry me but i managed to convince him that we could never be happy if we made his wife un happy he still loves me and i love him though ill never let him know i told him i loved the first boy though thats a lie because i sometimes hate him more than it seems possible for one human being to hate another last week the three of us met at a party and when my first boy friend met the mar ried man he struck me since then he comes around to my place of business and tells me that i deserved the beating be cause he says i invited this married man to the party so i could see him but i didnt i couldnt help it if some one else brought him along i didnt even know he was coming in the four years i have been going with this boy he ran around with married and divorced women and denied all the stories i heard until i saw him myself he was to blame for my actions and now he wants me to make up i know if i marry him i will have a terrible life i know youll tell me to forget him and i would like to do that but he just wont stay away he tells me that if i ran around with a married man once ill do it again and hes there to see that i dont three days ago this other man phoned and asked me to see him but i refused he told my friends that if he couldnt have me he hoped id never marry the other fellow because he has caused me so much trouble i am desperate unhappy arline no girl is obliged to marry a man who is as despicable as your first boy friend arline for goodness sake shake yourself awake and re member that this is if he wont keep away from you tell your family about it and if they havent sufficient influence to make him stay away from you the mighty hand of the law will im sure bear some weight with him you neednt be quite spineless simply be cause like a bad boy he says i wont when a girl is thinking of mar riage she should try to choose a man of character and dignity the friend in need every girl wants a husband of whom she can be proud and who will treat her with consideration but she cant blame any one but herself if she allows herself to be bullied into marriage as for the married man make it a final noand make it sound final im sure that if he sees you are firm he will stop calling dear mrs brown how can a girl be normal happy and carefree if all around her she sees nothing but bitterness and bickering that would drive any one crazy im a girl of sixteen my father died when i was quite young and my mother married again for a little while every thing seemed to be all right but you should visit my home now its fight fight fight all the time ive seen so many unhappy marriages that i dont think i will ever marry my mother goes out with other men and my stepfather does his share of going places with other women sometimes i think that i have seen enough of life to make any one sick of it ive had a little experience myself i started to date boys when i was fourteen at fifteen i kept company with a boy of twentytwo right now im going out with a married man who doesnt live with his wife he is thirty but whats the dif ference people say like mother like daughter they dont give me a chance they expect me to be bad and theyll talk anyway i often feel as if id like to give them something to talk about before i started going with this married man i was crazy about a young fellow i think i was really in love with him then some one lied to him about me and he be lieved that person he didnt even give me a chance to explain you may say he couldnt have cared for me and maybe he didnt care as much for me as i did for him but that didnt stop my loving him i still think of him even though i tell some of my friends that i hate him im so lonely that i could cry but i smile and pretend im happy all my socalled friends would laugh if they heard me say that i was lonely sad sixteen when a girl has such a poor ex ample of what happiness can really mean it is small wonder that she feels disillusioned and somewhat hopeless regarding marriage and her own future i sympathize with you my child but let me assure you that unhappy marriages are the ex ception and not the rule whenever young girls of sixteen moon around and think theyre in love it usually turns out to be nothing more than a schoolgirl in fatuation perhaps there is no harm in an attack of puppy love now and then but its unwise to allow yourself to think that life isnt worth living just because some boy disappoints you it isnt always a simple matter to erase unfavorable impressions from a youthful mind but i think that if you would stop dating boys drop them altogether for six months or longerand harness your in terests in other directions life would take on new meaning for you join girls clubs and if it is at all possible go to live with a relative for a while its really a pity that your mother has so little consideration for you and so little respect for herself perhaps you can even go back to school if you have to hold down a job go to night school where you can take up some course that might interest you if you throw yourself whole heartedly into the change a more balanced perspective will gradually return to you come again dear mrs brown im a young fellow of twenty but feel about fifty after all ive gone through ever since i was fifteen i have been going with a girl i knew from school and about a year ago we became engaged we planned to get married last may two weeks after our engagement was announced i found out that the previous spring she had been in trouble and that the man had paid her several hun dred dollars to straighten things out of course i thought that she had learned street amp smiths love story magazine her lesson and because i really cared for the girl i saw no sense in bringing it up it hurt me deeply to find this out about her but i decided to forgive her and go on as before things ran along smoothly i had several hundred dollars saved to start our home with but the bank in our town closed up and i dont know yet whether ill ever get my money or not when i went to see my fiancee she treated me very coldly she said she was sorry this happened but she behaved as if i were a stranger and we quarreled then she became sweet again but it didnt last i hated to think that because id apparently lost my money she didnt want to marry me one day when we were quarreling i told her that i knew about her and this man she said that i was very oldfashioned and jealous and if i thought she was going to stay home waiting until i made more money and could take her places i was mistaken but the next day she wrote that she was sorry and didnt think what she was say ing and begged me to forgive her which i did a week or two after that she came to see my mother who wasnt feeling well at the time after she left our home she went to see a cousin of hers who lived in the next block and spread the story that my mother was lazy because she didnt even try to serve my fiancee something to eat while she was there however once more i for gave her then she wrote me that she didnt want to get married and sent back the ring three weeks ago i saw an announcement of her engagement to another fellow he is very well off financially and can give her lots more than i could i met her on the street after that and she begged me to forgive her but she wouldnt break up with this other fellow she said because he takes her out a lot for the past two weeks i have been go ing with another girl trying to forget but i dont seem to be able to do that this other girl has told me that she loves me and wants to get married she is very sweet and thinks i feel about her as she does about me but i hate to keep on de ceiving her i only told her i cared for her to find out how she felt about me i really do think a great deal of her and when we are together i dont feel so bad about the other girl in fact ive almost decided to marry this girl because she be lieves that i love her and i wouldnt want to break her heart my former fiancee knows i go with this girl and says that if i take her back she will break with this fellow please tell me what to do mrs brown my heart tells me to take her back but my sense of honor and common sense tell me to marry the other girl who im sure wouldnt treat me like the first girl did i often think that if i marry the second girl ill be happy with her because she is so good and sweet disappointed reader habits and points of view as well as traits of character are pretty well fixed before two people marry and nothing is more foolish than to try to convince yourself that the person youre attracted to can make you happy when the linger of bet ter judgment points against it perhaps that is where the saying that love is blind comes into its own the girl youve been engaged to has proved by her actions that she isnt quite worthy of your love and if you give yourself a fair chance you will in time become much more deeply attached to another girl but i wouldnt advise you to marry a girl you know you dont love even though she is sweet and good and sincere and you feel that you may learn to return her affec tion you know the old saying about haste my suggestion is that you do nothing for at least two or three years why because youre too young to really know your own heart and mind though you may think you do and because youre not in love with the girl you think you should marry you should also have something set aside to start housekeeping on and above all because youre upset dis appointed and are not at all sure what you want to do let it all pass make no rash de cisions waste no more time on the first girl go on being friendly with the friend in need the second girl and have other girl friends too by the time a couple of years pass things will clear up for you not only in your own mind but financially too and youll be more sure as to what you should do dear mrs brown two years ago when i graduated from business school i found a position with a firm of lawyers i was then eighteen years old the firm consists of four lawyers my job is to take dictation from one of them and help out another member of the firm the other two have their own stenographers the lawyer i worked for is a bachelor around thirtytwo for about a year everything was all right and i liked my job then he started to tell me funny stories and asked me personal questions as to how many boy friends i had how often i dated them did i go to dances et cetera then he surprised me by asking if i would kiss him i said not unless im forced to but didnt realize at the mo ment how foolish and perhaps even invit ing this remark must have sounded anyway a day or so later he put his arms tight around me from behind as i was sitting at my desk and kissed me this happened many times of course i pro tested but he seems to make it a sort of habit hes asked me several times to go out with him but so far ive refused he hasnt gone beyond kissing me i would hate to resign as i like my work and need the money and work is rather scarce just now also i am almost the sole support of our family ive asked him countless times to leave me alone but he just laughs it off he kisses me when i least expect it i dont know what to do am i doing wrong in allowing him to go on like this a girl can flirt and kiss other men and it seems all right but when it comes to her employers why is it different and con sidered terrible i know that if the other girls in the office knew about this theyd be gossiping about me all the time secretary beth business is business and as a general rule flirtations between girls and their employers mix no better than oil and water theres no question that there exists the type of man who labors under the impression that just because he pays a girls salary he can play romeo during business hours judging from your letter how ever i doubt very much if your em ployer would go on kissing you once you really put your foot down and make it very plain to him that this sort of thing must stop if hes a gentleman he will not force his at tentions on you if you show him that his advances are distasteful to you but perhaps your vanity is flattered that hes keen enough about you to ask you to go out with him and there may be something in your actions which does not quite convince him that you actually re sent his advances you may not have been firm enough with him of course if he persists youll have to find another way out couldnt you talk to the head of the firm for instance and ask him to assign one of the other girls to take this mans dictation dear mrs brown i was married at nineteen and have been very unhappy i have tried my best to make our marriage a success but somehow things went wrong bill and i both worked after we were married and though neither of us earned a great deal our combined earnings were enough to provide a fairly comfortable living however bill started to drink and when i begged him to stop he paid no attention to me finally his drinking cost him his job i never wanted very much i wanted a little home furniture of our own and was satisfied with few clothes but no matter how hard i tried i didnt seem to be get ting anywhere i left bill four times be cause i couldnt stand seeing him drunk around the house and because i hoped it would wake him up he promised to do better each time i left and of course i always went back when i found out finally that i couldnt go on like this and that i didnt really love him any more because he had killed all the feeling ive ever had for him i left town once in a while i went out with street amp smiths love story magazine other men the men i really liked wanted to marry me after a while but marriage of course was out of the question for me cant men be just pals im twentytwo now and in the past two years i have lived in four different cities im so discontented and restless i dont know what to do to find a little peace and happiness i know there are many things i should be thankful for im healthy can easily earn my own living and i have lots of friends but i feel that something is wrong when i go to a party ill start having a good time and then suddenly i want to get away from every one see new faces and just drop every one i know of course i dont do exactly that but now and then i dont see any one for a week at a time and i stay home i have been in this city four months have a good job and i ought to be happy and satisfied but im ready to pack up and be on the go do you think im silly im all alone my parents died four years ago and i have no brothers or sisters is there any way i can overcome this feeling of restlessness and dissatisfaction i dont like to broodtheres nothing i like better than to laugh and be gay i have some nice girl friends and know several worthwhile men so i shouldnt be lonely ill appreciate anything you can tell me restless shirley in spite of everything life holds happiness for every one of us but it doesnt come done up in pack ages and handed over a counter you may say that youre not lonely or that you shouldnt be lonely be cause you have men and women friends but deep down in your heart you are very lonely and the sense of having failed or missing the really vital thing so important to most womena happy marriageis what makes you miserable you can spend a lifetime rushing from place to place groping among new interests for that mysterious something which you think will make you happy but no one in this world ever found happiness by flitting around restlessly if theres not the slightest change of your husband pulling himself to gether so that you can make a real start together again then why re main in this uncertain and exas perating situation youre not exactly a wife and you cant be a sweetheart make up your mind definitely one way or the other and then act accordingly happiness is a thing of slow growth it has to be fought for before it can be won dear mrs brown four years ago i married a boy one year younger than i i really loved him then and still do regard less of all the heartbreaking things that have happened the first two years of our marriage were perfect in every way but arent the first two or three years always perfect the last two years have been nothing less than a nightmare i wonder what others would have done if they had been in my shoes the trouble started when my husband began to drink from liquor to running around with women was a short step i dont smoke or drink but im not at all oldfashioned and consider myself modern in every other respect i tried several methods in my effort to reform my husband but i failed each time after almost a year of staying home alone nights and trying to pay our bills out of what was left of his salary i just couldnt put up with things any longer i told him that i was going home i packed my things and left and went back to work my husband pretended that he didnt miss me but he started to act wilder than ever every one who knew us pitied me finally i decided that divorce would be the best way out needless to say i was heartbroken but i thought it might wake him up if i de manded money well i got my money but he didnt change and i wasnt any happier then my husband fell sick he caught cold and it developed into pneumonia he called for me all the time and at last i went to see him he wanted me back he said he loved me i remarried him for two months everything went fine then he went out one day got drunk and never came back he stayed away eight months i worked night and day trying to for the friend in need get my misery i went out of course and even had three proposals to marry but every night i sent up a prayer for my lost husband i learned to take knocks with a smile i became independent and promised myself not to let anything hurt me again a month ago my husband came back he seemed changed in looks was more quiet and refined but he didnt find me as easy as i had been before he begged me to give him another chance so i put him on probation for a year i felt that it was a year against a lifetime i know that i wont change my mind and take him back before that year is up no matter how often he begs me to make up now i havent given up yet and im going to keep right on hoping that things will turn out all right my husband seems a changed man but i will not let him break my resolution if he disappoints me i wont let him hurt me as he did before i hope some other wife tries this method it may solve her problem it is now seven months since my husband and i are good friends i see him once a week the rest of the time he works from what i can see it would appear that hes working hard last week he showed me a bank book with several hundred dollars to his credit so it looks as though hes saving his money and i havent noticed that hes drinking or running around with other women he lives two blocks away and his landlady says he seldom goes out and then only to a movie i think my plan is going to work out all right i hope so dorothy s and i hope so too dorothy be lief and strength in your own con victions will help you find ultimate happiness if your husband is working so hard to get you back it looks as if hell turn out to be the right kind of husband after all when the year of probation is up good luck to you wont you write again and let us know how things have turned out neck and neck finishes victory as the whistle blows exciting experiences c twice a month at all news stands street amp smiths sport story magazine stories by tw ford danney horton william bruner and others stories of the stars actionpacked pages street amp smiths love story magazine dear mrs brown why are men so easily deceived by women who have noth ing to do but break up homes and enjoy themselves by vamping other womens hus bands i suppose mine can be considered an old story but no matter how old the story is its usually new to the person who is on the wrong side of it six years ago i married a man i loved dearly i still love him he loved me at the time of our marriage and for four years we were very happy then came promotion in his work and a transfer to another branch of the business brought him in contact with women and thats where the trouble started the first thing he did was to begin to drinkjust to be sociable he said then he started to run around first with one woman and then another lied about busi ness engagements and stayed out all hours of the night we have no children and i am glad of it now because of what hap pened then my husband began to complain when i wanted him to take me out i thought it might be my fault so i started to take an interest in the things i knew interested him and kept my home in fine order for a few months he forgot to com plain and then the same things began to happen again one day he said he was going out of town on business and hasnt returned of course i dont mean that i havent heard from him i have he arranged to send me an allowance and i continue to live in our cozy little apartment the worst of it all is that i love him dearly and probably always will he was the only man i ever cared for and i know that a reconciliation is out of the question now a wife seems to mean so little in a mans life are men not to be trusted with a womans heart i feel as if there is nothing for me to live for im sure i cant love any other man ive lived alone for almost two years now and i feel worse all the time mrs x tragic as it is many compara tively young women are confronted with an early marriage failure some wives may be partly to blame some may not
