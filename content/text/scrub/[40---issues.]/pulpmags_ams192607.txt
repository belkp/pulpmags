place new york n y extravagant fiction today cold fact tomorrow fiction versus facts by hugo gernsback a few letters have come to the editors desk from some readers who wish to know what prompts us to so frequently preface our stor ies in our introductory remarks with the state ment that this or that scientific plot is not impossible but quite probable these readers seem to have the idea that we try to impress our friends with the fact that whatever is printed in amaz ing stories is not necessarily pure fiction but could or can be fact that impression is quite correct we do wish to do so and have tried to do so ever since we started amazing stories as a matter of fact our editorial policy is built upon this structure and will be so continued indefinitely the reason is quite simple the human mind not only of today but of ten thousand years ago also is and was so con stituted that being merged into the present it can see neither the past nor the future clearly if only five hundred years ago or little more than ten generations which is not a long time as human progress goes anyone had come along with a story wherein radio telephone steamships airplanes electricity painless surgery the phonograph and a few other modern marvels were described he would probably have been promptly flung into a dungeon all these things sounded preposterous and the height of nonsense even as little as one hundred years ago and lo and behold within two generations we take these marvels and miracles as everyday occurrences and do not get in the least excited when we read of recent reports that it will be possible within a year or less to see as well as hear your sweetheart a thousand miles away without intervening wires or connections of any sort so when we do read one of these to us impossible tales in amazing stories we may be almost certain that the impossibility will have become a fact perhaps before an other generationâif not much sooner it is most unwise in this age to declare anything impossible because you may never be sure but that even while you are talking it has already become a reality many things in the past which were declared impossible arc of everyday occurrence now there are few stories published in this magazine that can be called outright impossible as a matter of fact in selecting our stories we always consider their possibility we reject stories often on the ground that in our opinion the plot or action is not in keeping with science as we know it today for instance when we see a plot wherein the hero is turned into a tree later on into a stone and then again back to himself we do not consider this science but rather a fairy tale and such stories have no place in amazing stories of course once in a great while an author may take some liberties as happened for instance in the conclusion of a trip to the center of the earth printed in this issue jules verne brought back his heroes in a most improbable manner but this one defect does not detract from the story as a whole throughout which good science is maintained it is only when the entire plot becomes frankly impossible or far too improbable that we draw the line and it should never be forgotten that the educational value of the scicntifiction type of story is tremendous mr g peyton wertenbaker author of the man from the atom says this on the same subject amazing stories should appeal however to quite a dif ferent public referring to the sextype of literature scientifiction is a branch of literature which requires more intelligence and even more aesthetic sense than is possessed by the sextype reading public it is designed to reach those qualities of the mind which are aroused only by things vast things cataclysmic and things unfathomably strange it is designed to reach that portion of the imagination which grasps with its eager feeble talons after the unknown it should be an influence greater than the influence of any literature i know upon the restless ambition of man for further conquests further understandings literature of the past and the present has made the mystery of man and his world more clear to us and for that reason it has been less beautiful for beauty lies only in the things that are mysteri ous beauty is a groping of the emotions towards realiza tion of things which may be unknown only to the intellect scientifiction goes out into the remote vistas of the uni verse where there is still mystery and so still beauty for that reason scientifiction seems to me to be the true literature of the future the danger that may lie before amazing stories is that of becoming too scientific and not sufficiently literary it is yet too early to be sure but not too early for a warning to be issued amicably and frankly it is hard to make an actual measure of course for the determination of the correct amount of science but the aesthetic instinct can judge i can only point out as a model the works of mr h g wells who has instinctively recog nized in his stories the correct proportions of fiction fact and science this has been possible only because mr wells is a literary artist above everything rather than predomin antly a scientist if he were a scientist his taste and sense would permit him only to write books of scientific research since lie is an artist he has given us the first truly beautiful work in this new field of literature these opinions we believe state the case clearly if we may voice our own opinion we should say that the ideal pro portion of a scientifiction story should be seventyfive per cent literature interwoven with twentyfive per cent science station x by g mcleod winsor as water and even atmosphere began to fail the lunarians the enormous circular reservoirs they made for its conservation and which must be so plainly visible from your earth stand to this day in their roofless ruin everlasting monuments to their abilities station x chapter i the new post as alan macrae watched the last hues of the sunset from plymouth hoe pale over mount edgcumbe he stood out in marked contrast to the stolid west country types around him his tall looselimbed figure his brooding gaze his nervous highlystrung manner marked him as a stranger a touch on the arm recalled him from his apparently sombre thoughtsâthe touch of a girl who had ap proached him unobserved at the sight of her his melancholy vanished im so sorry im late alan she cried gaily but the manager had a fit a fit questioned macrae yes of work exclaimed the girl and he kept me doing letters quite indifferent to the fact that this is our last night together lets walk shall we as they walked slowly along the hoe the con trast between the two was remarkable the brisk alertness of may treherne seemed to accentuate her companions moodiness and psychic gloom they had been engaged for a year and were waiting only for fortune to smile upon them to get married as may had expressed it bread and cheese and love are all right but you must be sure of the bread and cheese macrae had by sheer merit obtained an ap pointment at a foreign radio station that was all he knew beyond the fact that the salary was a handsome one on the morrow he was to start for his unknown destina tion where for a period of six months he would be lost to the world he would be allowed neither to send nor to receive letters and was sworn to divulge nothing as to where he had been or upon what engaged perhaps ive been a fool to take the post he said looking down at his companion with pessimis tic eyes thats not flattering alan said the girl gaily determined to cheer him out of his gloomy mood you did it so that we could she paused get married he con cluded the sentence for her yes i know but think of six months without you in a place that i know nothing about cheer up alan cried may brightly itll soon pass it was splendid of you to accept it im tired of sales limited and still more tired of its man ager hes such a motheaten tittle worm we are beginning in this issue station x which we consider by far the greatest radio story that was ever written at least we have never read or seen a better one lest you believe that it is impossible for one being to interchange his mind with that of another and thereby control him physically please consider the following in the publishers of this magazine in conjunction with station whn of new york city then located at ridgewood l i and mr joseph h dunninger per formed the following experiment on the morning of july a subject was placed in front of the loud speaker in radio news labo ratories at s park place new york city mr dunninger was at the broadcast station whn and by commanding the subject a young man mr leslie b duncan to fall asleep he impressed his will upon the sub ject from a distance of over fifteen miles until the latter fell into a hypnotic trance the subject was examined by over twelve newspaper reporters assembled at s park place long needles were stuck through the subjects arm drawing no blood and then dunninger from a distance commanded duncan to fall into a cataleptic state which prevailed for about half an hour the subject finally was brought again to his senses by mr dunningers commands issuing out of the loud speaker hypnotizing by radio was therefore proclaimed a suc cess a full account of the experiment may be found in the september issue of science and inven tion well yes you are right may the time will seem long no doubt but as it carries double pay i ought not to grumble he smiled down at her adding that it will bring a certain day nearer is the best part of it meanwhile said may i shall picture you lead ing a sort of lighthouse existence and in offduty moments thinking about me as she spoke her eyes rested on the beam of eddystone which the gathering darkness already made plainly visible off the cornish coast discussing the dangers at station x you are right on duty and off my thoughts will run pretty much on you dear he said now alan tell me why you arent or should i say werent a bit cheerful this evening its a com pliment of course but is there anything thats worrying you she looked up at him inquiringly i suppose ive got the blues i find myself op pressed with the feeling that something is going to happen i cant tell what but i feel that the future holds something dark and horrible tell me alan dear do you know of anything in your coming duties that suggests danger to you will you be among savages has anything hap pened to any one at the post or is it only just a feeling it rests on nothing but then for goodness sake my dear boy dont worry yourself about nothing said may with relief here wheeling him around let us face the wind and it will blow such cobwebs out of your head she cast about in her mind how to hearten her lover and her eye caught sight of the statue of sir francis drake did you ever hear of drake alan she asked thinking it possible that he might not knowing his educational shortcomings for which she had decided that the future should yet make amends as they approached the statue she told him about drake and that immortal game her favorite hero had played on this spot of the threatening danger and how the great de vonian refused to let the breathless messenger worry or even hurry him the celt ever quick of apprehension and self application had no need for the point to be labored different men have different natures said macrae in a restrained voice it does not follow that any one kind has all the courage it is amazing stories me to say if i would also have clone my duty then but this i know i would not have been able to finish that game of bowls its all a question of nerves as to the other matter i knew you would not understand you are a town girl and i am from the lonely glen there are some things that are only to be felt the forest the stream the rocks and the mountain can teach something to a child that can not be learned later its a sort of sixth sense some of us have it i dont claim to myself yet i feel the approach of a cloud as a boy i loved to wander alone listen to the roaring torrent climb the steep precipices of the mountainside and often when up at cloud level i have watched a great fleecy mass approaching slowly while in the distance but seemingly faster and faster as it came near then suddenly it would swallow me up well dearest may there is a cloud approaching now that is destined to swallow me up no light and fleecy mass but dark and terrible full of lightnings and of danger and i do not see myself liberated from its embrace a great opportunity alan dear do not keep anything from me if you know anything dangerous connect ed with your new post tell it to me you say you value this opportunity because it brings a certain day nearer as you are going away ill con fess that it is for the same reason i too value it when your position is established we can be so happy together at present as you know i am any thing but that yet i would far rather you threw it all up if there is any special danger if there is i know nothing about it he replied with a smile unfortunately you discovered my mood and made me tell you of this impression which really rests on nothing but he added hastily lets talk of other things may sighed as she recognized it would be use less to say more on the subject she knew macraes highlystrung nervous temperament but also that in all circumstances he would be sure to do his duty she could not understand his forebodings but recognizing that the moment of parting was draw ing near she allowed the subject to drop alan macrae had been a poor halfstarved youth from the highlands who had by mere chance been engaged in an unskilled capacity at the marconi sta tion of wireless telephony that the government had established on the northeast coast of scotland he had shown such willingness industry and inter est in the working of the station that opportunity had been given him to acquire further knowledge of it the advantage he took of this was so satis factory that he had been given every encouragement and chance to perfect himself after some years he had become one of the most competent wireless electricians on marconis staff a chance discovery had then caused his transference to poldhu in corn wall when radio telephony was in its infancy it was no easy matter to catch the words and acute hear ing was absolutely necessary to the operator to a certain extent it still is for there is always a zone surrounding any station near the limit of audibility where acuteness of hearing makes all the difference between the possibility and impossibility of com munication it was found that macraes endow ment in this respect was little short of phenomenal and this it was that caused him to be sent to the cornish station used for transatlantic messages later it had been one of the reasons combined with his steadiness and competence that had caused him to be selected for this mysterious government ap pointment when the moment approached for going on board the cruiser that was to transport him to his un known destination may treheme principally for the sake of filling some of the unoccupied time that she feared would hang heavily on his hands asked him to keep a diary so that she might at some fu ture time have the pleasure of reading it this he promised to do and after a tender parting he strode rapidly off in the direction of where the cruisers boat was awaiting him starting for station x that night he reported himself to captain evered of hms sagitta where he made the acquaintance of lieutenant wilson who would be in command of station x to which macrae was going knowing how much they would be thrown to gether captain evered was anxious that these two should make a mutually favorable impression upon each other but his instinct told him from the first that such was far from being the case wilson in speaking to his brother officers that night made no secret of his dismay this is rough luck said he to be boxed up for six months with that miserable mechanic for his part macrae said nothing but felt in stinctively the complete lack of sympathy between him and his future superior it was only after mak ing lieutenant wilsons acquaintance that he real ized the isolation of the past to which he was go ing he felt no resentment against wilson for what he recognized was a mutual misfortuneâthat they could never be companions and he saw that one of the chief reasons was his own lack of education captain evered found an early opportunity of taking wilson to task and of giving him some sound advice pointing out the bearings of the thing from the governments point of view the responsibility of his post and the desirability of cultivating good relations with his companion who had had less ad vantages than himself etc etc he nevertheless came to the conclusion long before the voyage was over that they were as illassorted a pair as he had ever seen the voyage was uneventful in the indian ocean they picked up from another cruiser a hongkong chinaman a quiet methodical sort of creature who had been engaged to act as servant at the station the otherwise nameless islet known to the ad miralty as station x was made on the morning of september a short time sufficed for the landing of the new staff and stores and the taking on board of those relieved before the new trio had realized the strangeness of their position the sagitta that greyhound of the waters had disap peared below the horizon one of the first things however that lieutenant wilson did realize after taking command was that macrae whatever his social shortcomings was a most intelligent and thoroughly competent wireless engineer and op erator station x chapter ii macraes forebodings realized a month passed during which captain ever eds forebodings as to the lack of sympathy between wilson and macrae were thoroughly realized upon macrae who had been accustomed from his childhood to solitude the effect was not marked but with lieutenant wilson it was differ ent he grew irritable unreasonable and almost morose his victim was the chinaman ling upon whom he seemed to take a savage pleasure in vent ing his spleen when off duty macrae would wander off to the cliff and there for hour after hour would sit brooding or writing up the diary that may treherne with remarkable foresight had urged him to keep his earlier entries were devoted to a description of many incidents of the voyage and the hundred and one impressions made on a peculiarly receptive mind he found in the diary a new medium of expres sion a relief from the brooding of his boyhood at first he discovered great difficulty in expressing himself but gradually found himself writing with increasing ease and facility one day on looking back through the earlier pages he was surprised to find how awkwardly they read he realized that they did not well represent or reflect his life he knew that he could now do it better he decided to begin again and now that he was more accustomed to expressing himself in writing to give a descrip tion of his life at station x diary of life at station x th october you can scarcely realize the task you set meâ i mean its difficultyâwhen you asked me to keep a diary it is a great pleasure as noth ing calls up your sweet face so clearly as writing to you all that is in my mind it is the next best thing to speaking to you i have already told you that i am forbidden to tell of the place or of my duties they are very light although of the utmost import ance in these times as a soldier would put it we are a reserve rather than an active force liable to be called upon but for an important reason used as little as possible we interchange a daily word or two to see that we are in working order i am afraid you will find this diary uninteresting sometimes but you will know that i have some ex cuse even the weather is uneventful here how little we know at home how wearisome and monoton ous perpetual blue skies can be during the long hours off duty i sit here in this loftiest nook on the cliff overlooking the ocean writing to you dozing or looking out over the limit less expanse of waters the long slow swell seems to move like enchanted waves until my own thoughts too seemed lulled to harmony with their changeless rhythm it is just in such moments that the ominous impression of the approach of that shadow i spoke to you about seems to become more real i have learned here that the feeling of isolation when confined with an uncongenial companion is more oppressive than if i were entirely alone how different things would be if only lieutenant wilson were a different sort of man i often think i should get on much better with many a worse man than he he is most exact so far as performance of duty is concerned it seems to me even too exact there is no possibility of any one under him for one moment shirking duty and of course i have no wish to do so as a matter of fact there is so little of it that i would willingly take mine and half his if he would permit it he treats me with the most rigid politeness but i can always feel a something at the back of it i am aware of my social shortcomings and can make every excuse for him not having a companion more to his liking he feels the life as much as i do but does not appear able to unbend you would be surprised at how few words we ex change in the twentyfour hours often in relieving each other at the door of the signal room saluting without a word at all the chinaman at first it struck even the chinaman as curi ous for i have more than once seen him re garding us out of his almond eyes with the suspicion of a grin for a moment humanizing his impenetrable countenance i wonder if all chinamen are like this one and i wonder what this one is like he is a walking image of inscrutability and silence his very foot fall makes no sound i think if one wanted to pre tend to be very wise a perfect storehouse of wisdom that one did not really possess the great thing to do would be to say nothing this can be quite impres sive if it is done in the right way the chinaman does it in the right way while as lieutenant wil son does it it is not impressive but only irritating the chinamans duties are light and he does them very methodically he gives no sign as to whether he likes or dislikes them or if the slow hours some times hang heavy on his hands or not i think he must be a philosopher taking it all as the expendi ture of so much time for so much pay and carrying out his contract with a calm that seems to hold in it an element of contempt for all the world and all that is in it as i have already mentioned lieuten ant wilson can convey contempt but to me that of the chinese appears much the loftier of the two and yet it is of this placid individual that lieu tenant wilson manages to fall foul i am well convinced that it is not so much through any fault in ling as the necessity for some safety valve for the escape of the lieutenants temper i am forbidden him by the regulations he really is most unreasonable a few minutes delay in the performance of some slight duty or service when heaven knows an hour would make little enough difference is enough to provoke an outburst lieu tenant wilsons display of temper always show a harsh and overbearing i might almost say a bully ing disposition you will see therefore that apart from my slight duties there is little to occupy my time and i am reduced to being my own companion a mis erable substitute at best for pleasant company that is where my diary comes in and saves me from what would otherwise be many a tiresome hour i wonder sometimes whether this was not in your amazing stories mind when you set me the task i think it must have been seeing that although i write to you i cannot post what i write if so thank you for the promise you exacted what would i not give dearest may even for a few minutes of your company the ocean solitude at station x th october if i lived long in this place i should have to be come an astronomer i am not allowed to give you many details but you know that we are isolated and overlook the sea when by day i sit and watch the ocean around or by night the ocean above both of which have now become so familiar to me these seem my real companions less remote in spite of their immensity than the two fellow hu mans with whom my lot is cast i think it is the mystery of things that is the attractive power the seabirds alone are a perpetual marvel as long ago as i can remember anything i remember watching the eagle with wonder and delight but these seabirds seem to surpass even him in magic they come from the invisible distance sail to and fro to and fro up and down and away again be yond the horizon and it is even rare to see the beat of a pinion it is not flying but floating but the secret of it is their own or at all events it is be yond the range of my mechanics but what are such mysteries compared with those that are spread above if you have heard me grumble at the monotony of perpetual blue skies you will never hear me grumble at these nights it is then i feel the burden of my ignorance watching nightly the march of these star battalions and not knowing even the name of one i look forward to being your scholar in this as in other studies when if ever the opportunity comes no doubt this in creased desire for information about the starry hosts is partly because i never knew before that there were so many of them there must be ten stars here for every one in a scotch sky at the best of times but the principal reason is that there would be so much the more to think about for i have made another discovery that an ignorant man alone is more lonely than a man of knowledge can ever be yet i dare say the knowledge of the wisest is a small matter compared with the measure of his ignorance if i could not turn my thoughts to you dear may sometimes i think i should almost lose my reason the place or rather the circumstances of my life here are getting on my nerves and i start almost at a shadow or the slightest sound i must indeed pull myself together and think still more of you and the double pay that is leading to you and turn my back resolutely upon things based on nothing as you say cobwebs as you call them i would not have you different from what you are for all the world and the greatest stroke of luck of my life was finding you with your level little head and matteroffact good sense to guide me what have i to fear it is now the hour for relieving lieutenant wil son at the signal station one of us must always be within hearing of the call signal he has never had to wait for me yet goodbye dear may until to morrow more about the chinaman th october if these lines were destined to meet your eye at once i would not write them as they could only worry you something has happened no cob web this time my wretched foreboding has always been so vague that it has seemed part of my trouble that i could not tell in what direction to look for it it never occurred to me that lieutenant wilsons temper would pass from an inconvenience into a danger but what occurred today has shown me that in relying on the immovable calm of ling i have been building on the sand the two things may still be quite unconnected as todays affair only con cerns me indirectly but from now i shall live in extra dread of what may happen here ling was a few minutes behind time in the per formance of some slight duty and so had laid him self open to rebuke this had taken the usual form and had included the additional feature of the threat of a ropesending when possible i manage to be absent on these occasions but i happened just them to be watching the chinaman and was startled to see the veil of his everlasting calm for a moment lifted a look flashed from his entirely transforming his features just for one fleeting instant only was it there but long enough to reveal to me the exis tence of an unsuspected volcano beneath then the impenetrable mask again descended but that glance of fiendish and vindictive hate is enough to show me that my reading of his character was wrong and that there may be a tragedy here at any time never more will i complain of monotonous days may every day i remain here be as monotonous as hitherto and may the time at length safely arrive when together we shall laugh all my fears out of countenance never did i feel the need of you dear may more than now for if anything of the kind i dread should happen i fear it would put the finish ing touch on my jarred nerves an awful mystery and murder th october can it be but yesterday that i wrote the last line in this book so far as the hours are concerned it appears even less for i know nothing of the passage of the greater part of them but reckoning by events which were crowded into seconds that time seems ages ago the bolt has fallen never more may shall i sit and write you my thoughts in the shadow of that rock on the cliff overlooking the sunlit waves but i will now to the best of my ability write down the awful account of what has happened and the strange thing that has followed it i am thankful to have had my nerves sufficiency restored to do so they are restored in fact to an extent that seems wonderful even to myself a short time ago was too distracted to write anything my last letter to you was written as usual while sitting at my favorite spot on the cliff having closed the diary on the ominous words i had concluded my letter with i was sitting half asleep dreamily watching some seabirds of tremendous wing the name of which is unknown to me and lazily wondering as i always do at their easy de fiance of the laws of gravitation when i was sud denly roused more effectually than by clap of thun station x der they say i have phenomenal powers of hearing and no doubt it is extra acute but the latent fear that since the day before had lain at the back of my mind coupled with the nervous strain that had so long oppressed me would in any case have made me quick to catch any unusual sound from the sta tionânearly half a mile distant what i did hear was an angry shout as of sur prise rage and something else that seemed to freeze the blood a moments mingling of two voices in ex citement a pistolshot and that was all the very silence that succeeded seemed to lend horror to my mind i had sprung to my feet at the first sound but stood spellbound for the few moments the sounds continued and then at my utmost speed i ran for the stationhouse during the two or three minutes this may have taken i could not prevent the thought of a hun dred awful possibilities from jostling each other through ray mind i feared to find terrible injury to one or other perhaps both of my companionsâ perhaps ling even dead for i knew the fatal ac curacy of lieutenant wilson with a pistol the reality surpassed it all poor wilson lay on his side bent backward like a bow his attitude and expression were too frightful to recall the last convulsive twitchings of life were still faintly per ceptible in his back was the chinamans knife driven to the hilt the chinaman lay like one asleep but in this case it was the sleep that knows no waking with a face on which its habitual calm had already reasserted itself and a pistol bullet through his brain recovery from a trance my dear may i cannot give you the history of the time that immediately succeeded my discovery it has become a blank whether i actually lost consciousness at the shock or not i do not know but my memory holds no record of what must have been a considerable time i remem ber ultimately finding myself standing on the same spot and raising my eyes from the awful scene at my feet i noticed that the sun was already in the western sky i was shaking like an aspen leaf i struggled to collect my ideas into a coherent train of thought instinctively realizing that something must be doneâat once the thought of those murdered bodies lying so near me in the pale starlight through the silent watches of the night was intolerable i resolved to bury them while daylight lasted just as they were as deep as i couldâout of sightâout of sight i cannot dwell even now on all the details of this task i dragged them as far as possible from the stationhouse where their lifes blood had made terrible token of the spot where they fell just out side the door thank heaven outside i was determined that deep they should lie but the ground was rocky and my tools not intended for this use thankful to have digging tools at all i at length completed my task i confess that the hardness of the ground was not my only difficulty for more than once i leapt up from my work with the vivid impression of the contorted face of the chinaman as i had once seen it close to my shoul der nothing but the alternative of their ghastly company above ground drove me to the completion of what i had commenced i was none too soon for by the time i had finished the brief twilight was already on the island such however was my un reasoning frantic desire to obliterate all traces of the tragedy that ere black night descended the bloodstains also had been washed away entering the building my loneliness rushed down upon me and seemed to wrap me round i be lieve it was more this feeling than the duty of re porting the occurrence that took me straight to the instrument i longed to hear the voice of my fellow man at the signaltable there is provided for the purpose of wireless telephony a headpiece that fits over both ears without requiring to be held by the hands that they may be left free for taking down a message and that shuts out all sounds except those coming through the instrument a wireless fromwhere as i put on this headpiece i felt severely the physical and mental strain to which i had been subjected and suffered a curious feel ing that i do not know how to describe except that it seemed half utter fatigue and half excitement i passed the signal and then spoke the call word and nearly jumped out of the chair at the sound of my own voice this should not have been very dis tinct to me so effective are the earpieces or receiv ers as excluders of all sounds not coming by wire less yet i seemed to have shouted trying again and speaking softly it had the same effect having waited in vain for an answer from the neighboring neighboringâthree thou sand miles station i removed the headpiece and sat still for a moment then i found why my voice had seemed a shout my nerves or whatever the proper word may be were in a state of unnatural exaltation incredible as it may appear the mur mur of the wavelets all round the islet was clearly audible to me the gentlest of breezes seemed to hiss over the bungalow the creak of a board was like a pistolshot a breaking communication once more i assumed the headpiece and signalled again and again the clang of the callsignal at the receiving station is audible for some distance it is not necessary to have on the headpiece to receive it the fact of getting no reply proved there was no one in at tendance at the moment at either of the two sta tions we communicated with it is true the hour was an unusual one in fact one at which no call had ever been sent before and that could be he only reason why i was left without reply it was an illustration of how even the best can get slack under such circumstances i felt at the time that this went some way to vindicate lieutenant wil sons methods whose faults whatever they mighf have been certainly did not lie in the direction o slackness no one could have signalled us at any moment day or night during his command here without receiving an immediate answer keeping on the headpiece i waited calling up at intervals how long this went on i cannot say but after some shorter or longer time a thing happened that i cannot explain unless by supposing it the result amazing stories of the state of physical exhaustion to which i had reduced myself while i waited i fell asleep my head must have dropped forward on the signal table at which i sat and with the headpiece still attached sleep suddenly overcame me on waking i seemed to come suddenly to ray full senses and it immediately struck me with a shock of surprise that it was no longer night it did not take me a moment to realize the fearful neglect of duty of which i had been guilty recall ing as i did the fact that it could not have been much more than an hour after sunset when i fell asleep my first act was to look at the chronometer it marked four oclock this was absolutely be wildering for at four oclock it would not be al ready light hastily removing the headpiece i walked out of the stationhouse the sun was ap proaching the west there could only be one ex planationâi had slept over twenty hours remembering that as yet no account of the tragedy of yesterday had been despatched and the urgent need of bringing the facts to the knowledge of the admiralty so that relief might be sent i hastened back to the instrument here another sur prise awaited me to make you understand which a little explanation is necessary it is part of our instructions that when telephoning every word as spoken must be written down in shorthand and every word spoken at the other end must be taken down as received this gives the admiralty two records of everything that passes one at each sta tion which should exactly correspond on opening the record book imagine my surprise to find written down in my own shorthand the re port of a long conversation with the queensland station in which i had apparently given a full ac count of everything that had happened and received replies and instructions i tried to recollect some thing of this but in vain my memory was as it still is and no doubt always will be a complete blank respecting it the only explanation that seemed possible was that i had done this in my sleep or in some state resembling sleep brought on by the abnormal condition in which i had been the evening before a change in physical condition it now occurred to me for the first time what a great change there was in me as compared with the day previous incredible as this unremem bered signalling appeared and nothing but the evi dence of my own notes staring me in the face would have convinced me of it it seemed almost as strange that such a disturbed sleep as it evidently must have been could have restored me in the way it had my nervous condition had quite vanished for i found myself as collected as ever before in my life it might therefore be said i was more than re stored for i could scarcely recognize myself as the same individual that had spent the last few weeks and especially the last days in torturing worry and foreboding it seemed as though the very catastrophe i had apprehended had by its occurrence relieved my mind from the strain if any one had told me some months ago say when last we saw each other that under such circumstances as theseâof horror iso lation responsibilityâi should be able to take it so calmly i should have been the last to believe it it next occurred to me that i was fearfully hungry as well might be the case and the need suddenly appeared so pressing that it had to be at once attended to never had food tasted so good and yet before i had proceeded far a mouthful seemed to turn to ashes the record book cer tainly contained an account of messages in my hand writing but what evidence was there that it was other than an acted dream dropping my food hunger forgotten i went to the instrument and in less than a minute was talking with queensland my relief was great as i found my account fully confirmed they had received my report and now renewed the instruction to keep as constantly on duty as i am physically capable of since finishing my interrupted meal i have writr ten you this account while keeping within sound of the callsignal it is almost the hour at which i yesterday fell asleep at the instrument that will not happen again but i shall put on the headpiece it is not necessary but somehow i feel as though called to the instrument so goodbye dear may for the present chapter iii what the sagitta discovered it was the afternoon of the th of october the cruiser sagitta was taking a wireless telegragh staff men whose leave had expired from new zealand where their last duty had been to the relief of the station at weihaiwei about six bells a radio message was received in code from a station on the eastern extension cable take staff on board with all dispatch to relief of sta tion x all communication ceased report on ar rival when captain evered received this communica tion he was already well north of the bismarck archipelago as he read it his face could not have become graver had he seen an approaching typhoon on the horizon in a figurative sense that is what he did see promptly the nose of his thirty knotter was de flected to the northeast and she was sent racing at her best pace on the new route which lay through the countless islands of the caroline and marshall groups to where the bottom of the pacific falls into the ammen deep near which his goal was situated he knew that something unusual must have hap pened but the secrecy of the service precluded the possibility of his asking questions it was very possible he thought that whitehall knew no more than he all communication ceased was what lent color to the natural thought that had instantly oc curred to him two young and healthy men are not likely to be totally incapacitated from duty at the same momentâfrom natural causes thinking of the two young men concerned in the present case his thoughts took another turn and judging by his expression it did not seem a partic ularly pleasant one encountering the ships doctor on deck soon after the change of course he said what do you think of this message anderson have you any theory illness probably was the reply perhaps said captain evered in a tone of doubt or worse station x what do you mean sir was the startled re tort do you think that germanyââ my first thought was that the storm had burst said captain evered but if such an idea had been entertained at home the message would have been worded differently we live in such ticklish times that every precaution must be taken but i dont think that is the explanation no communication with station x then have you some other theory i dont like to call it a theory but i brought those two fellows out from eng land and i cant forget what an illpaired couple they were captain evered lit a cigarette in other words you think it possible there has been trouble queried the doctor you were not with us on the outward voyage and so have not met them wilson showed every sign of being a martinet and a surly one at that macrae the engineer and operator is more difficult to describe he is wellmeaning but with little edu cation very nervous and of weak will no vice but no ballast so we have the undisciplined temper of one the peculiar unstable character of the other and extremely trying conditionsâhow trying they can be is known only to those who have been boxed up together for months in that way i hope there has been no row between them very likely not but nothing would surprise me very much the one thing certain is that neither of them is on duty and the more i think of it the less i believe in outside interference such a thing would be an overt act of war of which there would be other signs by now station x was thoroughly fitted for radio tele graphy as well as with the incomparably larger plant for longdistance telephony as the distance between herself and the island diminished the sagitta made repeated efforts to call up the station but received no reply on the morning of the th the island was raised a tiny speck on the oceans rim when near enough for the glass to show every detail on cliff and shore the cruiser made the tour of it as a measure of precaution but no sign of life was visible either on land or water she then fired a rocket to attract attention and waited but in vain captain evereds face was the picture of aston ishment what had happened to the chinaman even assuming the worst in regard to macrae and wil son turning to his first lieutenant he said mr fletcher take the cutter and go and investi gate anderson will go with you let the men stay by the boat while you and anderson land if you see no sign of any one signal me to that effect and proceed to the stationhouse take your revolvers be careful to disturb nothing that has any bearing on what has happened and return as soon as you can landing from the sagitta the boats crew were piped away and were soon pulling for the shelving beach the two officers landed and proceeded to climb the cliff they stood for a moment the whole in terior of the island lying like a map before them they were watched with much curiosity from the sagitta in order to preserve the secret of station x every precaution had been taken to hide from the noncommissioned ranks the fact that there was any secret connected with it or anything different from the other various stations periodically visited as it is always the unusual that is most like to be talked about captain evered intended to take every means to hide any discovery of a remarkable na ture in connection with the present visit that there was something out of the usual routine could not be hidden but he hoped that the statement that there was a case of sickness on the island would be sufficient explanation whatever the full facts of the case might be this was why the doctor had been made one of the landingparty the agreed sign that nothing was visible was made and the two men disappeared over the cliff the station looks all right at all events said the doctor but no sign of anybody where the dickens can the fellows have got to they pressed on for the stationhouse and pushed open the door which was closed but not latched on the floor on its back lay the body of macrae with an overturned chair beside him the appear ance irresistibly suggested that the poor fellow had been sitting at the table in front of the instrument when from some unexplained cause he had fallen backward chair and all striking the floor with the back of his head there was no sign that he had made any subsequent effort dead said the doctor after a brief examina tion but where are the others catalepsy or death the various rooms of the bungalowbuilt sta tionhouse were thoroughly searched but there was nothing to throw any light on their absence can you tell the cause of the operators death anderson inquired lieutenant fletcher no replied the doctor there is no sign of violence its very strange possibly the papers will show something of what has happened suggested fletcher but i think wed better not interfere with them ill go back and report no doubt the chief will then come ashore rightoh said the doctor who had turned his attention again to the body in the signalroom lieutenant fletcher accordingly returned to the sagitta and made his report with the result that captain evered immediately decided to go ashore himself and make a personal examination of the island on arriving at the stationhouse he went straight to the signalroom where he found dr anderson kneeling by the body of macrae fletcher and i thought you had better see the place before anything was touched sir said an derson looking up hes dead questioned captain evered indicat ing macrae i thought so at first was the reply captain evered looked sharply at the speaker for both in the words and tone there was a significance answering the look anderson proceeded i have made a further examination and im not now amazing stories certain that my first report was at all correct while speaking he was placing the body in what for a living person would have been a more easy attitude it is true that i can find no sign of life what ever neither pulse nor temperature but on the other hand i can find no certain sign of death you see there is no rigor nor any sign of decay the cessation of signals implies that he may have lain in this state for four days and in this climate too but said captain evered is such a state of death in life possible it is difficult to say what is possible in this way said the doctor but if this is trance it is the most extraordinary case that has ever come to my knowl edge meanwhile what should be done he must be got on board as quickly as possible and receive treatment captain evered did not reply for a moment he was looking at the thing from the service point of view well he said at length what must be must be it is true we could not very well leave him here but its unfortunate but what of the others where are they weve seen no sign of them said anderson and in your absence fletcher would not refer to the signal records to see what light they might throw on things examining the signalbooks acting on the hint captain evered went to the signalbook and began to read the first thing he noticed for in the circumstances he began at the end was that the last signalling which took place was on october th that is the day be fore he had been ordered to change his course turning back the leaves he at once came upon mac raes report of the tragedy this showed him that the admiralty was already in possession of the facts so far it did not show him the first arrange ment made for macraes relief and which for the sake of greater despatch when macrae no longer re sponded had been altered by sending the sagitta captain evered now gave the terrible details to his companion and requested him to find the place where the bodies were buried while anderson was thus employed captain evered turned to macraes diary which under the circumstances he felt justified in examining this he scanned over from the beginning reading a little here and there and soon seeing that it was a most improper account to have written containing many indications that in certain hands would have af forded undesirable clues as he came to macraes description of the death of his companions and the effect on himself captain evered became con firmed in the view he had always held that macrae had never been a man suited to this kind of duty as he read the astonishing document he came to the inevitable conclusion that the poor fellows brain had been turned by the event that had hap pened and that the latter part of the diary was but the ravings of a lunatic in fact macrae seemed pathetically enough to have had a suspicion of the fact himself putting down the diary as the doctor returned to the signalroom captain evered said well have you found the spot yes sir ive found the grave was the reply then that so far verifies his report but it is necessary that our arrival and discovery should be reported for the information of the admiralty i believe you are a motorist anderson and no doubt you can recharge with petrol and start the en gine whilst dr anderson busied himself about this captain evered wrote out his report for despatch this concluded he turned to the doctor that a row of some sort should have happened here would not have surprised me but to find all dead is beyond my worst anticipations what do you now make of him i can only repeat what i have before said he must be brought on board said the doctor but i have little hope for him then was the reply when the report is sent and the relief staff landed you must take him on board on a covered stretcher with as little remark as possible say he is in a comatose condition and too ill to remain here with care his peculiar state need not be made apparent the absence of the other two will not be spoken of and there will not be much to call special attention to the affair among the crew the injured operatpr taken on board the naval cruiser leaving dr anderson in charge of the sta tion captain evered went down to the boat and returned on board he explained the sit uation to the officer about to take charge and sent him with his engineeroperator and servant to take immediate possession on the island instructing him to call up british columbia and advise that the sta tion was again in working order under the excuse of waiting until the repairs rendered necessary by the recent explosion at the station had been carried out the sagitta stood by until sunset in the fading light the injured op erator was placed on a litter and under the doctors supervision brought on board long before that the sagitta had received her orders from home to proceed to hongkong captain evered had brought macraes diary away with him and now went carefully through the lat ter part of it he was quite convinced of the truth of the version given respecting the fatal occurrence between wilson and the chinaman there were further entries under the dates of the two subse quent days the former had been first written in shorthand in the manner a message is taken down as received which in fact it pretended to have been and had afterwards been rewritten in long hand the entry under the second date the last entry in the diary was still in shorthand only it was the former that had been considered by cap tain evered when on the island to be proof of the writers insanity deciphering the shorthand diary at the first opportunity he spoke to dr ander son on the subject i should like you he said to run through this entry of his the poor fellow seems to have had the most extraordin station x ary delusion one could imagine what do you make of him now absolutely no change in my opinion if it is trance it must end in death with probably nothing to show the precise moment of the change do these writings of his throw any light on how he came in the position in which we found him so far as it is written out no but half of it is still in the original shorthand this i cant read myself and i rather hesitate about putting it in the hands of any one on board who can well as you propose to hand the papers to me ill see what i can make of it if its pitmans and fairly well written i think i may be able to make it out and if you wish ill write it out for you thanks if its anything like the record of the day previous i confess i should like to see it wild delusion though it be but take it and read it its very existence from beginning to end shows how unfit he was for the secret service of one of these stations where his madness began i leave you to decide at all events he seems mad enough towards the finish what do you suppose caused him to lose his rea son i dont feel the least doubt about that said captain evered he was a young fellow of con siderable ability but of the nervous imaginative sort unsuited in any case to the life incidental to such a post and when the event happened that left him there alone under circumstances that would have been trying to any one he simply went all to pieces however read the first part of this that is already written out and tell me what you think of it brain and nerve disorders had always been the branch of his profession that had special attraction for dr anderson and the vagaries of unhinged and abnormal minds had been a particular study of his it was therefore with scientific interest that he took macraes writings for perusal after read ing the part that has already been repeated here he came to the point where macrae in the signal room finished his daily entry or letter with the avowed intention of going to the instrument and putting on the receiver or headpiece to quote his own words as though called upon to do so chapter iv the mysterious voice wiat dr anderson began to read in his cabin ran as followsâ it is not very agreeable my dear may to write what i feel must inevitably make you to be lieve me tobe perfectly mad and will you be far wrong that is the question i am constantly asking myself at all events here are what appear to me to be the exact particulars of my experience after finishing my letter to you yesterday i went and put on the headpiece without knowing myself quite why i did so almost immediately after the receivers were covering my ears i heard a voice and it at once struck me as a very peculiar voice very pleasant and musical but quite different somehow from any i had ever heard it said ma crae are you there having answered i was surprised after a short interval to hear the voice repeat the same ques tion as though i had not been heard but then it occurred to me that i had replied in a very low tone instead of the rather loud and distinct manner of speaking we are instructed to use so i endeavored this time to reply louder but found that i seemed to have almost entirely lost my voice i could only answer in the same manner as before there was a minutes silence and then the same question re peated my inability to reply otherwise than as be fore was most disconcerting for i reflected while that state of things continued i was for the purpose of radio telephony absolutely useless as the only one at the station this would be serious using my best effort but without any extra result from it i answered yes i am attending who are you once more the same question came through the receiver while i sat still wondering what i should do about it the voice spoke again i had been heard and now dear may try to believe me however difficult think should i choose such a terrible time as this for romancing no either this great mar vel has really happened or else i amâbut no i must must keep away that terrible thought the strange message from an unknown source the voice said you attend now listen and do not be induced to leave the instrument or fail in the closest attention by the surprise of what you hear also understand that six minutes will elapse before any answer can reach you in reply to any question or remark of yours i am not speaking to you from any point on your planet but from your nearest neighboring world which you call venus but i interrupted you called me by name this went on the voice is an event in the history of your world the immense importance of which others of your fellowbeings will be much better able to realize than you of greater im portance to your world than ours in view of the fact that we are more advanced in intellect and knowledge than yourselves and have therefore less to learn from you than you from us having gleaned all we can from yourself i will pending ar rangements that must be made for your savants to converse with us give you some information re specting ourselves and the world from which i speak to you yes i called you by name you do not remember but we have been in conversation already for twenty hoursâas long as your nature could hold out this i will at once explain to you what you call radio telegraphy is the launching through space of etheric impulses which travel outward from the generating centre indefinitely in all directions the medium in which these impulses are propagated is universal unlike sound signals which propagated in the air must be bounded by the atmosphere these etheric signals have no defin ite bounds they are easily detectable here and much further consequently your radio conversations have been eagerly listened to on my world and have aroused an interest that you will scarcely under stand from a time thousands of years before your recorded history commences we have desired to converse with you during all these ages we have been able to see you but not to speak to you this amazing stories we have ardently wished not only that we might help you forward but that we might have the means of solving a thousand problems relating to your world and especially to your to us bewilderingly incomprehensible human nature as denoted by your acts so although the subjectmatter of most of your radio messages is of trivial interest in it self the light it has thrown on the mentality of your species lends to every word a profound inter est interplanetary telephony when at last you discovered telephony we recognized that communication should soon follow and we did all we could to at tract your attention but you persistently remained deaf to our words from this we found out that your powers of hearing were insufficient for the purpose of interplanetary communication which would therefore remain for ever impossible unless some means of establishing mental rapport with some one of you could be devised in the latter events through the exalted condition of the sens orial faculties that could be induced and especially as controlled by hypnotic influence we still hoped success might be obtained the difficulty however of bringing this about remained unconquerable and in the event chance alone has decided it this chance depended on the accident of one of your own particular nature or character being thrown by unwonted circumstances and your iso lated position into a mental condition one symp tom of which was an abnormal functional exalta tion of the sensorial ganglia on the night of what you call october in this condition of nervous exaltation and physical ex haustion you to outward appearance fell asleep at the instrument sleep is one of the natural phe nomena that with you seem to be still curiously uncomprehended for the present i will merely say that your subconsciousness was especially wide awake and could hear my call you answered and the rest was easy improving the adjustment of your already responsive condition by hypnotic sug gestion for twenty hours we remained in the clos est mental rapport this time was employed except for short intervals when i assisted you in the per formance of the work of your station in getting from you all the information on things human and terrestrial that you are capable of giving you have resolved a thousand questions that have been de bated here for millenniums we regret to find your strange lack of information on subjects evidently within the present acquirements of your race why are not allâbut of that another time it may please you to know that although at present an undis tinguished individual on earth you are at this moment the most celebrated on venus the voice said your nearest neighbour the voice ceased and can you wonder dear may that words in reply failed me for a time among a hundred thoughts crowding through my mind the one which persisted with most force was could this be real your nearest neigh bour the voice said i do not know what it means the horrible idea took shape this is delusion mad ness i cannot blame you that like any one else you will be driven to that conclusion it must be so much easier to think that trouble has driven another poor wretch out of his mind than to be lieve that some one has spoken to him from the stars after a timeâi do not know how longâi pulled myself together sufficiently to make an answer i tried to speak into the receiver but found that i could only speak in the same low tone as before how is it then i asked if i could only hear you at first in consequence of a special state i was then in that i can hear you now but try as i would i could not raise my voice finally i gave up the attempt and sat dejected at this impotence while i sat with my head bent the voice began to speakâto answer i was astounded that so low a tone should have been effectual because you are still in a special state as you call it the voice said that is under my hyp notic control as established by me at our first interview it is in obedience to my suggestion that you came to this interview and that you can now only speak in a low tone to me to others you are able to speak as loudly as you desire although your consciousness is now awake and you do not feel the control still it is perfect as your loss of voice proves this i ordered partly that i might have that proof which is necessary and partly that our conversation might be private as none of your fellowbeings can hear you and you alone can of course hear me how then are others going to talk with you at first through you then i hope directly in a way you will see when the time comes but no one will believe me every one will think me mad rather than suppose a human voice has reached me from such a distance there will be no difficulty at this or subsequent interviews there will be plenty of subjectmatter in your notes that it will be evident did not eman ate from you but do not say a human voice you must not suppose me to be in the least human it is venus that has been speaking to station x what are you then i said and dear may you have no idea what a horrible shiver ran down my spine as i asked i had be come already a little accustomed to the ringing musical voice and drawn by it had i think all unconsciously begun to picture a fellowbeing speaking to me from this other world not without sympathy but now all that feeling instantly van ished nothing remained but a sense of the hideous uncanniness of it all i am answered the voice one of the dominat ing race on venus just as you are one of the domin ating race on earth and do not be surprised or of fended when i inform you that were we on your earth and able to live there we should by virtue of our greater mental powers have no more difficulty in dominating you than you have in dominating your horses and cattle if this is true may thank god for the gulf of distance between us while speaking of distance do not forget that in these conversations there is always a wait of about six minutes for replies if as i suppose this is in consequence of the distance station x it gives me some idea of what it must be in sig nalling queensland or british columbia i have often noticed there is no interval at all detectable how is it then i asked that if you are not a human being you speak to me with a human voice a very reasonable question said the voice showing that you realize that the sounds of hu man speech could only be made by human or in some measure humanlike organs but the explana tion is very simple when first radio telephony was invented by you that is when first we heard your voice on our receivers we immediately learned your languages that you should have more than one shows how crude is still your socialâbut of that later our next care was to make a mechanism that could give out the sounds alluded to this i employ as you might play on an organ and it is sounds so produced that you hear the wonderful intelligence of the venus people as i listened to these last words of the voice i felt a lightening of the load of dread the suspicion of my own insanity that weighed on me surely mad or sane no such ideas could spring up spontaneously in my head some one somewhere was communicating with me until you used radio telephony we were ignor ant of the sounds you made in communicating with each other and it seems to be practically sounds alone that you employâa curious limitation but i said you could see us before that you knew that this world was inhabited we have known it for a hundred thousand years and more and during all that time have been close and interested observers of the happenings on your globe placed as you are peculiarly well for our observation while we were still not on the whole more advanced mentally than you are now we had already constructed an instrument which enabled us to do this the fact that you have not yet done so is because you are mentally constituted in a totally different manner which inclines you to devote your study and efforts in other directions that is to say primarily so the observation of nature and the universe in which we live would appear to you of infinitely less importance than matters which to us appear futile and trivial i am sorry that i have not had the time to study these things i said but i thought mars was the nearest world to us not venus and i have seen some talk about its being perhaps inhabited i should take an interest in science but i have had no time with my living to get mars is also inhabited no doubt said the voice but your savants will be under no misapprehension as to the relative distances of venus and mars you have seen more respecting mars because it is better placed for your observation i can inform you that it is inhabited of all the things we shall speak of this is the most vital to you but we will not enter on it until tomorrow as the time for our present conversation is now nearly ended this of course seemed very surprising to me and i cannot now see at all what it could mean it does not seem to me that any news about the inhabi tants of mars could be of much importance to us as information of practical benefit to ourselves on hearing that the present conversation was about to end i said will you or can you give me some proof that others will accept that this conversation has actually taken place and is not merely my own imagination what kind of proof do you suggest something that could not be known to me in any other way as for instance a description of the thing you said you could see us with so long ago when no cleverer than we are nobody could believe that i had invented such a thing as that must be very well as you may not be able to follow all the description which i must render short write with care the words you hear so that others may be able to understand it even where you may not be able to do so given perfect workmanship the power of a tele scope depends on the area of its objective lens this is not on account of any superiority of defini tion but on its greater lightgathering power the image it produces is capable of greater magnifica tion because better illuminated but beyond certain moderate dimensions the practical difficulties in the making of optically perfect objectives increases out of proportion to the extra area for this reason our savants turned their endeavors to the discovery of some way of making a number of objectives ar ranged in series yield one perfect image of the object double refraction and polarization there are certain crystals which probably you have personally never heard of which are doubly refracting when a single ray of light enters one of these crystals in a certain direction it divides into two which proceed in di verging paths and emerge as two rays if the ray or beam of light entering the crystal carries an im age of some object the sides of the crystal can easily be so cut that both the emerging beams carry per fectly the same image conversely if two rays enter the crystal in the paths by which the first mentioned left it they will unite and emerge as one ray the rest is obvious a battery of objectives and as many intervening crystals is arranged into each intervening crystal enter two beams in the requisite paths mentioned the one of which comes from the object direct through one of the objectives the other is the emerging beam from the crystal next before it in series and which is the united beams from an objective and the crystal still next before by this means the beam emerging from the crystal last in series is composed of the united beams of all the objectives and if the manufacture and optical arangement is perfect will carry a perfect image of the object with light in proportion to the united area of all the objectives the arrange ment of the minor lenses and the method of deal ing with the polarization will be so obvious to your opticians that it can be here omitted what i said is polarization there is no time now said the voice for fur ther description and the fact that you do not know renders my description the more valuable to you for the purpose for which you asked it your people will know all about it we must now cease amazing stories to communicate and you will be unable to hear un til tomorrow at the same hour as today when you will come again to the instrument getting to the end of the dialogue so there our conversation ceased and i said no more in fact i had a curious feeling as though forbidden to do so i hope i shall soon be relieved of this dreadful post headquar ters tell me relief is coming as quickly as possible i have nothing to say against the friendly sort of voice i have listened to or the communication it has made i owe it something for having at our first interview in my sleep evidently quieted my nerves when i was probably on the high road to madness very possibly that saved my reason all the same i cannot forget that i am hundreds of miles from a living soul and it makes my flesh creep to listen to the voice of one who tells me openly he is not a human being at all what i wonder can he be like i dare not think of it i have not reported officially any of the above conversation what would be the use at least i am now sure of the existence of some one who has talked to me i can feel his personal influence too strongly to doubt it apart from any other evi dence but that does not prove his words are true or that he speaks from venus perhaps some lying and wandering spiritâbut i will not think about it what would i not give to be off this awful rock that seems lost in the remotest wilderness of the ocean i used to like to look around from the cliff edge and see the faroff circle of the horizon without a spot in any direction to break its line but now i dread it i have resolved not to attend at the instrument at the time the voice has appoint ed let the next conversation be when there are others here end of the diary with a few love sentences principally ex pressing the desire for an early reunion the diary ended for the day under date of the next day and precisely at the hour appointed by the voice evidently in spite of macraes resolve to the contrary a further conversation had taken place and been recorded this was only in shorthand and while the doctor was puzzling over the first words of it the door opened and captain evered entered well anderson what do you think of the poor fellows ravings curious delusion wasnt it more than curious but between ourselves they dont read to me like ravings at all there is a curious problem here that at the moment i must admit puzzles me if macrae were a man of scien tific attainments it would be still very curious as an instance of selfdelusion but the number of such cases is very great and this could simply pass as a noteworthy specimen among them but if he was only the uneducated man you have given me to understand then this document is the most aston ishing thing ive ever heard of yet i suppose we can accept his own version of it well you know more about this kind of thing than i but to me it simply reads like the ravings of a lunatic but these are not ravings what he has writ ten as the words of the voice indicate considerable scientific knowledge and if macrae did not himself possess it the theory of his madness would not ac count for it let us dissect it a little either he had considerable scientific knowledge when he landed my dear anderson i watched him closely during a long voyage while endeavoring to establish better relations between him and poor wilson i had sev eral conversations with him and drew him out and you may absolutely rely on it that he was just an ignorant unread mountain lad but very imagina tive he had applied himself diligently to the prac tical part of radio telegraphyâand subsequently telephony he knew next to nothing of the scien tific theory of it but was very competent in the engineering and general working as for general scientific knowledge he simply had none perhaps pursued the doctor he took books with him and studied on the island nothing of the kind was landed or he was instructed by wilson during their spare time suggested the doctor absolutely out of the question wilson would as soon have thought of instructing a mountain goat discussing the conclusion of the diary then he has been in wireless communica tion with some one somewhere who has thought it worth his while to hold this con versation with him that is the only explanation of this said dr anderson tapping the manuscript before him there are said captain evered only two sta tions on earth that have the necessary apparatus for communication by telephone with station x no one at either unless as mad as macrae himself would venture so far as to contravene the regula tions for such a purpose using the morse code the signals of any vessel within a wide range are re ceived but it is forbidden to answer therefore if we are driven to believe he received the messages from somewhere we must it seems accept the ver sion of jupiter or wherever it is he claims it for anderson did not join in the captains laugh well then said captain evered as you will not i see accept my simple explanation tell me what it is in his account that causes the difficulty certainly did you notice this account of a kind of compound telescope i saw there was some description of something in that way was the reply is there anything in it i do not say it is workable in fact in my opinion it is not but it is quite understandable and the theory is all right the difficulties although probably fatal are merely mechanical so far as i am aware the idea is quite new in the hands of superior beings such as this venerian claims they are mechanical difficulties would disappear so that in the first place the story hangs together all right and secondly macrae could not have in vented it further while reading it i checked off the position of venus at the date of the writing and calculated roughly the distance i find that at the speed of these hertzian waves it would be al station x most exactly a threeminute journey so that ma craes six minutes for replies is quite correct again there are the remarks of the supposed venerian as to the backward state socially of us terrestrials ill not adopting a universal language and on other social questions can you imagine them as emanat ing from macrae speaking of languages does this writing strike you where the venerian is sup posed to be speaking as being in macraes style by jove anderson you are right now this really is interesting perhaps this shorthand that follows will throw light on it as well as on his present condition by the by i hope it wont last much longer it becomes increasingly difficult to keep it from the crew i am glad to see you are at last interested but there is a task before me here it is so long since i used pitman that i have almost forgotten the signs it proved quite as difficult as the doctor expected and it was far into the night before he had finished but he was too absorbed in the contents to leave it before it was done chapter v captain evered gets the transcription the next morning dr anderson handed to captain evered his transcription of macraes shorthand what do you make of it was the question as they walked towards the captains cabin id rather not say until youve read it sir was the response lest you think me mad as you think macrae now im going to turn in ive not long finished it in order to keep macraes condition from the crew and for the doctors better private observa tion of him anderson had given up his cabin and was for the time accommodated in a screenedoff corner of the barbette transcription of the mysterious communication captain evered shut himself in his cabin and unfolded the manuscript which ran are you there macrae yes i am here although on thinking it over after our talk yesterday i decided not to be why i decided i would prefer to leave it until there were others here with me since you told me i was not listening to a human voice i seem somehow to shrink from it it is uncanny also some time after i left the instrument the doubt came back that it might be all a delusion so you decided not to come to the instrument for this appointment but as the time approached you altered your mind or rather your mind altered and you felt inclined to attend is that so well yes that is exactly how it was quite so that is as it should be while you are talking with me do you entertain any doubt of my existence not at the time i can distinctly feel that you are somewhere that there is some one besides myself exactly across the abyss you feel my personal influence i think macrae you must be exception ally adapted even among your impressionable spe cies for the role you are filling be quite convinced of my objective reality from this time onward dis miss any idea to the contrary from your mind let no such doubt occur to you again with respect to the other point you raise although you do not know anything of bodily forms here do not let that trouble you the curiosity that will doubtless exist among your fellowbeings respecting us shall be fully satisfied later for the present try to realize that the body is but the raiment it is the being who is clothed with it that alone signifies in view of what i am about to say to you it is essential that you should keep that fixed in your mind as it will help you to understand for the rest look upon us here as the friends of your kind how urgently you are in need of our assistance you are about to learn for it has been decided here that in view of this wonderful opportunity which accident might interfere with not another day should be lost in acquainting you with the particu lars as the message is not for you alone be very careful in your written report of it now listen attentively a warning from a friendly planet a terrible danger threatens from which nothing but the fortunate accident of your getting in communication first with me may save you if saved you are to be that you should the better understand what you are about to hear it is necessary to begin by recounting to you some long past events relating to life in other worlds than yours or mine the mystery of the origin of life like that of matter is an ocean depth where no plummet of the finite mind can find a bottom it is sufficient illus tration of the crudity of your ideas on the subject that there should be any doubt among you as to the other planetary members of our system being in habited you now have proof that one other is so and must take my word for it that there is good reason why no planet under such temperature and other conditions as render life possible can remain barren of organic development but there have been times in the past when such conditions have not obtained when the various members of our system have been too heated for life to be possible in consequence of the more rapid cooling of the smaller planets the first to be the scene of life was your satellite the moon this was millions of years ago and the climatic conditions on it then were very different from now it then had abundant atmosphere and humidity and afforded a site for life development long ages before your world or ours was so suited the inevitable result under these conditions fol lowed it became covered with a myriad forms of living creatures out of which finally emerged one by virtue of its mental superiority combined with sufficient bodily fitness to dominate all in obedi ence to the laws of development this race advanced to higher and higher powers attaining a position similar to that held by you in your world and by us in ours now you must conceive the lapse of a vast period of time before the great tragedy of which i am about to speak took place amazing stories about lunarians and their history in the course of unnumbered thousands of years the lunarians as we will call them had developed in powers both mental and physical far beyond either yours or ours at the present day at that time the earth and venus were still without other than the lower forms of life in consequence of their more recent habitabil ity the only other place where life had now ad vanced to the higher plane was the much smaller planet mars at the time when the dominating race on mars had arrived approximately at your present mental status the lunarians were vastly advanced the moon was palpably growing old and un fitted for the easy maintenance of its inhabitants as it had been the first to be habitable so it would be the first to be uninhabitable as to the causes of this i cannot enter now but will explain them on a future occasion the near neighborhood of your earth had much to do with it the lunarians saw ahead of them the time when daily revolution would altogether cease and induce conditions apart from the shrinkage of atmosphere and moisture impos sible for them any longer to combat generation after generation the contest with nature under less and less easy terms became more strenuous in judging the lunarians it is but just to recall all the facts the science and intellect of these beings en abled them to make a minute investigation into the local conditions prevailing on the other members of the solar system or at all events of the four in ner members of it they began to discuss the ques tionâwere there any among these that would af ford a better home if attainable there was oneâ mars but this was already inhabited by beings of high intelligence and with whom the lunarians had succeeded in establishing communication could mars be reached there was a way so horrible in its selfishness so fiendish in its unspeakable wick edness that the mind shrinks from thought con tact with it even after the lapse of a million years but it is now my painful duty to tell you the ter rible narrative the lunarians knew the double impracticability of transferring their bodies to mars impossible to launch themselves those millions of miles across the zodiac and live impossible to continue existence in the new world even if they could safely arrive there bacteria of the different planets the conditions of health quite as much as the conditions of disease depend on the microscopic forms of life which teem both in our bodies and in our surroundings the greater number of the latter are only innocuous because by being ab initio accustomed to their action we have acquired immunity but these bacterial and other low forms of life are quite different on mars from those which are common to the earth and her satellite the result would be that no animal form of life from the one could continue to exist on the other it would be the defenceless victim to un numbered new diseases any one of which would be fatal yet there was a way have you thought of the fact that so far as your will is concerned you are now completely under my influence that it was an easy thing for me to hold intercourse with you for twenty hours without your knowledge that without even knowing why with out consciousness of the outside influence you came to this present interview at the appointed moment and in spite of your having resolved to the con trary what you do not realize is that you had no option in the matter that lay entirely with me but such powers as mine while no doubt greater in degree although not perhaps very different in kind from what is known on your earth are as nothing compared to the powers possessed by the lunarians both now and at the time i speak of when neither your world nor mine had a reasoning being on it it was an easy thing for a lunarian to estab lish with a fellowbeing by mutual consent a mental rapport and not only thus to exchange ideas without outward physical means but even to exchange per sonalities which practically amounts to exchanging bodies but it need not be with a fellow lunarian it could be with any being of sufficiently high men tal status to be brought on the same plane of mental rapport and mere physical distance had nothing to do with it in the case of weaker beings no mutual consent was necessary once that intercourse en abled them by hypnotic influence to establish this rapport they could compel the weaker will the aw ful idea was conceived and in due course remorse lessly carried out of effecting bodily exchange with the unfortunate martians of those days an appalling interplanetary crime into all the details of this appalling crime extending over weeks it is not necessary to enter the science of the lunarians ampli fied as to martian local conditions by intercourse with their intended victims enabled them to ac quire in advance all the needed particulars and data for successfully mastering and dealing with the new conditions so that in taking possession of their to them new bodies they were at no loss as to procedure on the contrary each martian awoke from his hypnotic sleep to find himself not himself so far as his bodily form was concerned but some strange and to him loathsome creature in a world of which he knew nothing reason could not stand so great a shock in raving dementia he died so six hundred million beings of high intellect and cul ture perished this is the greatest tragedy that our sun has ever looked on the invaders now inhabited a new world full of life and beauty with a fauna and flora of infinite variety splendor and novelty and general condi tions of life making their existence as a race pleas ant and easy but everything in the universe is a means to an end and crime is no exception and its end is not happiness the essence of crime is sel fishness the crime of the lunarians whom we will henceforth speak of as martians was a race crime it was not lacking in heroic qualities so far as the individuals who carried it out were con cerned to them personally the advantages were questionable the sacrifice inevitable it must be remembered that each of them no less than his victim now inhabited a body at least as unattractive to him as his to the poor unfortunate who had been forced into it more so the older and vastly superior of the two races could not but feel station x degraded by the more primitive and undeveloped bodily form and one far less suited by the modell ing effect of ages of adaptation to be the tools of his will in this connection the matter of language alone need be mentioned it having to be translated into entirely new sounds of articulation time only could alleviate these conditions and the passing of the generation alone entirely remove them the excuse the martians made for themselves was that the conditions of lunar life were becom ing such as to threaten by deteriorating their bodily welfare to impair their mental powers to lower and ultimately extinguish the splendid intellect of which they were so justly proud if they pleaded one of the two races must perish why should not the higher survive note that their argument in speaking of races disdains the mere physical part and deals alone with that which dwells in it for of course in their transfer so far as the physical form was concerned it was the higher which per ished the martians could not exist on the earth or in venus and now the sequel too late it came to their knowledge in the light of the future ages that their previous abode had not been so nearly uninhabitable as they had feared that it had been calculated to last as their abode as a race possible of habitation until its greater com panion sphere was fit for their reception that the increasing difficulties of lunar existence were ex actly calculated not to destroy but to stimulate and enhance their powers of both mind and body until their physical transfer to earth was pos sible that their growing science would have been in good time sufficient to carry this out in a per fectly legitimate way by launching their bodies across the comparatively trivial distance to their terrestrial goal where they would have been com petent to live and advance for the bacterial forms of life on the earth and its satellite are the same at this moment so great has been their scientific advance that the problem of making the journey and arriving safely on earth not merely from the moon but from mars is within their ability to solve but as already mentioned it would from the latter be fatal as martian organisms could not ex ist on earth or we are thankful to say on venus either from this natural and happy denouement they have therefore forever cut themselves off to their eternal regret they see the error of the evil deed of their ancestors but do not see any way to avoid its consequence by any deed less evil but they are as anxious to leave mars as their an cestors were to gain it one reason is that from the moment of their arrival on mars a result that they wholly failed to foresee they have intellectually ceased to advance scientifically only have they advanced a very different thing the other reason is that mars is now growing old the fall of the lunarians before the evil thought occurred to the lunarians they were in all respects an ad vancing and a noble people natural heirs to a heritage the full extent of which is even now not apparent wherever their gaze might fall on the worlds around them they could see that there was nothing equal to themselves their industry ever kept pace with their intellect their stupend ous energy was always equal to the heightening struggle with nature the mastery they gained over their globe and its conditions surpassed praise as water and even atmosphere began to fail them the enormous circular reservoirs they made for its conservation and which must be so plainly visible from your earth stand to this day in their roof less ruin everlasting monuments to their abilities it is now maddening to the martian still im measurably our superior to see us ever advancing however slowly however painfully ever advancing on the road where he stands motionless destined as it seems to be overtaken and passed in the race from the days of his forefathers iniquity his former nobility seems dead his intellect vast as it is beyond our power to measure seems no longer harmonized to high ideals but to evil which is probably the reason why it is stagnant and now we come to your danger and with your mind prepared by the history to which you have listened it can be stated in a single sentence as he treated the former martians so he abrupt end of the manuscript here the shorthand manuscript ceased abruptly it was evidently at this point that the occurrence happened whatever it might have been that caused macrae not only to cease his notes but to fall to the floor in the re markable condition in which he still lay for some minutes captain evered sat gazing straight in front of him then he rang for his ord erly and instructed him to ask dr anderson to come to his cabin at once as he entered anderson looked quickly at his superior sit down was all captain evered said after fully a minutes pause he continued mad as a march hare what i question it remarked anderson dryly not yet recovered from the unceremonious interruption of his longdeferred sleep but the fellow didnt know what he was writ ing about persisted captain evered well somebody did said anderson quietly i dont think you can read this over carefully and seriously believe that it bears any resemblance to the incoherences of madness or could be composed by any one who did not know what he was doing great scot you are not telling me that you be lieve this story that is hardly the question sir i think we may leave the truth or otherwise of the narrative on one side for the moment the question is where did it come from well it came from macrae of course we cant go beyond that i never saw macrae to speak to said anderson you have you have described him to me his char acter and his education or rather lack of it i ac cept your account of him as correct but that story pointing to the papers in evereds hand touches on points of astronomy evolution physiology and other sciences and always after the manner of one well acquainted with them or at least in a way cer tainly impossible to one so entirely ignorant of them as you know macrae to have been amazing stories dr anderson leaned back with the air of a man who challenges confutation quite so said captain evered i see your point ill go through this again and we will have a further talk about it what is your theory so far i have none sir replied anderson none whatever im completely at fault a theory searched for to solve the mystery in the course of the day captain evered read macraes story again looking out for the dif ferent points indicated by the doctor and he realized the force of his observations anderson is right he muttered macrae no more wrote this out of his own head than i did couldnt have done it who the devil did it captain evered had arrived at the same point previously reached by dr anderson the doctor was meanwhile curious as to the re sult of evereds further study of the document to wards evening he was sent for queer thing this radio telegraphy and telephony anderson said captain evered as the doctor en tered his cabin do you believe in the planets be ing inhabited professor rudge is firmly convinced that one at least is he considers schiaparellis discoveries to have absolutely proved it so far as mars is con cerned he wants in fact to try and signal to them in some way other scientists are convinced that if that planet is not inhabited it shows many signs that it is not uninhabitable so rudge wants to get into communication with them does he a possibly dangerous proceeding according to this said captain evered tapping the manuscript their eyes met for a moment the doctor re mained silent look here anderson i believe were both agreed that this yarn of macraes is quite the tallest weve ever heard and also that there is some mystery about it that wants clearing up the infernal thing has been running through my head all day and i am no forwarder are you your case sir is mine exactly im stuck anderson confessed then what ought i to do if you really wish to know what i should do were i in your place sir i should ask the admiralty to trust some eminent scientist such as professor rudge whom we just mentioned with the secret of the station and place macraes writings in his handsâand so wash yours of all responsibility capital thats what ill do there is a further point in its favor professor rudge as the inventor of the method of this new system of telephony without which these long distance installations would have been impossible was called into consultation when they were contemplated and their sites chosen he already knows of the existence of station x then there can be no difficulty i only wish in addition to placing the papers in his hands we could place there macrae also poor fellow you still see no chance of his recovery if he is not actually dead it cannot be quite hopeless can it im quite convinced he will rnot recover but insensibly merge from his trance into death said anderson with conviction here their conversation was interrupted by some one knocking at the door come in said captain evered and a sailor put in his head if you please sir mr macrae has got out of his bunk and is walking about the ship in his blanket asking for you sir he seems a bit dazed like ye gods muttered anderson as he and captain evered left the cabin chapter vi professor rudge investigates never was a medical man more pleased at a wrong diagnosis than dr anderson in regard to the mysterious case of alan macrae to the natural satisfaction of seeing the return to life of a patient of whom he had despaired was added the anticipation of probing further the interesting problem that now engrossed their thoughts there was now a chance that he would be able to investigate for himself not only into the mental state of macrae but also into his character and attainments and so definitely satisfy himself as to whether this alleged communication had taken place he had already convinced himself that a belief in its possibility was far from scientifically absurd and he knew that in this he was backed by some of the most eminent scientists of the day on taking charge of his patient he at once saw that the poor fellow was not so much dazed as excited and it was some time before he could be soothedânot iri fact until it had been explained to him how he came to be on board the sagitta dr anderson answered his questions while getting him as quickly as possible back to his cabin macrae then gradually calmed down took nourishment and slept thereby relieving dr anderson from the fears he was beginning to entertain a quick recovery of the operator from his catalyptic state after this he made a quick recovery showing that there was nothing organically wrong and that the elasticity of youth had not been permanently impaired two days elapsed before dr anderson would allow his patient to be questioned as to what had happened to him in the signalroom of station x macrae on his part showed no disposition to discuss the subject it was partly on account of this tacit avoidance of it on the invalids part that dr anderson deprecated the subject being forced on him too soon the blow he said whatever it was was struck on the nervous system and if there is any danger for him it is there we must look for it toward the close of the second day macrae seemed so fully hiinself again apart from some physical weakness that the doctor decided that there would be no harm in a little judicious questioning he had already convinced himself that there was no trace of insanity in his patient he therefore determined to ascertain if macrae were really averse to entering on the topic and if not to prepare him for a visit from captain evered station x surely sir said macrae on seeing the doctor enter i am well enough to get up now in fact there is nothing the matter with me except weakness through lying here so long and not having had anything to eat for a week before that my lad you might include that eh however i intend to let you loose tomorrow you must not think a couple of days rest and judicious stoking too much after your experience talking about your experience there is no wish to press you to go into that subject before you feel well enough but the captain wants to have a talk with you i have been expecting this si i must of course explain although the thing i shall have to tell has nothing to do with my official duties what thing asked the doctor talking it over with the operator my experience on the island sir its so strange that no one will believe it lean scarcely believe it myself it is not very pleasant to know that i shall be looked upon as either mad or a liar dont be so sure of that and you mustnt regard your talks with the captain or me as official examinations that will no doubt come later in london you shall tell us just as much or as little as you wish and on no account go into anything that will unduly excite you when speaking of it sir i would prefer to tell the whole thing but i dont quite know how to begin the captain of course knows how i came to be alone on the island yesâah here he is he broke off as captain evered entered well macrae he said smiling pleasantly feel better i am all right now i think sir but this dreadful affair with lieutenant wilson and the mysteries on top of it have been a bit too much for me you were surprised to find yourself on board the sagitta i expect suggested captain evered yes sir i did not expect that do you remember all that took place at the station of course i have seen the official record and have also looked through your private account of your experiences i am afraid it will have to be impounded as it contains several things that might give away the position of the station if it fell into improper hands im very sorry sir said macrae coloring if ive done anything wrong not intentionally i am sure said captain evered kindly but perhaps you have not quite realized the extreme caution requisite tomorrow probably we shall be landing you at hongkong remember the solemn engagement you made when signing on not to communicate anything to an unauthorized person in any way referring to station x we will speak of that again in the morning just now dr anderson and i wish to hear your last recollections on the island can you tell us how you came to be as we found you i am glad to hear that you have read my diary sir for although it was not intended for any one but the girl i am engaged to it saves a lot of explanation now i can quite well see that any one reading what i have written must naturally put me down for either a liar or a lunatic but i can solemnly assure you sir that what i have written is the truth you remember all you have written asked captain evered you remember having conversations with some one who informed you he was speaking to you from another planetâin fact from venus i remember all quite clearly said macrae earnestly and i have written down the exact words that passed the last conversation is still in shorthand only if you wish sir i will now write it out i was about to tell you when captain evered came in said anderson that i have transcribed your shorthand so that brings us down to the point where it ends so abruptly the interruption of the communication macrae hesitated for a moment as if loth to enter upon so distasteful a topic yes he said at length it does leave off suddenly that was when the interruption came the interruption said the doctor what interruption well sir it all began and ed in a few seconds i scarcely know how to describe it the voice was speaking to me and seemed to be about to warn me of something when suddenly there was another voice a greater voice oh a voiceâmacrae sat up and his hearers were surprised to see the look of awe that came into his faceâi cannot describe it it seemed to have great authority what did it say said the doctor after a pause during which macrae was evidently taxing his memory he said i cannot recall it i seem to have a sort of remembrance of something that is the only way i can say it but it is misty all covered up i cant remember the words only the voice seeing the examination had proceeded as far as was good for his patient dr anderson half rose with a view to close the conversation but captain evered motioned him to sit down again he then said to macrae you said a great voice do you mean a louder voice one that you could hear more distinctly and which drowned the other i dont know that it was a louder voice said macrae but there was something in the tone the force of it that would make one attend i cant describe it any more it had a great influence on you then inquired captain evered yes a great influence replied macrae with an involuntary shudder how long did it last a violent blowâoblivion at once there was an interruption from the first voice and sounds like a dispute but not in words it all began and ended so quickly that its a sort of jumble in my recollection the only thing that remains clear is that two voices came through the instrument and spoke to me at the same time although i cant remember the words i know both seemed to exert an influence on amazing stories me the one seemed fighting the other but the second voice was gaining then there was suddenly something like darkness and a sharp command from the first voice i seemed to be struck a violent blow on the back of my head the next thing i knew was finding myself on board this ship that is absolutely all you know about it questioned captain evered that is all sir try and forget it for tonight said the doctor get to sleep as fast as you can and tomorrow get up and have a turn on deck they wished him goodnight and left the cabin for hours the two men talked in the privacy of captain evereds cabin but they ended as they began each knew that he was half carried away by the story macrae had told both from the internal evidence of the report itself and his evident sincerity at the same time each saw its extraordinary nature too clearly to admit yielding an entire belief in it even to himself much less to any one else he seems perfectly sane to you questioned captain evered quite so as rational as you or i was the response well i shall follow your advice respecting professor rudge said captain evered there should be no difficulty in his seeing macrae we shall land him tomorrow and from hongkong he will be invalided home accompanied by my report and of course these writings of his i shall report him as not in my opinion suited to this kind of service you will be able to endorse that i can said anderson macrae is one of the subjective sort did you notice how full his diary is of himself exactly by the by what did you make of two voices and a blow on the head well i suppose two voices are not more mysterious than one said anderson if you can believe in one why not two according to him there would appear to be disagreement sometimes even among our friends the venerians theres a party i suppose who want to have nothing to do with us probably smiled captain evered adding i intend in addition to suggesting that this account of his be submitted to professor rudge to drop a private line or two to the professor himself letting him know there is something in the wind a government department my dear anderson being in this case the admiralty i hope i am not speaking blasphemy will go about as far as it is kicked but i think rudge will not let them shelve it the operator returns to his sweetheart so it came about that macrae found himself on the homeward journey much before he had anticipated when leaving england it did not exhilarate him as he was oppressed with a feeling of failure without being able to see how he could have done differently he was afraid that what would be looked upon as a preposterous story would militate against him and the government might not find him even home employment this feeling of depression lasted until entering the bay of biscay when grey skies reminded him of his native hills the wind of the atlantic with a tooth in it blew on him aad his spirits rose a telegram advised may treherne of her lovers unexpected return and she was at portsmouth to meet him hers was one of the first faces he saw and her welcome completed the cure that northern skies had begun macraes keen eyes did not fail to see in hers the involuntary question that tact was keeping from her lips and he wondered how he was going to answer it seeing that he was bound to secrecy it was no secret that he had been at a wireless station and there could not be any breach of trust in saying the position was somewhat isolated there were plenty which that description would suit so he told her how during a short absence of his from the stationhouse his fellow workers had been murdered and he had returned to find their dead bodies and himself the only survivor how he had fallen unconscious how in consequence of the shock to his system he had been relieved and placed on sick leave and ultimately sent back for service at a home station he added that there were some other details which in view of the strictness of official secrecy he could not divulge she was horrified at the tale and clung to him in her gratitude that he had escaped suppose dear alan you had been at the station when those wretches murdered your companions you would have been murdered too oh i am glad you are back in england when i got your telegram i was awfully surprised he saw his explanation had relieved her mind of something it also seemed to have loosened her tongue for now he had very little to do but be a patient listener and hear a full account of her somewhat uneventful history during his absence and discuss plans for the future as modified by this new development the government investigations in london that evening may treherne returned to plymouth and macrae proceeded to report himself in london the next morning he presented himself at the admiralty and was given an hour at which to attend the next day when the report respecting him would have been read he then found himself put through a very searching examination for there had been considerable nervousness that some scheme of a possible enemy was at the bottom of the business it came as a surprise to the officials to find that after the most exhaustive questioning nothing could be gleaned to lend color to this suspicion it was obviously a relief to his examiners to find that everything went to indicate that the deaths took place as officially reported first by macrae himself and afterwards by the captain of the sagitta for the rest it had of course been a curious case of delusion while under the influence of nervous shock his diary was confiscated he was reprimanded for having written it and especially for including expressions that would serve as indications of things that were government secrets he would for the future be retained at home stations so long as no further indiscretion was committed and was further directed to present himself for duty at the end of a month granted as leave of absence the next day found macrae at plymouth and staion x now appeared the wisdom of captain evered in writing to professor rudge for had he not done so nothing further would have been heard of macraes experiences on the island of station x the letter he received had not contained much information but enough to make him want to know more he had an interview with the first lord and as a result macraes account of his experiences was placed in his hands with the request that all requisite caution should be employed professor rudge read macraes account with unbounded astonishment when he had read the pages a second time his mind was made up he was a man of quick decision and equally quick action the next morning macrae received a letter from professor rudge enclosing a remittance for expenses and asking him as a favor to come back to town and call on him at his earliest convenience with a view to the further investigation of your recent remarkable experience this phrase showed macrae that his correspondent must be in touch with the authorities and he felt bound to comply at once although not without a grumble both on his part and that of his fiancee examination of the operator again macrae found himself put through an examination this time it was more searching more detailed more minute than any he had had before absolutely no point escaped the savant he was at least as competent as dr anderson to investigate the examinee as to his mental health far more competent to probe his character disposition ways of thought and general knowledge and form an accurate opinion as to his personal peculiarities macrae himself described the process as that of being turned completely inside out before it was finished he had taken a great liking to the professor the training of the scientist had taught professor rudge to approach his subject without prejudice and under the influence of his sympathetic manner macrae opened out and laid himself bare as he would not have believed possible next the conversation was turned on the radio installation at the station and macrae found that on the subject he knew most of his knowledge was small compared with that of his examiner he was questioned on every detail however apparently irrelevant professor rudge decidcs to visit station x finally they went through almost word for word the communications of the voice innumerable questions were asked respecting the voice itself he was very especially questioned he could not tell why regarding any peculiarity in respect to stress or accent on the various syllables and modulation of intonation he was able to reply very intelligently to this being quick to understand the meaning of the question no doubt the more so from being himself bilingual he noticed that the professor seemed pleased at eliciting the information that while the articulation and pronunciation were accurate accent and modulation were notably deficient making the style rather monotonous a special peculiarity volunteered by macrae was that every sentence seemed to end abruptly with no falling of the voice as though in fact it had been intended to add more at last when the examination seemed almost over macrae himself ventured to put the question as to what conclusion if any his questioner had come to i have come to several macrae and as i observed that you have an uncomfortable feeling that people will doubt your sincerity let me at once say that such a thing is not intelligently possible even with the greatest desire to deceive you could not possibly have duped me for a moment on this matter the voice spoke to me asked macrae eagerly undoubtedly there is not the least possibility that you are yourself deceived in that replied the professor i am very glad i came to see you sir said macrae with a sigh of relief and all i ask now is to forget the whole thing voice island and all then you ask a great deal too much my boy said professor rudge with a smile shall i tell you how much you have interested me

say hallo the impossible the incredlble was visible to them all the lamp hung inverted in the air burning quietly with its flame pointing down it was as solid as indisputable as ever a lamp was the prosaic common lamp of the long dragon bar the man who could work miracles chapter i a pantoum in prose the bar of the long dragon it is doubtful whether the gift was innate for my own part i think it came to him suddenly indeed until he was thirty he was a sceptic and did not believe in miraculous powers and here since it is the most convenient place i must mention thathe was a little man and had eyes of a hot brown very erect red hair a moustache with ends that he twisted up and freckles his name was george mcwhirter fotheringayânot the sort of name by any means to lead to any expectation of miraclesâand he was clerk at gomshotts he was greatly addicted to assertive argument it was while he was asserting the impossibility of miracles that he had his first intimation of his extraordinary powers this particular argument was being held in the bar of the long dragon and toddy beamish was conducting the opposition by a monotonous but effective so you say that drove mr fotheringay to the very limit of his patience there were present besides these two a very dusty cyclist landlord cox and miss maybridge the perfectly respectable and rather portly barmaid of the dragon miss maybridge was standing with her back to mr fotheringay washing glasses the others were watching him more or less amused by the present ineffectiveness of the assertive method goaded by the torres vedras tactics of mr beamish mr fotheringay determined to make an unusual rhetorical effort looky here mr beamish said mr fotheringay let us clearly understand what a miracle is its something contrariwise to the course of nature done by power of will something what couldnt happen unless specially willed so you say said mr beamish repulsing him discussing miracles the inverted lamp mr fotheringay appealed to the cyclist who had hitherto been a silent auditor and received his assentâgiven with a hesitating cough and a glance at mr beamish the landlord would express no opinion and mr fotheringay returning to mr beamish received the unexpected concession of a qualified assent to his definition of a miracle for instance said mr fotheringay greatly encouraged here would be a miracle that lamp in the natural course of nature couldnt burn like that upsydown could it beamish you say it couldnt said beamish and you said fotheringay you dont mean to sayâeh no said beamish reluctantly no it couldnt very well said mr fotheringay then here comes some one as it might be me along here and when you start reading this story by the famous author you begin to wonder why such seeming nonsense ever was committed to paper you begin to doubt if it was really written by h g wells and as you proceed the thought dawns upon you that he probably wrote it before he was ten years old this thought gains conviction until the final denouement when the author fully reveals himself and you have the sinking feeling that the joke is on you this interesting story should be read at least twice in order to get the fullest enjoyment from it and incidentally although this story was written before the recognition of the einstein theory it is an excellent illustration of the modern conception of timespace personally we consider it a masterpiece and heartily recommend it to our readers stands as it might be here and says to that lamp as i might do collecting all my willâturn upsydown without breaking and go on burning steady andhallo it was enough to make any one say hallo the impossible the incredible was visible to them all the lamp hung inverted in the air burning quietly with its flame pointing down it was as solid as indisputable as ever a lamp was the prosaic common lamp of the long dragon bar mr fotheringay stood with an extended forefinger and the knitted brows of one anticipating a catastrophic smash the cyclist who was sitting next the lamp ducked and jumped across the bar everybody jumped more or less miss maybridge turned and screamed for nearly three seconds the lamp remained still a faint cry of mental distress came from mr fotheringay i cant keep it up he said any longer he staggered back and the inverted lamp suddenly flared fell against the corner of the bar bounced aside smashed upon the floor and went out it was lucky it had a metal receiver or the whole place would have been in a blaze mr cox was the first to speak and his remark shorn of needless excrescences was to the effect that fotheringay was a fool fotheringay was beyond disputing even so fundamental a proposition as that he was astonished beyond measure at the thing that had occurred the subsequent conversation threw absolutely no light on the matter so far as fotheringay was concerned the general opinion not only followed mr cox very closely but very vehemently every one accused fotheringay of a silly trick and presented him to himself as a foolish destroyer of comfort and security his mind was in a tornado of perplexity he was himself inclined to agree with them and he made a remarkably ineffectual opposition to the proposal of his departure he went home flushed and heated coatcollar crumpled eyes smarting and ears red he watched each of the ten street lamps nervously as he passed it it was only when he found himself alone in his little bedroom in church row that he was able to grapple seriously with his memories of the occurrence and ask what on earth happened chapter ii the power of the human will he had removed his coat and boots and was sitting on the bed with his hands in his pockets repeating eithe text of his defence for the seventeenth time i didnt want the confounded thing to upset when it occurred to him that at the precise moment he had said the commanding words he had inadvertent ly willed the thing he said and that when he had seen the lamp in the air he had felt that it depended on him to maintain it there without being clear how this was to be done he had not a particularly com amazing stories plex mind or he might have stuck for a time at that inadvertently willed embracing as it does the abstrusest problems of voluntary action but as it was the idea came to him with a quite acceptable haziness and from that following as i must admit no clear logical path he came to the test of experiment he pointed resolutely to his candle and collected his mind though he felt he did a foolish thing be raised up he said but in a second that feeling vanished the candle was raised hung in the air one giddy moment and as mr fotheringay gasped fell with a smash on his toilettable leaving him in darkness save for the expiring glow of its wick for a time mr fotheringay sat in the darkness perfectly still it did happen after all he said and ow im to explain it i dont know he sighed heavily and began feeling in his pockets for a match he could find none and he rose and groped about the toilettable i wish i had a match he said he resorted to his coat and there was none there and then it dawned upon him that miracles were possible even with matches he extended a hand and scowled at it in the dark let there be a match in that hand he said he felt some light object fall across his palm and his fingers closed upon a match after several ineffectual attempts to light this he discovered it was a safety match he threw it down and then it occurred to him that he might have willed it lit he did and perceived it burning in the midst of his toilettable mat he caught it up hastily and it went out his perception of possibilities enlarged and he felt for and replaced the candle in its candlestick here you be lit said mr fotheringay and forthwith the candle was flairing and he saw a little black hole in the toiletcover with a wisp of smoke rising from it for a time he stared from this to the little flame and back and then looked up and met his own gaze in the lookingglass by this help he communed with himself in silence for a time how about miracles now said mr fotheringay at last addressing his reflection mr fotheringay practices miracles upon himself with great success the subsequent meditations of mr fotheringay were of a severe but confused description so far he could see it was a case of pure willing with him the nature of his experiences so far disinclined him for any further experiments at least until he had reconsidered them but he lifted a sheet of paper and turned a glass of water pink and then green and he created a snail which he miraculously annihilated and got himself a miraculous new toothbrush somewhere in the small hours he had reached the fact that his willpower must be of a particularly rare and pungent quality a fact of which he had indeed had inklings before but no certain assurance the scare and perplexity of his first discovery was now qualified by pride in this evidence of singularity and by vague intimations of advantage he became aware that the church clock was striking one and as it did not occur to him that his daily duties at gomshotts might be miraculously dispensed with he resumed undressing in order to get to bed without further delay as he struggled to get his shirt over his head he was struck with a brilliant idea let me be in bed he said and found himself so undressed he stipulated and finding the sheets cold added hastily and in my nightshirtâno in a nice soft woolen nightshirt ah he said with immense enjoyment and now let me be comfortably asleep he awoke at his usual hour and was psrisive all through brealcfasttime wondering whether his overnight experience might not be a particularly vivid dream at length his mind turned again to cautious experiments for instance he had three eggs for breakfast two his landlady had supplied good but shoppy and one was a delicious fresh goose egg laid cooked and served by his extraordinary will he hurried off to gomshotts in a state of profound but carefuliy concealed excitement and only remembered the shell of the third egg when his landlady spoke of it that night all day he could do no work because of this astonishing new selfknowledge but this caused him no inconvenience because he made up for it miracuously in his last ten minutes chapter iii more miracles astonishing the natives as the day wore on his state of mind passed from wonder to elation albeit the circumstances of his dismissal from the long dragon were still disagreeable to recall and a garbled account of the matter that had reached his colleagues led to some baridinage it was evident he must be careful how he lifted frangible articles but in other ways his gift promised more and more as he turned it over in his mind he intended among other things to increase his personal property by unostentatious acts of creation he called into existence a pair of very splendid diamond studs and hastily annihilated them again as young gomshott came across the countinghouse to his desk he was afraid young gomshott might wonder how he had come by them he saw quite clearly the gift required caution and watchfulness in its exercise but so far as he could judge the difficulties attending its mastery would be no greater than those he had already faced in the study of cycling it was that analogy perhaps quite as much as the feeling that he would be unwelcome in the long dragon that drove him out after supper into the lane beyond the gasworks to rehearse a few miracles in private there was possibly a certain want of originality in his attempts for apart from his willpower mr fotheringay was not a very exceptional man the miracle of moses rod came to his mind but the night was dark and unfavourable to the proper control of large miraculous snakes then he recollected the story of tannhauser that he had read on the back of the philharmonic programme that seemed to him singularly attractive and harmless he stuck his walkingstickâa very nice poonapenang lawyerâinto the turf that edged the footpath and commanded the dry wood to blossom the air was immediately full of the scent of roses and by means of a match he saw for himself that this beautiful miracle was indeed accomplished his satisfaction was ended by advancing footsteps the man who could work miracles afraid of a premture discovery of his powers he addressed the blossoming stick hastily go back what he meant was change back but of course he was confused the stick receded at a considerable velocity and incontinently came a cry of anger and a bad word from the approaching person who are you throwing brambles at you fool cried a voice that got me on the shin mr fotheringay gets in trouble with the police and disposes of the officer as in the next chapter im sorry old chap said mr fotheringay and then realizing the awkward nature of the explanation caught nervously at his moustache he saw winch one of the three immering constables advancing what do you mean by it asked the constable hallo its you is it the gent that broke the lamp at the long dragon i dont mean anything by it said mr fotheringay nothing at all what dyer do it for then oh bother said mr fotheringay bother indeed dyer know that stick hurt what dyer do it for eh for the moment mr fotheringay could not think what he had done it for his silence seemed to irritate mr winch youve been assaulting the police young man this time thats what you done look here mr winch said mr fotheringay annoyed and confused im sorry very the fact is well he could think of no wâły but the truth i was working a miracle he tried to speak in an offhand way but try as he would he couldnt chapter iv more trouble about the policeman working a ere dont you talk rot working a miracle indeed miracle well thats downright funny why yous the chap that dont believe in miracles fact is this is another of your silly conjuring tricksâthats what this is now i tell you but mr fotheringay never heard what mr winch was going to tell him he realized he had given himself away flung his valuable secret to all the winds of heaven a violent gust of irritation swept over him to action he turned on the constable swiftly and fiercely here he said ive had enough of this i have ill show you a silly conjuring trick i will go to hades go now he was alone mr fotheringay performed no more miracles that night nor did he trouble to see what had become of his flowering stick he returned to the town scared and very quiet and went to his bedroom lord he said its a powerful giftâan extremely powerful gift i didnt hardly mean as much as that not really i wonder what hades is like he sat on the bed taking off his boots struck by a happy thought he transferred the constable to san francisco and without any more interference with normal caution went soberly to bed in the night he dreamt of the anger of winch the next day mr fotheringay heard two interesting items of news some one had planted a most beautiful climbing rose against the elder gomshotts private house in the lullaborough road and the river as far as rawiings mill was to be dragged for constable winch mr fotheringay was abstracted and thoughtful all that day and performed no miracles except certain provisions for winch and the miracle of completing his days work with punctual perfection in spite of all the beeswarm of thoughts that hummed through his mind and the extraordinary abstraction and meekness of his manner was remarked by several people and made a matter of jesting for the most part he was thinking of winch on sunday evening he went to chapel and oddly enough mr maydig who took a certain interest in occult matters preached about things that are not lawful mr fotheringay was not a regular chapelgoer but the system of assertive sclcepticism to which i have already alluded was now very much shaken the tenor of the sermon threw an entirely new light on these novel gifts and he suddenly decided to consult mr maydig immediately after the service so soon as that was determined he found himself wondering why he had not done so before mr maydig a lean excitable man with quite remarkably long wrists and neck was gratified at a request for a private conversation from a young man whose carelessness in religious matters wa a subject for general remark in the town after a few necessary delays he conducted him to the study of the manse which was contiguous to the chapel seated him comfortably and standing in front of a cheerful fireâhis legs threw a rhodian arch of shadow on the opposite wallârequested mr fotheringay to state his business at first mr fotheringay was a little abashed and found some difficulty in opening the matter you will scarcely believe me mr maydig i am afraid âand so forth for some time he tried a question at last and asked mr maydig his opinion of miracles chapter v interviewing a clergyman mr maydig was still saying well in an extremely judicial tone when mr fotheringay interrupted again you dont believe i suppose that some common sort of person âlike myself for instanceâas it might be sitting here now might have some sort of twist inside him that made him able to do things by his will its possible said mr maydig something of the sort perhaps is possible if i might make free with something here i think i might show you by a sort of experiment said mr fotheringay now take that tobaccojar on the table for instance what i want to know is whether what i am going to do with it is a miracle or not just half a minute mr maydig please he knitted his brows pointed to the tobaccojar and said be a bowl of vilets the tobaccojar did as it was ordered mr maydig started violently at the change and stood looking from the thaumaturgist to the bowl of amazing stories flowers he said nothing presently he ventured to lean over the table and smell the violets they were freshpicked and very fine ones then he stared at mr fotheringay again how did you do that he asked mr fotheringay pulled his moustache just told itâand there you are is that a miracle or is it black art or what is it and what do you thinks the matter with me thats what i want to ask its a most extraordinary occurrence and this day last week i knew no more that i could do things like that than you did it came quite sudden its something odd about my will i suppose and thats as far as i can see is thatâthe only thing could you do other things besides that lord yes said mr fotheringay just anything he thought and suddenly recalled a conjuring entertainment he had seen here he pointed change into a bowl of fishânot not thatâ change into a glass bowl full of water with goldfish swimming in it thats better you see that mr maydig its astonishing its incredible you are either a most extraordinary but no i could change it into anything said mr fotheringay just anything here be a pigeon will you in another moment a blue pigeon was fluttering round the room and making mr maydig duck every time it came near him stop there will you said mr fotheringay and the pigeon hung motionless in the air i could change it back to a bowl of flowers he said and after replacing the pigeon on the table worked that miracle i expect you will want your pipe in a bit he said and restored the tobaccojar mr maydig very much interested mr maydig had followed all these later changes in a sort of ejaculatory silence he stared at mr fotheringay and in a very gingerly manner picked up the tobaccojar examined it replaced it on the table well was the only expression of his feelings now after that its easier to explain what i came about said mr fotheringay and proceeded to a lengthy and involved narrative of his strange experiences beginning with the affair of the lamp in the long dragon and complicated by persistent allusions to winch as he went on the transient pride of mr maydigs consternation had caused passed away he became the very ordinary mr fotheringay of everyday intercourse again mr maydig listened intently the tobaccojar in his hand and his bearing changed also with the course of the narrative presently while mr fotheringay was dealing with the miracle of the third egg the minister interrupted with a fluttering extended hand it is possible he said it is credible it is amazing of course but it reconciles a number of amazing difficulties the power to work miracles is a giftâa peculiar quality like genius or second sight hitherto it has come very rarely and to exceptional people but in this case i have always wondered at the miracles of mahomet and at yogis miracles and the miracles of madame blavatsky but of course â yes it is simply a gift it carries out so beautifully the arguments of that great thinker â mr maydigs voice sankâhis grace the duke of argyll here we plumb some profounder lawâdeeper than the ordinary laws of nature yesâyes go on go on chapter vi a long talk with the clergyman about miracles mr fotheringay proceeded to tell of his misadventure with winch and mr maydig no longer overawed or scared began to jerk his limbs about and interject astonishment its this what troubled me most proceeded mr fotheringay its this im most mijitly in want of advice for of course hes at san franciscoâ wherever san francisco may beâbut of course its awkward for both of us as youll see mr maydig i dont see how he can understand what has happened and i dare say hes scared and exasperated something tremendous and trying to get at me i dare say he keeps on starting off to come here i send him back by a miracle every few hours when i think of it and of course thats a thing he wont be able to understand and its bound to annoy him and of course if he takes a ticket every time it will cost him a lot of money i done the best i could for him but of course itss difficult for him to put himself in my place i thought afterwards that his clothes might have got scorched you know âif hades is all its supposed to beâbefore i shifted him in that case i suppose theyd have locked him up in san francisco of course i willed him a new suit of clothes on him directly i thought of it but you see im already in a deuce of a tangle mr maydig looked serious i see you are in a tangle yes its a difficult position how you are to end it he became diffused and inconclusive however well leave winch for a little and discuss the larger question i dont think this is a case of the black art or anything of the sort i dont think there is any taint of criminality about it at all mr fotheringayânone whatever unless you are suppressing material facts no its miraclesâpure miraclesâmiracles if i may say so of the very highest class he began to pace the hearthrug and gesticulate while mr fotheringay sat with his arm on the table and his head on his arm looking worried i dont see how im to manage about winch he said a gift of working miraclesâapparently a very powerful gift said mr maydig will find a way about winchânever fear my dear sir you are a most important manâa man of the most astonishing possibilities as evidence for example and in other ways the things you may do yes ive thought of a thing or two said mr fotheringay butâsome of the things came a bit twisty you saw that fish at first wrong sort of bowl and wrong sort of fish and i thought id ask some one a proper course said mr maydig a very proper courseâaltogether the proper course he stopped and looked at mr fotheringay its practically an unlimited gift let us test your powers the man who could work miracles for instanceif they really are if they really are all they seem to be the clergyman calls for more miracles and so incredible as it may seem in the study of the little house behind the congregational chapel on the evening of sunday nov mr fotheringay egged on and inspired by mr maydig began to work miracles the readers attention is specially and definitely called to the date he will object probably has objected that certain points in this story are improbable that if any things of the sort already described had indeed occurred they would have been in all the papers at that time the details immediately following he will find particularly hard to accept because among other things they involve the conclusion that he or she the reader in question must have been killed in a violent and unprecedented manner more than a year ago now a miracle is nothing if not improbable and as a matter of fact the reader was killed in a violent and unprecedented manner in in the subsequent course of this story that will become perfectly clear and credible as every rightminded and reasonable reader will admit but this is not the place for the end of the story being but little beyond the hither side of the middle and at first the miracles worked by mr fotheringay were timid little miraclesâlittle things with the cups and parlour fitments as feeble as the miracles of theosophists and feeble as they were they were received with awe by his collaborator he would have preferred to settle the winch business out of hand but mr maydig would not let him but after they had worked a dozen of these domestic trivialities their sense of power grew their imagination began to show signs of stimulation and their ambition enlarged their first larger enterprise was due to hunger and negligence of mrs minchin mr maydigs housekeeper the meal to which the minister conducted mr fotheringay was certainly illlaid and uninviting as refreshment for two industrious miracleworkers but they were seated and mr maydig was descanting in sorrow rather than in anger upon his housekeepers shortcomings before it occurred to mr fotheringay that an opportunity lay before him dont you think mr maydig he said if it isnt a liberty i my dear mr fotheringay of course noâ i dont think chapter vii a miraculous meal and many reforms mr fotheringay waved his hand what shall we have he said in a large inclusive spirit and at mr maydigs order revised the supper very thoughtfully as for me he said eyeing mr maydigs selection i am always particularly fond of a tankard of stout and a nice welsh rarebit and ill order that i aint much given to burgundy and forthwith stout and welsh rarebit promptly appeared at his command they sat long at their supper talking like equals as mr fotheringay presently perceived with a glow of surprise and gratification of all the miracles they would presently do and bytheby mr maydig said mr fotheringay i might perhaps be able to help youâin a domestic way dont quite follow said mr maydig pouring out a glass of miraculous old burgundy mr fotheringay helped himself to a second welsh rarebit out of vacancy and took a mouthful i was thinking he said i might be able chum chum to work chum chum a miracle with mrs minchin chum chumâmake her a better woman mr maydig put down the glass and looked doubtful shesâshe strongly objects to interference you know mr fotheringay andâas a matter of factâits well past eleven and shes probably ip bed and asleep do you think on the whole mr fotheringay considered these objections i dont see that it shouldnt be done in her sleep for a time mr maydig opposed the idea and then he yielded mr fotheringay issued his orders and a little less at their ease perhaps the two gentlemen proceeded with their repast mr maydig was enlarging on the changes he might expect in his housekeeper next day with an optimism that seemed even to mr fotheringays supper sense a little forced and hectic when a series of confused noises from upstairs began their eyes exchanged interrogations and mr maydig left the room hastily mr fotheringay heard him calling up to his housekeeper and then his footsteps going softly up to her in a minute or so the minister returned his step light his face radiant wonderful he said and touching most touching he began pacing the hearthrug a repentanceâ a most touching repentanceâthrough the crack of the door poor woman a most wonderful change she had got up she must have got up at once she had got up out of her sleep to smash a private bottle of brandy in her box and to confess it too but this gives usâit opensâa most amazing vista of possibilities if we can work this miraculous change in her the things unlimited seemingly said mr fotheringay and about mr winch altogether unlimited and from the hearthrug mr maydig waving the winch difficulty aside un folded a series of wonderful proposalsâproposals he invented as he went along now what those proposals were does not concern the essentials of this story suffice it that they were designed in a spirit of infinite benevolence the sort of benevolence that used to be called postprandial suffice it too that the problem of winch remained unsolved nor is it necessary to describe how far that series got to its fulfilment there were as tonishing changes the small hours found mr may dig and mr fotheringay careering across the chilly market square under the still moon in a sort of ecstasy of thurmaturgy mr maydig all flap and gesture mr fotheringay short and bristling and no longer abashed at his greatness they had re formed every drunkard in the parliamentary divi sion changed all the beer and alcohol to water mr maydig had overruled mr fotheringay on this point they had further greatly improved the railroad communication of the place drained flin ders swamp improved the soil of one tree hill and cured the vicars wart and they were going to see what could be done with the injured pier at amazing stories south bridge the place gasped mr maydig wont be the same place tomorrow how surpris ed and thankful every one will be and just at that moment the church clock struck three chapter viii the rotation of the earth stopped i say said mr fotheringay thats three i oclock i must be getting back ive got to be at business by eight and besides mrs wimms were only beginning said mr maydig full of the sweetness of unlimited power were only be ginning think of all the good were doing when people wake but said mr fotheringay mr maydig gripped his arm suddenly his eyes were bright and wild my dear chap he said theres no hurry look he pointed to the moon at the zenithâjoshua joshua said mr maydig why not stop it mr fotheringay looked at the moon thats a bit tall he said after a pause why not said mr maydig of course it doesnt stop you stop the rotation of the earth you know time stops it isnt as if we were doing harm hm said mr fotheringay well he sighed ill try here he buttoned up his jacket and addressed himself to the habitable globe with as good an assumption of confidence as lay in his power jest stop ro tating will you said mr fotheringay incontinently he was flying head over heels through the air at the rate of dozens of miles a minute in spite of the innumerable circles he was describing per second he thought for thought is wonderfulâsometimes as sluggish as flowing pitch sometimes as instantaneous as light he thought in a second and willed let me come down safe and sound whatever else happens let me down safe and sound mr fotheringay starts a terrific storm he willed it only just in time for his clothes heated by his rapid flight through the air were already beginning to singe he came down with a forcible but by no means injurious bump in what appeared to be a mound of freshturned earth a large mass of metal and masonry extraordinarily like the ciocktower in the middle of the market square hit the earth near him ricochetted over him and flew into stonework bricks and cement like a bursting bomb a hurtling cow hit one of the larger blocks and smashed like an egg there was a crash that made all the most violent crashes of his past seem like the sound of falling dust and this was followed by a descending series of lesser crashes a vast wind roared throughout earth and heaven so that he could scarcely lift his head to look for a while he was too breathless and as tonished even to see where he was or what had hap pened and this movement was to feel his head and reassure himself that his streaming hair was still his own lord gasped mr fotheringay scarce able to speak for the gale ive had a squeak whats gone wrong storms and thunder and only a minute ago a fine night its maydig set me on to this sort of thing what a wind if i go on fooling in this way im bound to have a thundering accident wheres maydig what a confounded mess everythings in he looked about him so far as his flapping jacket would permit the appearance of things was really extremely strange the skys all right anyhow said mr fotheringay and thats about all that is all right and even there it looks like a terrific gale coming up and even theres the moon over head just as it was just now bright as midday but as for the restwheres the village wheres âwheres any thing and what on earth set this wind ablowing i didnt order no wind chapter ix a strenuous life mr fotheringay struggled to get to his feet in vain and after one failure remain ed on all fours holding on he surveyed the moonlit world to leeward with the tails of his jacket streaming over his head theres something seriously wrong said mr fotheringay and what it isâgoodness knows far and wide nothing was visible in the white glare through the haze of dust that drove before a screaming gale but tumbled masses of earth and heaps of inchoate ruins no trees no houses no familiar shapes only a wilderness of disorder van ishing at last into the darkness beneath the whirling columns and streamers the lightnings and thunder ings of a swiftly rising storm near him in the livid glare was something that might once have been an elmtree a smashed mass of splinters shivered from boughs to base and further a twisted mass of iron girdersâonly too evidently the viaductârose out of the piled confusion you see when mr fotheringay had arrested the rotation of the solid globe he had made no stipu lation concerning the trifling movables upon its sur face and the earth spins so fast that the surface at its equator is travelling at rather more than a thousand miles an hour and in these latitudes at more than half that pace so that the village and mr maydig and mr fotheringay and everybody and everything had been jerked violently forward at about nine miles per secondâthat is to say much more violently than if they had been fired out of a cannon and every human being every living creature every house and every treeâall the world as we know it âhad been so jerked and smashed and utterly de stroyed that was all getting rid of the power of performing miracles these things mr fotheringay did not of course fully appreciate but he perceived that his miracle had miscarried and with that a great disgust of miracles came upon him he was in darkness now for the clouds had swept to gether and blotted out his momentary glimpse of the moon and the air was full of fitful struggling tortured wraiths of hail a great roaring of wind continued on page the scientific adventures of mr fosdick by

captivating tale demonstrates this most aptly did you ever stroke a cat in the dark and watch the sparks leap between your hand and the cats fur perhaps you did but it remained for the illustrious fos dick to commercialize this great inherent power the results were most amazing as the readers will soon find out starting with a single cat highly charged with electricity see what a catastropheâno pun intendedâhe brings upon himself there is only one point we missed and that is what electrode in the experiment was the cathode than mr fosdick for he was an inventor and genius in all matters pertaining to science he was the village authorityâeven a greater authority than old pro fessor snooks the fiercely bewhiskered savant of doolittle college up on the hill snooks had once called him a doddering tinker but this mr fosdick attributed to jealousy as did all the in habitants of whiffleville for the professor was a pompous man and an unpopular one no fairminded person could doubt mr fosdicks versatility in the arts and crafts for upon the signboard that hung over the sidewalk in front of the door of the tinshop was lettered his many accomplishments jason quincy fosdick tinsmith keyfitter and scissorsgrinder amazing stories as an inventor mr fosdick had achieved great success true his patent corkscrew had never drawn a cork but it had made a fair hairpin and he had disposed of it as such for a dignified sum his patent pump refused flatly to perform the duty for which it had been designed but it turned out to be an excellent churn and the favorite creature of his inventive brain his patent curling iron was in service in countless homes throughout the broad land as a nutcracker a wonderful idea in the field of electric power as mr fosdick gazed abstractedly at the bare wall in front of him he beetled his brows after the manner of all geniuses when con centrating their minds upon some great and sud denly discovered phenomenon in the wonderful world of science as stated before mr fosdick was thinking and the thing that immersed him so deep in thought was a sentence that he had just read in the book many would have passed it by but mr fosdicks eyes had no sooner fallen on the lines of typeâless than a score of words in allâthan it im mediately revealed to him a wide field of experi mental research and one replete with thrilling pos sibilities the momentous truth as told in the single short and unobtrusive sentence was static electricity may be generated by rubbing together such substances as resin and fur little did mr fosdick at the time suspect that his stumbling upon this bit of elementary science was to result in focus ing upon him the fierce limelight of international publicity and to make whiffleville for a brief forty eight hours the breathless topic of conversation throughout the civilized world fully an hour passed the noon whistle blew at ebert stetzles chop mill announcing to all whifile ville the arrival of the dinner hour and then mr fosdick with the sigh of a tired man arose from his chair and started to close the shop had he fol lowed out his intention this story would never have been written but just as he was about to lock the front door there happened one of those strange and inexplicable things that so often change the destiny of men and nationsâa large black cat walked across the threshold and sniffed rather contemptuously at mr fosdicks shins mr fosdick stared at the cat for a full minute and then he slowly put the key back in his pocket its john l he exclaimed by thunder ill try it pulling out a drawer of the workbench he after fumbling about in a bushel or so of wheels springs screweyes and other odds and ends so dear to the hearts of all geniuses eventually drew forth a large chunk of resin and then picking up the unsus pecting john lâso named after a highly successful pugilist on account of his extremely belligerent dis positionâhe placed the cat upon the bench and began to gently stroke himfore and aft with the resin slowly the hair upon the cats back began to rise and in a few minutes john l had apparently grown to twice his normal size no astronomer discovering some hitherto unknown planetâno mother gazing with loving eyes at her first born ever experienced the rapturous tumult of feelings that suffused mr fosdick as he watched the rapidly expanding john l quickly wrapping a piece of copper wire around a water pipe mr fosdick with eyes burning with the excitement of the experiment slowly pushed the other end of the wire in the direc tion of john ls nose suddenly and without warn ing there was a loud cracking sound a hot blue flame shot out from the cats nose to the end of the wire and john l with a wild cry of rage leaped some dozen feet in the air and coming down exe cuted a neat right and left scratch upon the inven tors face then with a single bound sprang through the door by jinks cried fosdick she worksâshe worksâshe works the feline light and power co organized less than a week after mr fosdick had made his experiment all whiffleville was thrown in to a turmoil of excitement by the erection of a mysterious criblike structure back of his tinshop only a chosen few knew the purpose of the strange building and they eben stetzle and five other friends and admirers of mr fosdick maintained a sphynxlike silence in fact these men having paid in ten dollars apiece to mr fosdick constituted the stockholders and the first board of directors of the feline light and power co the plan of organization was broad and com prehensive the feline light and power co was to be the parent company mr fosdick assured the directors that it should by virtue of the ownership of basic patents which he was sure to obtain control all the other companies that would spring up throughout the country just as soon as the parent company had demonstrated the success of the new method of power generation briefly the new power plant consisted of a room hardly larger than a piano box elevated some three feet from the ground by insulating pillars of glazed brick the floor and the walls of the room were coated with a fourinch lining of pure resin into this room a plurality of cats so the patent ap plication read were to be liberated therein by drop ping them through the trap door a to the resin covered floor b upon which surface they will con duct themselves in the manner hereinafter describ ed the prospectus which mr fosdick had already started to work upon told in simpler language that the friction of the cats against the surface of the resin would generate electricity which would be conveyed to consumers within a radius of ten miles âand possibly to the street railway and light sta tions in the city fifty miles distant eben stetzle was the first to foresee that there would be an immediate market for cats and secretly he and his brotherinlaw set about organizing a catbreeding corporation under the laws of new jersey to be known as the general feline co limited mr fosdick and his units it took some pretty hard hustling upon the part of the directorate but by the time the power house was completed twenty units as mr fosdick called them had been lured from as many back yards nd for a day languished in the back room of the tinshop in the evening when night the feline light amp power co had thrown its sable shade over whiffleville and left the world in darkness to mr fosdick and his cats ltis mr thomas gray would doubtlessly have written had he thought about it when composing his famous elegyâat any rate it was after dark when mr fosdick stole out of the tinshop and one by one dropped his units through the trapdoor of the power house roof twenty trips he made and twenty units were installed then he listened intentlyâthere was not a sound with a heart sickened with the appre hension of failure mr fosdick made one more journey back to the tinshop and reappeared this time with john lâthe exciter as he afterwards called him hardly had he dropped the hero of a thousand backfence encounters into the dark and silent hole than things began to happen such a beldam of yowling and caterwauling whiffleville had never heardâthe plant was in operation the next morning when president fosdick and the other officers and directors of the feline light and power company elbowed their way through the crowd of curious citizens that had gathered about the power house it was evident from the noise that came from the units inside that the charging pro cess was still in progress with some trepidation they mounted the ladder and looked down into the generating room a strange and wonderful sight met their gaze twentyone cats each of them the size of a beer keg were fighting each other in a grand battle royal their hair stood straight out and sparks played over their dully luminous bodies incessantly the crackling noise of electrical dis charges was continuous and the peculiar odor of ozone filled the air the directors were awed men were worth millions and millions ejacu lated mr fosdick gazing down rapturously at the expanded units mr fosdick and his friends acquire a dangerous electric charge quickly handing vicepresident stetzle the voltmeter he had brought with him mr fosdick slipped down into the room pick ing up a unit he handed it up through the door for more thorough examination but the unit did not propose being examined with a yowl of rage it sank its teeth into the vicepresidents arm and then with a loud and furious hiss leaped to the ground upon just what happened then none could ever agree stetzle afterwards described the explosion as being like that of the sudden eruption of a vol cano other spectators when brought to their senses were sure there had been an earthquake but mr fosdick with his calm unemotional mind of a born investigator believed neither of these theories he saw the cat as it touched the groundâsaw the sud den flare of blue fireâheard the tremendous report âsaw the unit disappear in a dense cloud of white smoke and afterwards identified all that was left of itâsmall patch of fur about the size of a dimeâ probably an ear hardly had the breeze wafted the dust and smoke aside when mr fosdick became aware of a strange and startling phenomenonâhis hair and whiskers stood out from his head and face like the quills of a porcupine mr stetzle was similarly affected dont touch the ground eben shouted mr fosdick warningly if you do you will blow up like the cat did were charged with millions of volts it was a terrible situation and the two men looked anxiously about for assistance but the frightened spectators had fled to that haven of safety and gos sipâthe postoffice what is to be done with the charged subject excitement was at fever heat in the town all sorts of rumors filled the air and the telegraph was sending them to the remotest corners of the earth before noon extras were upon the streets of a score of cities telling in columns and columns of the terrible catastrophe and giving il lustrations of it drawn by our special artist upon the ground all day long the fwo terrorized men cowered in the generating room outside at a safe distance a great crowd gathered no one dared go near and it was generally believed that the unfortunate fos dick and stetzle must eventually starve to death during the afternoon correspondents from the great city dailies poured in on every train and camera men clicked their instruments about the death shed in shoals towards evening it became known that the casualities were one cat dead and two men electrified about supper time prof snooks arrived and it was owing to his suggestions to have food passed to them at the end of long glass poles that the men were saved from starvation in the generating room life was well nigh insuf ferable the constant electrical discharges were irritating in the extreme and both men and units were in a vicious humor it must be said however that president fosdick made some attempt to bear the strain with the fortitude of a martyr to science but the unhappy stetzle displayed no such courage âhe had a wife and family he said and he wanted to get out mr fosdick counseled the vicerpresi dent to have his family brought in but to this sug gestion stetzle only replied with curses in calmer moments stetzle said that with two men and twenty cats in the bin there could be no room for mrs stet zle and nine children the frightened people leave the town the next afternoon prof snooks from a safe distance shouted to them that they might per haps regain their liberty by wearing rubber boots but that they should try the idea on a cat first in this suggestion mr fosdick saw a ray of hope and mr stetzle was so cheered that he of fered to dispose of his stock in the company of mr fosdick for a mere song the offer was refused mr fosdick said that he was not interested partic ularly in financial matters at that time he wrote a note to josh little the harnessmaker ordering a pair of rubber boots made catsize then the in ventor by eloquent gestures attracted the attention of the crowd and threw the note towards it at which there was a great scattering a moment later he sank back in despair for just as the epistle touched the ground there was a slight explosion a vivid red flash and it burned up before his very eyes well might he shudder for now he realized the tre continued on page the moon metal by garrett p serviss author of a columbus of space the second deluge etc and i perceived that the of the glass tube had been melted through an molten gold was slowly dripping from it the moon metal chapter i south polar gold when the news came of the discovery of gold at the south pole nobody suspected that the beginning had been reached of a new era in the worlds history the newsboys cried extra as they had done a thousand times for murders battles fires and wall street panics but nobody was excited in fact the reports at first seemed so exaggerated and improbable that hardly anybody believed a word of them who could have been expected to credit a despatch forwarded by cable from new zealand and signed by an unknown name which contained such a statement as this a seam of gold which can be cut with a knife has been found within ten miles of the south pole the discovery of the pole itself had been an nounced three years before and several scientific parties were known to be exploring the remarkable continent that surrounds it but while they had sent home many highly interesting reports there had been nothing to suggest the possibility of such an amazing discovery as that which was now an nounced accordingly most sensible people looked upon the new zealand despatch as a hoax but within a week and from a different source flashed another despatch which more than confirmed the first it declared that gold existed near the south pole in practically unlimited quantity some geologists said this accounted for the greater depth of the antarctic ocean it had always been noticed that the southern hemisphere appeared to be a little overweighted people now began to prick up their ears and many letters of inquiry appeared in the newspapers concerning the wonderful tidings from the south some asked for information about the shortest route to the new goldfields in a little while several additional reports came some via new zealand others via south america and all confirming in every respect what had been sent before then a new york newspaper sent a swift steamer to the antarctic and when this enterprising journal pub lished a fourpage cable describing the discoveries in detail all doubt van ished and the rush began gold loses its value and the markets of the world are upset some time i may undertake a description of the wild scenes that occurred when at last the in habitants of the northern hemisphere were convinced the boundless stores of gold existed in the unclaimed and uninhabited wastes surrounding the south pole but at present i have something more wonderful to relate let me briefly depict the situation one of the finest pieces of scientifiction ever written is the moon metal this classic by the well known professor garrett p serviss contains a tremend ous amount of excellent science while this story was written at the close of the th century no one in this lat ter day of transmission of radio over great distances and the actual accomplishment of transmutation of gases and the like can find fault or can question that such a scheme as propounded by the authorâthat is of extracting ore or metal from a distant body without intervening physical meansâcan some day be accomplished the story keeps up a tremendous interest because you are not permitted to know for quite a long stretch just how the moon metal was extracted from the moon the illustrious author has long enjoyed a reputation as a populariser of natural science here we see him as a true scientific story teller for many years silver had been absent from the coinage of the world its increasing abundance rendered it unsuitable for money especially when contrasted with gold the silver craze which had raged in the closing decade of the nineteenth cen tury was already a forgotten incident of financial history the gold standard had become universal and business all over the earth had adjusted itself to that condition the wheels of industry ran smoothly and there seemed to be no possibility of any disturbance or interruption the common monetary system prevailing in every land fostered trade and facilitated the exchange of products travellers never had to bother their heads about the currency of money any coin that passed in new york would pass for its face value in london paris berlin rome madrid st petersburg constan tinople cairo khartoum jerusalem peking or yeddo it was indeed the golden age and the world had never been so free from financial storms upon this peaceful scene the south polar gold discoveries burst like an unheralded tempest i happened to be in the company of a famous bank president when the confirmation of those dis coveries suddenly filled the streets with yelling newsboys the gold standard eliminated and disaster impending get me one of those extras he said and an officeboy ran out to obey him as he perused the sheet his face darkened im afraid its too true he said at length yes there seems to be no getting around it gold is going to be as plentiful as iron if there were not such a flood of it we might manage but when they begin to make trousers buttons out of the same metal that is now locked and guarded in steel vaults where will be our standard of worth my dear fellow he continu ed impulsively laying his hand on my arm i would as willingly face the end of the world as this thats coming you think it so bad then i asked but most people will not agree with you they will re gard it as very good news how can it be good he burst out what have we got to take the place of gold can we go back to the age of barter can we substitute cattlepens and wheatbins for the strong boxes of the treas ury can commerce exist with no common measure of exchange it does indeed look serious i assented serious i tell you it is the deluge thereat he clapped on his hat and hurried across the street to the office of another celebrated banker his premonitions of disaster turned out to be but too well grounded the deposits of gold at the south pole were richer than the wildest reports had rep resented them the shipments of the precious metal amazing stories to america and europe soon became enormousâso enormous that the metal was no longer precious the price of gold dropped like a falling stone with accelerated velocity and within a year every money centre in the world had been swept by a panic gold was more common than iron every government was compelled to demonetize it for when once gold had fallen into contempt it was less valuable in the eyes of the public than stamped paper for once the world had thoroughly learned the lesson that too much of a good thing is worse than none of it gold is brought into economic use then somebody found a hew use for gold by inventing a process by which it could be hardened and tempered assuming a wonder ful toughness and elasticity without losing its non corrosive property and in this form it rapidly took the place of steel in the mean time every effort was made to bolster up credit endless were the attempts to find a sub stitute for gold the chemists sought it in their laboratories and the mineralogists in the mountains and deserts platinum might have served but it too had become a drug in the market through the discovery of immense deposits out of the twenty odd elements which had been rarer and more valu able than gold such as uranium gallium etc not one was found to answer the purpose in short it was evident that since both gold and silver had be come too abundant to serve any longer for a money standard the planet held no metal suitable to take their place the entire monetary system of the world must be readjusted but in the readjustment it was cer tain to fall to pieces in fact it had already fallen to pieces the only recourse was to paper money but whether this was based upon agriculture or mining or manufacture it gave varying standards not only among the different nations but in succes sive years in the same country exports and im ports practically ceased credit was discredited commerce perished and the world at a bound seemed to have gone back financially and industrial ly to the dark ages one final effort was made a great financial con gress was assembled at new york representatives of all the nations took part in it the ablest financ iers of europe and america united the efforts of their gearius and the results of their experience to solve the great problem the various governments all solemnly stipulated to abide by the decision of the congress but after spending months in hard but fruit less labor that body was no nearer the end of its un dertaking than when it first assembled the entire world awaited its decision with bated breath and yet the decision was not formed at this paralyzing crisis a most unexpected event suddenly opened the way chapter ii the magician of science an attendant entered the room where the per plexed financiers were in session and pre sented a peculiarlooking card to the presi dent mr boon the president took the card in his hand and instantly fell into a brown study so com plete was his absorption that herr finster the celebrated berlin banker who had been addressing the chair for the last two hours from the opposite end of the long table got confused entirely lost track of his verb and suddenly dropped into his seat very red in the face and wearing a most injured expression but president boon paid no attention except to the singular card which he continued to turn over and over balancing it on his fingers and holding it now at armslength and then near his nose with one eye squinted as if he were trying to look through a hole in the card at length this odd conduct of the presiding of ficer drew all eyes upon the card and then every body shared the interest of mr boon in shape and size the card was not extraordinary but it was com posed of metal what metal that question had immediately arisen in mr boons mind when the card came into his hand and now it exercised the wits of all the others plainly it was not tin brass copper bronze silver aluminumâalthough its lightness might have suggested that metal nor even base gold the president although a skilled metallurgist confessed his inability to say what it was so in tent had he become in examining the curious bit of metal that he forgot it was a visitors card of in troduction and did not even look for the name which it presumably bore the reception of a visitors wonderful card as he held the card up to get a better light up on it a stray sunbeam from the window fell across the metal and instantly it bloomed with exquisite colors the presidents chair being in the darker end of the room the radiant card suffused the atmosphere about him with a faint rose tint playing with sur prising liveliness into alternate canary color and violet the effect upon the company of clearheaded fin anciers was extremely remarkable the unknown metal appeared to exercise a kind of mesmeric in fluence its soft hues blending together in a chro matic harmony which captivated the sense of vision as the ears are charmed by a perfectly rendered song gradually all gathered in an eager group around the presidents chair what can it be was repeated from lip to lip did you ever see anything like it asked mr boon for the twentieth time none of them had even seen the like of it a spell fell upon the assemblage for five minutes no one spoke while mr boon continued to chase the flick ering sunbeam with the wonderful card suddenly the silence was broken by a voice which had a touch of awe in it it must be the metal the speaker was an english financier first lord of the treasury hon james hamptonjones kcb immediately everybody echoed his remark and the strain being thus relieved the spell dropped from them and several laughed loudly over their momen tary aberration the moon metal the visitor himself enters president boon recollected himself and coloring slightly placed the card flat on the table in order more clearly to see the name in plain red letters it stood forth with such sur prising distinctness that mr boon wondered why he had so long overlooked it dr max syx tell the gentleman to come in said the presi dent and thereupon the attendant threw open the door the owner of the mysterious card fixed every eye as he entered he was several inches more than six feet in height his complexion was very dark his eyes were intensely black bright and deep set his eyebrows were bushy and upcurled at the ends his sable hair was closetrimmed and his ears were narrow pointed at the top and promi nent he wore black mustaches covering only half the width of his lip and drawn into projecting needles on each side while a spiked black beard adorned the middle of his chin he smiled as he stepped confidently forward with a courtly bow but it was a very disconcerting smile because it more than half resembled a sneer this uncommon person did not wait to be addressed i have come to solve your problem he said fac ing president boon who had swung round on his pivoted chair the metal exclaimed everybody in a breath and with a unanimity and excitement which would have astonished them if they had been spectators in stead of actors of the scene the tall stranger bowed and smiled again just so he said what do you think of it it is beautiful again the reply came from every mouth simultan eously and again if the speakers could have been listeners they would have wondered not only at their earnestness but at their words for why should they instantly and unanimously pronounce that beautiful which they had not even seen but every man knew he had seen it for instinctively their minds reverted to the card and recognized in it the metal referred to the mesmeric spell seemed once more to fall upon the assemblage for the fin anciers noticed nothing remarkable in the next act of the stranger which was to take a chair unin vited at the table and the moment he sat down he became the presiding officer as naturally as if he had just been elected to that post they all waited for him to speak and when he opened his mouth they listened with breathless attention the visitors story his words were of the best english but there was some peculiarity which they had already noticed either in his voice or his manner of enunciation which struck all of the listeners as denoting a foreigner but none of them could satisfactorily place him neither the americans the englishmen the germans the frenchmen the russians the austrians the ital ians the spaniards the turks the japanese nor the chinese at the board could decide to what race or nationality the stranger belonged this metal he began taking the card from mr boons hand i have discovered and named i call it artemisium i can produce it in the pure form abundantly enough to replace gold giving it the same relative value that gold possessed when it was the universal standard as dr syx spoke he snapped the cord with his thumbnail and it fluttered with quivering hues like a hummingbird hovering over a flower he seemed to await a reply and president boon asked what guarantee can you give that the supply would be adequate and continuous i will conduct a committee of this congress to my mine in the rocky mountains where in antici pation of the event i have accumulated enough re fined artemisiurn to provide every civilized land with an amount of coin equivalent to that which it form erly held in gold i can there satisfy you of my ability to maintain the production but how do we know that this metal of yours will answer the purpose try it was the laconic reply there is another difficulty pursued the presi dent people will not accept a new metal in place of gold unless they are convinced that it possesses equal intrinsic value they must first become famil iar with it and it must be abundant enough and de sirable enough to be used sparingly in the arts just as gold was i have provided for all that said the stranger with one of his disconcerting smiles i assure you that there will be no trouble with the people they will be only too eager to get and to use the metal let me show you he stepped to the door and immediately returned with two black attendants bearing a large tray filled with articles shaped from the same metal as that of which the card was composed the financiers all jumped to their feet with exclamations of surprise and admiration and gathered around the tray whose dazzling contents lighted up the corner of the room where it had been placed as if the moon were shining there the new metal artemisium there were elegantly formed vases adorned with artistic figures embossed and incised and glowing with delicate colors which shim mered in tiny waves with the slightest motion of the tray cups pins fingerrings earrings watch chains combs studs lockets medals tableware models of coinsâin brief almost every article in the fabrication of which precious metals have been em ployed was to be seen there in profusion and all composed of the strange new metal which everybody on the spot declared was far more splendid than gold do you think it will answer asked dr syx we do was the unanimous reply all then resumed their seats at the table the tray with its magnificent array having been placed in the centre of the board this display had a remarkable influence confidence awoke in the breasts of the financiers the dark clouds that had oppressed them rolled off and the prospect grew decidedly brighter what terms do you demand at length asked mr boon cheerfully rubbing his hands amazing stories i must have military protection for my mine and reducing works replied dr syx then i shall ask the return of one per cent on the circulat ing medium together with the privilege of dispos ing of a certain amount of the metalâto be limited by agreementâto the public for use in the arts of the proceeds of this sale i will pay ten per cent to the government in consideration of its protection but exclaimed president boon that will make you the richest man who ever lived undoubtedly was the reply why added mr boon opening his eyes wider as the facts continued to dawn upon him you will become the financial dictator of the whole earth undoubtedly again responded dr syx un moved that is what i purpose to become my discovery entitles me to no less but remember i place myself under government inspection and re striction i should not be allowed to flood the market even if i were disposed to do so but my own interest would restrain me it is to my ad vantage that artemisium once adopted shall re main stable in value a shadow of doubt suddenly crossed the presi dents face suppose your secret is discovered he said surely your mine will not remain the only one if you in so short a time have been able to accum ulate an immense quantity of the new metal it must be extremely abundant others will discover it and then where shall we be while mr boon uttered these words those who were watching dr syx as the president was not resembled persons whose startled eyes are fixed up on a wild beast preparing to spring as mr boon ceased speaking he turned towards the visitor and instantly his lips fell apart and his face paled dr syx the visitor is imperious dr syx had drawn himself up to his full stat ure and his features were distorted with that peculiar mocking smile which had now returned with a concentrated expression of mingled selfconfidence and disdain will you have relief or not he asked in a dry hard voice what can you do i alone possess the secret which can restore industry and commerce if you reject my offer do you think a second one will come president boon found voice to reply stammer ingly i did not mean to suggest a rejection of the of fer i only wished to inquire if you thought it probable that there would be no repetition of what occurred after gold was found at the south pole the earth may be full of my metal returned dr syx almost fiercely but so long as i alone possess the knowledge how to extract it is it of any more worth than common dirt but come he added after a pause and softening his manner i have other schemes will you as representatives of the leading nations undertake the introduction of artemisium as a substitute for gold or will you not can we not have time for deliberation asked president boon yes one hour within that time i shall return to learn your decision replied dr syx rising and preparing to depart i leave these things point ing to the tray in your keeping and significantly i trust your decision will be a wise one his curious smile again curved his lips and shot the ends of his mustache upward and the influence of that smile remained in the room when he bad closed the door behind him the financiers gazed at one another for several minutes in silence then they turned towards the coruscating metal that filled the tray chapter iii the teton mountains away on the western border of wyoming in the all but inaccessible heart of the rocky mountains three mighty brothers the big tetons look perpendicularly into the blue eye of jennys lake lying at the bottom of the profound depression among the mountains called jacksons hole bracing against one another for support these remarkable peaks lift their granite spires from to nearly feet into the blue dome that arches the crest of the continent their sides and especially those of their chief the grand teton are streaked with glaciers which shine like silver trap pings when the morning sun comes up above the wilderness of mountains stretching away eastward from the hole when the first white men penetrated this wonder ful region and one of them bestowed his wifes name upon jennys lake they were intimidated by the grand teton it made their flesh creep ac customed though they were to rough scrambling among mountain gorges and on the brows of im mense precipices when they glanced up the face of the peak where the cliffs fall one below another in a series of breathless descents and imagined themselves clinging for dear life to those skyey battlements but when in messrs stevenson and lang ford finally reached the top of the grand teton â the only successfu members of a party of nine practised climbers who had started together from the bottomâthey found there a little rectangular enclosure made by piling up rocks six or seven feet across and three feet in height bearing evidences of great age and indicating that the red indians had for some unknown purpose resorted to the summit of this tremendous peak long before the white men invaded their mountains yet neither the indians nor the whites ever really conquered the teton for above the highest point that they at tained rises a granite buttress whose smooth verti cal sides seemed to them to defy everything but wings winding across the sagecovered floor of jacksons hole runs the shoshone or snake river which takes its rise from jacksons lake at the northern end of the basin and then as if shrinking from the threatening brows of the tetons whose fall would block its progress makes a detour of one hundred miles around the buttressed heights of the range before it finds a clear way across idaho and so on to the columbia river and the pacific ocean the moon metal a visit to syxs works in the teton mountains on a july morning about a month after the visit of dr max syx to the assembled finan ciers in new york a party of twenty horse men following a mountaintrail arrived on the eastern margin of jacksons hole and pausing up on a commanding eminence with exclamations of wonder glanced across the great depression where lay the shining coils of the snake river at the tow ering forms of the tetons whose icestriped cliffs flashed lightnings in the sunshine even the im passive broncos that the party rode lifted their heads inquiringly and snorted as if in equine as tonishment at the magnificent spectacle one familiar with the place would have noticed something which to his mind would have seemed more surprising than the pageantry of the moun tains in their morning sunbath curling above one of the wild gorges that cut the lower slopes of the tetons was a thick black smoke which when lifted by a passing breeze obscured the precipices half way to the summit of the peak had the grand teton become a volcano cer tainly no hunting or exploring party could make a smoke like that but a word from the leader of the party of horsemen explained the mystery there is my mill and the mine is underneath it the speaker was dr syx and his companions were members of the financial congress when he quitted their presence in new york with the promise to return within an hour for their reply he had no doubt in his own mind what that reply would be he knew they would accept his proposi tion and they did no time was then lost in com municating with the various governments and ar rangements were quickly perfected whereby in case the inspection of dr syxs mine and its re sources proved satisfactory america and europe should unite in adopting the new metal as the basis of their coinage as soon as this stage in the nego tiations was reached it only remained to send a committee of financiers and metallurgists in com pany with dr syx to the rocky mountains they started under the doctors guidance completing the last stage of their journey on horseback an inspection of the records at washington dr syx continued addressing the horsemen will show that i have filed a claim covering ten acres of ground around the mouth of my mine this was done as soon as i had discovered the metal the fil ing of the claim and the subsequent proceedings which perfected my ownership attracted no atten tion because everybody was thinking of the south pole and it goldfields explaination from dr syx the party gathered closer around dr syx and listened to his words with silent atten tion while their horses rubbed noses and jingled their goldmounted trappings as soon as i had legally protected myself he continued i employed a force of men transported my machinery and material across the mountains erected my furnaces and opened the mine i was safe from intrusion and even from idle curiosity for the reason i have just mentioned in fact so exclusive was the attraction of the new goldfields that i had difficulty in obtaining workmen and finally i sent to africa and engaged negroes whom i placed in charge of trustworthy foremen ac cordingly with half a dozen exceptions you will see only black men act the mine and with their aid you have mined enough metal to supply the mints of the world asked president boon exactly so was the reply but i no longer employ the large force which i needed at first how much metal have you on hand i am aware that you have already answered this question during our preliminary negotiations but i ask it again for the benefit of some members o four party who were not present then i shall show youtoday said dr syx with his curious smile tons of refined artemisium stacked in rockcut vaults under the grand teton and you have dared to collect such inconceiv able wealth in one place you forget that it is not wealth until the people have learned to value it and the governments have put their stamp upon it true but how did you arrive at the proper mo ment easily i first ascertained that before the ant arctic discoveries the world contained altogether about tons of gold valued at per ton or worth all told now my metal weighs bulk for bulk onequarter as much as gold it might be reckoned at the same intrinsic value per ton but i have considered it preferable to take ad vantage of the smaller weight of the new metal which permits us to make coins of the same size as the old ones but only onequarter as heavy by giv ing to artemisium four times the value per ton that gold had thus only tons of the new metal are required to supply the place of the tons of gold the tons which i already have on hand are more than enough for coinage the rest i can supply as fast as needed the party did not wait for further explanations they were eager to see the wonderful mine and the store of treasure spurs were applied and they galloped down the steep trail forded the snake river and skirting the shore of jennys lake soon found themselves gazing up the headlong slopes and dizzy parapets of the grand teton dr syx led them by a steep ascent to the mouth of the canyon above one of whose walls stood his mill and where the champ champ of a powerful engine saluted their ears the wealth of the world an electric light shot its penetrating rays into a gallery cut through virgin rock and run ning straight towards the heart of the teton the centre of the gallery was occupied by a narrow railway on which a few flat cars propelled by elec tric power passed to and fro blackskinned and silent workmen rode on the cars both when they came laden with broken masses of rock from the farther end of the tunnel and when they returned empty suddenly to an eye situated a little way within the gallery appeared at the entrance the dark face of dr syx wearing its most discomposing smile amazing stories and a moment later the broader countenance of president boon loomed in the electric glare beside the doctors black framework of eyebrows and mustache behind them were grouped the other visiting financiers this tunnel said dr syx leads to the mine head where the orebearing rock is blasted as he spoke a hollow roar issued from the depths of the mountain followed in a short time by a gust of foul air you probably will not care to go in there said the doctor and in fact it is very uncomfortable but we shall follow the next carload to the smelter and you can witness the reduction of the ore accordingly when another car came rumbling out of the tunnel with its load of cracked rock they all accompanied it into an adjoining apartment where it was cast into a metallic shute through which they were informed it reached the furnace while it is melting explained dr syx certain elements the nature of which i must beg to keep secret are mixed with the ore causing chemical action which results in the extraction of the metal now let me show you pure artemisum issuing from the furnace the metal shown running from the furnace he led the visitors through two apartments into a third one side of which was walled by the front of a furnace from this pro jected two or three small spouts and iridescent streams of molten metal fell from the spouts into earthern receptacles from which the blazing liquid was led like flowing iron into a system of molds where it was allowed to cool and harden the financiers looked on wondering and their astonishment grew when they were conducted into the rockcut storerooms beneath where they saw metallic ingots glowing like gigantic opals in the light which dr syx turned on they were piled in rows along the walls as high as a man could reach a very brief inspection sufficed to convince the visitors that dr syx was able to perform all that he promised although they had not penetrated the secret of his process of reducing the ore yet they had seen the metal flowing from the furnace and the piles of ingots proved conclusively that he had uttered no vain boast when he said he could give the world a new coinage but president boon being himself a metallurgist desired to inspect the mysterious ore a little more closely possibly he was thinking that if another mine was destined to be discovered he might as well be the discoverer as anybody dr syx at tempted no concealment but his smile became more than usually scornful as he stopped a laden car and invited the visitors to help themselves i think he said that i have struck the only lode of this ore in the teton or possibly in this part of the world but i dont know for certain there may be plenty of it only waiting to be found that however doesnt trouble me the great point is that nobody except myself knows how to extract the metal mr boon closely examined the chunk of rock which he had taken from the car then he pulled a lens from his pocket with a deprecatory glance at dr syx oh thats all right said the latter with a laugh the first that these gentlemen had ever heard from his lips and it almost made them shudder put it to every test examine it with the micro scope with fire with electricity with the spectro scopeâin every way you can think of i assure you it is worth your while again dr syx uttered his freezing laugh pass ing into the familiar smile which had now become an undisguised mock upon my word said mr boon taking his eye from the lens i see no sign of any metal here look at the green specks cried the doctor snatching the specimen from the presidents hand thats it thats artemisium but its of no use unless you can get it out and purify it which is my secret dr syx laughs for the third time dr syx laughed and his merriment affected the visitors so disagree ably that they showed impatience to be gone immediately he changed his manner come into my office he said with a return to the graciousness which had characterized him ever since the party started from new york when they were all seated and the doctor had handed round a box of cigars he resumed the con versation in his most amiable manner you see gentlemen he said turning a piece of ore in his fingers artemisium is like aluminum it can only be obtained in the metallic form by a special process while these greenish particles which you may perhaps mistake for chrysolite or some similar silicate really contain the precious metal they are not entirely composed of it the process by which i separate out the metallic ele ment while the ore is passing through the furnace is in truth quite simple and its very simplicity guards my secret make your minds easy as to overproduction a man is as likely to jump over the moon as to find me out but he continued again changing his man ner we have had business enough for one day now for a little recreation while speaking the doctor pressed a button on his desk and the room which was illuminated by electric lampsâfor there were no windows in the buildingâsuddenly became dark except part of one wall where a broad area of light appeared dr syxs voice had become very soothing when next he spoke i am fond of amusing myself with a peculiar form of the magiclantern which i invented some years ago and which i have never exhibited except for the entertainment of my friends the pictures will appear upon the wall the apparatus being con cealed he had hardly ceased speaking when the il luminated space seemed to melt away leaving a great opening through which the spectators looked as if into another world on the opposite side of the wall for a minute or two they could not clearly discern what was presented then gradually the flitting scenes and figures became more distinct un til the lifelikeness of the spectacle absorbed their whole attention before them passed in panoramic review a the moon metal sunny land filled with brillianthued vegetation and dotted with villages and cities which were bright with lightcolored buildings people appear ed moving through the scenes as in a cinemeto graph exhibition but with infinitely more semblance of reality in fact the pictures blending one into another seemed to be life itself yet it was not an earthlike scene the colors of the passing land scape were such as no man in the room had ever beheld and the people tall roundlimbed with florid complexion golden hair and brilliant eyes and lips were indescribably beautiful and graceful in all their movements dr syxs movies from the land the view passed out to sea and bright blue waves edged with creaming foam ran swiftly under the spectators eyes and occasionally driven before light winds ap peared fleets of daintily shaped vessels which re minded the beholder by their flashing wings of the feigned ship of pearl after the fairy ships and breezy sea views came a long curving line of coast brilliant with coral sands and indented by frequent bays along whose enchanting shores lay pleasant towns the landscapes behind them splendid with groves meadows and streams presently the shifting photographic tape or what ever the mechanism may have been appeared to have settled upon a chosen scene and there it rest ed a broad champaign reached away to distant sapphire mountains while the foreground was oc cupied by a magnificent house resembling a large country villa fronted with a garden shaded by bowers and festoons of huge brilliant flowers birds of radiant plumage flitted among the trees and blossoms and then appeared a company of gayly attired people including many young girls who joined hands and danced in a ring apparently with shouts of laughter while a group of musicians standing near thrummed and blew upon curiously shaped instruments end of the movie show suddenly the shadow of a dense cloud flitted across the scene whereupon the brilliant birds flew away with screams of terror which almost seemed to reach the ears of the onlookers through the wall an expression of horror came over the faces of the people the children broke from their merry circle and ran for protection to their elders the utmost confusing and whelming terror were evidenced for a momentâthen the ground split asunder and the house and the garden with all their living occupants were swallowed by an awful chasm which opened just where they had stood the great rent ran in a widening line across the sunlit landscape until it reached the horizon when the distant mountains crumbled clouds poured in from all sides at once and billows of flame burst through them as they veiled the scene but in another instant the commotion was over and the world whose curious spectacles had been enacted as if on the other side of a window seemed to retreat swiftly into space until at last emerging from a fleecy cloud it reappeared in the form of the full moon hanging in the sky but larger than is its wont with its dry oceanbeds its keenspired peaks its ragged mountain ranges its gaping chasms its immense crater rings and tycho the chief of them all shooting raylike streaks across the scarred face of the abandoned lunar globe the show was ended and dr syx turning on only a partial illumination in the room rose slowly to his feet his tall form appearing strangely mag nified in the gloom and invited his bewildered guests to accompany him to his house outside the mill where he said dinner awaited them as they emerged into daylight they acted like persons just aroused from an opiate dream chapter iv wonders of the new metal within a twelvemonth after the visit of president boon and his fellowfinanciers to the mine in the grand teton a railway had been constructed from jacksons hole connecting with one of the pacific lines and the distribution of the new metal was begun all of dr syxs terms had been accepted united states troops occupied a permanent encampment on the upper waters of the snake river to afford protection and as the con signments of precious ingots were hurried east and west on guarded trains the mints all over the world resumed their activity once more a common mon etary standard prevailed and commerce revived as if touched by a magic wand artemisium quickly won its way in popular favor its matchless beauty alone was enough not only was it gladly accepted in the form of money but its success was instantaneous in the arts dr syx and the inspectors representing the various nations found it difficult to limit the output to the agreed upon amount the demand was incessant goldsmiths and jewellers continually discovered new excellencies in the wonderful metal its prop erties of translucence and refraction enabled skilful artists to perform marvels by suitable manage ment a chain of artemisium could be made to re semble a string of varicolored gems each separate link having a tint of its own while as the wearer moved delicate complementary colors chased one another in rapid undulation from end to end a fresh charm was added by the new metal to the personal adornment of women and an enhanced splendor to the pageants of society gold in its palmiest days had never enjoyed such a vogue a crowded receptionroom or a dinnerparty where artemisium abounded possessed an indescribable at mosphere of luxury and richness refined in quality yet captivating to every sense imaginative persons went so far as to aver that the sight and presence of the metal exercised a strangely soothing and dreamy power over the mind like the influence of moonlight streaming through the treetops on a still balmly night the public curiosity in regard to the origin of artemisium was boundless the various nations published official bulletins in which the general factsâomitting of course such incidents as the singular exhibition seen by the visiting financiers on the wall of dr syxs officeâwere detailed to gratify the universal desire for information president boon not only submitted the specimens amazing stories of orebearing rock which he had brought from the mine to careful analysis but also appealed to sev eral of the greatest living chemists and mineral ogists to aid him but they were all equally mysti fied the green substance contained in the ore al though differing slightly from ordinary chrysolite answered all the known tests of that mineral it was remembered however that dr syx had said that they would be likely to mistake the substance for chrysolite and the result of their experiments justified his prediction evidently the doctor had gone a stones east beyond the chemistry of the day and just as evidently he did not mean to reveal his discovery for the benefit of science nor for the benefit of any pockets except his own the extraction of the metal is an unsolvable mystery notwithstanding the failure of the chemists to extract anything front dr syxs ore the public at large never doubted that the secret would be discovered in good time and thousands of prospectors flocked to the teton moun tains in search of the ore and without much dif ficulty they found it evidently the doctor had been mistaken in thinking that his mine might be the only one the new miners hurried specimens of the greenspeckled rock to the chemical laboratories for experimentation and meanwhile began to lay up stores of the ore in anticipation of the time when the proper way to extract the metal should be dis covered but alas that time did not come the fresh ore proved to be as refractory as that which had been obtained from dr syx but in the midst of the universal disappointment there came a new sensation one morning the newspapers glared with a des patch from grand teton station announcing that the metal itself had been discovered by prospectors on the eastern slope of the main peak it outcrops in many places ran the despatch and many small nuggets have been picked out of crevices in the rocks the excitement produced by this news was even greater than when gold was discovered at the south pole again a mad rush was made for for tetons the heights around jacksons hol and the shores of jacksons and jennys lakes were quickly dotted with camps and the military force had to be doubled to keep off the curious and occasionally menacing crowds which gathered in the vicinity and seemed bent on unearthing the great secret locked behind the windowless walls of the mill where the column of black smoke and the roar of the engine served as reminders of the incredible wealth which the sole possessor of that secret was rolling up this time no mistake had been made it was a fact that the metal in virgin purity had been dis covered scattered in various places on the ledges of the grand teton in a little while thousands had obtained specimens with their own hands the quantity was distressingly small considering the number and the eagerness of the seekers but that it was genuine artemisium not even dr syx could have denied he however made no attempt to deny it yes he said when questioned i find that i have been deceived at first i thought the metal existed only in the form of the green ore but of late i have come upon veins of pure artemisium in my mine i am glad for your sakes but sorry for my own still it may turn out that there is no great amount of free artemisium after all the mountain is covered with prospectors while the doctor talked in this manner close observers detected a lurking sneer which his acquaintances had not noticed since arte misism was first adopted as the money basis of the world the crowd that swarmed upon the mountain quickly exhausted all of the visible supply of the metal sometimes they found it in a thin stratum at the bottom of crevices where it could be de tached in opalescent plates and leaves of the thick ness of paper these superficial deposits evidently might have been formed from water holding the metal in solution occasionally deep cracks con tained nuggets and wiry masses which looked as if they had run together when molten the most promising spots were soon staked out in miners claims machinery was procured stock companies were formed and borings were begun the enthusiasm arising from the earlier finds and the flattering surface indications caused everybody to work with feverish haste and energy and within two months one hundred tunnels were piercing the mountain for a long time nobody was willing to admit the truth which gradually forced itself upon the atten tion of the miners the deeper they went the scarc er became the indications of artemisium in fact such deposits as were found while confined to fis sures near the surface but dr syx continued to report a surprising increase in the amount of free metal in his mine and this encouraged all who had not exhausted their capital to push on their tunnels in the hope of finally striking a vein at length however the smaller operators gave up in despair until only one heavily capitalized company remained at work chapter v a strange discovery it is my belief that dr max syx is a deceiver the person who uttered this opinion was a young engineer andrew hall who had charge of the operations of one of the mining com panies which were driving tunnels into the grand teton what do you mean by that asked president boon who was the principal backer of the enter prise i mean replied hall that there is no free metal in this mountain and dr syx knows there is none but he is getting it himself from his mine re torted president boon so he says but who has seen it no one is ad mitted into the syx mine hi foremen are forbid den to talk and his workmen are specially import ed negroes who do not understand the english lan guage but persisted mr boon how then do you account for the nuggets scattered over the moun the moon metal tain and besides what object could dr syx have in pretending that there is free metal to be had for the digging he may have salted the mountain for all i know said hall as for his object i confess i am entirely in the dark but for all that i am convinced that we shall find no more metal if we dig ten miles for it nonsense said the president if we keep on we shall strike it did not dr syx himself admit that he found no free artemisium until his tunnel had reached the core of the peak we must go as deep as he has gone before we give up i fear the depths he attains are beyond most peoples reach was halls answer while a thought ful look crossed his clearcut brow but since you desire it of course the work shall go on i should like however to change the direction of the tun nel certainly replied mr boon bore in what ever direction you think proper only dont des pair about a month after this conversation andrew hall with whom a community of tastes in many things had made me intimately acquainted asked me one morning to accompany him into his tun nel i want to have a trusty friend at my elbow he said for unless i am a dreamer something re markable will happen within the next hour and two witnesses are better than one a friendly investigatorâandrew hall proposes to solve the mystery i knew hall was not the person to make such a remark carelessly and my curiosity was in tensely excited but knowing his peculiarities i did not press him for an explanation when we arrived at the head of the tunnel i was surprised at finding no workmen there i stopped blasting some time ago said half in explanation for a reason which i hope will be come evident to you very soon lately i have been boring very slowly and yesterday i paid off the men and dismissed them with the announcement which i am confident president boon will sanction after he hears by reports of this mornings work that the tunnel is abandoned you see i am now using a drill which i can manage without assis tance i believe the work is almost completed and i want you to witness the end of it he then carefully applied the drill which noise lessly screwed its nose into the rock when it had sunk to a depth of a few inches he withdrew it and taking a handdrill capable of making a hole not more than an eighth of an inch in diameter cautiously began boring in the centre of the larger cavity he had made hardly a hundred turns of the handle when the drill shot through the rock a gratified smile illuminated his features and he said in a suppressed voice dont be alarmed im going to put out the light instantly we were in complete darkness but be ing close at halls side i could detect his move ments he pulled out the drill and for half a min ute remained motionless as if listening there was no sound i must enlarge the opening he whispered and immediately the faint grating of a sharp tool cut ting through the rock informed me of his pro gress there at last he said i think that will do now for a look i could tell that he had placed his eye at the hole and was gazing with breathless attention presently he pulled my sleeve put your eye here he whispered pushing me into the proper position for looking through the hole looking through a peephole at first i could discern nothing except a smoky blue glow but soon my vision cleared a little and then i perceived that i was gazing into a narrow tunnel which met ours directly end to end glancing along the axis of this gallery i saw some two hundred yards away a faint light which evi dently indicated the mouth of the tunnel at the end where we had met it the mysterious tunnel was considerably widened at one side as if the excavators had started to change direction and then abandoned the work and in this elbow i could just see the outlines of two or three flat cars loaded with broken stone while a heap of the same ma terial lay near them through the centre of the tunnel ran a railway track do you know what you are looking at asked hall in my ear i begin to suspect i replied that you have ac cidentally run into dr syxs mine if dr syx had been on his guard this accident wouldnt have happened replied hall with an al most inaudible chuckle i heard you remark a month ago i said that you were changing the direction of your tunnel has this been the aims of your labors ever since discoveries under halls auspices you have hit it he replied long ago i i becairie convinced that my company was throwing away its money in a vain attempt to strike a lode of pure artemisium but president boon has great faith in dr syx and would hot give up the work so i adopted what i regarded as the only practical method of proving the truth of my opinion and saving the companys funds an electric indicater of my invention enabled me to locate the syx tunnel when i got near it and i have met it on end and opened this peephole in order to observe the doctors operations i feet that such spying is entirely justified in the circumstances although i cannot yet explain just how or why i feel sure that dr syx was the cause of the sudden discovery of the surface nuggets and that he has encouraged the miners for his own ends until he has brought ruin to thousands who have spent their last cent in driving useless tunnels into this mountain it is a righteous thing to expose him but i interposed i do not see that you have exposed anything yet except the interior of a tun nel you will see more clearly after a while was the reply hall now placed his eye again at the aperture and was unable entirely to repress the exclamation amazing stories that rose to his lips he remained staring through the hole for several minutes without uttering a word presently i noticed that the lenses of his eye were illuminated by a ray of light coming through the hole but he did not stir after a long inspection he suddenly applied his ear to the hole and listened intently for at least five minutes not a sound was audible to me but by an occasional pressure of the hand hall signified that some important disclosure was reaching his sense of hearing at length he removed his ear pardon me he whispered for keeping you so long in waiting but what i have just seen and over heard was of a nature to admit of no interruption he is still talking and by pressing your ear against the hole you may be able to catch what he says who is he look for yourself i placed my eye at the aperture and almost re coiled with the violence of my surprise the tun nel before me was brilliantly illuminated and with in three feet of the wall of rock behind which we crouched stood dr syx his dark profile looking al most satanic in the sharp contrast of light and shadow he was talking to one of his foremen and the two were the only visible occupants of the tun nel putting my ear to the little opening i heard his words distinctly âend of their rope well theyve spent a pretty lot of money for their experience and i rather think we shall not be troubled again by artemisium seekers for some time to come spying on dr syx the doctors voice ceased and instantly i clap ped my eye to the hole he had changed his position so that his black eyes now looked straight at the aperture my heart was in my mouth for at first i believed from his expression that he had detected the gleam of my eyeball but if so he probably mistook it for a bit of mica in the rock and paid no further attention then his lips moved and i put my ear again to the hole he seemed to be replying to a question that the fore man had asked if they do he said they will never guess the real secret thereupon he turned on his heel kicked a bit of rock off the track and strode away towards the en trance the foreman paused long enough to turn out the electric lamp and then followed the doctor well asked hall what have you heard i told him everything it fully corroborates the evidence of my own eyes and ears he remarked and we may count ourselves extremely lucky it is not likely that dr syx will be heard a second time proclaiming his de ception with his own lips it is plain that he was led to talk as he did to the foreman on account of the latters having informed him of the sudden dis charge of my men this morning their presence within earshot of our hidingplace during their conversation was of course pure accident and so you can see how kind fortune has been to us i expected to have to watch and listen and form de ductions for a week at least before getting the in formation which five lucky minutes have placed in our hands while he was speaking my companion busied himself in carefully plugging up the hole in the rock when it was closed to his satisfaction he turned on the light in our tunnel did you observe he asked that there was a second tunnel what do you say when the light was on in there i saw the mouth of a small tunnel entering the main one behind the cars on the right did you notice it oh yes i replied i did observe some kind of a dark hole there but i paid no attention to it be cause i was so absorbed in the doctor well rejoined hall smiling it was worth considerably more than a glance as a subject of thought i find it even more absorbing than dr syx did you see the track in it no i had to acknowledge i did not notice that but i continued a little piqued by his manner being a branch of the main tunnel i dont see any thing remarkable in its having a track also it was rather dim in that hole said hall still smiling in a somewhat provoking way but the railroad track was there plain enough and whether you think it remarkable or not i should like to lay you a wager that that track leads to a secret worth a dozen of the one we have just overheard my good friend i retorted still smarting a little i shall not presume to match my stupidity against your perspicacity i havent cats eyes in the dark hall immediately broke out laughing and slap ping me goodnaturedly on the shoulder exclaimed come come now if you go to kicking back at a fellow like that i shall be sorry i ever undertook this adventure chapter vi a mystery indeed when president boon had heard our story he promptly approved halls dismissal of the men he expressed great surprise that dr syx should have resorted to a deception which had been so disastrous to innocent people and at first he talked of legal proceedings but after thinking the matter over he concluded that syx was too powerful to be attacked with success especially when the only evidence against him was that he had claimed to find artemisium in his mine at a time when as everybody knew artemisium actually was found outside the mine there was no appar ent motive for the deception and no proof of ma licious intent in short mr boon decided that the best thing for him and his stockholders to do was to keep silent about their losses and await events and at halls suggestion he also determined to say nothing to anybody about the discovery he had made it could do no good said hall in making the suggestion and it might spoil a plan i have in mind what plan asked the president i prefer not to tell just yet was the reply i observed that in our interview with mr boon hall made no reference to the side tunnel to which he had appeared to attach so much importance and i concluded that he now regarded it as lacking sig nificance in this i was mistaken the moon metal a few days afterwards i received an invitation from hall to accompany him once more into the abandoned tunnel i have found out what that sidetrack means he said and it has plunged me into another mys tery so dark and profound that i cannot see my way through it i must beg you to say no word to any one concerning the thing i am about to show you i gave the required promise and we entered the tunnel which nobody had visited since our former adventure having extinguished our lamp my companion opened the peephole and a thin ray of light streamed through from the tunnel on the op posite side of the wall he applied hia eye to the hole yes he said quickly stepping back and push ing me into his place they are still at it look and tell me what you see i see i replied after placing my eye at the aperture a gang of men unloading a car which has just come out of the side tunnel and putting its contents upon another car standing on the track of the main tunnel yes and what are they handling why ore of course and do you see nothing significant in that to be sure i exclaimed why that oreâ hush hush admonished hall putting his hand over my mouth dont talk so loud now go on in a whisper the ore i resumed may have come back from the furnaceroom because the side tunnel turns off so as to run parallel with the other it not only may have come back it actually has come back said hall how can you be sure because i have been over the track and know that it leads to a secret apartment directly under the furnace in which dr syx pretends to melt the ore for a minute after hearing this avowal i was speechless are you serious i asked at length dr syx is a systematic deceiver perfectly serious run your finger along the rock here do you perceive a seam two days ago after seeing what you have just witnessed in the syx tunnel i carefully cut out a section of the wall making an aperture large enough to crawl through and when i knew the workmen were asleep i crept in there and examined both tunnels from end to end but in solving one mystery i have run myself into another infinitely more perplexing how is that why does dr syx take such elaborate pains to deceive his visitors and also the government of ficers it is now plain that he conducts no min ing operations whatever this mine of his is a gigantic blind whenever inspectors or scientific curiosity seekers visit his mill his mute workmen assume the air of being very busy the cars laden with his socalled ore rumble out of the tunnel and their contents are ostentatiously poured into the furnace or appear to be poured into it really dropping into a receptacle beneath to be carried back into the mine again and then the doctor leads his gulled visitors around to the other side of the furnace and shows them the molten metal coming out in streams now what does it all mean thats what id like to find out whats his game for mark you if he doesnt get artemisium from this pretended ore he gets it from some other source and right on this spot too there is no doubt about that the whole world is supplied by syxs furnace and syx feeds his furnace with something that comes from his ten acres of grand teton rock what is that something how does he get it and where does he hide it these are the things i should like to find out well i replied i fear i cant help you but the difference between you and me he re torted is that you can go to sleep over it while i shall never get another good nights rest so long as this black mystery remains unsolved what will you do i dont know exactly what but ive got a dim idea which may take shape after a while hall was silent for some time then he suddenly asked did you ever hear of that queer magiclantern show with which dr syx entertained mr boon and the members of the financial commission in the early days of the artemisium business yes ive heard the story but i dont think it was ever made public the newspapers never got hold of it no i believe not odd thing wasnt it why yes very odd but just like the doctors eccentric ways though hes always doing some thing to astonish somebody without any apparent earthly reason but what put you in mind of that free artemisium put me in mind of it replied hall quizzically i dont see the connection im not sure that i do either but when you are dealing with dr syx nothing is too improbable to be thought of andrew hall is meditating hall thereupon fell to musing again while we returned to the entrance of the tunnel after he had made everything secure and slipped the key into his pocket my companion re marked dont you think it would be best to keep this latest discovery to ourselves certainly because he continued nobody would be bene fitted just now by knowing what we know and to expose the worthlessness of the ore might cause a panic the public is a queer animal and never gets scared at just the thing you expect will alarm it but always at something else we had shaken hands and were separating when hall stopped me do you believe in alchemy he asked thats an odd question from you i replied i thought alchemy was exploded long ago well he said slowly i suppose it has been exploded but then you know an explosion may sometimes be a kind of instantaneous education breaking up old things but revealing new ones amazing stories chapter vii the age of artemisium important business called me east soon after the meeting with hall described in the forego ing chapter and before i again saw the grand teton very stirring events had taken place as the reader is aware dr syxs agreement with the various governments limited the output of his mine an international commission contin ually in session in new york adjusted the differ ences arising among the nations concerning finan cial affairs and allotted to each the proper amount of artemisium for coinage of course this amount varied from time to time but a fair average could easily be maintained the gradual increase of wealth in houses machinery manufactured and artistic products called for a corresponding in crease in the circulating medium but this too was easily provided for an equally painstaking super vision was exerciscd over the amount of the prec ious metal which dr syx was permitted to supply to the markets for use in the arts on this side also the demand gradually increased but the wonderful teton mine seemed equal to all calls upon its resources after the failure of the mining operations there was a moderate revival of the efforts to reduce the teton ore but no success cheered the experiment ers prospectors also wandered all over the earth looking for pure artemisium but in vain the gen eral public knowing nothing of what hall had dis covered and still believing syxs story that he also had found pure artemisium in his mine accounted for the failure of the tunnelling operations on the supposition that the metal in a free state was ex cessively rare and that dr syx had had the luck to strike the only vein of it that the grand teton contained as if to give countenance to this opin ion dr syx now announced in the most public manner that he had been deceived again and that the vein of free metal he had struck being eshausted no other had appeared accordingly he said he must henceforth rely exclusively as in the begin ning upon reduction of the ore artemisium had proved itself an immense boon to mankind and the new era of commercial pros perity which it had ushered in already exceeded everything that the world had known in the past schoolchildren learned that human civilization had taken five great strides known respectively begin ning at the bottom as the age of stone the age of bronze the age of iron the age of gold and the age of artemisium the mobs object to the restriction of the worlds currencies nevertheless sources of dissatisfaction finally began to appear and after the na ture of such things they developed with marvellous rapidity people began to grumble about contraction of the currency in every coun try there arose a party which demanded free money demagogues pointed to the brief reign of paper money after the demonetization of gold as a happy period when the people had enjoyed their rights and the money baronsâborrowing a term from nineteenthcentury historyâwere kept at bay then came denunciations of the international commission for restricting the coinage dr syx was described as a devilfish sucking the veins of the planet and holding it helpless in the grasp of his tentacular billions in the united states meet ings of agitators passed furious resolutions de nouncing the government assailing the rich curs ing dr syx and calling upon the oppressed to rise and take their own the final outcome was of course violence mobs had to be suppressed by military force but the most dramatic scene in the tragedy occurred at the grand teton excited by inflammatory speeches and printed documents sev eral thousand armed men assembled in the neighbor hood of jennys lake and prepared to attack the syx mine for some reason the military guard had been depleted and the mob under the leadership of a man named bings who showed no little talent as a commander and strategist surprised the small force of soldiers and locked them up in their own guardhouse telegraphic communication having been cut off by the astute bings a fierce attack was made on the mine the assailants swarmed up the sides of the canyon and attempted to break in through the foundation of the buildings but the masonry was stronger than they had anticipated and the attack failed sharpshooters then climbed the neighbor ing heights and kept up an incessant peppering of the walls with conical bullets driven at four thous and feet per second no reply come from the gloomy structure the huge column of black smoke rose uninterruptedly into the sky and the noise of the great engine never ceased for an instant the mob gathered closer on all sides and redoubled the fire of the rifles to which was now added the belching of several ma chineguns ragged holes began to appear in the walls and at the sight of these the assailants yelled with delight it was evident that the mill could not long withstand so destructive a bombardment if the besiegers had possessed artillery they would have knocked the buildings into splinters within twenty minutes as it was they would need a whole day to win their victory a riot and an attack on the mill of dr syx suddenly it became evident that the be sieged were about to take a hand in the fight thus far they had not shown themselves or fired a shot but now a movement was perceived on the roof and the projecting arms of some kind of machinery became visible many marksmen con centrated their fire upon the mysterious objects but apparently with little effect bings mounted on a rock so as to command a clear view of the field was on the point of ordering a party to rush forward with axes and beat down the formidable doors when there came a blinding flash from the roof something swished through the air and a gust of heat met the assailants in the face bings dropped dead from his perch and then as if the scythe of the destroyer had swung downward and to the right and left in quick succession the close packed mob was levelled rank after rank until the few survivors crept behind rocks for refuge instantly the atmospheric broom swept up and down the canyon and across the mountains flanks the moon metal and the marksmen fell in bunches like shaken grapes ninetenths of the besiegers were destroyed within ten minutes after the first movement had been noticed on the roof those who survived owed their escape to the rocks which concealed them and they lost no time in crawling off into neighboring chasms and as soon as they were beyond eyeshot from the mill they fled with panic speed then the towering form of dr syx appeared at the door emerging without sign of fear or exciter ment he picked his way among his fallen enemies and approaching the military guardhouse undid the fastening and set the imprisoned soldiers free i think i am paying rather dear for my whistle he said with a characteristic sneer to captain carter the commander of the troop it seems that i must not only defend my own people and property when attacked by mob force but must also come to the rescue of the soldiers whose payrolls are met from my pocket the captain made no reply and dr syx strode back to the works when the released soldiers saw what had occurred their amazement had no bounds it was necessary at once to dispose of the dead and this was no easy undertaking for their small force however they accomplished it and at the begin ning of their work made a most surprising discov ery hows this jim said one of the men to his comrade as they stooped to lift the nearest victim of dr syxs withering fire whats this fellow got all over him artemisium pon my soul responded jim staring at the body hes all coated over with it end of the riot immediately from all sides came similar exclamations every man who had fallen was covered with a film of the precious metal as if he had been dipped into an electrolytic bath cloth ing seemed to have been charred and the metallic atoms had penetrated the flesh of the victims the rocks all around the battlefield were similarly ve neered it looks to me said captain carter as if old syx had turned one of his spouts of artemisium into a hosepipe and soaked em with it thats it chimed in a lieutenant thats ex actly what hes done well returned the captain if he can do that i dont see what use hes got for us here probably he dont want to waste the stuff said the lieutenant what do you suppose it cost him to plate this crowd i guess a months pay for the whole troop wouldnt cover the expense its costly but thenâ gracious wouldnt i have given something for the doctors hose when i was a youngster campaigning in the philippines in the story of the marvellous way in which dr syx defended his mill became the sensation of the world for many days the hosepipe theory struck off on the spot by captain carter seized the popu lar fancy and was generally accepted without fur ther question there was an element of the ludicrous which robbed the tragedy of some of its horror moreover no one could deny that dr syx was well within his rights in defending himself by any means when so savagely attacked and his triumph ant success no less than the ingenuity which was supposed to underlie it placed him in an heroic light which he had not hitherto enjoyed as to the demagogues who were responsible for the outbreak and its terrible consequences they slunk out of the public eye and the result of the battle at the mine seemed to have been a clearing up of the atmosphere such as a thunderstorm effects at the close of a season of foul weather but now little as men guessed it the beginning of the end was close at hand chapter viii the detective of science the morning of my arrival at grand teton station on my return from the east an drew hall met me with a warm greeting i have been anxiously expecting you he said for i have made some progress towards solving the great mystery i have not yet reached a con clusion but i hope soon to let you into the entire secret in the meantime you can aid me with your companionship if in no other way for since the defeat of the mob this place has been mighty lone some the grand teton is a spot that people who have no particular business out here carefully avoid i am on speaking terms with dr syx and occasionally when there is a party to be shown around i visit his works and make the best pos sible use of my eyes captain carter of the military is a capital fellow and i like to hear his stories of the war in luzon forty years ago but i want some body to whom i can occasionally confide things and so you are as welcome as moonlight in harvest time tell me something about that wonderful fight with the mob did you see it i did i had got wind of what bings intended to do while i was down at pocotello and i hurried up here to warn the soldiers but unfortunately i came too late finding the military cooped up in the guardhouse and the mob masters of the situation i kept out of sight on the side of the teton and watched the siege with my binocular i think there was very little of the spectacle that i missed what of the mysterious force that the doctor employed to sweep off the assailants of course captain carters suggestion that syx turned molten artemisium from his furnace into a hosepipe and sprayed the enemy with it is ridicu lous but it is much easier to dismiss carters theory than to substitute a better one i saw the doctor on the roof with a gang of black workmen and i noticed the flash of polished metal turned rapidly this way and that but there was some in tervening obstacle which prevented me from getting a good view of the mechanism employed it cer tainly bore no resemblance to a hosepipe or any thing of that kind no emanation was visible from the maehine but it was stupefying to see the mob melt down how about the coating of the bodies with arte misium there you are back on the hosepipe again laughed hall but to tell you the truth id rather be excused from expressing an opinion on that op amazing stories eration in wholesale electroplating just at present ive the ghost of an idea what it means but let me test my theory a little before i formulate it in the meanwhile wont you take a stroll with me certainly nothing could please me better i replied which way shall we go to the top of the grand teton what are you seized with the mountainclimb ing fever not exactly but i have a particular reason for wishing to take a look from that pinnacle i suppose you know the real apex of the peak has never been trodden by man i do know it but it is just that apex that i am determined to have under my feet for ten minutes the failure of others is no argument for us just as you say i rejoined but i suppose there is no indiscretion in asking whether this little climb has any relation to the mystery if it didnt have an important relation to the clearing up of that dark thing i wouldnt risk my neck in such an undertaking was the reply wandering over the great teton peak accordingly the next morning we set out for the peak all previous climbers as we were aware had attacked it from the west that seemed the obvious thing to do because the westward slopes of the mountain while very steep are less abrupt than those which face the rising sun in fact the eastern side of the grand teton ap pears to be absolutely unclimable but both hall and i had had experience with rock climbing in the alps and the dolomites and we knew that what looked like the hardest places sometimes turn out to be next to the easiest accordingly we decided the more particularly because it would save time but also because we yielded to the common desire to outdo our predecessorsâto try to scale the giant right up his face we carried a very light but exceedingly strong rope about five hundred feet long wore nailshod shoes and had each a metalpointed staff and a small hatchet in lieu of the regular mountaineers axe advancing at first along the broken ridge be tween two gorges we gradually approached the steeper part of the teton where the cliffs looked so sheer and smooth that it seemed no wonder that no body had ever tried to scale them the air was de liciously clear and the sky wonderfully blue above the mountains and the moon a few days past its last quarter was visible in the southwest its pale crescent face slightly blued by the atmosphere as it always appears when seen in daylight slow westering a phantom sailâ the lonely soul of yesterday behind us somewhat north of east lay the syx works with their black smoke rising almost vertic ally in the still air suddenly as we stumbled along on the rough surface something whizzed past my face and fell on the rock at my feet i looked at the strange missile that had come like a meteor out of open space with astonishment it was a bird a beautiful specimen of the scarlet tanagers which i remembered the early explorers had found inhabiting the teton canyons their brill iant plumage borrowing splendor from contrast with the gloomy surroundings it lay motionless its outstretched wings having a curious shrivelled aspect while the flaming color of the breast was half obliterated with smutty patches stooping to pick it up i noticed a slight bronzing which in stantly recalled to my mind the peculiar appearance of the victims of the attack on the mine look here i called to hall who was several yards in advance he turned and i held up the bird by a wing where did you get that he asked it fell at my feet a moment ago hall glanced in a startled manner at the sky and then down the slope of the mountain did you notice in what direction it was flying he asked no it dropped so close that it almost grazed my nose i saw nothing of it until it made me blink andrew hall does not tell everything i have been heedless muttered hall under his breath at the time i did not notice the singularity of his remark my attention being absorbed in contemplating the unfortunate tanager look how its feathers are scorched i said i know it hall replied without glancing at the bird and it is covered with a film of artemisium i added a little piqued by his abstraction i know that too see here hall i exclaimed are you trying to make game of me not at all my dear fellow he replied dropping his cogitation pray forgive me but this is no new phenomenon to me i have picked up birds in that condition on this mountain before there is a terrible mystery here but i am slowly letting light into it and if we succeed in reaching the top of the peak i have good hope that the illumination will increase here now he added a moment later sitting down upon a rock and thrusting the blade of his penknife into a crevice what do you think of this he held up a little nugget of pure artemisium and then went on you know that all this slope was swept as clean as a dutch housewifes kitchen floor by the thous ands of miners and prospectors who swarmed over it a year or two ago and do you suppose they would have missed such a tidbit if it had been here then dr syx must have been salting the mountain again i suggested well replied hall with a significant smile if the doctor hasnt salted it somebody else has thats plain enough but perhaps you would like to know precisely what i expect to find out when we get on the topknot of the teton i should certainly be delighted to learn the ob ject of our journey i said of course im only go ing along for company and for the fun of the thing but you know you can count on me for substantial aid whenever you need it it is because you are so willing to let me keep my own counsel he rejoined and to wait for things to ripen before compelling me to disclose them that i like to have you with me at critical times now as to the object of this breakneck the moon metal expedition whose risks you understand as fully as i do i need not assure you that it is of supreme importance to the success of my plans in a word i hope to be able to look down into a part of dr syxs mill which if i am not mistaken no human eye except his and those of his most trustworthy helpers has even been permitted to see and if i see there what i fully expect to see i shall have got a long step nearer to a great fortune good i cried en avant then we are los ing time chapter ix the top of the grand teton the climbing soon became difficult until at length we were going up hand over hand taking advantage of crevices and knobs which an inexperienced eye would have regarded as incapable of affording a grip for the fingers or a support for the toes presently we arrived at the foot of a stupendous precipice which was absolutely insurmountable by any ordinary method of ascent parts of it overhung and everywhere the face of the rock was too free from irregularities to afford any footing except to a fly now to borrow the expression of old bunyan we are hard put to it i remarked if you will go to the left i will take the right and see if there is any chance of getting up i dont believe we could find any place easier than this hall replied and so up we go where we are have you a pair of wings concealed about you i asked laughing at his folly well something nearly as good he responded unstrapping his knapsack he produced a silken bag which he unfolded on the rock a balloon i exclaimed but how are you going to inflate it for reply hall showed me a receptacle which he said contained liquid hydrogen and which was furnished with a device for retarding the volatiliza tion of the liquid so that it could be carried with little loss you remember i have a small laboratory in the abandoned mine he explained where we used to manufacture liquid air for blasting this balloon i made for our present purpose it will just suf fice to carry up our rope and a small but practically unbreakable grapple of hardened gold i calculate to send the grapple to the top of the precipice with the balloon and when it has obtained a firm hold in the riven rock there we can ascend sailor fashion you see the rope has knots and i know your muscles are as trustworthy in such work as my own there was a slight breeze from the eastward and the current of air slanting up the face of the peak assisted the balloon in mounting with its burden and favored us by promptly swinging the little air ship with the grapple swaying beneath it over the brow of the cliff into the atmospheric eddy above as soon as we saw that the grapple was well over the edge we pulled upon the rope the balloon in stantly shot into view with the anchor dancing but under the influence of the wind quickly re turned to its former position behind the projecting brink the grapple had failed to take hold try try again must be our motto now mut tered hall we tried several times with the same result al though each time we slightly shifted our position at last the grapple caught now all together cried my companion and simultaneously we threw our weight upon the slender rope the anchor apparently did not give an inch let me go first said hall pushing me aside as i caught the first knot above my head its my de vice and its only fair that i should have the first try climbing teton peak and trying for its summit in a minute he was many feet up the wall climb ing swiftly hand over hand but occasionally stopping and twisting his leg around the rope while he took breath its easier than i expected he called down when he had ascended about one hundred feet here and there the rock offers a little hold for the knees i watched him breathless with anxiety and as he got higher my imagination pictured the little gold grapple invisible above the brow of the preci pice with perhaps a single thin prong wedged into a crevice and slowly ploughing its way towards the edge with each impulse of the climber until but an other pull was needed to set it flying so vivid was my fancy that i tried to banish it by noticing that a certain knot in the rope remained just at the level of my eyes where it had been from the start hall was now fully two hundred feet above the ledge on which i stood and was rapidly nearing the top of the precipice in a minute more he would be safe suddenly he shouted and glancing up with a leap of the heart i saw that he was falling he kept his face to the rock and came down feet foremost it would be useless to attempt any description of my feelings i would not go through that experience again for the price of a battleship yet it lasted less than a second he had dropped not more than ten feet when the fall was arrested all right he called cheerily no harm done it was only a slip but what a slip if the balloon had not carried the anchor several yards back from the edge it would have had no opportunity to catch another hold as it shot forward and how could we know that the second hold would prove more secure than the first hall did not hesitate however for one instant up he went again but in fact his best chance was in going up for he was within four yards of the top when the mishap occurred with a sigh of relief i saw him at last throw his arm over the verge and then wriggle his body upon the ledge a few seconds later he was lying on his stomach with his face over the edge looking down at me come on he shouted its all right when i had pulled myself over the brink at his side i grasped his hand and pressed it without a word we understand one another it was pretty close to a miracle he remarked at last look at this the rock over which the grapple had slipped was deeply scored by the unyielding point of the metal and exactly at the verge of the precipice the prong had wedged itself into a narrow crack so firmly that we had to chip away the stone in order to re lease it if it had slipped a single inch farther be amazing stories fore taking hold it would have been all over with my friend the summit attained by the two explorers such experiences shake the strongest nerves and we sat on the shelf we had attained for fully a quarter of an hour before we ventured to attack the next precipice which hung beetling directly above us it was not as lofty as the one we had just ascended but it impended to such a de gree that we saw we should have to climb our rope while it swung free in the air luckily we had little difficulty in getting a grip for the prongs and we took every precaution to test the security of the anchorage not only putting our combined weight repeatedly upon the rope but flipping and jerking it with all our strength the grapple resisted every effort to dislodge it and finally i started up insisting on my turn as leader the height i had to ascend did not exceed one hundred feet but that is a very great distance to climb on a swinging rope without a wall within reach to assist by its friction and occasional friendly projections in a little while my movements to gether with the effect of the slight wind had im parted a most distressing oscillation to the rope this sometimes carried me with a nerveshaking bang against a prominent point of the precipice where i would dislodge loose fragments that kept hall dodging for his life and then i would swing out apparently beyond the brow of the cliff below so that as i involuntarily glanced downward i seemed to be hanging in free space while the steep mountainside looking ten times steeper than it really was resembled the vertical wall of an ab solutely bottomless abyss as if i were suspended over the edge of the world i avoided thinking of what the grapple might be about and in my haste to get through with the awful experience i worked myself fairly out of breath so that when at last i reached the rounded brow of the cliff i had to stop and cling there for fully a minute before i could summon strength enough to lift myself over it when i was assured that the grapple was still securely fastened i signalled to hall and he soon stood at my side exclaiming as he wiped the perspiration from his face i think ill try wings next time but our difficulties had only begun as we had foreseen it was a case of alp above alp to the very limit of human strength and patience however it would have been impossible to go back in order to descend the two precipices we had surmounted it would have been necessary to leave our lifelines clinging to the rocks and we had not rope enough to do that if we could not reach the top we were lost a view from the summit and spying on dr syx having refreshed ourselves with a bite to eat and a little stimulant we resumed the climb after several hours of the most ex hausting work i have ever performed we pulled our weary limbs upon the narrow ridge but a few square yards in area which constitutes the apex of the grand teton a little below on the opposite side of a steepwalled gap which divides the top of the mountain into two parts we saw the singular en closure of stones which the early white explorers found there and which they ascribed to the in dians although nobody has ever known who built it or what purpose it served the view was of course superb but while i was admiring it in all its wonderful extent and variety hall who had immediately pulled out his binocular was busy inspecting the syx works the top of whose great tufted smoke column was thousands of feet beneath our level jacksons lake jennys lake leighs lake and several lakelets glittered in the sunlight amid the pale grays and greens of jack sons hole while many a bending reach of the snake river shone amid the wastes of sagebrush and rock there suddenly exclaimed hall i thought i should find it what take a look through my glass at the roof of syxs mill look just in the centre why its open in the middle i cried as soon as i had put the glass to my eyes theres a big cir cular hole in the centre of the roof look inside look inside repeated hall im patiently i see nothing there except something bright do you call it nothing because it is bright well no i replied laughing what i mean is that i see nothing that i can make anything of ex cept a shining object and all i can make of that is that it is bright youve been in the syx works many times havent you yes did you ever see the opening in the roof never then dr syx doesnt show his visitors every thing that is to be seen evidently not since as we know he concealed the double tunnel and the room under the fur nace dr syx an alchemist dr syx has concealed a bigger secret than that hall responded and the grand teton has helped me to a glimpse of it for several minutes my friend was absorbed in thought then he broke out i tell you hes the most wonderful man in the world who dr syx well ive long thought that yes but i mean in a different way from what you are thinking of do you remember my asking you once if you believed in alchemy i remember being greatly surprised by your question to that effect well now said hall rubbing his hands with a satisfied air while his eyes glanced keen and bright with the reflection of some passing thought max syx is greater than any alchemist that ever lived if those old fellows in the dark ages had accom plished everything they set out to do they would have been of no more consequence in comparison with our blackbrowed friend down yonder thanâ than my head is of consequence in comparison with the moon the moon metal i fear you flatter the man in the moon was my laughing reply no i dont returned hall and some day youll admit it well what about that something that shines down there you seem to see more in it than i can dr syx is suspicious about the climb to the summit but my companion had fallen into a reverie and didnt hear my question he was gazing abstractedly at the faint image of the wan dering moon now nearing the mountaintop in the distance presently his mind seemed to return to the old magnet and he whirled about and glanced down at the syx mill the column of smoke was diminishing in volume an indication that the en gine was about to enjoy one of its periodical rests the irregularity of these stoppages had always been a subject of remark among practical engineers the hours of labor were exceedingly erratic but the engine had never been known to work at night ex cept on one occasion and then only for a few min utes when it was suddenly stopped on account of a fire just as hall resumed his inspection two huge quarter spheres which had been resting wide apart on the roof moved towards one another until their arched sections met over the circular aperture which they covered like the dome of an observatory i expected it hall remarked but come it is midafternoon and we shall need all of our time to get safely down before the light fades dr syx speaks to them as i have already explained it would not have been possible for us to return the way we came we determined to descend the com paratively easy western slopes of the peak and pass the night on that side of the mountain letting our selves down with the rope into the hollow way that divides the summit of the teton into two pinnacles we had no difficulty in descending by the route fol lowed by all previous climbers the weather was fine and having found good shelter among the rocks we passed the night in comfort the next day we succeeded in swinging round upon the eastern flank of the teton below the more formidable cliffs and just at nightfall we arrived at the station as we passed the syx mine the doctor himself con fronted us there was a very displeasing look on his dark countenance and his sneer was strongly marked so you have been on top of the teton he said yes replied hall very blandly and if you have a taste for that sort of thing i should advise you to go up the view is immense as fine as the best in the alps pretty ingenious plan that balloon of yours continued the doctor still looking black thank you hall replied more suavely than ever ive been planning that a long time you probably dont know that mountaineering used to be my chief amusement the doctor turned away without pursuing the conversation i could kick myself hall muttered as soon as dr syx was out of earshot if my absurd wish to outdo others had not blinded me i should havo known that he would see us going up this side of the peak particularly with the balloon to give us away however whats done cant be undone he may not really suspect the truth and if he does he cant help himself even though he is the richest man in the world strange fate of a kite are you ready for another tramp was andrew halls greeting when we met early on the morning following our return from the peak certainly i am what is your programme for today i wish to test the flying qualities of a kite which i have constructed since our return last night you dont allow the calls of sleep to interfere very much with your activity i havent much time for sleep just now replied hall without smiling the kite test will carry us up the flanks of the teton but i am not going to try for the top this time if you will come along ill ask you to help me by carrying and operating a light transit i shall carry another myself i am desirous to get the elevation that the kite attains and certain other data that will be of use to me we will make a detour towards the south for i dont want old syxs suspicions to be prodded any more what interest can he have in your kiteflying the same interest that a burglar has in the rap of a policemans nightstick then your experiment today has some connec tion with the solution of the great mystery my dear fellow said hall laying his hand on my shoulder until i see the end of that mystery i shall think of nothing else in a few hours we were clambering over the broken rocks on the southeastern flank of the teton at an elevation of about three thousand feet above the level of jacksons hole finally hall paused and began to put his kite together it was a small box shaped affair very light in construction with paper sides in order to diminish the chances of dr syx noticing what we are about he said as he worked away i have covered the kite with skyblue paper this together with distance will probably insure us against his notice in a few minutes the kite was ready having ascertained the direction of the wind with much attention he stationed me with my transit on a commanding rock and sought another post for him self at a distance of two hundred yards which he carefully measured with a gold tape my instruc tions were to keep the telescope on the kite as soon as it had attained a considerable height and to note the angle of elevation and the horizontal angle with the base line joining our points of observation be particularly careful was halls injunction and if anything happens to the kite by all means note the angles at that instant as soon as we had fixed our stations hall began to pay out the string and the kite rose very swiftly as it sped away into the blue it was soon practi cally invisible to the naked eye although the tele scope of the transit enabled me to follow it with ease amazing stories aerial trigonometryâhall reticent glancing across now and then at my com panion i noticed that he was having con siderable difficulty in at the same time man aging the kite and manipulating his transit but as the kite continued to rise and steadied in posi tion his task became easier until at length he ceased to remove his eye from the telescope while holding the string with outstretched hand dont lose sight of it now for an instant he shouted for at least half an hour he continued to manipu late the string sending the kite now high towards the zenith with a sudden pull and then letting it drift off it seemed at last to become almost a fixed point very slowly the angles changed when sud denly there was a flash and to my amazement i saw the paper of the kite shrivel and disappear in a momentary flame and then the bare sticks came tumbling out of the sky did you get the angles yelled hall excitedly yes the telescope is still pointed on the spot where the kite disappeared read them off he called and then get your angle with syx works all right i replied doing as he had requested and noticing at the same time that he was in the act of putting his watch in his pocket is there anything else i asked no that will do thank you hall came running over his face beaming and with the air of a man who has just hooked a par ticularly cunning old trout ah he exclaimed this has been a great suc cess i could almost dispense with the calculation but it is best to be sure what are you about anyhow i asked and what was it that happened to the kite dont interrupt me just now please was the only reply i received mr hall decides to try alchemy too thereupon my friend sat down on a rock pulled out a pad of paper noted the angles which i had read on the transit and fell to figuring with feverish haste in the course of his work he consulted a pocket almanac then glanced up at the sky muttered approvingly and finally leaped to his feet with a halfsuppressed hurrah if i had not known him so well i should have thought that he had gone daft will you kindly tell me i asked how you managed to set the kite afire hall laughed heartily you thought it was a trick did you said he well it was no trick but a very beautiful demonstration you surely havent forgotten the scarlet tanager that gave you such a surprise the day before yesterday do you mean i exclaimed startled at the sug gestion that the fate of the bird had any connec tion with the accident to your kite accident isnt precisely the right word replied hall the two things are as intimately related as own brothers if you should care to hunt up the kite sticks you would find that they too are now artemisium plated this is getting too deep for me was all that i could say i am not absolutely confident that i have touched bottom myself said hall but im going to make another dive and if i dont bring up treas ures greater than vanderdecken found at the bot tom of the sea then dr syx is even a more won derful human mystery than i have thought him to be what do you propose to do next to shake the dust of the grand teton from my shoes and go to san francisco where i have an extensive laboratory so you are going to try a little alchemy your self are you perhaps who knows at any rate my good friend i am forever indebted to you for your assistance and even more for your discretion and if i succeed you shall be the first person in the world to hear the news chapter x better than alchemy i come now to a part of my narrative which would have been deemed altogether incredible in those closing years of the nineteenth cen tury that witnessed the first steps towards the solution of the deepest mysteries of the ether al though men even then held in their hands without knowing it powers which after they had been mastered and before use had made them familiar seemed no less than godlike for six months after halls departure for san francisco i heard nothing from him notwith standing my intense desire to know what he was doing i did not seek to disturb him in his retire ment in the meantime things ran on as usual in the world only a ripple being caused by renewed discoveries of small nuggets of artemisium on the tetons a fact which recalled to my mind the re mark of my friend when he dislodged a flake of the metal from a crevice during our ascent of the peak at last one day i received this telegram at my office in new york san francisco may come at once the mystery is solved signed hall as soon as i could pack a grip i was flying west ward one hundred miles an hour on reaching san francisco which had made enoromus strides since the opening of the twentieth century owing to the extension of our oriental possessions and which already ranked with new york and chicago among the financial capitals of the world i hastened to halls laboratory he was there expecting me and after a hearty greeting during which his elation over his success was manifest he said i am compelled to ask you to make a little jour ney i found it impossible to secure the necessary privacy here and before opening my experiments i selected a site for a new laboratory in an unfre quented spot among the mountains this side of lake tahoe you will be the first man with the exception of my two devoted assistants to see my apparatus and you shall share the sensation of the critical experiment then you have not yet completed your solution of the secret yes i have for i am as certain of the result the moon metal as if i had seen it but i thought you were entitled to be in with me at the death a visit to the hall laboratory experimenting with a gold cathode from the nearest railway station we took horses to the laboratory which occupied a secluded but most beautiful site at an eleva tion of about six thousand feet above sealevel with considerable surprise i noticed a building sur mounted with a dome recalling what we had seen from the grand teton on the roof of dr syxs mill hall observing my look smiled significantly but said nothing the laboratory proper occupied a smaller building adjoining the domed structure hall led the way into an apartment having but a single door and illuminated by a skylight this is my sanctum sanctorum he said and you are the first outsider to enter it seat yourself comfortably while i proceed to unveil a little cor ner of the artemisium mystery near one end of the room which was about thirty feet in length was a table on which lay a glass tube about two inches in diameter and thirty inches long in the farther end of the tube gleamed a lump of yellow metal which i took to be gold hall and i were seated near another table about twentyfive feet distant from the tube and on this table was an apparatus finished with a con cave mirror whose optical axis was directed towards the tube it occurred to me at once that this ap paratus would be suitable for experimenting with electric waves wires ran from it to the floor and in the cellar beneath was audible the beating of an engine my companion made an adjustment or two and then remarked now keep your eyes on the lump of gold in the farther end of the tube yonder the tube is exhausted of air and i am about to concentrate upon the gold an intense electric influence which will have the effect of making it a kind of cathode pole i only use this term for the sake of illus tration you will recall that as long ago as the days of crookes it was known that a cathode in an exhausted tube would project particles or atoms of its substance away in straight lines now watch i fixed my attention upon the gold and presently saw it enveloped in a most beautiful violet light this grew more intense until at times it was blinding while at the same moment the interior of the tube seemed to have become charged with a luminous vapor of a delicate pinkish hue watch watch said hall look at the nearer end of the tube why its becoming coated with gold i ex claimed continuation of the experiment he smiled but made no reply still the strange process continued the pink vapor became so dense that the lump of gold was no longer visible although the eye of violet light glared piercingly through the colored fog every second the deposit of metal shining like a mirror increased until suddenly there came a curious whistling sound hall who had been adjusting the mirror jerked away his hand and gave it a flip as if hot water had spattered it and then the light in the tube quickly died away the vapor escaped filling the room with a peculiar stim ulating odor and i perceived that the end of the glass tube had been melted through and the molten gold was slowly dripping from it i carried it a little too far said hall ruefully rubbing the back of his hand and when the glass gave way under the atomic bombardment a few atoms of gold visited my bones but there is no harm done you observed that the instant the air reached the cathode as i for convenience call the electrified mass of gold the action ceased but your anode to continue your simile i said is constantly exposed to the air true he replied but in the first place of course this is not really an anode just as the other is not really a cathode as science advances we are compelled for a time to use old terms in a new sense until a fresh nomenclature can be in vented but we are now dealing with a form of electric action more subtile in its effects than any at present described in the textbooks and the tran sactions of learned societies i have not yet even attempted to work out the theory of it i am only concerned with its facts but wonderful as the exhibition you have given is i do not see i said how it concerns dr syx and his artemisium listen replied hall settling back in his chair after disconnecting his apparatus you no doubt have been told how one night the syx engine was heard working for a few minutes the first and only night work it was ever known to have done and how hardly had it started up when a fire broke out in the mill and the engine was instantly stopped now there is a very remarkable story connected with that and it will show you how i got my first clew to the mystery although it was rather a mere sus picion than a clew for at first i could make nothing out of it the alleged fire occurred about a fort night after our discovery of the double tunnel my mind was then full of suspicions concerning syx because i thought that a man who would fool people with one hand was not likely to deal fairly with the other the suspicious actions of dr syx explained it was a glorious night with a full moon whose face was so clear in the limpid air that having found a snug place at the foot of a yel lowpinetree where the ground was carpeted with odiferous needles i lay on my back and renewed my early acquaintance with the romantically named mountains and seas of the lunar globe with my binocular i could trace those long white streaks which radiate from the crater ring called tycho and run hundreds of miles in all directions over the moon as i gazed at these singular objects i re called the various theories which astronomers puzzled by their enigmatical aspects have offered to a more or less confiding public concerning them in the midst of my meditation and moon gazing i was startled by hearing the engine in the syx works suddenly begin to run immediately a queer light shaped like the beam of a ships searchlight but reddish in color rose high in the moonlit heav ens above the mill it did not last more than a minute or two for almost instantly the engine was amazing stories stopped and with its stoppage the light faded and soon disappeared the next day dr syx gave it out that on starting up his engine in the night something had caught fire which compelled him im mediately to shut down again the few who had seen the light with the exception of your humble servant accepted the doctors explanation without a question but i knew there had been no fire and syxs anxiety to spread the lie led me to believe that he had narrowly escaped giving away a vital secret i said nothing about my suspicions but upon inquiry i found out that an extra and pressing order for metal had arrived from the austrian government the very day of the pretended fire and i drew the inference that syx in his haste to fill the orderâhis supply having been drawn lowâhad started to work contrary to his custom at night and had immediately found reason to repent his rashness of course i connected the strange light with this sudden change of mind my suspicions having been thus stimulated and having been directed in a certain way i began from that moment to notice closely the hours dur ing which the engine labored at night it was always quiet except on that one brief occasion sometimes it began early in the morning and stop ped about noon at other times the work was done entirely in the afternoon beginning sometimes as late as three or four oclock and ceasing invariably at sundown then again it would start at sunrise and continue the whole day through for a long time i was unable to account for these eccentricities and the problem was not rend ered much clearer although a startling suggestive ness was added to it when at length i noticed that the periods of activity of the engine had a definite relation to the age of the moon then i discovered with the aid of an almanac that i could predict the hours when the engine would be busy at the time of new moon it worked all day at full moon it was idle between full moon and last quarter it labored in the forenoon the length of its working hours in creasing as the quarter was approached between last quarter and new moon the hours of work lengthened until as i have said at new moon they lasted all day between new moon and first quar ter work began later and later in the forenoon as the quarter was approached and between first quarter and full moon the laboring hours rapidly shortened being confined to the latter part of the afternoon until at full moon complete silence reigned in the mill the moon is concerned in dr syxs mystery well well i broke in greatly astonished by halls singular recital you must have thought dr syx was a cross between an alchemist and an astrologer note this said hall disregarding my interrup tion the hours when the engine worked were in variably the hours during which the moon was above the horizon what did you infer from that of course i inferred that the moon was directly concerned in the mystery but how that bothered me for a long time but a little light broke into my mind when i picked up on the mountainside a dead bird whose scorched feathers were bronzed with artemisium and sometime later another simi lar victim of a mysterious form of death then came the attack on the mine and its tragic finish i have already told you what i observed on that occasion but instead of helping to clear up the mystery it rather complicated it for a time at length however i reasoned my way partly out of the difficulty certain things which i had noticed in the syx mill convinced me that there was a part of the building whose existence no visitor suspected and putting one thing with another i inferred that the roof must be open above that secret part of the structure and that if i could get upon a suffi ciently elevated place i could see something of what was hidden there at this point in the investigation i proposed to you the trip to the top of the teton the result of which you remember i had calculated the angles with great care and i felt certain that from the apex of the mountain i should be able to get a view into the concealed chamber and into just that side of it which i wished particularly to inspect you remember that i called your attention to a shining object underneath the circular opening in the roof you could not make out what it was but i saw enough to convince me that it was a gigan tic parabolic mirror ill show you a smaller one of the same kind presently now at last i began to perceive the real truth but it was so wildly incredible so infinitely remote from all human experience that i hardly ventured to formulate it even in my own secret mind but i was bound to see the thing through to the end it occurred to me that i could prove the accuracy of my theory with the aid of a kite you were kind enough to lend your assistance in that experiment and it gave me irrefragable evidence of the exist ence of a shaft of flying atoms extending in a direct line between dr syxs preted mine and the moon hall i exclaimed you are mad my friend smiled goodnaturedly and went on with his story why the kite was burned the instant the kite shrivelled and disap peared i understood why the works were idle when the moon was not above the hori zon why birds flying across that fatal beam fell dead upon the rocks and whence the terrible master of that mystery mill derived the power of destruc tion that could wither an army as the assyrian host in byrons poem melted like snow in the glance of the lord but how did dr syx turn the flying atoms against his enemies i asked in a very simple manner he had a mirror mounted so that it could be turned in any direction and would shunt the stream of metallic atoms heated by their friction with the air towards any desired point when the attack came he raised this machine above the level of the roof and swept the mob to a lustrous if expensive death and the light at nightâ was the shining of the heated atoms not lumin ous enough to be visible in broad day for which reason the engine never worked at night and the the moon metal stream of volatized artemisium was never set flow ing at full moon when the lunar globe is above the horizon only during the hours of darkness i see i said whence came the nuggets on the mountain some of the atoms owing to the resist ance of the air fell short and settled in the form of impalpable dust until the winds and rains collected and compacted them in the cracks and crevices of the rocks that was it of course and now i added my amazement at the suc cess of halls experiments and the accuracy of his deductions increasing every moment do you say that you have also discovered the means employed by dr syx to obtain artemisium from the moon not only that replied my friend but within the next few minutes i shall have the pleasure of presenting to you a button of moon metal fresh from the veins of artemis herself chapter xi the looting of the moon i shall spare the reader a recital of tireless efforts continuing through many almost sleep less weeks whereby andrew hall obtained his clew to dr syxs method it was manifest from the beginning that the agent concerned must be some form of etheric or socalled electric energy but how to set it in operation was the problem finally he hit upon the apparatus for his initial experiments which i have already described recurring to what had been done more than half a century ago by hertz when he concentrated electric waves upon a focal point by means of a concave mirror said hall i saw that the key i wanted lay in an extension of these experiments at last i found that i could transform the energy of an engine into undulations of the ether which when they had been concentrated upon a metallic object like a chunk of gold imparted to it an in tense charge of an apparently electric nature upon thus charging a metallic body enclosed in a vacuum i observed that the energy imparted to it possessed the remarkable power of disrupting its atoms and projecting them off in straight lines very much as occurs with a cathode in a crookess tube butâ and this was of supreme importanceâi found that the line of projection was directly towards the appa ratus from which the impulse producing the charge had come in other words i could produce two poles between which a marvellous interaction occurred my transformer with its concentrating mirror acted as one pole from which energy was trans ferred to the other pole and that other pole im mediately flung off atoms of its own substance in the direction of the transformer but these atoms were stopped by the glass wall of the vacuum tube and when i tried the experiment with the metal removed from the vacuum and surrounded with air it failed utterly this at first completely discouraged me until i suddenly remembered that the moon is in a vacuum the great vacuum of interplanetary space and that it possesses no perceptible atmosphere of its own at this a great light broke around me and i shouted eureka without hesitation i construct ed a transformer of great power furnished with a large parabolic mirror to transmit the waves in parallel lines erected the machinery and buildings here and when all was ready for the final experi ment i telegraphed for you details of halls experiments prepared by these explanations i was all on fire to see the thing tried hall was no less eager and calling in his two faithful assist ants to make the final adjustments he led the way into what he facetiously named the lunar chamber if we fail he remarked with a smile that had an element of worriment in it it will become the lunatic chamberâbut no danger of that you ob serve this polished silver knob suported by a metal lic rod curved over at the top like a crane that constitutes the pole from which i propose to transmit the energy to the moon and upon which i expect the storm of atoms to be centred by reflec tion from the mirror at whose focus it is placed one moment i said am i to understand that you think that the moon is a solid mass of artemi sium and that no matter where your radiant force strikes it a cathodic pole will be formed there from which atoms will be projected to the earth no said hall i must carefully choose the point on the lunar surface where to operate but that will present no difficulty i made up my mind as soon as i had penetrated syxs secret that he obtained the metal from those mystic white streaks which radiate from tycho and which have puzzled the astronomers ever since the invention of tele scopes i now believe those streaks to be composed of immense veins of the metal that syx has most appropriately named artemisium which you of course recognize as being derived from the name of the greek goddess of the moon artemis whom the romans called diana but now to work it was less than a day past the time of new moon and the earths satellite was too near the sun to be visible in broad daylight accordingly the mirror had to be directed by means of knowledge of the moons place in the sky driven by accurate clock work it could be depended upon to retain the proper direction when once set with breathless interest i watched the proceed ings of my friend and his assistants the strain upon the nerves of all of us was such as could not have been borne for many hours at a stretch when everything had been adjusted to his satis faction hall stepped back not without betraying his excitement in flushed cheeks and flashing eyes and pressed a lever the powerful engine under neath the floor instantly responded the experi ment was begun i have set it upon a point about a hundred miles north of tycho where the yerkes photographs show a great abundance of the white substance said hall then he waited a minute elapsed a bird fluttering in the opening above for a second or two wrenched our strained nerves halls face turned pale they had better keep away from here he whis pered with a ghastly smile two minutes i could hear the beating of my heart the engine shook the floor three minutes halls face was wet with perspi amazing stories ration the bird blundered in and startled us again hall produces artemisium on a small scale four minutes we were like statues with all eyes fixed on the polished ball of silver which shone in the brilliant light concentrated upon it by the mirror five minutes the shining ball had become a confused blue and i violently winked to clear my vision at last thank god look there it is it was hall who spoke trembling like an aspen the silver knob had changed color what seemed a miniature rainbow surrounded it with concentric circles of blinding brilliance then something dropped flashing into an earthen dish set beneath the ball another glittering drop followed and at a shorter interval another almost before a word could be uttered the drops had coalesced and become a tiny stream which as it fell twisted itself into a bright spiral gleaming with a hundred shifting hues and forming on the bottom of the dish a glowing interlacing maze of viscid rings and circlets which turned and twined about and over one another until they had blended and settled into a buttonshaped mass of hot metal lic jelly hall snatched the dish away and placed another in its stead this will be about right for a watch charm when it cools he said with a return to his customary selfcommand i promised you the first specimen ill catch another for myself but can it be possible that we are not dream ing i exclaimed do you really believe that this comes from the moon just as surely as rain comes from the clouds cried half with all his old impatience havent i just showed you the whole process then i congratulate you you will be as rich as dr syx perhaps was the unperturbed reply but not until i have enlarged my apparatus at present i shall hardly do more than supply mementoes to my friends but since the principle is established the rest is mere detail six weeks later the financial centres of the earth were shaken by the news that a new supply of arte misium was being marketed from a mill which had been secretly opened in the sierras of california for a time there was almost a panic if hall had chosen to do so he might have precipi tated serious trouble but he immediately entered into negotiations with government representatives and the inevitable result was that to preserve the monetary system of the world from upheaval dr syx had to consent that halls mill should share equally with his in the production of artemisium during the negotiations the doctor paid a visit to halls establishment the meeting between them was most dramatic syx tried to blast his rival with a glance but knowledge is power and my friend faced his mysterious antagonist whose deep est secrets he had penetrated with an unflinching eye it was remarked that dr syx became a changed man from that moment his masterful air seemed to have deserted him and it was with something resembling humility that he assented to the arrangement which required him to share his enormous gains with his conqueror the syx mill is blown up of course halls success led to an immedi ate recrudescence of the efforts to extract artemisium from the syx ore and equally of course every such attempt failed hall while keeping his own secret did all he could to discour age the experiments but they naturally believed that he must have made the very discovery which was the subject of their dreams and he could not without betraying himself and upsetting the finan ces of the planet directly undeceive them the con sequence was that fortunes were wasted in hopeless experimentation and with halls achievement daz zling their eyes the deluded fortuneseekers kept on in the face of endless disappointments and dis aster and presently there came another tragedy the syx mill was blown up the accidentâalthough many people refused to regard it as an accident and asserted that the doctor himself in his chagrin had applied the matchâthe explosion then occur red about sundown and its effects were awful the great works with everything pertaining to them and every rail that they contained were blown to atoms they disappeared as if they had never existed even the twin tunnels were involved in the ruin a vast cavity being left in the mountain side where syxs ten acres had been the force of the explosion was so great that the shattered rock was reduced to dust to this fact was owing the escape of the troops camped near while the moun tain was shaking to its core and enormous para pets of living rock were hurled down the precipices of the teton no missiles of appreciable size tra versed the air and not a man at the camp was injured but jacksons hole filled with red dust looked for days afterwards like the mouth of a tremendous volcano just after an eruption dr syx had been seen entering the mill a few minutes before the catastrophe by a sentinel who was sta tioned about a quarter of a mile away and who although he was felled like an ox by the shock and had his eyes ears and nostrils filled with flying dust miraculously escaped with his life after this a new arrangement was made whereby andrew hall became the sole producer of artemisi um and his wealth began to mount by leaps of mil lions toward the starry heights of the billions about a year after the explosion of the syx mill a strange rumor got about it came first from buda pest in hungary where it was averred several per sons of credibility had seen dr max syx millions had been familiar with his face and his personal peculiarities through actually meeting him as well as through photographs and descriptions and un less there was an intention to deceive it did not seem possible that a mistake could be made in iden tification there surely never was another man who looked just like dr syx and besides was it not general ly known that he must have perished in the awful destruction of his mill the moon metal the secret of producing artemisium becomes public property soon after came a report that dr syx had been seen again this time at ekaterinburg in the urals next he was said to have paid a visit to batang in the mountainous district of southwestern china and finally according to ru mor he was seen in sicily at nicolosi among the volcanic pimples on the southern slope of mount etna next followed something of more curious and even startling interest a chemist at budapest where the first rumors of syxs reappearance had placed the mysterious doctor announced that he could pro duce artemisium and proved it although he kept his process secret hardly had the sensation caused by this news partially subsided when a similar report arrived from ekaterinburg then another from ba tang after that a fourth from nicolosi nobody could fail to notice the coincidence wherever the doctorâor was it his ghostâappear ed there shortly afterwards somebody discovered the muchsought secret after syxs apparitions rapidly increased in fre quency followed in each instance by the announce ment of another productive artemisium mill he appeared in germany italy france england and finally at many places in the united states it is the old doctors revenge said hall to me one day trying to smile although the matter was too serious to be taken humorously yes it is his revenge and i must admit that it is complete the price of artemisium has fallen onehalf within six months all the efforts we have made to hold back the floor have proved useless the secret itself is becoming public property we shall inevitably be overwhelmed with artemisium just as we were with gold and the last condition of the financial world will be worse than the first my friends gloomy prognostications came near being fulfilled to the letter ten thousand artemisi um mills shot their etheric rays upon the moon and our unfortunate satellites metal ribs were stripped by atomic force some of the great white rays that had been one of the telescopic wonders of the lunar landscapes disappeared and the face of the moon which had remained unchanged before the eyes of the children of adam from the beginning of their race now looked as if the blast of a furnace had swept it at night on the moonward side the earth was studded with brilliant spikes all pointed at the heart of its child in the sky but the looting of the moon brought disaster to the robber planet so mad were the efforts to get the precious metal that the surface of our globe was fairly showered with it productive fields were in some cases almost smothered under a metallic coating the air was filled with shining dust until finally famine and pestilence joined hands with fin ancial disaster to punish the grasping world then at last the various governments took effec tive measures to protect themselves and their people another combined effort resulted in an interna tional agreement whereby the production of the precious moon metal was once more rigidly con trolled but the existence of a monopoly such as dr syx had so long enjoyed and in the enjoyment of which andrew hall had for a brief period suc ceeded him was henceforth rendered impossible chapter xii the last of dr syx many years after the events last recorded i sat at the close of a brilliant autumn day side by side with my old friend andrew hall on a broad vineshaded piazza which faced the east where the full moon was just rising above the rim of the sierra and replacing the rosy coun terglow of sunset with its silvery radiance the sight was calculated to carry the minds of both back to the events of former years but i noticed that hall quickly changed the position of his chair and sat down again with his back to the rising moon he had managed to save some millions from the wreck of his vast fortune when artemisium started to go to the dogs and i was now paying him one of my annual visits at his palatial home in california did i ever tell you of my last trip to the teton he asked as i continued to gaze contemplatively at the broad lunar disk which slowly detached itself from the horizon and began to swim in the clear evening sky no i replied but i should like to hear about it or of my last sight of dr syx indeed i did not suppose that you ever saw him after that conference in your mill when he had to surrender half of the world to you once only i saw him again said hall with a peculiar intonation pray go ahead and tell me the whole story my friend lighted a fresh cigar tipped his chair into a more comfortable position and began it was about seven years ago i had long felt an unconquerable desire to have another look at the teton and the scenes amid which so many strange events in my life had occurred i thought of send ing for you to go with me but i knew you were abroad much of your time and i could not be cer tain of catching you finally i decided to go alone i travelled on horseback by way of the snake river canyon and arrived early one morning in jacksons hole i can tell you it was a gloomy place as barren and deserted as some of those arabian wadies that you have been describing to me the railroad had long ago been abandoned and the site of the mili tary camp could scarcely be recognized an immense cavity with ragged walls showed where dr syxs mill used to send up its plume of black smoke as i started up the gaunt form of the teton whose beetling precipices had been smashed and split by the great explosion i was seized with a resistless impulse to climb it i thought i should like to peer off again from that pinnacle which had once formed so fateful a watchtower for me turn ing my horse loose to graze in the grassy river bot tom and carrying my rope tether along as a pos sible aid in climbing i set out for the ascent i knew i could not get up the precipices on the east ern side which we were able to master with the aid of our balloon and so i bore round when i reached the steepest cliffs until i was on the south western side of the peak where the climbing was easier continued on page the eggs from lake tanganyika by curt siodmak crying and screaming the people fled from the street and crowded into the houses they couldnt tell where the insect would fall and they were afraid of their heads the eggs from lake tanganyika professor meyermaier drew a sharp needle out of the cushion carefully picked up with the pincers the fly lying in front of him and stuck it carefully upon a piece of white paper he looked over the rim of his glasses dipped his pen in the ink and wrote under the specimen glossina palpalis specimen from tsetsefly river in the aboriginal language termed nsinsi usually found on river courses and lakes in west africa bearer of the malady negana tsetse sicknessâ sleep ing sickness he laid down the pen and took up a powerful magnifying glass for a closer examination a hor rible creature he murmered and shivered involun tarily on each side of the head of the flying horror there was a monstrous eye surrounded by many sharp lashes and divided up into a hundred thousand flashing facets an ugly proboscis thickly studded with curved barbs or hooks grew out of the lower side of the head the wings were small and pointed the legs armed with thorns spines and claws the thorax was muscular like that of a prize fighter the abdomen was thin and looked like india rubber it could take in a great quantity of blood and expand like a balloon on the whole the flying horror resembling a prehistoric flying dragon was not very pleasant lookingâprof meyermaier took a pin and transfixed the body of the fly it seemed to him that a vicious sheen of light emanated from the eyes and that the probos cis rolled up quickly he picked up the magnifying glass but it was an optical illusionâthe thing was dead with all its poison still within its body memories of the expedition to africa with a deep sigh he laid aside pincers and magnifying glass and sank into a deep re verie the clock struck counted professor meyermaier in udjidji a village on lake tanganyika the na tives had told him of gi gantic flies inhabiting the interior further north these monsters were three times as big as the giants composing the giant bodyguard of the prince of ssuggi who all had to be of at least stand ard height meyermaier laughed over this negro fable but the negroes were obstinate they refused to follow him to the northern part of lake tanganyika even msuuru his black ser vant who otherwise made an intelligent impression trembled with excitement and begged to be left out of the expeditionâbecause there enormous flies and bees were to be foundâthat let no man approach they drank the river dry and guarded the valley of the elephants the valley of the elephants was a fabled place where the old pachyderms withdrew to die it is inexplicable soliloquized meyer maier that no one ever found a dead elephant the clock struck we consider this extraordinary story a classic and cer tanly the best scientifiction story so far for how large can insects grow is there any limit to their size frankly no one knows we have almost micros copically small flies and in some of the tropical countries we have some almost as large as the fist is it possible to have still larger flies and could monstrous flies such as are depicted in this story be bred at some future date the author of this brilliant tale evidently thinks so anyway we trust he is mistaken as we should not like to meet such monsters the science of entomology pre sented in this story is excellent and will arouse your imagination the natives had come along on the expedition much against their will moyermaier had trouble to keep the caravan moving up to the day when he found four great strange looking eggs larger than ostrich eggs the negroes were seized with a panic half of them deserting in the night in spite of the great distance from the coast the other half could only be kept there by tremendous efforts he had to make up his mind finally to go back but he secretly put the eggs he had found into his camp ing chest to solve their riddle now they were here in his berlin home in his workroom he had not found time as yet to exam ine them for he had brought much material home to be worked over the clock struck meyermaier kept thinking of the ugly head of the tsetse fly that he had seen through the magnifying glass a strange thought occurred to him and made him smile suppose the stories of the negroes were true and the giant fliesâbutterflies and beetles as big as elephants did exist and suppose that they propagated as flies doâeach one laying eighty million eggs a year he laughed aloud and pictured to himself how such a creature would stalk through the streets a strange sound and the hatching of an egg he broke off suddenly in the midst of his laughter a sound reached his ear an earsplitting buzzing like that of a thousand flies a deafening hum as if a swarm of bees were entering the room it burst out like a blast of wind through the room and then stopped meyermaier jerked the door open nothing all was quiet i must relax for a while said he and opened the window he turned on the light and threw back the lid of the big chest which contained the giant eggs suddenly he grew pale as death and staggered back a creature was crawling out a creature as big as a police dogâa frightful creature with wings a muscular body and six hairy legs with claws it crept slowly raised its incandescent head to the light and polished its wings with its hind legs faint with fright meyer maier pressed against the wall with outspread arms a loud buzzing â the creature swept across the room climbed up on the window sill and was gone meyermaier came slowly to himself my nerves are deceiving me did i dream he whis pered and dragged himself to the campchest but he became frozen with horror one egg was broken open it breaks out of its shell like a chicken it does not change into a chrysalis he thought me chanically at last his mind cleared and he awoke to the emergency he sprang to the desk snatched up his revolver ran downstairs and out into the street he saw no trace of the escaped giant insect meyer maier looked up at the lighted windows of his home suddenly the light became dim the other eggs âlike a blow came the thoughtâthe other eggs too amazing stories have broken he raced back up the stairs a deaf ening buzzing filled the room he jerked his door open and firedâonce twice until the magazine was emptyâthe room was silent through the window he saw three silhouettes sweeping high across the nightsky and disappearing in the direction of the great woods in the west in the chest there lay the four broken giant eggs a call for his colleague meyermaier sank upon a chair its against all logic he thought and glanced at the empty revolver in his hand my delirium has taken wings and crawled out of the egg what shall i do shall i call the police they will send me to an alienist keep quiet about it look for the creatures ill call up my colleague schmidt schmitt he dragged himself to the telephone and got a connection schmidtschmitt was at home this is meyermaier sounded a tired voice come over at once whats the trouble asked schmidtschmitt my african giant eggs have burst lisped meyermaier with a failing voice you must come at once your nerves are out of order answered schmidtschmitt have you still got the creat ures theyve gone whispered meyermaierâhe thought he would collapseâflew out of the win dow there there laughed schmidtschmitt now we are getting to the truthâof course they arent there anyhow ill come over meanwhile take a cognac and put on a cold pack take your car and say nothing about what i told you professor meyermaier hung up the receiver it was incredible he pressed his hand to his forehead if the empty shells were not irrefutable evidence he would have been inclined to think of hallucinations he helped himself to some brandy and after the second glass he felt better i wish professor schmidtschmitt would come he ought to be here by now he will have an explanation and will help me to get myself in hand again the day of ghosts and miracles is long past but why isnt he here he ought to have come by this time meyermaier looked out of the window a car came tearing through the dark street and stopped with squeaking brakes in front of meyermaiers residence a form jumped out like an india rubber ball ran up the steps burst into meyermaiers study and collapsed into a chair how awful he gasped it seems to me you are even more excited over it than i said professor meyermaier dispiritedly while he watched his shaking friend absolutely terrible professor schmidtschmitt wiped his forehead with a silk handkerchief you were not suffering from nerves you had no hallucin ations just now i saw a flycreature as large as a heifer falling upon a horse the monster grew big and heavy while the horse collapsed and the fly flew away i examined the horse its veins and arteries were empty not a drop of blood was left in its body the driver fainted with fright and has not come to yet it is a world catastrophe notifying the police we must notify the police at once a quick telephone connection was ob tained the police lieutenant in charge himself answered this is professor meyermaier talking please believe what i am going to tell you i am neither drunk nor crazy four poisonous gigantic flies as large as horses are at large in the city they must be destroyed at all costs what are you trying to do kid me the lieu tenant came back in an angry voice believe meâfor gods sake yelled meyer maier reaching the end of his nervous strength hold the wire the lieutenant turned to the desk of the sergeant what is up now a cab driver has been here who says that his horse was killed by a gigantic bird on karlstrasse get the men of the second platoon ready for immediate action he ordered the sergeant and turned back to the telephone hello professor are you still there please come over as quickly as possible what you told me is true one of these giant insects has been seen professor meyermaier hung up he loaded his revolver and put a browning pistol into his col leagues hand is your car still downstairs yes i took the little limousine excellentâthen the monster cannot attack us they rushed on through the night what can happen now inquired professor schmidtsshmitt these giant flies may propagate and multiply in the manner of the housefly and in that case due to their strength and poisonous qualities continued professor meyermaier the whole human race will perish in a few weeks when they crept from the shell they were as large as dogs they grew to the size of a horse within an hour god knows what will happen next let us hope and pray that we will be able to find and kill the four flies and destroy the eggs which they have laid in the meantime within fourteen days the car came to a stop in front of the police sta tion a policeman armed with steel helmet and hand trench bombs swinging from his belt tore open the limousine door the lieutenant hastened out and conducted the scientists into the station house any more news inquired meyermaier the west precinct station just called up one of their patrolmen saw a giant animal fly over the teutoburger forest luckily we had war tanks near there which immediately set out in search of the creature the telephonebell rang the lieutenant rushed to the phone central police station east station talking report comes from lake wieler that a gigantic fly has attacked two motor boats put small trench mortars on the policeboat and go out on the lake shoot when the beast gets near you the door of the stationhouse opened and the city commissioner entered i have just heard some the eggs from lake tanganyika fabulous stories he said and approached the visi tors professor meyermaier major pritzel wilzell can you explain all this i brought home with me four large eggs from my african expedition for examination tonight these eggs broke open four great flies came outâa sort of tsetse fly such as is found on lake tanganyika the creatures escaped through the window and we must make every endeavor to kill them at once the telephone bell rang as if possessed this is the central broadcasting station a giant bird has been caught in the high voltage lines it has fallen down and lies on the street close the street at once the major took up the instrument call up the second company let all four flying companies go off with munition and gas oline for three days come with me my friends we will get at least one of them an armored automobile came tearing along at a frightful speed we appreciate your foresight major said meyermaier as they stepped into the steelarmored machine one of the giant flies is electrocuted although it was five oclock in the morn ing the square in front of the broadcasting station was black with people the police kept a space clear in the center where monstrously large and ugly lay the dead giant fly its wings were burnt its proboscis extended while the legs with their claws were drawn up against the body the abdomen was a great ball full of bright red liquid that is certainly the creature that killed the horse said schmidtschimitt and pointed at the thick abdomen he then walked around the crea ture glossina palpalis a monstrous tsetse fly will you please send the monster to the zoological laboratory the major nodded assent the fire men prepared for service pushed poles under the insect and tried to lift it up from the ground out of the air came a droning sound an airplane squadron dropped out of the clouds and again disap peared a bright body with vibrating wings flew across the sky the airplanes dropped on it the noise of the machineguns staged the bright body fell in a spiral course to the ground crying and screaming the people fled from the street and crowded into the houses they couldnt tell where the insect would fall and they were afraid of their heads the street was empty in an instant the body of the monster fell directly in front of the armored car and lay there stiff in its fall it car ried away a lot of aerial cable and now it lay on the pavement as if caught in a net the head torn by the machine gun bullets it looked like a strange gleam ing cactus take me to my home major groaned meyer maier i cant stand it any longer the excite ment is too much for me in the hospital the armored car started noisily into motion meyermaier fell from the seat senseless up on the floor of the tonneau when he came to himself he lay in a strange bed his gaze fell upon a bell which swung to and fro above his face in his head there was a humming like an airplane motor he made no attempt even to think his finger pressed the pushbutton and he never released it until halfadozen attendants came rushing into the room one figure stood out in dark colors in the group of whiteclad interns it was his colleague schmidtschmitt youre awake said he and stepped to his bed how are you feeling my head is buzzing as if there were a swarm of hornets living in it how many hours have i lain here hours schmidtschmitt dwelt upon the word today is the fifteenth day that you are lying in professor stieblings sanitorium it was a difficult case you always woke up at mealtime and without saying a word went to sleep again fifteen days cried meyermaier excitedly and the insects have they been killed ill tell you the whole story when you are well again said schmidtschmitt quieting him lie as you are quietlyâany excitement may hurt you they must not come into the room he screamed out to an excited messenger who breathlessly pull ed the door open professor â the man was in deadly fear the central police station has given out the news that a swarm of giant flies are descending up on the city barricade all windows at once you wasted precious time screamed meyer maier and jumped out of the bed let me go to my house i must solve the riddle as to how to get at the insects dont touch me he raved he snatched a coat from the rack ran out of the house and jumped into schmidtschmitts automobile which stood at the gate and went like the wind to his home the door of his house was ajar he rushed up four flights and in delirious haste rushed into his workroom the telephone bell rang the danger is over meyermaier snatched up the receiver he got the consoling message from the city police commissioner the danger is over professor our airsquadron has destroyed the swarm with a cloud of poisongas only two of the insects escaped death these we have caught in a net and are taking them to the zoological gardens and if they have left eggs behind them we are going to search the woods systematically and will inject lysol into any eggs we find i think that will help laughed the major shall i send some of them to you for examination no cried meyermaier in fright keep them off my neck he sat down at his worktabie there seemed a vicious smile on the face of the transfixed dead tse tse fly you frightful ghost murmured the pro fessor with pallid lips and threw a book on the in sect his head was in a daze he tried his best to think clearly an axiom of science came to him if the flies are as large as elephants they can only progagate as fast as elephants do they cant have a million young ones but only a few i cant be wrong he murmured ill look up the confirma tion he took up the telephone and called the city com missioner major how many insects were in the swarm continued on page the magnetic storm by hugo gernsback the president of the glorious french republic shouts dramatically messieursle jour de gloire est arrivevive la france and throws the huge switch with its long ebonite handle the magnetic storm why sparks had stopped reading the new york evening world he contemp lated his old meerschaum pipe medita tively while with his long and lanky in dex finger stained by many acids he carefully rubbed a long thin and quivering nose this was always a sign of deep concentrated thought of the noses owner it also as a rule in duced the birth of a great idea again and very slowly he reread the article which millions that same day had read casually without a quiver let alone a nose quiver the news paper item was simple enough new york aug âan electro magnetic storm of great violence swept over the eastern section of the united states last night due to a brilliant aurora borealisâthe north ern lightsâtelegraph and long distance tele phone as well as cable communications were interrupted for hours no telegraphic traffic was possible between new york and points west it was impossible to work any of the transatlantic cables between a m and a m every one of them having gone dead the aurora borealis disturbance af fected all telegraph and telephone lines extend ing between chicago and the eastern cities on telegraph wires of the postal telegraph co without regular battery being applied at terminal offices grounded lines showed a po tential of volts positive varying to volts negative the disturbance continuing be tween a m and a m at newark n j in the broad street office a western union operator was severely shocked trying to operate the key while long sparks played about his instruments sparks rose excitedly and began pacing the ce ment floor of the vast tesla laboratory totally ob livious to the fact that he was sucking a cold pipe the more he paced about the more excited he be came finally he flung himself into a chair and began feverishly to make sketches on big white sheets of drawing paper why sparks had been just an ordinary bug an experimenter when he entered teslas great re search laboratory at the beginning of the great war in tesla liked the keen redhaired tous led boy who always seem ed to divine your thoughts before you had uttered five words his clear blue eyes lying deep in their sockets sparkled with life and intelligence and what sparks did not know about electricity was mighty little indeed i believe there is no electrical book in existence that sparks had not devoured ravenously in his spare hours while hav ing lunch or else while in bed in the small hours of the morning his thirst for electrical knowledge was unbounded and he soaked up every bit of in formation like a sponge yes and he retained it this story was written during the world war long be fore the death ray was ever invented it is believed in some quarters that here we have the original germ of the death ray in fact the means chosen by the author to bring down enemy airplanes by means of electricity were exploited a number of years later by grindell matthews although he admits today that the death ray was pure fiction nevertheless at some future date it will be possible to do just what the author tells us in this story nikola tesla who read the original proofs of this story endorses the idea he himself was able to bum out electrical amateurs thirteen miles from his famous col orado pozver plant in when he was also able to light electric lamps at this distance without wires too in short the young prodigy was a living elec trical cyclopedia and highly valued by his associates no wonder tesla in three short years had made him superintendent of the laboratory sparks first name of course sparks first name was not really why but some one had dubbed him with this sobriquet because of his eternal but why is thisâwhy why should we not do it this wayâwhy do you try to do that in short his first word always seemed to be whyâit had to be in his unending quest of knowledge and his why was always very emphatic explosivelike imperative from which there was no escape ah yes his first name to tell the honest truth i dont know it last year in the spring when i went up to the laboratory i thought i would find out so when i finally located the young wonder behind a bus bar where he was drawing fat blue sparks by means of a screwdriver i told him that i intended to write something about him and his wonderful electrical knowledge would he be good enough to give me his real first name he was watching a big fuse critically and in an absentminded manner exploded why that finished my mission and for all i know his real name is why sparks but we left sparks with his drawings in the laboratory that was on a certain evening in to be exact it was about oclock at tesla accompanied by two high army officials strolled in to the laboratory where sparks was still feverishly engaged with sketches lying all about him tesla who was working out a certain apparatus for the government had dropt in late to show major general mcquire the result of six weeks labors the apparatus had been completed that day and the general a military electrical expert had come over specially from washington to see the thing work but before tesla had a chance to throw in the switch of the large rotary converter sparks had leaped up and was wav ing excitedly a large drawing in teslas face he gushed forth a tor rent of sentences and for fully five minutes tesla and the two army officials were listening spellbound to the young inventor for a minute or two the three men were speech less looking awestruck at sparks who having de livered himself of his latest outburst now became normal again and lit up his still cold pipe it was tesla who first found his voice wonder ful wonderful absolutely wonderful sparks in a month you will be the most talked of man on this planet and his idea is sound this to the gen eral absolutely without a flaw and so simple why oh why did i not think of it before come let me shake the hand of americas youngest and greatest genius which he did there then followed an excited thirtyminute con amazing stories versation with the two army men and an endless long distance talk with the war department at washington then there was a rush trip to wash ington by tesla and sparks conferences at the war department and finally a few days later sparks went to the white house and was presented to the president who was highly enthusiastic about the model which sparks and tesla demonstrated to the head of the nation still later there were certain rush orders from the war department to the gen eral electric and westinghouse companies for many big queer machines and these same machines were shortly but here the censor bids us an emphatic halt one may not even now divulge certain military information you appreciate that behind the german lines baron von unterrichters flying circus was getting ready to bomb a certain amer ican depot behind the lines the americans of late had shot down entirely too many of the barons flyers only yesterday von der halber stadtâa german ace himselfâand one of von un terrichters closest friends had been downed and killed inside of the german lines so the baron was out for blood this sunny morning as he put it verdammte yankee schweinehunde we will show them who is master of the air hereabouts shaking his fist at the american lines beyond sie muller this to an orderly zu befehl herr leutnant replied the young orderly as he came on the run and stood at attention clicking his heels together hand at his cap versammlung sofort barked the chief as he hastened muller off to summon post haste every man of the aerial squadron for the usual conference before the attack in less than ten minutes the thirty flyers were standing drawn up at military attention before their chief forming a half circle about him von unterrichters instructions were simple enough this was a reprisal raid von der halberstadts death must be avenged fearfully avenged no quar ter was to be given dieses amerikanische gesindelâhere his voice rose to a shrill pitch must be taught to re spect us as never before the orders are to bomb every american base hospital within the sector at this several of the men recoiled involuntarily which did not escape the keen eye of von unter richter who now incensed to blind fury by this show of softheartedness as he put it exhorted his men in his harshest possible terms and as for their flyers you must not give quarter you must not be satisfied with disabling their machines kill them schiesst die lumpen zusammen pump nickel into them if you see that they may land unharmedâthis in direct violation of all fly ing etiquetteâa thing abhorred by any decent flyer as a rule it is bad enough to have your machine shot down but sitting on a disabled enemys tail and pouring machine gun fire into a helpless man struggling in midairâwhat was german prestige coming to with such methods plainly the men did not like such liberties with their honor but orders for translation of foreign terms see end of this story were orders they grumbled audibly and cast not very encouraging looks at their chief even his parting shout vorwartsâfur gott und vater land failed to bring the usual cheers the german aerial circus promptly on the minute of the fifteen flyers of the circus rose like a flock of big white sea gulls heading in v formation towards the american lines von unterrichter was leading his herd in a big fokker he was out for blood and he meant to have it his face was set his jaws clenched like a vice hate was written in large characters over his face why didnt these dollarjager stay home and mind their own business chasing their dollars what right did they have in this fray anyway elendige schweine bande he spoke out loud to better vent his over powering hate but where were the yankee flieger today the barons circus was up one thousand meters and less than a mile away from the american first line trenches but still no machine in sight either american or french strange quite an unheard of occurrence afraid unsinn he muttered to himself they were not the sort to be afraid von unterrichter knew that for the first time he felt a vague sort of uneasiness creeping over him he could not understand there was not a flieger any where in sight none on the ground either as he scanned the vast saucer below him through his zeiss was it a new trick was before he finished his train of thought his engine stopped dead cursing volubly he made ready to bank his machine in order to volplane down be hind his own lines he congratulated himself that his engines had not stopped later while over the enemys lines but his pleasure was shortlived for he suddenly became aware of the fact that there was a supreme quiet reigning all about him why did he not hear the loud roar of the other fourteen en gines now that his own engine was quiet looking around he perceived with horror that every one of the fourteen machines of the circus had simul taneously gone dead and all of them were now volplaning earthward the circus descends disabled sick with an unknown terror von unterrichter made a clumsy landing in the midst of his other flyers all of them pale some shaking some with a strange animal expression in their eyes what unknown invisible hand had with one stroke disabled the fifteen engines one thousand meters above the ground himmelkreuzdonnerwetter shrieked von un terrichter jumping to the ground near his air drome i i cannot here his voice broke for the first time in his life the young prus sian was speechless he then stamped his foot in a frenzied fury but finally gave vent to a full round of cursing at last he collected his senses suffi ciently to look for the cause of the mysterious occur rence it only took five minutes to find it his mechanician pointed to the magneto kaput he said laconically if not grammatically auseinander nehmen commanded the chief it took the deft mechanician but a minute to take the magnetic storm the magneto apart and to withdraw the armature he gave it one look and with a sickly smile uttered ausgebrannt herr leutnant herr leutnant took the armature into his own hands and inspected it critically sure enough it was burnt out if ever there was a burnt out armature perhaps fused would be a better term the armature was beyond repair a child could see that he flung it away and went over to the next nearest flyer but the mechanic had already located the troubleâin the magneto burnt out too von unterrichter unutterably sick at heart aim lessly wandered about the other machines in each case the result was the same every magneto arma ture of the fifteen flyers was burnt out the wires fused together all insulation gone aber so was muttered von unterrichter look ing about him helplessly it took fully five minutes before it filtered through his thick skull that this disaster that overtook his circus could by no means be a coincidence verfluchte amerikaner he said probably a new teufelmaschine of edison but what would the kommando say to this in stantly he stiffened as he jumped into a waiting au tomobile attached to the airdrome zum kommando schnell he ordered the driver as he sank back into his seat he must report this queer business to headquarters at once the driver cranked the engine then cranked it some more pfut pfut pfut sputtered the engine asthmaticlike but it did not start he tried again same result the useless automobile donnerwetter nochmal stormed the baron vexed over the delay was ist denn jetzt los why in thunder dont you start you miserable dog but the engine would not start the perplexed chauffeur climbed into the seat of the old style car which still had its faithful spark coils so necessary to the igni tion system but the spark coil refused to work al though the storage battery was fully charged and all the connections were right cautiously he pulled out one of the spark coil units from its box one look told the story ausgebrannt herr leutnant he said weakly for he had seen the burnt out magneto armatures a few minutes before von unterrichter with eyes almost popping out of his head was struck absolutely speechless for half a minute heiliger strohsack he muttered awestruck remembering his young sisters favorite expression whenever something out of the ordinary happened to her he finally collected himself suf ficiently and jumped out of the car zum telefon he muttered to himself he must report this uncanny occurrence at once to the kom mando not a second was to be lost he at last un derstood that something momentous had happened he made the airdrome on the run and though it was only yards away he surprised himself at the speed he made puffing volubly he arrived at the telephone he gave the handle several quick turns grasped the receiver and simultaneously bellowed into the mouthpiece in front of him all german telephones are magneto operated to call central you most turn the handle of the ringing magneto hallo hallo but he went no further the receiver flew from his ear for there had been a loud clattering rattling earsplitting noise in the instru ment that almost burst his eardrum he made a foolish grimace as he held his ear with his hand cautiously he approached the receiver to within a few inches of his other ear and listened all was quiet not a sound mechanically he unscrewed the receiver cap and looked at the two bobbins they were charred and black the telephone was dead to the radio transmitting station the instrument slipped from his hand and dangling by its red and purple cord went crashing against the wall of the airdrome while von unterrichter limply sank into a chair once more he got up and walked out he must get in touch with his general at all costs this was becoming too serious ah he had it the field telegraph there was one at the other end of the building he went there as fast as his legs could carry him he opened the door of the little office but one look sufficed the young man in charge of the telegraph sat dejected in a corner a dumb ex pression in his eyes long purple sparks were play ing about the instruments on the table a child could have seen that it was impossible to either send or receive a telegram under such conditions ah an inspiration dummkopf he muttered to himself why didnt i think of it before die funkenstation surely the wireless must work ha ha there are no wires there at least to burn out the radio station was over a kilometer away he knew it well for he had flown over it a great many times to get there quick that was the question the kommando was at least eight kilometers to the rear and he knew he could not make that distance on foot very quickly ah yes there was a horse somewhere around the cavalry horse was located soon and as the young airman walked hurriedly about troubled as he was he could not help noticing the listless attitude of every man he passed men were whispering in a hushed manner alarm was plainly written on their facesâthe fear or the un known von unterrichter jumped on to his horse and galloped in the direction of the field radio station it did not take him long to reach it and long be fore he dismounted he could see the bright blue spark of the transmitting station gott sei lob he uttered to himself as he jumped to the ground at least thats working now it so happened that von unterrichter had been an expert wireless man before the war and while he did not know a great deal about electricity he well knew how to send and receive messages he ran to the wagon which carried the mobile radio field apparatus and peremptorily ordered the operator in charge away aber herr leutnant expostulated the thus rudely interrupted man i tell you maul halten thundered von unterrichter with which he sat down clamping the operators receiv ers on his own head amazing stories at the wireless key he pressed the key impulsively and noted with grim satisfaction that the loud blue spark crashed merrily in the not very uptodate spark gap as he sent out the call mechanically he wondered vaguely what the matter could be with the govern ment because it did not even supply a modern up todate loschfunkenstreckeâquenched spark gapâ for field use things must be pretty bad when the government must economize even a few beggarly pounds of brass so necessary for a noiseless spark gap but he could not give that matter further atten tion for he had thrown the aerial switch from sending to receiving he had strained his ears for a reply from the op erator from the kommando but as the switch was thrown instead of a reply there was a loud constant roar in the receivers so loud that it was painful off came the headgear while von unterrichter once more sank into a chair he was a pitiful spectacle to look at the fate of a th century man flung back a hundred years his eyes roamed idly about till the distant railroad em bankment struck his eye no train was moving everything was at a standstillâhow could a train move without a telegraph how could a train be dispatchedâthere would be a thousand collisions he turned to the radio operator who as yet had not grasped the situation in its entirety nordlicht nicht wahr herr leutnant he be gan thinking no doubt that the phenomenon was an ordinary form of aurora borealisâthe northern lightsâin other words a magnetic storm that would be over soon dummes rindsvieh snapped the herr leutnant who knew better by this time indeed he was to know still more at once for while he was speaking there came to his ear a low dull roar a sound he had heard once before far back in when the germans had retreated very much in a hurry beyond the marne panic seized him yes the sound was unmistak able the german army once more was in full re treatâno it was a routâa panicstricken rabble that made its way back rumors spread through the german ranks like lightning the news had spread among the men at the front that uncanny things were afoot that all communications had been an nihilated with one stroke that no orders could be sent or received except by prehistoric cour iers that the grosses kommando was cut off from the army and that in short the german army as far as communication was concerned had suddenly found itself a century back for what had happened to von unterrichter that morning hafl happened on a large scale not only to every one along the front but all over germany as well every train every trolley car every electric motor or dynamo every telephone every telegraph had been put out of commission with one stroke germany had been flung back into the days of na poleon every modern industry every means of trafficâexcept horsedrawn vehiclesâwere at a standstill for days the german retirement went on till on the fifteenth day the entire german army had retired behind the natural defenses of the rhine the victorious allies pressing the fleeing hordes back irresistibly and it must have been a bitter pill for the ger man highcommand to swallow when they saw that the allied fliers were constantly flying behind their own lines and that as the allies advanced their au tomobiles and their trains seemed to run as well as ever behind their own lines but no german suc ceeded in flying an aeroplane or in running an au tomobile that mysterious force obviously was trained only against them but was harmless behind the allied lines nor did the germans find out to this date what caused their undoing i cannot even now divulge the full details of the scheme of just how the germans were finally driven across the rhine that of course is a military secret but i am permitted to give an outline of just what happened on that memorable morning when the german army was flung back into the dark ages in teslas laboratory but first we must go back to teslas laboratory once more back to that evening when why sparks first overwhelmed tesla and his com panions with his idea this is in part what sparks said mr tesla in while you were making your now historic highfrequency experiments in col orado with your kilowatt generator you ob tained sparks feet in length the noise of these sparks was like a roaring niagara and these spark discharges were the largest and most wonderful produced by man down to this very day the prim ary coil of your oscillator measured feet in diam eter while you used amperes the voltage probably was over million now then in your book high frequency currents among other things you state that the current which you produced by means of this mammoth electric oscillator was so terrific that its effect was felt miles away al though there were no wires between your laboratory and the colorado electric light amp power co five miles distant your wireless energy burnt out several armatures of the large dynamo generators simply by long distance induction from your high frequency oscillator you subsequently raised such havoc with the lighting companys dynamos that you had to modify your experiments although you were over five miles away from the lighting com pany now if in twenty years ago you could do that why why cannot we go a step further in when we have at our command vastly more powerful generators and better machinery if you can burn out dynamo armatures miles distant with a paltry kilowatts why cannot we burn out every armature within a radius of miles or more sparks great project the primary coil of your oscillator in was feet in diameter why cannot we build a primary coil from the english channel down to switzerland paralleling the the above occurrences as well as the citcd experiments and effects of the tesla currents are actual facts checked by mr tesla himself who saw the original proofs of this storyâeditor the magnetic storm entire western front this is not such a foolish nor such a big undertaking as you might think my calculations show that if we were to string highly insulated copper wires onequarter inch thick on telegraph poles behind the front the problem would become a simple one ordinary telegraph poles can be used and each pole is to carry twenty wires begin ning three feet above the ground each wire is spaced two feet distant from the next one these wires run continuous from the sea to switzerland moreover every ten miles or so we place a huge kilowatt generating plant with its necessary spark gaps condensers etc the feed wires from these generating plants then run into the thick wires strung along the telegraph poles forming the gigantic tesla primary coil of course you realize that in a scheme of this kind it is not necessary to run the telegraph poles actually parallel with every curve of the actual front that would be a waste of material but we will build our line along a huge flat curve which will sometimes come to within one half mile of the front and sometimes it will be as much as fifteen miles behind it the total length of the line i estimate to be about miles that gives us generating plants or a total power of kilowatts a similar line is built along the italian front which is roughly one hundred miles long at present that gives us another kilowatts bringing the total up to now the import ant part is to project the resultant force from this huge tesla primary coil in one direction only namely that facing the enemy this i find can be readily accomplished by screening the wires on the telegraph poles at the side facing our way as well as by using certain impedance coils the screen is nothing else but ordinary thin wire netting fastened on a support wire between the telegraph poles this screen will then act as a sort of electric reflector so sparks demonstrated by means of one of his sketches everything completed we turn on the highfre quency current into our line from the sea to little switzerland immediately we shoot billions of volts over germany and austria penetrating every cor ner of the central empires every closed coil of wire throughout germany and austria be it a dynamo armature or a telephone receiver coil will be burnt out due to the terrific electromotive force set up inductively to our primary current in other words every piece of electrical apparatus or mach inery will become the secondary of our tesla coil no matter where located moreover the current is to be turned on in the day time only it is switched off during the night the night is made use of to ad vance the telegraph poles over the recaptured land ânew ones can be used with their huge primary coil wires for i anticipate that the enemy must fall back turning off the power does not work to our disadvantage for it is unreasonable to suppose that the teutons will be able to wind and install new coils and armatures to replace all the millions that were burnt out during the day such a thing is im possible besides once we get the germans moving it ought to be a simple matter to follow up our ad vantage for you must not forget that we will de stroy all their electrical communications with one stroke no aeroplane no automobile will move throughout the central states in other words we will create a titanic artificial magnetic storm such as the world has never seen but its effect will be vastly greater and more disastrous than any natural magnetic storm that ever visited this earth nor can the germans safeguard themselves against this electric storm any more than our telegraph com panies can when a real magnetic storm sweeps over the earth also every german telegraph or tele graph line in occupied france and belgium will be our ally these insulated metallic lines actually help us to guide our energy into the very heart of the enemys countries the more lines the better for us because all lines act as feed wires for our high frequency electrical torrents at nomeny near the frontier a few kilometers north of nancy in the de partment of meurthe et moselle there is a little town by the name of nomeny it is a progressive thrifty little french town of chief im portance principally for the reason that here for four years during the great war the french army has been nearer to the german frontier than at any other point with the exception of that small por tion of alsace actually in the hands of the french nomeny in the military sense is in the toul sec tor which sector early in was taken over by the americans if you happened to go up in a captive balloon near nomeny you could see the spires of the metz cathedral and the great german fortress but kilometers away always presuming that the air was clear and you had a good glass on a superb warm summer morning there were queer doings at a certain point in the outskirts of nomeny all of a sudden this point seemed to have become the center of interest of the entire french british and american armies since dawn the mili tary autos of numerous high allied officers had been arriving while the grayblue uniforms of the french officers were forever mixing with the businesslike khaki of the british and americans the visitors first gave their attention to the camouflaged oddlooking telegraph poles which resembled huge harps with the difference that the wires were running horizontally the telegraph line stretching from one end of the horizon to the other a few hundred yards back of this line there was an old brewery from which ran twenty thick wires connecting the brewery with the telegraph poles to this brewery the high officers next strolled an inspection here revealed a ponderous kilowatt generator purring almost silently on its shining brass plate was the legend made in u s a there was also a huge wheel with large queer round zinc pieces attached to the axis of this wheel was a big electric motor but it was not running now there were also dozens of huge glass jars on wooden racks lined against the wall pon derous copper cables connected the jars with the huge wheel one of the french officers who previous to the war had been an enthusiastic wireless amateur was much interested in the huge wheel and the large glass bottles aha said he turning to his ques tioning american confrere l eclateur rotatif et les bouteilles de leyde there was little satisfaction in this but just then amazing stories a redhaired tousled young man who seemed to be much at home in the brewery came over and ad justed something on the huge wheel what do you call all of these dofunnies our young officer asked of him pointing at the mysteri ous objects rotary spark gap and leyden jars was the laconic reply the officer nodded just then there was a big commotion the door flew open and a french officer standing at attention shouted impres sively le president de la republique the president of france arrives instantly every man stood erect at attention hand at the cap a few seconds later and presi dent poincare walked in slowly at his side general petain it was then five minutes to president poincare was introduced to the red haired tousled young man whom he addressed as monsieur sparks monsieur sparks speaking a much dilapidated french managed however to explain to his excellence all of the important machinery thanks to a sleepless night with a french dictionary monsieur poincare was much impressed and visibly moved when a french officer had gone over sparks ground and reexplained the finer details the president now takes his stand on an elevated platform near a huge switch which has an ebonite handle about a foot long he then addresses the distinguished assembly with a short speech all the while watching a dapper young french officer stand ing near him chronometer in hand somewhere a clock begins striking the hour of ten the president still speaks but finishes a few seconds later the distinguished assemblage ap plauds and cheers vociferously only to be stopped by the dapper young officer who slowly raises his right hand his eyes glued to the chronometer im mediate silence prevails only interrupted by the soft purring of the huge generator the dapper young officer suddenly sings out monsieur le president atention allez the president of the glorious french republic then shouts dramatically messieurs le jour de gloire est arrive viveâlaâfrance âand throws in the huge switch with its long ebon ite handle instantly the ponderous rotary spark gap begins to revolve with a dizzying speed while blinding blue white sparks

extremity of the proboscis suddently expand themselves and from them there proceeded a sound so loud and so expressive of woe that it struck upon my nerves like a knelland i fell at once fainting to the floor during the dread reign of the cholera in new york i had accepted the invita tion of a relative to spend a fortnight with him in the retirement of his cot tage orne on the banks of the hudson we had here around us all the ordinary means of summer amusement and what with rambling in the woods sketching boating fishing bathing music and books we should have passed the time pleasantly enough but for the fearful in telligence which reached us every morning from the popu lous city not a day elapsed which did not bring us news of the decease of some acquaint ance then as the fatality in creased we learned to expect daily the loss of some friend at length we trembled at the approach of every messenger this littleknown classic by edgar allan poe is chiefly interesting because it once more shows us how our senses are sometimes fooled and how nature often contrives to play some huge joke on us in this story poe takes as his vehicle the science of optics and with his usual facile pen he manages to excite your interest to a high pitch the denouement is as simple as it is startling the very air from the south seemed to us redolent with death that palsying thought indeed took en tire possession of my soul i could neither speak think nor dream of anything else my host was of a less excitable temperament and although greatly depressed in spirits exerted himself to sustain my own his richly philosophical intellect was not at any time affected by unrealities to the substances of terror he was sufficiently alive but of its shadows he had no apprehension his endeavors to arouse me from the condition of abnormal gloom into which i had fallen were frustrated in great meas ure by certain volumes which i had found in his library these were of a character to force into germination what ever seeds of hereditary super station lay latent in my bosom amazing stories i had been reading these books without his knowl edge and thus he was often at a loss to account for the forcible impression which had been made upon my fancy the popular belief in omens discussed a favorite topic with me was the popular belief in omens â a belief which at this one epoch of my life i was almost seriously disposed to defend on this subject we had long and animated discussions he maintaining the utter groundlessness of faith in such matters i contending that a popular sentiment arising with absolute spontaneityâthat is to say without apparent traces of suggestionsâhad in itself the unmistakable elements of truth and was entitled to much respect the fact is that soon after my arrival at the cottage there had occurred to myself an incident so entirely inexplicable and which had in it so much of the portentous character that i might well have been excused for regarding it an omen it appalled and at the same time so confounded and bewildered me that many days elapsed before i could make up my mind to communicate the circumstances to my friend an awful apparition near the close of an exceedingly warm day i was sitting book in hand at an open window commanding through a long vista of the river banks a view of a distant hill the face of which nearest my posi tion had been denuded by what is termed a land slide of the principal portion of its trees my thoughts had been long wandering from the volume before me to the gloom and desolation of the neigh boring city uplifting my eyes from the page they fell upon the naked face of the hill and upon an objectâupon some living monster of hideous con formationâwhich very rapidly made its way from the summit to the bottom disappearing finally in the dense forest below as this creature first came in sight i doubted my own sanity or at least the evidence of my own eyes and many minutes passed before i succeeded in convincing myself that i was neither mad nor in a dream yet when i describe the monster which i distinctly saw and calmly sur veyed through the whole period of its progress my readers i fear will feel more difficulty in being convinced of these points than even i did myself estimating the size of the creature by compari son with the diameter of the large trees near which it passedâthe few giants of the forest which had escaped the fury of the landslideâi concluded it to be far larger than any ship of the line in existence i say ship of the line because the shape of the monster suggested the idea the hull of one of our seventyfours might convey a very tolerable con ception of the general outline the mouth of the animal was situated at the extremity of a proboscis some sixty or seventy feet in length and about as thick as the body of an ordinary elephant near the root of this trunk was an immense quantity of black shaggy hairâmore than could have been sup plied by the coats of a score of buffaloes and pro jecting from his hair downwardly and laterally sprang two gleaming tusks not unlike those of the wild boar but of infinitely greater dimension ex tending forward parallel with the proboscis and on each side of it was a gigantic staff thirty or forty feet in length formed seemingly of pure crystal and in shape a perfect prismâit reflected in the most gorgeous manner the rays of the declining sun the trunk was fashioned like a wedge with the apex to the earth from it there were outspread two pairs of wingsâeach wing nearly one hundred yards in lengthâone pair being placed above the other and all thickly covered with metal scales each scale apparently some ten or twelve feet in diameter i observed that the upper and lower tiers of wings were connected by a strong chain but the chief peculiarity of this horrible thing was the repre sentation of a deaths head which covered nearly the whole surface of its breast and which was as accurately traced in glaring white upon the dark ground of the body as if it had been there carefully designed by an artist while i regarded this ani mal and more especially the appearance on its breast with a feeling of horror and aweâwith a sentiment of forthcoming evil which i found it im possible to quell by any effort of the reasonâi per cieved the huge jaws at the extremity of the pro boscis suddenly expand themselves and from them there proceeded a sound so loud and so expressive of woe that it struck upon my nerves like a knell and as the monster disappeared at the foot of the hill i fell at once fainting to the floor upon recovering my first impulse of course was to inform my friend of what i had seen and heardâ and i can scarcely explain what feeling of repug nance it was which in the end operated to pre vent me again terrorized by the apparition reappearing at length one evening some three or four days after the occurrence we were sitting to gether in the room in which i had seen the apparitionâi occupying the same seat at the same window and he lounging on a sofa near at hand the association of the place and time impelled me to give him an account of the phenomenon he heard me to the endâat first laughed heartily and then lapsed into an excessively grave demeanor as if my insanity was a thing beyond suspicion at this instant i again had a distinct view of the mon ster to which with a shout of absolute terror i now directed his attention he looked eagerly but main tained that he saw nothing although i designated minutely the course of the creature as it made its way down the naked face of the hill i was now immeasurably alarmed for i consid ered the vision either as an omen of my death or worse as the forerunner of an attack of mania i threw myself passionately back in my chair and for some moments buried my face in my hands when i uncovered my eyes the apparition was no longer visible my host however had in some degree resumed the calmness of his demeanor and questioned me very rigorously in respect to the conformation of the visionary creature when i had fully satisfied him on this head he sighed deeply as if relieved of some intolerable burden and went on to talk with what i thought a cruel calmness of various points of speculative philosophy which had heretofore formed a subject of discussion between us i re the sphinx member his insisting very especially among other things upon the idea that the principal source of error in all human investigations lay in the lia bility of the understanding to underrate or to over value the importance of an object through mere misadmeasurement of its propinquity to estimate properly for example he said the influence to be exercised on mankind at large by the thorough diffusion of democracy the distance of the epoch at which such diffusion may possibly be accom plished should not fail to form an item in the esti mate yet can you toll me one writer on the sub ject of government who has ever thought this particular branch of the subject worthy of dis cussion at all apparition identified and the occurrences explained he here paused for a moment stepped to a bookcase and brought forth one of the or dinary synopses of natural history re questing me then to exchange seats with him that he might the better distinguish the fine print of the volume he took my armchair at the window and opening the book resumed his discourse very much in the same tone as before but for your exceeding minuteness he said in describing the monster i might never had had it in my power to demonstrate to you what it was in the first place let me read to you a schoolboy ac count of the genus sphinx of the family crepus cularia of the order lepidoptera of the class of insectaâor insects the account runs thus four membranous wings covered with little colored scales of a metallic appearance mouth form ing a rolled proboscis produced by an elongation of the jaws upon the sides of which are found the rudiments of mandibles and downy palpi the in ferior wings retained to the superior by a stiff hair antennae in the form of an elongated club prismatic abdomen pointed the deathsheaded sphinx has occasioned much terror among the vul gar at times by the melancholy kind of cry which it utters and the insignia of death which it wears upon its corselet he here closed the book and leaned forward in the chair placing himself accurately in the position which i had occupied at the moment of beholding the monster ah here it is he presently exclaimed it is reascending the face of the hill and a very remark able looking creature i admit it to be still it is by no means so large or so distant as you imagined it for the fact is that as it wriggles its way up this thread which some spider has wrought along the window sash i find it to be about the sixteenth of an inch in its extreme length and also about the sixteenth of an inch distant from the pupil of my eye note acheronta atrotos of the sphingidae family of moths habitat europe and africaâed the end improvements you will note two big improvements in this issue of amazing stories we have had some suggestions as to the quality of the paper used and heeding the requests we are beginning with this issue to use a much better grade of paper as time goes on still better paper will be used then the other day some one on the pacific coast wrote in and complained that much as he liked amazing stories it was rather difficult to read it because you had to hold the magazine in your hand with a vicelike grip the usual magazines practically without exception are staplebound which binding clamps the edge of the magazine so tightly that when you lay it on the table in front of you it will not stay open we investigated the complaint and found it to be most reasonable we therefore took immediate ways and means to do away with the oldfashioned binding and you now hold in your hand a magazine bound with the socalled perfect binding you will note that you can lay this magazine down flat and it will stay open nevertheless the pages will not come off easily unless you tear them out forcibly the perfect binding process is a very much more expensive method of binding and only a few concerns in the country have the machinery necessary to do the perfect binding the machine itself is most inter esting it costs by the way over the process is as follows when all the pages and all the signatures are gathered the machine grasps them and cuts off the entire back of the magazine this means that all the pages are loose the pages that have been thus treated advance in the machine un til they meet a glueing apparatus whereby hot glue under pressure is forced against the cut pages the glue as will be noticed if a copy is carefully in spected impregnates the pages for a small distance traveling on the magazine is then encased in a piece of stiff gauze after which the cover is glued on the magazine is then automatically compressed and is soon ready for the freight car all of this goes on with lightninglike rapidity so quickly in fact that the eye can hardly follow the magazine through the various processes until a com pletely bound issue emerges from this latest of wonders the perfect binder that binds amazing stories is capable of turning out copies per hour this process is of course more expensive than the old type of stapling but we believe that the readers of amazing stories are entitled to the latest tech nical advances in magazine publishing and the conveni ences thereby brought about a trip to the center of the earth by jules verne author around the world in days off on a comet etc etc there is no lodger any water harry he answered but a kind of lava paste which is heaving us up in company with itself to the mouth of the crater the temperature was becoming utterly insupportable but for the extraordinary rapidity of our ascent we should have been stifled what went before professor hardwigg chemist philoso pher mineralogist etc while delighting in a rare old book by a famous iceland author comes upon a mysterious parchment containing a secret message the professor and his nephew harry have deciphered it descend into the crater of the yokul of sneffels which the shade of scar taris covers before the kalends of july audacious traveler and you will reach the center of the earth i did itâarne saknussem the professor and harry in the case of the lat ter much against his will and better judgment start for iceland and mount sneffels with the good wishes of gretchen the professors ward and harrys fiancee in iceland they very fortunately obtain the services of hans a true icelandic guide âcalm stolid and depaendble after numerous ad ventures and many interesting encounters and diffi cult climbing they reach mount sneffels and descend into its crater they go deeper and deeper lower ing themselves into the bigger shafts by means of sturdy ropes doubled over the rocks above once now they were reassured of the validity of the mysterious message when they noticed the inscription arne saknussem on some rocks also they see all kinds of rock formations gypsum stal actites and stalagmites etc in their desperate search for a spring they hear and tap a tremendous torrent of hot water which for a time also acts as a guide to them in their descent then to cap it all harry strays from his companions and in his attempt to rejoin them gets hopelessly lost when he has about given up all hope of finding his com panions or of being found he hears voices and dis covers a whispering gallery thus they are able to communicate with each other and after some calcu lation they effect a reunion they continue on their way until they come to an enormous expanse of waterâthe central sea hans succeeds in building a raft and they start off for an other shore but they meet some huge sea monsters among other dangers and after many days on the water cannot see any signs of a shore and then by means of a terrific hurricane and storm they are very rudely brought back to a point on the same side from which they started there were lots of time lost but they are not discouraged while hans is repairing the raft professor hardwigg and harry go off on a tour of further discovery and they are not disappointed new wonders unfold them selves at every turn a trip to the center of the earth jules verne part iii chapter xxxvi what is it for a long and weary hour we tramped over this great bed of bones we advanced re gardless of everything drawn on by ardent curiosity what other marvels did this great cavern containâwhat other wondrous treasures for the scientific man my eyes were quite prepared for any number of surprises my imagination lived in expectation of something new and wonderful the borders of the great central ocean had for some time disappeared behind the hills that were scattered over the ground occupied by the plain of bones the imprudent and enthusiastic profes sor who did not care whether he lost himself or not hurried me forward we advanced silently bathed in waves of elec tric fluid the light illumined equally the sides of every hill and rock the appearance presented was that of a tropical country at midday in summerâ in the midst of the equatorial regions and under the vertical rays of the sun the rocks the distant mountains some confused masses of faroff forests assumed a weird and mysterious aspect under this equal distribution of the luminous fluid we re error the author was adelbert van chamisso jules vernes great romance is concluded in this issue it is possible that some of our readers may find fault with the vehicle that verne chose to bring back the travelers from the earths interior but it should be re membered that back they had to come and we know of no better method than the one which verne chose at least it is logical although the chances are that our heroes would not have survived such an ordeal but we should not be too critical on such points for the story certainly is and remains one of the great classics of scientifiction some of the most breathless and hairraising episodes occur in the closing chapters sembled to a certain extent the mysterious person age in one of hoffmanns fantastic talesâthe man who lost his shadow after we had walked about a mile farther we came to the edge of a vast forest not however one of the vast mushroom forests we had discovered near port gretchen it was the glorious and wild vegetation of the tertiary period in all its superb magnificence huge palms of a species now un known superb palmacitesâa genus of fossil palms from the coal formationâ pines yews cypress and conifers or conebearing trees the whole bound to gether by an inextricable and complicated mass of creeping plants a beau tiful carpet of mosses and ferns grew beneath the trees pleasant brooks murmured beneath um brageous boughs little worthy of this name for no shade did they give upon their borders grew small treelike shrubs such as are seen in the hot countries on our own inhabited globe the one thing wanted to these plants these shrubs these treesâwas color forever deprived of the vivifying warmth of the sun they were vapid and colorless all shade was lost in one uniform tint of a brown and faded character the leaves were wholly devoid of green and the flowers so amazing stories numerous during the tertiary period which gave them birth were without color and without per fume something like paper discolored by long ex posure to the atmosphere a herd of mastodons my uncle ventured beneath the gigantic groves i followed him though not without a certain amount of apprehension since nature had shown herself capable of producing such stupendous vegetable productions why might we not meet with animals as large and therefore dangerous suddenly i stopped short and restrained my uncle the extreme diffuseness of the light en abled me to see the smallest objects in the distant copse i thought i sawâno i really did see with my own eyesâimmense gigantic animals moving about under the mighty trees yes they were truly gigantic animals a whole herd of mastodons not fossils but living yes i could see these enormous elephants whose trunks were tearing down large boughs and work ing in and out the trees like a legion of serpents i could hear the sounds of the mighty tusks up rooting huge trees the boughs crackled and whole masses of leaves and green branches went down the capacious throats of these terrible mon sters that wondrous dream when i saw the antehis torical times revivified when the tetiary and quat ernary periods passed before me was now realized and there we were alone far down in the bowels of the earth at the mercy of its ferocious inhabi tants my uncle paused full of wonder and astonish ment come he said at last when his first sur prise was over come along my boy and let us see them nearer no replied i restraining his efforts to drag me forward we are wholly without arms what should we do in the midst of that flock of gigantic quadrupeds come away uncle i implore you no human creature can with impunity brave the feroc ious anger of these monsters no human creature said my uncle suddenly lowering his voice to a mysterious whisper you are mistaken my dear harry look look yonder it seems to me that i behold a human beingâa be ing like ourselvesâa man a dream of prehistoric ages i looked shrugging my shoulders and decided to push incredulity to its very last limits but whatever might have been my wish i was com pelled to yield to the weight of ocular demonstration yesânot more than a quarter of a mile off leaning against the trunk of an enormous tree was a hu man beingâa proteus of these subterranean re gions a new son of neptune keeping this innumer able herd of mastodons immanis pecoris custos immanior ipse the keeper of gigantic cattle him self a giant yesâit was no longer a fossil whose corpse we had raised from the ground in the great cemetery but a giant capable of guiding and driv ing these prodigious monsters his height was above twelve feet his head as big as the head of a buffalo was lost in a mane of matted hair it was indeed a huge mane like those which belonged to the elephants of the earlier ages of the world in his hand was a branch of a tree which served as a crook for this antediluvian shepherd we remained profoundly still speechless with surprise but we might at any moment be seen by him nothing remained for us but instant flight come come i cried dragging my uncle along and for the first time he made no resistance to my wishes a quarter of an hour later we were far away from that terrible monster now that i think of the matter calmly and reflect upon it dispassionately now that months years have passed since this strange and unnatural adventure befell us what am i to think what am i to believe no it is utterly impossible our ears must have deceived us and our eyes have cheated us we have not seen what we believed we had seen no hu man being could by any possibility have existed in that subterranean world no generation of men could inhabit the lower caverns of the globe with out taking note of those who peopled the surface without communication with them it was folly folly folly nothing else i am rather inclined to admit the existence of some animal resembling in structure the human raceâof some monkey of the first geological epochs like that discovered by m lartet in the os siferous deposits of sansan but this animal or being whichsoever it was surpassed in height all things known to modern science never mind however unlikely it may be it might have been a monkeyâbut a man a living man and with him a whole generation of gigantic animals buried in the entrails of the earthâit was too monstrous to be believed chapter xxxvii the mysterious dagger during this time we had left the bright and transparent forest far behind us we were mute with astonishment overcome by a kind of feeling which was next door to apathy we kept running in spite of ourselves it was a per fect flight which resembled one of those horrible sensations we sometimes meet with in our dreams instinctively we made our way towards the cen tral sea and i cannot now tell what wild thoughts passed through my mind nor of what follies i might have been guilty but for a very serious pre occupation which brought me back to practical life though i was aware that we were treading on a soil quite new to us i every now and then noticed certain aggregation of rock the shape of which forcibly reminded me of those near port gretchen this confirmed moreover the indications of the compass and our extraordinary and unlookedfor as well as involuntary return to the north of this great central sea it was so like our starting point that i could scarcely doubt the reality of our posi tion streams and cascades fell in hundreds over the numerous projections of the rocks i actually thought i could see our faithful and monotonous hans and the wonderful grotto in which i have come back to life after my tremendous fall a trip to the center of the earth then as we advanced still farther the position of the cliffs the appearance of a stream the unex pected profile of a rock would throw me again into a state of bewildering doubt after some time i explained my state of mental indecision to my uncle he confessed to a similar feeling of hesita tion he was totally unable to make up his mind in the midst of this extraordinary but uniform panorama there can be no doubt i insisted that we have not landed exactly at the place whence we first took our departure but the tempest has brought us above our starting point i think there fore that if we follow the coast we shall once more find port gretchen in that case cried my uncle it is useless to continue our exploration the very best thing we can do is to make our way back to the raft are you quite sure harry that you are not mistaken it is difficult was my reply to come to any decision for all these rocks are exactly alike there is no marked difference between them at the same time the impression on my mind is that i recognize the promontory at the foot of which our worthy hans constructed the raft we are i am nearly convinced near the little port if this is not it i added carefully examining a creek which ap peared singularly familiar to my mind my dear harryâif this were the case we should find traces of our own footsteps some signs of our passage and i can really see nothing to indi cate our having passed this way a rusty dagger is found deep in the earth but i see something i cried in an impetu ous tone of voice as i rushed forward and eagerly picked up something which shone in the sand under my feet what is it cried the astonished and bewildered professor this was my reply and i handed to my startled relative a rusty dagger of singular shape what made you bring with you so useless a weapon he exclaimed it was needlessly hamp ering yourself i bring itâit is quite new to me i never saw it beforeâare you sure it is not out of your collec tion not that i know of said the professor puzzled i have no recollection of the circumstance it was never my property this is very extraordinary i said musing over the novel and singular incident not at all there is a very simple explanation harry the icelanders are known to keep up the use of these antiquated weapons and this must have belonged to hans who has let it fall without know ing it i shook my head that dagger had never been in the possession of the pacific and taciturn hans i knew him and his habits too well what can it beâunless it be the weapon of some antediluvian warrior i continued of some living man a con temporary of that mighty shepherd from whom we have just escaped but noâmystery upon mystery âthis is no weapon of the stone epoch nor even of the bronze period it is made of excellent steel it is saknussems dagger ere i could finish my sentence my uncle stop ped me short from entering upon a whole train of theories and spoke in his most cold and decided tone of voice calm yourself my dear boy and endeavor to use your reason this weapon upon which we have fallen so unexpectedly is a true dague one of those worn by gentlemen in their belts during the sixteenth century its use was to give the coup de grace the final blow to the foe who would not surrender it is clearly of spanish work manship it belongs neither to you nor to me nor the eiderdown hunter nor to any of the living be ings who may still exist so marvelously in the in terior of the earth what can you mean uncle i said now lost in a host of surmises look closely at it he continued these jagged edges were never made by the resistance of human blood and bone the blade is covered with a reg ular coating of ironmould and rust which is not a day old not a year old not a century old but much moreâ the professor began to get quite excited ac cording to custom and was allowing himself to be carried away by his fertile imagination i could have said something he stopped me harry he cried we are now on the verge of a great discov ery this blade of a dagger you have so marvelous ly discovered after being abandoned upon the sand for more than a hundred two hundred even three hundred years has been indented by someone en deavoring to carve an inscription on these rocks but this poignard never got here of itself i exclaimed it could not have twisted itself some one therefore must have preceded us upon the shores of this extraordinary sea yes a man but what man has been sufficiently desperate to do such a thing a man who has somewhere written his name with this very daggerâa man who has endeavored once more to indicate the right road to the interior of the earth let us look around my boy you know not the importance of your singular and happy discovery prodigiously interested we walked along the wall of rock examining the smallest fissures which might finally expand into the much wished for gully or shaft we at last reached a spot where the shore became extremely narrow the sea almost bathed the foot of the rocks which were here very lofty and steep there was scarcely a path wider than two yards at any point at last under a huge over hanging rock we discovered the entrance of a dark and gloomy tunnel there on a square tablet of granite which had been smoothed by rubbing it with another stone we could see two mysterious and much worn letters the two initials of the bold and extraordinary trav eler who had preceded us on our adventurous jour ney arne saknussem a s cried my uncle you see i was right arne saknussem always arne saknussem amazing stories chapter xxxviii no outletâblasting the rock ever since the commencement of our marvel ous journey i had experienced many sur prises had suffered from many illusions i thought that i was casehardened against all sur prises and could neither see nor hear anything to amaze me again however when i saw these two letters which had been engraved three hundred years before i stood fixed in an attitude of mute surprise not only was there the signature of the learned and enterprising alchemist written in the rock but i held in my hand the identical instrument with which he had laboriously engraved it it was im possible without showing an amount of incredulity scarcely becoming a sane man to deny the existence of the traveler and the reality of that voyage which i believed all along to have been a mythâthe mysti fication of some fertile brain while these reflections were passing through my mind my uncle the professor gave way to an ac cess of feverish and poetical excitement wonder ful and glorious genius great saknussem he cried you have omitted no resourse to show to other mortals the way into the interior of our mighty globe and your fellowcreatures can find the trail left by your illustrious footsteps three hundred years ago you have been careful to secure for others the contemplation of these wonders and marvels of creation your name engraved at every important stage of your glorious journey leads the hopeful traveler direct to the mighty discovery to which you devoted such energy and courage the audacious traveler who shall follow your footsteps to the last will doubtless find your initials engraved with your own hand upon the center of the earth i will be that audacious travelerâi too will sign my name upon the very same spot upon the central granite stone of this wondrous work of the creator but in justice to your devotion and to your being the first to indicate the road let this cape seen by you upon the shores of this sea discovered by you be called for all time cape saknussem this is what i heard and i began to be roused to the pitch of enthusiasm indicated by those words a fierce excitement roused me i forgot everything the dangers of the voyage and the perils of the re turn journey were now as nothing what another man had done in ages past could i felt be done again i was determined to do it myself and now nothing that man had accomplished appeared to me impossible forwardâforward i cried in a burst of genuine and hearty enthusiasm where the raft brought them i had already started in the direction of the somber and gloomy gallery when the profes sor stopped me he the man so rash and hasty he the man so easily roused to the highest pitch of anthusiasm checked me and asked me to be patient and show more calm let us return to our good friend hans he said we will then bring the raft down to this place i must say that though i at once yielded to my uncles request it was not without dissatisfaction and i hastened along the rocks of that wonderful coast do you know my dear uncle i said as we walked along that we have been singularly helped by a concurrence of circumstances right up to this very moment so you begin to see it do you harry said the professor with a smile doubtless i responded and strangely enough even the tempest has been the means of putting us on the right road blessings on the tempest it brought us safely back to the very spot from which fine weather would have driven us forever sup posing we had succeeded in reaching the southern and distant shores of this extraordinary sea what would have become of us the name of saknussem would never have appeared to us and at this mo ment we should have been cast away upon an in hospitable coast probably without an outlet yes harry my boy there is certainly some thing providential in that wandering at the mercy of wind and waves towards the south we have come back exactly north and what is better still we fall upon this great discovery there is something in it which is far beyond my comprehension the coincidence is unheardof marvelous what matter it is not our duty to explain facts but to make the best possible use of them doubtless my boy but if you will allow me said the reallydelighted professor a discussion of geography excuse me sir but i see exactly how it will be we shall take the northern route we shall pass under the northern regions of europe under sweden under russia under siberia and who knows hereâinstead of burying ourselves under the burning plains and deserts of africa or beneath the mighty waves of the ocean and that is all at this stage of our journey that i care to know let us advance and heaven will be our guide yes harry you are right quite right all is for the best let us abandon this horizontal sea which could never have led to anything satisfactory we shall descend descend and everlastingly de scend do you know my dear boy that to reach the interior of the earth we have only five thousand miles to travel bah i cried carried away by a burst of en thusiasm the distance is scarcely worth speaking about the thing is to make a start my wild mad and incoherent speeches continued until we rejoined our patient and phlegmatic guide all was we found prepared for an immediate de parture there was not a single parcel out of its proper place we all took up our posts on the raft and the sail being hoisted hans received his direc tions and guided the frail barque towards cape saknussem as we had definitely named it the wind was very unfavorable to a craft that was unable to sail close to the wind we were con tinually reduced to pushing ourselves forward by means of poles on several occasions the rocks ran far out into deep water and we were compelled to make a long round at last after three long and weary hours of navigation that is to say about six oclock in the evening we found a place at which we could land i jumped on shore first in my present state of excitement and enthusiasm i was always first my a trip to the center of the earth uncle and the icelander followed the voyage from the port to this point of the sea had by no means calmed me it had rather produced the opposite effect i even proposed to burn our vessel that is to destroy our raft in order to completely cut off our retreat but my uncle sternly opposed this wild project i began to think him particularly luke warm and unenthusiastic at any rate my dear uncle i said let us start without delay yes my boy i am quite as eager to do so as you can be but in the first place let us examine this mysterious gallery in order to find if we shall need to prepare and mend our ladders my uncle now began to see to the efficiency of our ruhmkorfs coil which would doubtless soon be needed the raft securely fastened to a rock was left alone the opening into the new gallery was not twenty paces distant from the spot our little troop with myself at the head advanced their journey blocked by a great rock the orifice which was almost circular pre sented a diameter of about five feet the som ber tunnel was cut in the living rock and coated on the inside by the different material which had once passed through it in a state of fusion the lower part was about level with the water so that we were able to penetrate to the interior without difficulty we followed an almost horizontal direc tion when at the end of about a dozen paces our further advance was checked by the interposition of an enormous block of granite rock accursed stone i cried furiously on perceiv ing that we were stopped by what seemed an insur mountable obstacle in vain we looked to the right in vain we looked to the left in vain examined it above and below there existed no passage no sign of any other tun nel i experienced the most bitter and painful dis appointment so enraged was i that i would not admit the reality of any obstacle i stooped to my knees i looked under the mass of stone no hole no interstice i then looked above the same bar rier of granite hans with the lamp examined the sides of the tunnel in every direction but all in vain it was necessary to renounce all hope of pass ing through i had seated myself upon the ground my uncle walked angrily and hopelessly up and down he was evidently desperate but i cried after some mo ments thought what about arne saknussem you are right replied my uncle he can never have been checked by a lump of rock noâten thousand times no i cried with ex treme vivacity this huge lump of rock in conse quence of some concussion has in some unexpected way closed up the passage many and many years have passed away since the return of saknussem and the fall of this huge block of granite is it not quite evident that this gallery was formerly the out let for the pentup lava in the interior of the earth and that these eruptive matters then circulated freely look at these recent fissures in the granite roof it is evidently formed of pieces of enormous stone placed here as if by the hand of a giant who had worked to make a strong and substantial arch one day after an unusually heavy shock the vast rock which stands in our way fell through to a level with the soil and has barred our further pro gress we are right then in thinking that this is an unexpected obstacle with which saknussem did not meet and if we do not upset it in some way we are unworthy of following in the footsteps of the great discoverer and incapable of finding our way to the center of the earth in this wild way i addressed my uncle the zeal of the professor his earnest longing for success had become part and parcel of my being i wholly forgot the past i utterly despised the future noth ing existed for me upon the surface of this spheroid in the bosom of which i was engulfed no towns no country no hamburg no konigstrasse not even my poor gretchen who by this time would believe me utterly lost in the interior of the earth well cried by uncle roused to enthusiasm by my words let us go to work with pickaxes with crowbars with anything that comes to handâbut down with these terrible walls it is far too tough and too big to be destroyed by a pickax or crowbar i replied what then as i said it is useless to think of overcoming such a difficulty by means of ordinary tools what then what else but gunpowder a subterranean mine let us blow up the obstacle that stands in our way gunpowder yes all we have to do is to get rid of this paltry obstacle to work hans to work cried the professor the icelander went back to the raft and soon re turned with a huge crowbar with which he began to dig a hole in the rock which was to serve as a mine it was by no means a slight task it was necessary for our purpose to make a cavity large enough to hold fifty pounds of fulminating gun cot ton the expansive power of which is four times as great as that of ordinary gunpowder i had now roused myself to an almost miraculous state of excitement while hans was at work i ac tively assisted my uncle to prepare a long wick made from damp gunpowder the mass of which we finally enclosed in a bag of linen we are bound to go through i cried enthusiastically we are bound to go through responded the professor tapping me on the back at midnight our work as miners was completely finished the charge of fulminating cotton was thrust into the hollow and the match which we had made of considerable length was ready a spark was now sufficient to ignite this formidable engine and to blow the rock to atoms we will now rest until tomorrow it was absolutely necessary to resign myself to my fate and to consent to wait for the explosion for six weary hours chapter xxxix the explosion and its results the next day which was the twentyseventh of august was a date celebrated in our won drous subterranean journey i never think of it even now but i shudder with horror my heart beats wildly at the very memory of that awful day from this time forward our amazing stories reason our judgment our human ingenuity had nothing to do with the course of events we were about to become the playthings of the great pheno mena of the earth at six oclock we were all up and ready the dreaded moment was arriving when we were about to seek an opening into the interior of the earth by means of gunpowder what would be the conse quences of breaking through the crust of the earth i begged that it might be my duty to set fire to the mine i looked upon it as an honor this task once performed i could rejoin my friends upon the raft which had not been unloaded as soon as we were all ready we were to sail away to some dis tance to avoid the consequences of the explosion the effects of which would certainly not be concen trated in the interior of the earth the slow match we calculated to burn for about ten minutes more or less before it reached the chamber in which the great body of powder was confined i should there fore have plenty of time to reach the raft and put off to a safe distance after a hearty repast my uncle and the hunter guide embarked on board the raft while i remained alone upon the desolate shore i was provided with a lantern which was to enable me to set fire to the wick of the infernal machine go my boy said my uncle and heaven be with you but come back as soon as you can i shall be all impatience be easy on that matter i replied there is no fear of my delaying on the road having said this i advanced toward the opening of the sombre gal lery my heart beat wildly i opened my lantern and seized the extremity of the wick the professor who was looking on held his chronometer in his hand are you ready cried he quite ready well then fire away i hastened to put the light to the wick which crackled and sparkled hiss ing and spitting like a serpent then running as fast as i could i returned to the shore get on board my lad and you hans shove off cried my uncle by a vigorous application of his pole hans sent us flying over the water the raft was quite twenty fathoms distant it was a moment of palpitating interest of deep anxiety my uncle the professor never took his eyes off the chronometer only five minutes more he said in a low tone only four only three my pulse went a hundred to the minute i could hear my heart beating only two one now then mountains of gran ite crumble beneath the power of man the explosion what happened after that as to the ter rific roar of the explosion i do not think i heard it but the form of the rocks com pletely changed in my eyesâthey seemed to be drawn aside like a curtain i saw fathomless a bottomless abyss which yawned beneath the turgid waves the sea which seemed suddenly to have gone mad then became one great mountainous mass upon the top of which the raft rose perpendicularly we were all thrown down the light gave place to the most profound obscurity then i felt all solid support give way not to my feet but to the raft itself i thought it was going bodily down a tremendous well i tried to speak to question my uncle nothing could be heard but the roaring of the mighty waves wo clung together in utter silence despite the awful darkness despite the noise the surprise the emotion i thoroughly understood what had happened beyond the rock which had been blown up there existed a mighty abyss the ex plosion had caused a kind of earthquake in this soil broken by fissures and rents the gulf thus suddenly thrown open was about to swallow the inland sea which transformed into a mighty tor rent was dragging us with it one only idea filled my mind we were utterly and completely lost one hour two hoursâwhat more i cannot say passed in this manner we sat close together el bow touching elbow knee touching knee we held one anothers hands not to be thrown off the raft we were subjected to the most violent shocks whenever our sole dependence a frail wooden raft struck against the rocky sides of the channel fortunately for us these concussions became less and less frequent which made me fancy that the gallery was getting wider and wider there could be no doubt that we had chanced upon the road once followed by saknussem but instead of going down in a proper manner we had through our own im prudence drawn a whole sea with us these ideas presented themselves to my mind in a very vague and obscure manner i felt rather than reasoned i put my ideas together only confusedly while spinning along like a man going down a waterfall to judge by the air which as it were whipped my face we must have been rushing at a perfectly lightning rate to attempt under these circumstancse to light a torch was simply impossible and the last remains of our electric machine of our ruhmkorfs coil had been destroyed during the fearful explosion i was therefore very much confused to see at last a bright light shining close to me the calm coun tenance of the guide seemed to gleam upon me the clever and patient hunter had succeeded in lighting the lantern and though in the keen and thorough draught the flame flickered and vacillated and was very nearly put out it served partially to dissipate the awful obscurity the gallery into which we had entered was very wide i was therefore quite right in that part of my conjecture the insufficient light did not allow us to see both of the walls at the same time the slope of waters which was carrying us away was far greater than that of the most rapid river the whole surface of the stream seemed to be composed of liquid arrows darted forward with extreme vio lence and power i can give no idea of the impres sion it made upon me all instruments lost except the compass and chronometer the raft at times caught in certain whirl pools and rushed forward yet turned on it self all the time how it did not upset i shall never be able to understand when it approached the sides of the gallery i took care to throw upon them the light of the lantern and i was able to a trip to the center of the earth judge of the rapidity of motion by looking at the projecting masses of rock which as soon as seen were again invisible i believe we were going at a rate of not less than a hundred miles an hour my uncle and i looked at one another with wild and haggard eyes we clung convulsively to the stump of the mast which at the moment when the catastrophe took place had snapped short off we turned our backs as much as possible to the wind in order not to be stifled by a rapidity of motion which nothing human could face and live and still the long monotonous hours went on the situation did not change in the least though a dis covery i suddenly made seemed to complicate it very much when we had slightly recovered our equili brium i proceeded to examine our cargo i then made the unsatisfactory discovery that the greater part of it had utterly disappeared i became alarmed and determined to discover what were our resources my heart beat at the idea but it was absolutely necessary to know on what we had to depend with this in view i took the lantern and looked around of all our former collection of nautical and phil osophical instruments there remained only the chronometer and the compass the ladders and ropes were reduced to a small piece of rope fastened to the stump of the mast not a pickax not a crow bar not a hammer and far worse than all no food ânot enough for one day i this discovery was a prelude to a certain and horrible death seated gloomily on the raft clasp ing the stump of the mast mechanically i thought of all i had read as to sufferings from starvation i remembered everything that history had taught me on the subject and i shuddered at the remem brance of the agonies to be endured maddened at the prospect i persuaded myself that i must be mis taken i examined the cracks in the raft i poked between the joints and beams i examined every possible hole and corner the result wasâsimply nothing our stock of provisions consisted of noth ing but a piece of dry meat and some soaked and halfmouldy biscuits i gazed around me scared and frightened i could not understand the awful truth and yet of what consequence wras it in regard to any new danger supposing that we had had provisions for months and even for years how could we ever get out of the awful abyss into which we were being hurled by the irresistible torrent we had let loose why should we trouble ourselves about the sufferings and tor tures to be endured from hunger when death stared us in the face under so many other swifter and perhaps even more horrid forms an alarming ascent through a great shaft i had the greatest mind to reveal all to my uncle to explain to him the extraordinary and wretched position to which we were re duced and in order that between the two we might make a calculation as to the exact space of time which remained for us to live it was it appeared to me the only thing to be done but i had the courage to hold my tongue to gnaw at my entrails like the spartan boy i wished to leave him all his coolness at this moment the light of the lantern slowly fell and at last went out the wick had wholly burnt to an end the obscurity became absolute it was no longer possible to see through the impene trable darkness there was one torch left but it was impossible to keep it alight then like a child i shut my eyes that i might not see the darkness after a great lapse of time the rapidity of our journey increased i could feel it by the rush of air upon my face the slope of the waters was ex cessive i began to feel that we were no longer go ing down a slope we were falling i felt as one does in a dream going down bodilyâfalling falling falling i felt that the hands of my uncle and hans were vigorously clasping my arms suddenly after a lapse of time scarcely appreciable i felt something like a shock the raft had not struck a hard body but had suddenly been checked in its course a water spout a liquid column of water fell upon us i was suffocating i was being drowned still the sud den inundation did not last in a few seconds i felt myself once more able to breathe my uncle and hans pressed my arms and the raft carried us all three away chapter xl the ape gigans it is difficult for me to determine what was the the real time but i should suppose by after calculation that it must have been ten at night i lay in a stupor a half dream during which i saw visions of astounding character monsters of the deep were side by side with the mighty elephan tine shepherd gigantic fish and animals formed strange conjunctions it seemed in my vision that the raft took a sudden turn whirled round entered another tunnel this time illumined in a most sing ular manner the roof was formed of porous stal actite through which a moonlit vapor appeared to pass casting its brilliant light upon our gaunt and haggard figures the light increased as we ad vanced while the roof ascended until at last we were once more in a kind of water cavern the lofty dome of which disappeared in a luminous cloud my uncle and the guide moved as men in a dream i was afraid to waken them knowing the danger of such a sudden start i seated myself beside them to watch as i did so i became aware of something moving in the distance which at once fascinated my eyes it was floating apparently upon the surface of the water advancing by means of what at first appeared paddles i looked with glaring eyes one glance told me that it was something monstrous but what it was the great shark crocodile of the early writers on geology about the size of an ordinary whale with hideous jaws and two gigantic eyes it advanced its eyes fixed on me with terrible sternness some indefinite warning told me that it had marked me for its own i attempted to riseâto escape no matter where but my knees shook under me my limbs trembled violently i almost lost my senses and still the mighty monster advanced my uncle and the guide made no effort to save themselves with a strange noise like none other i had ever heard the beast came on his jaws were at least seven feet apart amazing stories and his distended mouth looked large enough to have swallowed a boatful of men we were about ten feet distant when i discov ered that much as his body resembled that of a crocodile his mouth was wholly that of a shark his twofold nature now became apparent to snatch us up at mouthful it was necessary for him to turn on his back which motion necessarily caused his legs to kick up helplessly in the air i actually laughed even in the very jaws of death but next minute with a wild cry i darted away into the interior of the cavern leaving my unhappy comrades to their fate this cavern was deep and dreary after about a hundred yards i paused and looked around the whole floor composed of sand and malachite was strewn with bones freshly gnawed bones of reptiles and fish with a mixture of mamalia my very soul grew sick as my body shud dered with horror i had truly according to the old proverb fallen out of the fryingpan into the fire some beast larger and more ferocious even than the sharkcrocodile inhabited this den what could i do the mouth of the cave was guarded by one ferocious monster the interior was inhabited by something too hideaus to contemplate flight was impossible suddenly a groaning as of fifty bears in a fight fell upon my earsâhisses spitting moaning hideous to hear â and then i sawâ a dreadful dream of the antidiluvian gorilla never were ages to pass over my head shall i forget the horrible apparition it was the ape gigans the antidiluvian gorilla four teen feet high covered with coarse hair of a black ish brown it advanced its arms were as long as its body while its legs were prodigious it had thick long and sharplypointed teethâlike a mammoth saw it struck its breast as it came on smelling and sniffing reminding me of the stories we read in our early childhood of giants who ate the flesh of men and little boys suddenly it stopped my heart beat wildly for i was conscious that somehow or other the fearful monster had smelt me out and was peering about with his hideous eyes to try and discover my where abouts i gave myself up for lost no hope of safety or escape seemed to remain at this moment just as my eyes appeared to close in death there came a strange noise from the en trance of the cave and turning the gorilla evi dently recognized some enemy more worthy his pro digious size and strength it was the huge shark crocodile which perhaps having disposed of my friends was coming in search of further prey the gorilla placed himself on the defensive and clutching a bone some seven or eight feet in length a perfect club aimed a deadly blow at the hideous beast which reared upwards and fell with all its weight upon its adversary a terrible combat en sued the struggle was awful and ferocious i did not wait to witness the result regarding my self as the object of contention i determined to remove from the presence of the victor i slid down from my hidingplace reached the ground and glid ing against the wall strove to gain the open mouth of the cavern but i had not taken many steps when the fearful clamor ceased to be followed by a mumbling and groaning which appeared to be indi cative of victory i looked back and saw the huge ape gory with blood coming after me with glaring eyes with di lated nostrils that gave forth two columns of heat ed vapor i could feel his hot and fetid breath on my neck and with a horrid jumpâawoke from my nightmare sleep yesâit was all a dream i was still on the raft with my uncle and the guide the relief was not instantaneous for under the influence of the hideous nightmare my senses had become numbed after a while however my feel ings were tranquilized the first of my perceptions which returned in full force was that of hearing i listened with acute and attentive ears all was still as death all i comprehended was silence to the roaring of the waters which had filled the gallery with awful reverberations succeeded perfect peace after some little time my uncle spoke in a low and scarcely audible toneâharry boy where are you i am here was my faint rejoinder well dont you see what has happened we are going upwards my dear uncle what can you mean was my half delirious reply yes i tell you we are ascending rapidly our downward journey is quite checked the ascent continues i held out my hand and after some little diffi culty succeeded in touching the wall my hand was in an instant covered with blood the skin was torn from the flesh we were ascend ing with extraordinary rapidity the torchâthe torch cried the professor wildly it must be lighted hans the guide after many vain efforts at last succeeded in lighting it and the flame having now nothing to prevent its burning shed a tolerably clear light we were en abled to form an approximate idea of the truth it is just as i thought said my uncle after ai moment or two of silent attention we are in a narrow well about four fathoms square the waters of the great inland sea having reached the bottom of the gulf are now forcing themselves up the migh ty shaft as a natural consequence we are being cast up on the summit of the waters that i can see was my lugubrious reply but where will this shaft end and to what fall are we likely to be exposed of that i am as ignorant as yourself all i know is that we should be prepared for the worst we are going up at a fearfully rapid rate as far as i can judge we are ascending at the rate of two fathoms a second of a hundred and twenty fathoms a minute or rather more than three and a half leagues an hour at this rate our fate will soon be a matter of certainty no doubt of it was my reply the great con cern i have now however is to know whether this shaft has any issue it may end in a granite roofâ in which case we shall be suffocated by compressed a trip to the center of the earth air or dashed to atoms against the top i fancy already that the air is beginning to be close and condensed i have a difficulty in breathing this might have been fancy or it might have been the effect of our rapid motion but i certainly felt a great oppression of the chest harry said the professor i do believe that the situation is to a certain extent desperate there remain however many chances of ultimate safety and i have in my own mind been revolving them during your heavy but agitated sleep i have come to this logical conclusionâwhereas we may at any moment perish so at any moment we may be saved we need therefore to prepare ourselves for what ever may turn up in the great chapter of accidents but what would you have us do i cried are we not utterly helpless no while there is life there is hope at all events there is one thing we can doâeat and thus obtain strength to face victory or death as he spoke i looked at my uncle with a haggard glance i had put off the fatal communication as long as possible it was now forced upon me and i must tell him the truth still i hesitated eat i said in a deprecating tone as if there were no hurry yes and at once i feel like a starving pris oner he said rubbing his yellow and shivering hands together and turning round to the guide he spoke some hearty cheering words as i judged from his tone in danish hans shook his head in a terribly significant manner i tried to look uncon cerned the provisions gone what cried the professor do you mean to say that all our provisions are lost yes was my lowly spoken reply as i held out something in my hand this morsel of dried meat is all that remains for us three my uncle gazed at me as if he could not fully appreciate the meaning of my words the blow seemed to stun him by its severity i allowed him to reflect for some moments well said i after a short pause what do you think now is there any chance of our escaping from our horrible subterranean dangers are we not doomed to perish in the great hollows of the center of the earth but my pertinent questions brought no answer my uncle either heard me not or appeared not to do so and in this way a whole hour passed neither of us cared to speak for myself i began to feel the most fearful and devouring hunger my companions doubtless felt the same horrible tor tures but neither of them would touch the wretched morsel of meat that remained it lay there a last remnant of all our great preparations for the mad and senseless journey i looked back with wonderment to my own folly fully was i aware that despite his enthusiasm and the evertobe hated scroll of saknussem my uncle should never have started on his perilous voyage what memories of the happy past what previsions of the horrible future now filled my brain chapter xli hunger hunger prolonged is temporary madness the brain is at work without its required food and the most fantastic notions fill the mind hitherto i had never known what hunger really meant i was likely to understand it now only too well after dreaming for some time and thinking of this and other matters i once more looked around me we were still ascending with fearful rapidity every now and then the air appeared to check our respiration as it does that of aeronauts when the ascension of the balloon is too rapid but if they feel a degree of cold in proportion to the elevation they attain in the atmosphere we experienced quite a contrary effect the heat began to increase in a most threatening and exceptional manner i can not tell exactly the mean but i think it must have reached degrees of fahrenheit what was the meaning of this extraordinary change in the temperature as far as we had hitherto gone facts had proved the theories of davy and of lidenbrock to be correct until now all the peculiar conditions of refractory rocks of electric ity of magnetism had modified the general laws of nature and had created for us a moderate tempera ture for the theory of the central fire remained in my eyes the only explainable one were we then going to reach a position in which these phenomena were to be carried out in all their rigor and in which the heat would reduce the rocks to a state of fusion such was my not unnat ural fear and i did not conceal the fact from my uncle my way of doing so might be cold and heart less but i could not help it if we are not drowned or smashed into pancakes and if we do not die of starvation we have the satisfaction of knowing that we must be burned alive my uncle in presence of this brusque attack simply shrugged his shoulders and resumed his re flectionsâwhatever they might be an hour passed away and except that there was a slight increase in the temperature no incident modified the situation my uncle at last of his own accord broke silence well harry my boy he said in a cheerful way we must make up our minds make up our minds to what i asked in consid erable surprise wellâto something we must at whatever risk recruit our physical strength if we make the fatal mistake of husbanding our little remnant of food we may probably prolong our wretched existence a few hoursâbut we shall remain weak to the end yes i growled to the end that however will not keep us long waiting well only let a chance of safety present itselfâ only allow that a moment of action be necessaryâ where shall we find the means of aetion if we allow ourselves to be reduced to physical weakness by in anition when this piece of meat is devoured uncle what hope will there remain unto us none my dear harry none but will it do you any good to devour it with your eyes you appear amazing stories to me to reason like one without will or decision like a being without energy while there is life there is hope then cried i exasperated to a degree which is scarcely to be explained you do not mean to tell meâthat youâthat youâ have not lost all hope certainly not replied the professor with con summate coolness you mean to tell me uncle that we shall get out of this monstrous subterranean shaft while there is life there is hope i beg to as sert harry that as long as a mans heart beats as long as a mans flesh quivers i do not allow that a being gifted with thought and will can allow him self to despair what a resolution the man placed in a position like that we occupied must have been very brave to speak like this well i cried what do you mean to do eat what remains of the food we have in our hands let us swallow the last crumb it will be heaven willing our last repast well never mindâ instead of being exhausted skeletons we shall be men true muttered i in a despairing tone let us take our fill we must replied my uncle with a deep sigh call it what you will my uncle took a piece of the meat that remained and some crusts of biscuit which had escaped the wreck he divided the whole into three parts each had one pound of food to last him as long as he remained in the interior of the earth each now acted in accordance with his own pri vate character my uncle the professor ate greed ily but evidently without appetite eating simply from some mechanical motion i put the food in side my lips and hungry as i was chewed my morsel without pleasure and without satisfaction hans the guide just as if he had been eiderdown hunting swallowed every mouthful as though it were a usual affair he looked like a man equally prepared to enjoy superfluity or total want hans in all probability was no more used to starvation than ourselves but his hardy icelandic nature had prepared him for many sufferings as long as he received his three rixdollars every saturday night he was prepared for anything the fact was hans never troubled himself about much except his money he had undertaken to serve a certain man at so much per week and no matter what evils befell his employer or himself he never found fault or grumbled so long as his wages were duly paid suddenly my uncle roused himself he had seen a smile on the face of our guide i could not make it out what is the matter said my uncle schiedam said the guide producing a bottle of this precious fluid we drank my uncle and myself will own to our dying day that hence we derived strength to exist until the last bitter moment that precious bottle of hollands was in reality only halffull but under the circumstances it was nectar the worthy professor swallowed about half a pint and did not seem able to drink any more fortrafftig said hans swallowing nearly all that was left excellentâvery good said my uncle with as much gusto as if he had just left the steps of the club at hamburg i began to feel as if there were still one gleam of hope now all thought of the future vanished we had consumed our last ounce of food and it was five oclock in the morning chapter xlii the volcanic shaft mans constitution is so peculiar that his health is purely a negative matter no sooner is the rage of hunger appeased than it becomes difficult to comprehend the mean ing of starvation it is only when you suffer that you really understand as to anyone who has not endured privation having any notion of the matter it is simply absurd with us after a long fast some mouthfuls of bread and meat a little mouldy bis cuit and salt beef triumphed over all our previous saturnine thoughts nevertheless after this repast each gave way to his own reflections i wondered what were those of hansâthe man of the extreme north who was yet gifted with the fatalistic resignation of oriental character but the utmost stretch of the imagina tion would not allow me to realize the truth as for my individual self my thoughts had ceased to be anything but memories of the past and were all connected with that upper world which i never should have left i saw it all now the beautiful house in the konigstrasse my poor gretchen the good martha they all passed before my mind like visions of the past every time any of the lugubri ous groanings which were to be distinguished in the hollows around fell upon my ears i fancied i heard the distant murmur of the great cities above my head as for my uncle always thinking of his science he examined the nature of the shaft by means of a torch he closely examined the different strata one above the other in order to recognize his situation by geological theory this calculation or rather this estimation could by no means be anything but approximate but a learned man a philosopher is nothing if not a philosopher when he keeps his ideas calm and collected and certainly the pro fessor possessed this quality to perfection i heard him as i sat in silence murmuring words of geological science as i understood his object and his meaning i could not but interest myself de spite my preoccupation in that terrible hour erup tive granite he said to himself we are still in the primitive epoch but we are going upâgoing up still going up but who knows who knows then he still hoped he felt along the vertical sides of the shaft with his hand and some few min utes later he would go on again in the following styleâthis is gniess this mocashitesâsilicious mineral good again this is the epoch of transi tion at all events we are close to themâand then and thenâ what could the professor mean could he by any conceivable means measure the thickness of the crust of the earth suspended above our heads did he possess any possible means of making any ap proximation to this calculation no the man a trip to the center of the earth ometer was wanting and no summary estimation could take the place of it the temperature risesâthey are floating on lava as we progressed the temperature increased in the most extraordinary degree and i be gan to feel as if i were bathed in a hot and burning atmosphere never before had i felt any thing like it i could only compare it to the hot vapor from an iron foundry when the liquid iron is in a state of ebullition and runs over by degrees and one after the other hans my uncle and myself had taken off our coats and waistcoats they were unbearable even the slightest garment was the cause of extreme suffering are we ascending to a living fire i cried when to my horror and astonishment the heat be came greater than before no no said by uncle it is simply impossible quite impossible and yet said i touching the side of the shaft with my naked hand this wall is literally burn ing at this moment feeling as i did that the sides of this extraordinary wall were red hot i plunged my hands into the water to cool them i drew them back with a cry of despair the water is boiling i cried my uncle the professor made no reply other than a gesture of rage and despair something very like the truth had probably struck his imagination an invincible dread took possession of my brain and soul i could only look forward to an immedi ate catastrophe such a catastrophe as not even the most vivid imagination could have thought of an idea at first vague and uncertain was gradually being changed into certainty it was so terrible an idea that i scarcely dared to whisper it to myself yet all the while certain and as it were involun tary observations determined my convictions by the doubtful glare of the torch i could make out some singular changes in the granitic strata a strange and terrible phenomenon was about to be produced in which electricity played a part then this boiling water this terrible and excessive heat i determined as a last resource to examine the com pass the compass had gone mad yes wholly stark staring mad the needle jumped from pole to pole with sudden and surprising jerks ran round or as it is said boxed the compass and then ran suddenly back again as if it he had the vertigo terrible detonations like heavens artillery be gan to multiply themselves with fearful intensity i could only compare them with the noise made by hundreds of heavilyladen chariots being madly driven over a stone pavement it was a continuous roll of heavy thunder they are in the volcanic shaft of a crater in full action and then the mad compass shaken by the wild electric phenomena confirmed me in my rap idly formed opinion the mineral crust was about to burst the heavy granite masses were about to rejoin the fissure was about to close the void was about to be filled up and we poor atoms to be crushed in its awful embrace uncle uncle i cried we are wholly irretrievably lost what then my young friend is your new cause of terror and alarm he said in his calmest man ner what fear you now what do i fear now i cried in fierce and angry tones do you not see that the walls of the shaft are in motion do you not see that the solid granite masses are cracking do you not feel the terrible torrid heat do you not observe the awful boiling water on which we float do you not remark this mad needle every sign and portent of an aw ful earthquake my uncle coolly shook his head an earth quake he questioned in the most calm and pro voking tone yes my nephew i tell you that you are utterly mis taken he continued do you not can you not recognize all the well known symptoms of an earthquake by no means i am expect ing something far more important my brain is strained beyond enduranceâwhat what do you mean i cried an eruption harry an eruption i gasped we are then in the volcanic shaft of a crater in full action and vigor i have every reason to think so said the pro fessor in a smiling tone and i beg to tell you that it is the most fortunate thing that could hap pen to us the most fortunate thing had my uncle really and truly gone mad what did he mean by these awful wordsâwhat did he mean by this terrible calm this solemn smile what cried i in the height of my exasperation we are on the way to an eruption are we fatality has cast us into a well of burning and boiling lava of rocks on fire of boiling water in a word filled with every kind of eruptive matter we are about to be expelled thrown up vomited spit out of the interior of the earth in common with huge blocks of granite with showers of cinders and scoria in a wild whirlwind of flame and you sayâthe most fortunate thing which could happen to us yes replied the professor looking at me calm ly from under his spectacles it is the only chance which remains to us of ever escaping from the in terior of the earth to the light of day it is quite impossible that i can put on paper the thousand strange wild thoughts which followed this extraordinary announcement but my uncle was right quite right and never had he appeared to me so audacious and so convinced as when he looked me calmly in the face and spoke of the chances of an eruptionâof our being cast upon mother earth once more through the gaping crater of a volcano it is not a shaft of sneffels while we were speaking we were still as cending we passed the whole night going up or to speak more scientifically in an ascensional motion the fearful noise redoubled i was ready to suffocate i seriously believed that my last hour was approaching and yet so strange is imagination all i thought of was some childish hy pothesis or other in such circumstances you do not choose your own thoughts they overcome you amazing stories it was quite evident that we were being cast up wards by eruptive matter under the raft there was a mass of boiling water and under this was a heav ing mass of lava and an aggregate of rocks which on reaching the summit of the water would be dis persed in every direction that we were inside the chimney of a volcano there could no longer be the shadow of a doubt nothing more terrible could be conceived but on this occasion instead of sneffels an old and extinct volcano we were inside a mountain of fire in full activity several times i found myself asking what mountain was it and on what part of the world we should be shot out as if it were of any consequence in the northern regions there could be no reasonable doubt about that before it went decidedly mad the compass had never made the slightest mistake from the cape of saknus sem we had been swept away to the northward many hundreds of leagues now the question was were we once more under icelandâshould we be belched forth on to the earth through the crater of mount hecla or should we reappear through one of the other seven firefunnels of the island tak ing in my mental vision a radius of five hundred leagues to the westward i could see under this parallel only the littleknown volcanoes of the northwest coasts of america to the east one only existed somewhere about the eightieth degree of latitude the esk upon the island of jean mayen not far from the frozen regions of spitzbergen it was not craters that were wanting and many of them were big enough to vomit a whole army all i wished to know was the particular one towards which we were making with such fearful velocity i often think now of my folly as if i should have expected to escape towards morning the ascending motion became greater and greater if the degree of heat in creased instead of decreasing as we approached the surface of the earth it was simply because the causes were local and wholly due to volcanic in fluence our very style of locomotion left in my mind no doubt upon the subject an enormous force a force of some hundred of combined atmos pheres produced by vapors accumulated and long compressed in the interior of the earth were hoist ing us upwards with irresistible power but though we were approaching the light of day to what fearful dangers were we about to be ex posed instant death appeared the only fate which we could expect or contemplate the worst period of the ascent soon a dim sepulchral light penetrated the vertical gallery which became wider and wider i could make out to the right and left long dark corridors like immense tunnels from which awful and horrid vapors poured out ton gues of fire sparkling and crackling appeared about to lick us up the hour had come look uncle look i cried well what you see are the great sulphurous flames nothing more common in connection with an eruption but if they lap us round i angrily replied they will not lap us round was his quiet and serene answer but it will be all the same in the end if they stifle us i cried we shall not be stifled the gallery is rapidly becoming wider and wider and if it be necessary we will presently leave the raft and take refuge in some fissure in the rock but the water the water which is continually ascending i despairingly replied there is no longer any water harry he an swered but a kind of lava paste which is heaving us up in company with itself to the mouth of the crater in truth the liquid column of water had wholly disappeared to give place to dense masses of seeth ing eruptive matter the temperature was becoming utterly insupportable and a thermometer exposed to this atmosphere would have marked between and degrees fahrenheit perspiration rushed from every pore but for the extraordinary rapidity of our ascent we should have been stifled nevertheless the professor did not carry out his proposition of abandoning the raft and he did quite wisely anyway those few illjoined beams offered a solid surfaceâa support which elsewhere must have utterly failed us towards eight oclock in the morning a new in cident startled us the ascensional movement sud denly ceased the raft became still and motionless what is the matter now i said querulously very much startled by this change a simple halt replied my uncle is the eruption about to fail i asked i hope not without making any reply i rose i tried to look around me perhaps the raft checked by some projecting rock opposed a momentary resistance to the eruptive mass in this case it was absolutely necessary to release it as quickly as possible nothing of the kind had occurred the column of cinders of scoriae of broken rocks and earth had wholly ceased to ascend i tell you uncle that the eruption has stopped was my oracular decision ah said my uncle you think so my boy you are wrong do not be in the least alarmed this sudden moment of calm will not last long be as sured it has already endured five minutes and be fore we are many minutes older we shall be con tinuing our journey to the mouth of the crater all the time he was speaking the professor con tinued to consult his chronometer and he was probably right in his prognostics soon the raft resumed its motion in a very rapid and disorderly way which lasted two minutes or thereabout and then again it stopped as suddenly as before good said my uncle observing the hour in ten minutes we shall start again in ten minutes yesâprecisely we have to do with a volcano the eruption of which is intermittent we are com pelled to breathe just as it does a long lasting delirium as escape approaches nothing could be more true at the exact minute he had indicated we were again launched on high with extreme rapidity not to be cast off the raft it was necessary to hold on to the beams then the hoist again ceased many times since have i thought of this singular a trip to the center of the earth phenomenon without being able to find for it any satisfactory explanation nevertheless it appeared quite clear to me that we were not in the principal chimney of the volcano but in an accessory conduit where we felt the countershock of the great and principal tunnel filled by burning lava it is impossible for me to say how many times this maneuver was repeated all that i can remember is that on every ascensional motion we were hoisted up with everincreasing velocity as if we had been launched from a huge projectile during the sudden halts we were nearly stifled during the moments of projection the hot air took away our breath i thought for a moment of the voluptuous joy of suddenly finding myself in the hyperborean regions with the cold degrees below zero my exalted im agination pictured to itself the vast snowy plains of the arctic regions and i was impatient to roll myself on the icy carpet of the north pole by de grees my head utterly overcome by a series of vio lent emotions began to give way to hallucination i was delirious had it not been for the powerful arms of hans the guide i should have broken my head against the granite masses of the shaft i have in consequence kept no account of what followed for many hours i have a vague and con fused remembrance of continual detonations of the shaking of the huge granitic mass and of the raft going round like a spinning top it floated on the stream of hot lava amidst a falling cloud of cinders the huge flames roaring wrapped us around a storm of wind which appeared to be cast forth from an immense ventilator roused up the interior fires of the earth it was a hot incandescent blast at last i saw the figure of hans as if enveloped in the huge halo of burning blaze and no other sense remained to me but that sinister dread which the condemned victim may be supposed to feel when led to the mouth of a cannon at the supreme mo ment when the shot is fired and his limbs are dis persed into empty space chapter xliii daylight at last when i opened my eyes i felt the hand of the guide clutching me firmly by the belt with his other hand he supported my uncle i was not grievously wounded but bruised all over in the most remarkable manner after a moment i looked around and found that i was lying down on the slope of a mountain not two yards from a yawn ing gulf into which i should have fallen had i made the slightest false step hans had saved me from death while i rolled insensible on the flanks of the crater where are we dreamily asked my uncle who literally appeared to be disgusted at having re turned to earth the eiderdown hunter simply shrugged his shoulders as a mark of total ignor ance in iceland i replied not positively but inter rogatively nej said hans how do you mean cried the professor noâ what are your reasons hans is wrong said i rising after all the innumerable surprises of this jour ney a yet more singular one was reserved to us i expected to see a cone covered by snow by exten sive and widespread glaciers in the midst of the arid deserts of the extreme northern regions be neath the full rays of a polar sky beyond the high est latitudes but contrary to all our expectations i my uncle and the icelander were cast upon the slope of a mountain calcined by the burning rays of a sun which was literally baking us with its fires i could not believe my eyes but the actual heat which affected my body allowed me no chance of doubting we came out of the crater half naked and the radiant star from which we had asked noth ing for two months was good enough to be prodi gal to us of light and warmthâa light and warmth we could easily have dispensed with when our eyes were accustomed to the light we had lost sight of so long i used them to rectify the errors of my imagination whatever happened we should have been at spitzbergen and i was in no humor to yield to anything but the most absolute proof after some delay the professor spoke hem he said in a hesitating kind of way it really does not look like iceland but supposing it were the island of jean may en i ventured to observe not in the least my boy this is not one of the volcanoes of the north with its hills of granite and its crown of snow neverthelessâ on the surface of the earth at last look look my boy said the professor as dogmatically as usual right above our heads at a great height opened the crater of a volcano from which escaped from one quarter of an hour to the other with a very loud explosion a lofty jet of flame mingled with pumice stone cin ders and lava i could feel the convulsions of na ture in the mountain which breathed like a huge whale throwing up from time to time fire and air through its enormous vents below and floating along a slope of considerable angularity the stream of eruptive matter spread away to a depth which did not give the volcano a height of three hundred fathoms its base disap peared in a perfect forest of green trees among which i perceived olives fig trees and vines loaded with rich grapes certainly this was not the ordin ary aspect of the arctic regions about that there could not be the slightest doubt when the eye was satisfied at its glimpse of this verdant expanse it fell upon the waters of a lovely sea or beautiful lake which made of this enchanted land an island of not many leagues in extent to wards the setting sun some distant shores were to be made out on the edge of the horizon in one place appeared a prodigiously lofty cone above the sum mit of which hung dark and heavy clouds where can we be i asked speaking in a low and solemn voice hans shut his eyes with an air of indifference and my uncle looked on without clearly understand ing whatever this mountain may be he said at last i must confess it is rather warm the ex plosions do not leave off and i do not think it is amazing stories worth while to have left the interior of a volcano and remain here to receive a huge piece of rock upon ones head let us carefully descend the mountain and discover the real state of the case to con fess the truth i am dying of hunger and thirst decidedly the professor had ceased to be a truly reflective character for myself forgetting all my necessities ignoring my fatigues and sufferings i should have remained still for several hours long erâbut it was necessary to follow my companions where are they an interview with a child the slope of the volcano was very steep and slippery we slid over piles of ashes avoiding the streams of hot lava which glided about like fiery serpents still while we were advancing i spoke with extreme volubility for my imagination was too full not to explode in words we are in asia i exclaimed we are on the coast of india in the great malay islands in the center of oceana we have crossed the one half of the globe to come out right at the antipodes of europe but the compass exclaimed my uncle explain that to me yesâthe compass i said with considerable hesitation i grant that is a difficulty according to it we have always been going northward then it lied hemâto say it lied is rather a harsh word was my answer then we are at the north poleâ the poleânoâwellâwell i give it up was my reply the plain truth was that there was no explanation possible i could make nothing of it all the while we were approaching this beautiful verdure hunger and thirst tormented me fearfully happily after two long hours march a beautiful country spread out before us covered by olives pomegranates and vines which appeared to belong to anybody and everybody in the state of destitu tion into which we had fallen we were not particular to a grape what delight it was to press these delicious fruits to our lips and to bite at grapes and pomegranates fresh from the bough not far off near some fresh and mossy grass under the delicious shade of some trees i discovered a spring of fresh water into which we voluptuously plunged our faces hands and feet while we were all giving way to the delights of newfound pleasures a little child appeared be tween two tufted olive trees ah cried i an in habitant of this happy country the little fellow was poorly dressed weak and suffering and appeared terribly alarmed at our ap pearance halfnaked with tangled matted and ragged beards we did look supremely illfavored and unless the country was a bandit land we were not unlikely to alarm the inhabitants just as the boy was about to take to his heels hans ran after him and brought him back despite his cries and kicks my uncle tried to look as gentle as possible and then spoke in german what is the name of this mountain my friend the child made no reply good said my uncle with a very positive air of conviction we are not in germany he then made the same demand in english of which he was an excellent scholar the child shook its head and made no reply is he dumb cried the professor who was rather proud of his polyglot knowledge of languages and making the same demand in french the boy only stared in his face i must perforce try him in italian said my uncle with a shrug dove siamo yes tell me where we are i added impatiently and eagerly again the boy remained silent stromboli stromboli my fine fellow do you or do you not mean to speak cried my uncle who began to get angry he shook him and spoke an other dialect of the italian language come si chi ama questa isolaâwhat is the name of this island stromboli replied the rickety little shepherd dashing away from hans and disappearing in the olive groves stromboli what effect oh the imagination did these few words produce we were in the center of the mediterranean amid the eastern archipelago of mythological memory in the ancient strongylos where aeolus kept the wind and the tempest chained up and those blue mountains which rose towards the rising of the sun were the mountains of cala bria and that mighty volcano which rose on the southern horizon was etna the fierce and cele brated etna stromboli stromboli i repeated to myself my uncle played a regular accompaniment to my ges tures and words we were singing together like an ancient chorus ahâwhat a journeyâwhat a marvelous and extraordinary journey here we had entered the earth by one volcano and we had come out by another and this other was situated more than twelve hundred leagues from sneffels from that drear country of iceland cast away on the con fines of the earth the wondrous chances of this expedition had transported us to the most harmon ious and beautiful of earthly lands after a delicious repast of fruits and fresh water we again continued our journey in order to reach the port of stromboli to say how we had reached the island would scarcely have been prudent the superstitious character of the italians would have been at work and we should have been called de mons vomited from the infernal regions it was therefore necessary to pass for humble and unfor tunate shipwrecked travelers it was certainly less striking and romantic but it was decidedly safer as we advanced i could hear my worthy uncle muttering to himselfâbut the compass the com pass most certainly marked north this is a fact i cannot explain in any way well the fact is said i with an air of disdain we must not explain anything it will be much more easy i should like to see a professor of the johanneum institution who is unable to explain a cosmic phenomenonâit would indeed be strange and speaking thus my uncle halfnaked his leathern purse round his loins and his spectacles upon his a trip to the center of the earth nose became once more the terrible professor of mineralogy an hour after leaving the wood of olives we reached the fort of san vicenza where hans de manded the price of his thirteenth week of service my uncle paid him with many warm shakes of the hand at that moment if he did not indeed quite share our natural emotion he allowed his feelings so far to give way as to indulge in an extraordinary expres sion for him with the tips of two fingers he gently pressed our hands and smiled chapter xliv the journey ended this is the final conclusion of a narrative which will probably be disbelieved even by people who are astonished at nothing i am however armed at all points against human in credulity we were kindly received by the strombolite fish ermen who treated us as shipwrecked travelers they gave us clothes and food after a delay of fortyeight hours on the st of september a little vessel took us to messina where a few days of de lightful and complete repose restored us to our selves on friday the th of october we embarked in the volturus one of the postal packets of the im perial messagerie of france and three days later we landed at marseilles having no other care on our minds than that of our precious but erratic com pass this inexplicable circumstance tormented me terribly on the th of october in the evening we reached hamburg what was the astonishment of martha what the joy of gretchen i will not attempt to define it now harry that you really are a hero she said there is no reason why you should ever leave me again i looked at her she was weeping tears of joy i leave it to be imagined if the return of pro fessor hardwigg made or did not make a sensa tion in hamburg thanks to the indiscretion of martha the news of his departure for the interior of the earth had bqen spread over the whole world no one would believe itâand when they saw him come back in safety they believed it all the less but the presence of hans and many stray scraps of information by degrees modified public opinion then my uncle became a great man and i the nephew of a great man which at all events is something hamburg gave a festival in our honor a public meeting of the johanneum institution was held at which the professor related the whole story of his adventures omitting only the facts in connec tion with the compass that same day he deposited in the archives of the town the document he had found written by sak nussem and he expressed his great regret that cir cumstances stronger than his will did not allow him to follow the icelandic travelers track into the very center of the earth he was modest in his glory but his reputation only increased so much honor necessarily created for him many envious enemies of course they existed and as his theories supported by certain facts contradicted the system of science upon the question of central heat he maintained his own views both with pen and speech against the learned of every country although i still believe in the theory of central heat i confess that certain circumstances hitherto very illdefined may modify the laws of such natural phenomena a happy ending at the moment when these questions were be ing discussed with interest my uncle re ceived a rude shockâone that he felt very much hans despite everything he could say to the contrary quitted hamburg the man to whom we owed so much would not allow us to pay our deep debt of gratitude he was taken with nostalgia a love for his icelandic home farvel said he one day and with this one short word of adieu he started for reykjawik which he soon reached in safety we were deeply attached to our brave eiderduck hunter his absence will never cause him to be for gotten by those whose lives he saved and i hope at some not distant day to see him again to conclude i may say that our journey into the interior of the earth created an enormous sensa tion throughout the civilized world it was trans lated and printed in many languages all the lead ing journals published extracts from it which were commentated discussed attacked and supported with equal animation by those who believed in its episodes and by those who were utterly incredul ous wonderful my uncle enjoyed during his life time all the glory he deserved and he was even of fered a large sum of money by mr barnum to ex hibit himself in the united states and i am credibly informed by a traveler that he is to be seen in waxwork at madame tussauds but one care preyed upon his mind a care which rendered him very unhappy one fact remained in explicableâthat of the compass for a learned man to be baffled by such an inexplicable phenomenon was very aggravating but heaven was merciful and in the end my uncle was happy one day while he put some minerals belonging to his collection in order i fell upon the famous compass and examined it keenly for six months it had lain unnoticed and untouched i looked at it with curiosity which soon became surprise i gave a loud cry the professor who was at hand soon joined me what is the matter he cried the compass what then why its needle points to the south and not to the north my dear boy you must be dreaming i am not dreaming see the poles are changed changed my uncle put on his spectacles examined the in strument and leaped with joy shaking the whole house a clear light fell upon our minds here it is he cried as soon as he hadrecov ered the use of his speech our error is now easily explained but to what phenomenon do we owe this alteration in the needle nothing more simple explain yourself my boy i am on thorns during the storm upon the central sea the ball continued on page dr hackensaws secrets by clement fezandie the secret of the invisible girl seizing the opportunity he shot the loop of his lariat over her shouldersthe girlhung dangling helpless from the rope dr hackensaws secrets chapter i a strange offer doctor hackensaw im looking for a place im sorry my friend but we have no vacancy at present my name is phessenden keene al though i left school at the age of fifteen i have studied at home and have the equivalent of a college education i am very anxious to study inventing and having heard a great deal about your marvelous inventions i should like very much to work for you im sorry but as i said before there is no va cancy at present in fact this is the dull season and i have more men on hand now than i know what to do with phessenden keene smiled i know said he that you have no vacancy for an ordinary man but i am sure you have one for me doctor hackensaw looked up in surprise at this conceited statement and was about to make an angry reply but a look at the cleancut intelligent features of the young man before him caused him to hold his tongue the young fellow evidently had a strong will for he continued i know my own value better than you know it i am so sure that you have a vacancy for me that i am willing to come to work for you for nothing thank you replied doctor hackensaw coldly but i desire to pay my assistants for their work besides as i said before there is no work for you to do ill find work replied the young man confi dentlyâand plenty of it besides i am willing to do all the dirtiest and most disagreeable work on the place i will black the boots clean out the spit toons or the drains attend to the furnace shovel snow and so on i will be your porter and carry heavy bundles for you to any part of the city miss pep speaks give him a trial pop whisper ed miss pep perkins who seated at her typewriter had over heard the conversation and was pleased with the young mans looks how can you live if i dont pay you any sal ary asked doctor hack ensaw of the young man i have a couple of hundred dollars laid by that i saved penny by penny from my wages on a ranch where i worked for a while i can make that last me for a year and i know that long before that time i can convince you that my services are invaluable and if i am not convinced in that case i wont ask for anything very well ill engage you on your own terms you are to do all the hardest and most disagreeable making ones self invisible has always been one of the great fascinations to the human race and no wonder imagine all the mischief we could make all the eavesdropping we could do and all the secrets we could unravel scientifically speaking it is not impossible to make a body invisible recent experiments made by a new eng land professor of chemistry show that when certain liquids are injected into organic tissues they become practically transparent the professor succceded in making small animals entirely transparent and practically invisible who knows that in the future by some means of chemicals combined with certain rays it may not be possible for us to make ourselves entirely invisible we are sure you will enjoy the latest dr hackensaw exploit of the invisible girl how would you catch an invisible person but nothing is impossible to dr hack ensaw so see how he did it work on the place and are not to receive a cent in return thank you when will you begin right away i see the windows in the next room havent been washed for a month ill begin by cleaning thoseâ and five minutes later provided with a pail of water and a rag the young fellow was industriously polishing away at the windows which soon shone as they had never shone before well pep asked the doctor what do you think of that young fellow and his proposition i dont know what to think but i like his looks so do i but for all that he may be a burglar and may be choosing this means to learn where all the valuables on the place are kept i have mil lions of dollars worth of unpatented ideas that an intelligent chap like him could steal he looks like an honest fellow looks dont count for much the only other ex planation i can see for his offer is that he has fallen in love with you pep and has chosen this way of coming near you and doctor hackensaw smiled mischievously nonsense cried pep blushing but seemingly not at all displeased with the idea whatever the reason young keene soon made his services veritably invaluable he came early and stayed late and worked industriously all the time one of his first jobs was to make a grand housecleaning room by room he went over the whole establishment opening every neglected cup board and cleaning it thoroughly he timed his work so well and did it so neatly as never to occa sion discomfort to anyone he did more he made a card catalogue of every document and every ob ject in the place with a hieroglyph to indicate where the thing was to be found it was soon learned that if anyone wanted some particular thing there was no sense in hunting for it for keene could lay his hands on it in a minute chapter ii the zray photograph doctor hack ensaw ive got something peculiar to show you the speaker was phes senden keene bronzed from sunburn and just returned from a trip to central africa where he had been sent on a confi dential mission by the doctor keene was now doctor hackensaws righthand man his declaration that he would make himself indispensable was no vain boast before he had been in the doctors service a week it was evident that he was a man of extraordi nary abilities and energy doctor hackensaw how ever in order to make the test thorough kept him at work a whole month without any salary at the end of that time he made him a princely offer for amazing stories his services and needless to say the bootblacking and spittooncleaning ceased immediately the man was too valuable to be allowed to spend his time in such duties finally the doctor needing a confidential man to send to africa had entrusted keene with the mis sion poor pep perkins was brokenhearted at his departure because her admiration for this unique specimen of a man was unbounded she had at last found a man who made her heart go ticktack keene was now back from africa and it was after his business report that he exclaimed doctor hackensaw ive got something peculiar to show you what is it asked the doctor its a little memento i brought back from my african trip as you know i had with me some of the special cameras you invented for taking photo graphs at night without the need of flashlights yes said doctor hackensaw i gave you photographic plates of two kinds i gave you plates that were sensitive to electric emanations so that you could take photos of the aura that surrounds living beings precisely said silas what you call the zray plates well the curious thing i have to show you is one of the zray photographs i took near mon galla i think you will find it rather curious so saying phessenden keene took from his pocket a photograph which he handed to the doctor and pep left cleaning her typewriter in order to get a better view a young girl and her aura the photograph represented what appeared to be a beautiful young girl in a state of nature but surrounded by an aura of electric emana tions well what is there peculiar about this asked the doctor its just an ordinary photograph of a young lady taken on a special plate in order to show the aura no indeed replied keene i took that snap shot in bright sunlight and not a trace of a girl could i see it was a bird i was photographing and i hadnt the faintest idea there was a girl anywhere near me doctor hackensaw do you believe there are such things as invisible creatures well yes there are in the water there are cer tain animals like jellyfishes that are so transparent that they are practically invisible among the ani malcules too there are many whose small size rend ers them invisible and there are some that are so transparent that we cannot see them until they are stained even with a microscope that is what makes it so difficult to discover the specific microbe that causes a disease we must find some stain that will make the microbe visible and this isnt always easy the celebrated ehrhardt had to try no less than different stains before he found one that would color the microbes that cause syphilis once he found the proper stain however he was able to incorporate drugs with it and was thus en abled to have his drugs carried into the bodies of the microbes but while invisible beings are com mon in the microscopic world we know of no large invisible animals then the original of this photograph is the first one said keene and i wish to ask your permis sion to return to africa and try to capture her why didnt you try while you were over there i unfortunately didnt develop the negative until after my return to the united states well assented the doctor a search for an invisible girl is worse than a search for a needle in a haystack but the thing is so curious that we ought to make the attempt ill order my rapid aeroplane and pep and i will go with you chapter iii bunches of bananas for bait here we are doctor exclaimed phessen den keene this is the very spot where i took the snapshot as you can see by comparing it with the photograph even now said pep i dont see how we can ever hope to find the invisible girl pep spoke of its being as hard as looking for a needle in a hay stack but it seems to me much harder yes assented the doctor but to a scientist there would be no difficulty in finding a needle in a haystack he would merely spread out the hay and pass a strong electromagnet over it and in a few minutes the needle would be found clinging to the magnet perhaps so said pep but at least you can see the needle when you do find it here we cant see the girl and even if she were right in front of us and we took a snapshot of her with the zrays she would probably be gone by the time the negative was developed doctor hackensaw smiled you forget pep said he that we have other senses besides the sense of sight besides there are ways of making the invisible visible dont imagine for an instant that i have come unprepared i have in fact several strings to my bow you will remember that we stopped awhile in mongalla and i heard news there that will be of use to us hunting parties out after lions or elephants have noticed the mysterious dis appearance of their provisions bunches of bana nas disappear and also the strips of hippopotamus meat that they hang up to dry this knowledge will be very useful to us the girl evidently has no way of obtaining provisions except by stealing them hence a bunch of fine bananas would make a tempting bait oh exclaimed pep thats the reason you loaded up the aeroplane with such quantities of bunches of bananas precisely our first job is to locate the girl to do this we will hang up small bunches of bananas at likely spots near the white nile where she must go for water and when tomorrow we find one or two of the bunches missing we may strongly sus pect one invisible girl of being the culprit it was no easy task tramping through the wilds for caution was necessary as lions leopards and elephants abounded in the region and even the crocodiles were dangerous the postboat captain having informed our adventurers that he had had two of his men devoured by crocodiles the past year dr hackensaws secrets the animals dread of man fortunately most of the wild animals had acquired a real wholesome dread of man even a herd of elephants would fly from a single person it is a curious sight to see a herd of these huge monsters quietly feeding when a single man comes to windward of them first one trunk goes up into the air as the mans scent is wafted to the herd then another and another trunk is raised and moves about until the direction of the scent is located then the whole herd marches briskly away at a rate no ordinary hunter can at tain when all the bait was hung up carefully suspend ed out of the reach of elephants the party returned in their airplane to mongalla to spend the night the next morning they returned to examine the bait and to their joy they found several of the bunches of bananas missing in most of the places no tracks could be found in the hard earth but near one of the trees a small footprint could be plainly discerned in the sand theres our young lady cried the doctor and i propose that we name her lily foote it will be handy to have some name to know her by yes when we catch her muttered pep to her self now said the doctor the problem is shall we try to trap her here or shall we follow her to her den for she must have a lair somewhere safe from the wild beasts how could you follow her asked keene it would be easy enough if we had a good dog but you can get nothing of the kind here i have something better than a dog answered doctor hackensaw i have my trusty old super nose or smell amplifier it is really nothing but a series of half a dozen specially constructed audions designed to amplify smells instead of sounds calling one of his nubian servants doctor hack ensaw took from one of the bags a small case which we fastened like a knapsack on his back two tubes projected from the instrumentâone somewhat rigid with a flaring end which the doctor held over the scent the other tube ended in a small mask which fitted over the doctors nose thus equipped doc tor hackensaw could follow a scent better than the very best hunting dog nearing the quarry starting at the footprint the doctor had no difficulty in picking up the trail and start ed along it followed by his friends and the negro porters for several miles he pursued his quarry in this manner when he came to a tall tree and then paused and looked up into the branches nothing was visible she climbed up here said the doctor and is here yet unless she came down on the other side he made a rapid tour of the tree and then returned she is still up in the tree all weve got to do now is to catch her yes thats all returned keene sarcastically but how are you going to catch a girl you cant see i brought a lariat with me but how are you going to lasso a girl unless you can see her i have an answer for that returned doctor hackensaw for i have brought with me several pairs of specially constructed electrical spectac les what are they they are spectacles so constructed that they make electrical emanations visible this invisible girl is as we know by her photograph surrounded by an aura these spectacles will make that aura visible to us and it will be our own fault if we do not catch the girl a moment later the doctor pep and keene were each equipped with the unique spectacles and were gazing intently up the tree but the girl was well concealed in the leaves and they could see nothing never mind ill climb up with my lariat and if i see her well soon have her ive lassoed plenty of wild cattle on the ranches out west a moment later the young fellow with his slip noose in his hand was ascending the tree while pep and the doctor looked eagerly from below i see her cried keene and as he shouted the words a rustling in the leaves was heard i see her too cried pep or rather i see what looks like the shadow of a girl shes coming down the tree letting herself drop from branch to branch like a monkey it was a most peculiar sight the aura of this in visible girl as she rapidly descended but she was no match for a western cowboy like keene he watched her descent bracing himself against the trunk of the tree and seizing his opportunity shot the loop of his lariat over her shoulders and pulled it tight the girl made a spring but hung dangling helpless from the rope ive got her cried keene ill let her down to you carefully but i recommend you to tie her tight ly until we can get her into the cage we brought for her she looks like a slippery customer chapter iv conclusion here we are back in new york again cried doctor hackensaw gaily five days later as his swift aeroplane entered its hangar our first job now will be to teach aura to speak aura was the name that had finally been decided upon for the invisible girl lily foote did not seem very satisfactory the girl evidently posses sed a language of her own and a few arabic and shilluck words that she had evidently overheard the natives use but otherwise knew nothing and owned nothing as miggs expressed it when they found her she didnt even have a pagoda on he evi dently meant kimono miggs had been the air plane pilot on their expedition doctor hackensaw with his usual foresight had realized that if they caught the girl they would have to have some means of making her visible accord ingly he had brought along a trousseau for her it didnt fit very well but was more suitable than the electric aura which had been her sole garment pre viously to render her face visible he had also brought along a vanitycase and when her cheeks were powdered and her lips painted and she was attired in modern costume you couldnt have told her from an ordinary girl except for the absence of continued on page the man who could work miracles by hg wells concluded and waters filled earth and sky and peering under his hand through the dust and sleet to windward he saw by the play of the lightnings a vast wall of water pouring towards him maydig screamed mr fortheringays feeble voice amid the elemental uproar hereâmaydig stop cried mr fotheringay to the advancing water oh for goodness sake stop just a moment said mr fotheringay to the lightnings and thunder stop jest a moment while i collect my thoughts and now what shall i do he said what shall i do lord i wish maydig was about i know said mr fotheringay and for good ness sake lets have it right this time he remained on all fours leaning against the wind very intent to have everything right ah he said let nothing what im going to order happen until i say off lord i wish id thought of that before he lifted his little voice against the whirlwind shouting louder and louder in the vain desire to hear himself speak now thenâhere goes mind about that what i said just now in the first place when all ive got to say is done let me lose my miraculous power let my will become just like anybodys elses will and all these dangerous mir acles be stopped i dont like them id rather i didnt work em ever so much thats the first thing and the second isâlet me be back just before the miracles begin let everything be just as it was before that blessed lamp turned up its a big job but its the last have you got it no more miracles everything as it wasâme back in the long dragon just before i drank my halfpint thats it yes he dug his fingers into the mould closed his eyes and said off everything became perfectly still he perceived the he was standing erect chapter x back in the long dragon so you say said a voice he opened his eyes he was in the bar of the long dragon arguing about miracles with toddy beamish he had a vague sense of some great thing forgotten that instantaneously passed you see that except for the loss of his miraculous powers everything was back as it had been his mind and memory therefore were now just as they had been at the time when this story began so that he knew absolutely nothing of all that is told hereâknows nothing of all that is told here to this day and among other things of course he still did not believe in miracles i tell you that miracles properly speaking cant possibly happen he said whatever you like to hold and im prepared to prove it up to the hilt thats what you think said toddy beamish and prove it if you can looky here mr beamish said mr fotherin gay let us clearly understand what a miracle is its something contrariwise to the course of nature done by power of will the end experts join staff of amazing stories it will come as good news that two scientifiction experts have joined the staff as literary editors i of amazing stories the name of wilbur c whitehead the greatest auction bridge expert in the united states will come as a surprise to many nevertheless this famous man is a scientification fan of the first rank there are few works of scientifiction with which he is not familiar and he is just as much an expert in this type of literature as in his native bridge mr white head is the author of the following books on bridge and also editor of the workwhitehead auction bridge bulletin auction bridge standards auction bridge summary complete auction bridge and authoritative leads and conventions of playing every great man has a hobby and mr whitehead is no exception his hobby happens to be scientific tion and all that goes with it we congratulate our readers upon the acquisition of mr whitehead it means a great deal to the future editorial policy of amazing stories it means in short the best mr c a brandt who has also joined the editorial staff is in our opinion the greatest living expert on scientifiction at least we do not know of any one else who has practically every piece of scientifiction that was ever published in his library mr brandt has on his book shelves complete volumes and short stories taken from many publicationsall scicntific tion we believe that this collection of this type of literature can not be equalled by any one because he made a study not only of works in the english language but also in the german french and scan dinavian languages there is not a work of this kind that has appeared during the last fifty years with which mr brandt is not fully conversant this is of course a tre mendous asset to a publication of the type of amaz ing stories and one which assures you of getting the best that can be had at all times by having the advantage of such an expert editorial board amazing stories is convinced that when ever new stories from new writers are received they will have expert treatment and that of course is very necessary when dealing with a new literature of this kind the moon metal by garrett p serviss concluded the last fight oâł dr syx but it took me a long time and i did not reach the rift in the summit until just be fore sundown knowing that it would be impossible for me to descend at night i bethought me of the enclosure of rocks supposed to have been made by indians on the western pinnacle and de cided that i could pass the night there the perpendicular buttress forming the east ernmost and highest point of the tetons head would have baffled me but for the fact that i found a long crack probably an effect of the tremendous ex plosion extending from bottom to top of the rock driving my toes and fingers into this rift i man aged with a good deal of trouble and no little peril to reach the top as i lifted myself over the edge and rose to my feet imagine my amazement at see ing dr syx standing within armslength of me my breath seemed pent in my lungs and i could not even utter the exclamation that rose to my lips it was like meeting a ghost notwithstanding the many reports of his having been seen in various parts of the world it had always been my convic tion that he had perished in the explosion yet there he stood in the twilight for the sun was hidden by the time i reached the summit his tall form erect and his black eyes gleaming under the heavy brows as he fixed them sternly upon my face you know i never was given to losing my nerve but i am afraid i lost it on that occasion again and again i strove to speak but it was im possible to move my tongue so powerless seemed my lungs that i wondered how i could continue breathing the doctor remained silent but his curious smile which as you know was a thing of terror to most people overspread his blackrimmed face and was broad enough to reveal the gleam of his teeth i felt that he was looking me through and through the sensation was as if he had transfixed me with an icecold blade there was a gleam of devilish pleasure in his eyes as though my evident suffering was a delight to him and a gratification of his vengeance at length i succeeded in overcoming the feeling which oppressed me and making a step for ward i shouted in a strained voice you black satan i cannot clearly explain the psychological pro cess which led me to utter those words i had never entertained any enmity towards dr syx although i had always regarded him as a heartless person who had purposely led thousands to their ruin for his selfish gain but i knew that he could not help hating me and i felt now that in some inexplicable manner a struggle not physical but spiritual was taking place between us and my exclamation ut tered with surprising intensity produced upon me and apparently upon him the effect of a desperate sword thrust which attains its mark immediately the doctors form seemed to recede as if he had passed the verge of the precipice be hind him at the same time it became dim and then dimmer until only the dark outlines and particular ly the jetblack eyes glaring fiercely remained visible and still he receded as though floating in the air which was now silvered with the evening light until he appeared to cross the immense at mospheric gulf over jacksons hole and paused on the rim of the horizon in the east then suddenly i became aware that the full moon had risen at the very place on the distant mountainbrow where the spectre rested and as i continued to gaze as if entranced the face and figure of the doctor seemed slowly to frame them selves within the lunar disk until at last he ap peared to have quitted the air and the earth and to be frowning at me from the circle of the moon while hall was pronouncing his closing words i had begun to stare at the moon with swiftly increas ing interest until as his voice stopped i ex claimed why there he is now funny i never noticed it before theres dr syxs face in the moon as plain as day yes replied hall without turning round and i never like to look at it the end new

author of the thing from outside mr h gernsback june editor amazing stories new york city dear mr gernsback i cannot thank you too cordially for the opportunity you give me to say something in approval of your plan to print scientific fiction this is sup posed to be the age of science and the more widely scientific ideas are spread the better fiction is certainly one of the most effective methods of dissemi nating scientific ideas the world is too much given over to silly meaningless and licentious fic tion the type of stories you propose to print can do much to combat this evil tendency moreover such stories will wage war on the reactionary cam paign now going on the saying that science has conquered the world is unfortunately far from true only a very small percentage of people have as yet accepted scientific thought with all its implication the masses still cling to wornout old religious dogmas that even an elementary knowledge of science would destroy schools and churches still keep the hoary old super stitions alive and actively fight to do so the clergy realize that the real triumph of science would oust them from soft sinecures bluntly put from their graft today they are seeking with some success to have time taken from schoolhours for religious in struction they are backing the fight in many states to have science pro hibited in the schools and colleges an era of reaction is upon us science service and your magazines are do ing noble work which should by all means be extended if the black beetles of superstition had their way evolution would be banished from mod ern thought this must not be the war is on and you stand on the firing line for years i have advocated the teaching of evolution in grammar schools high schools and academies as well as in universities this one study would drive the inanities of su perstition out of court with ridicule by all means mr gernsback publish all the scientific fiction you can espe cially with bearing on evolution the clergy can dominate educational sys tems but they cannot control maga zines if the people cannot be reached through the schools they can through the magazines your work is of

bolt of sheet rubber was passed in the next morning however and fosdick set to work fashioning some insuulating shoes for john l these were immpleted by noon and the fifty thousand morbid spectators that had come in by special trains breathlessly watched the experiment rubber shod the cat was dropped to the groundâand it survived a great cheer went up from the crowd this had no sooner subsided than prof snooks realized that a terrible mistake had been made hastily grabbing a megaphone from a barker of one of the numerous side shows that had set up their tents everywhere he addres sed the crowd he told them that john l was at liberty charged with perhaps a hundred million volts of elec tricity and that contact with him could mean but one thingâdeath in stantly there was a wild commotion in the terrorized crowd and then a wild flight from the awful peril by night fall the railroads had deported thirty nine train loads of people and save for the few that could find rubber boots the streets of whiffleville were as lifeless as the shady paths of the neighboring cemetery rubber and rubber alone could pro tect them against the deadly menace of john l this all realized a thoughtless humanitarian bill hitch cock by the name made rubber boots for his three dogs one of the dogs that very afternoon spying john l set sail for him and although he man aged only to touch the tail of the cat ha became charged with the deadly electrical pressure and worse the dog coming home rubbed noses with hitchcocks other two dogs charging them with three electrical dogs and one electrical cat at large only the foolhardy ventured abroad casualties multiplied and the two charged subjects are still in captivity within the next twentyfour hours there were a number of casualties about nine in the evening old tige the largest of the dogs came in contact with a lamp post the post was instantly fused off even with the ground and the gas became ignited making a geyser of flame that shot a hundred feet heaven ward the dog died later in the night another one of the dogs ran against a barbwire fence killing ten head of stock four miles away that dog also died at daybreak there was a loud explosion in the outskirts of the town it is thought that this came from a cat fight in which john l par ticipated at any rate he has never been seen since and today only a pa thetic hole in the ground marks his probable last battlefield the remaining dog was captured at great peril to life and turned over to prof snooks for experimental pur poses by gradually drawing off the electrical charge by means of a con denser the professor in a weeks time reduced the dogs pressure to approxi mately five thousand volts and then the animal was further discharged by hooking him up to the town arc light system of fifty lamps which he main tained in the splendid effulgence of over two thousand candle power for a period of nine hours and eleven min utes before his power ran down mr fosdick and mr stetzle are now living on two insulated stools in the laboratory of doolittle college their potential is dropping at the rate of ten volts a day and prof snooks has calculated that they must remain there for the next years three months and two days before being fully dis charged it seems a great pity the end in preparation these stories will soon appear in amazing stories a columbus
