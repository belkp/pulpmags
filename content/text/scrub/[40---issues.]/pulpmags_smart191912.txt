discretion hitherto regarded as obligatory rang boldly the door bell of the elliot holland home in east sixtyfirst street and having asked for mrs holland handed the servant his carte de visite he forged a link in the chain which was eventually to shackle him that he did it unwittingly not being gifted with ability accurately to foresee the future is scarcely worth consider ing since an infallible prescience would probably not have deterred him cir cumstances had arisen which he felt made the call imperative conse quences likely or unlikelysuch was the emotional turmoil of the moment he had no thought for save however for an unusual pal lor there was nothing in his appearance to indicate the nervous strain he was undergoing a rather tall wellpro portioned young man noticeably good looking carefullyalmost meticulously groomed and smartly dressed the gaze of his bluegrey eyes as it met the enquiring look of the maid was unwa veringly direct and the movement of his gloved hand in presenting the card was markedly steady but waiting in the small reception room to the left of the entrance hall and released from observation his self command was less perfect still hold ing his hat and walkingstick he moved about restlessly with bent head and furrowed brow in the five minutes interval before the maids return he twice glanced at his watch and for the first time a fear loomed that bianca might decline to see him this though was eventually dissi pated it ended in his being led up a broad curving staircase and along a softly carpeted corridor to an open door before which his guide halted and with a gracefully indicative gesture stepped aside the next instant he was facing bi anca holland in every conceivable sense this wom an was to calvert the most desirable of gods creatures even the more in different men conceded her beauty and her charm nearly as tall as himself her figure had all the slender sinuous symmetry of a hamadryad its lines en hanced now by the teagown she was wearing a pale filmy fabric which seemed to hold in its folds the faint silver grey of earliest dawn just as the night seemed captive in her hair and starshine in the depths of her large dark languorous eyes the room though he failed to ob serve it was a fit setting for this jewel he so highly prized it was cosily small half boudoir and half library with no striking glaring color any where but a blending of tints that sug gested nothing so much as a great hol lowedout opal before either uttered a word he had read in her lookin her shadowy smile in the faint parting of her sensuous sensitive lipsnot reproach but ques tion in this wise he answered it i had to come there was no other way what is isnt for reply she gave him her hand and its soft warm pressure said very dis tinctly i know i understand stepping past him she closed the door and spoke actually here lee we shall be quite safe from interruption against the wall to the right was a dainty little sofalike thing of white en amel and lavender satin whereon they sat down ive tried bee he said dismally its no use i cant keep my promise for twentyfour hours ive been in pur gatory either you must find some way of getting out of going or release me from my promise not to follow you but my dear she rejoined not unkindly dont you see how impos sible either is what would happen you mean your husbands sus picions would be confirmed unquestionably well let them better still tell him the truth confess you no longer love him ask him to free you oh my dear it was not the first time he had asked her thisno nor the hundredthbut never before had so much hung be tween consent and refusal in the two years of their loveof their passion mutually avowed yet ungratified and wrapped in what they had believed to be an impenetrable secrecythere had been only the briefest separations a week had measured the longest and for being mostly behind a veil their meetings were all the sweeter in the clandestine there is zest but there had come a time now when some whisper or some intuitive convic tion of the truth having penetrated at least vaguely to the elliot holland con sciousness bianca was after but five days warning to be taken abroad to calvert therefore her exclama tory protest in response to this ultimate and paramount voicing of his old ap peal was like a sudden knifethrust at his last hope he winced visibly and a swift color dyed his cheeks to the temples the next instant though the flush receded and he bent forward burying his face in his palms into biancas expressive eyes there came then a cloud of pity masking the starshine it was with a gesture of pleading that she laid yearningly a hand upon his slanted shoulder lee she murmured dont please dont she could feel the slow deep rhythm of his breathing and it seemed to her the fullpulsed throbbing of his heart in pain he gave her no reply and she went on id do itoh so willingly so glad lyif there were the tiniest use but i know him so well it would only make matters worsea thousand times worse worse he echoed into his cupped palms as if anything could be but think dear its not for long two months perhaps three at the most he must be back by the middle of january theres a he straightened quickly and turned to her his eyes blazing look at me he cried sternly look at me and say that again she looked at him and looking quailed her gaze fell and she sat mute three months not long he repeat ed not long one month to me would be eternity if you loved me half as much as i love you you couldnt think of it her eyes narrowed the line of her lips straightened she held her breath as if in pain do you want to drive me quite mad he went on im notfar from it now abruptly she recovered herself its because i love you so dearly that i can face it bravely if i had no thought but my own selfish desires id have been yours long ago wholly yours wed have been at the worlds end by now would to god we were he re turned fervently oh dont say that she begged you know that no lasting happiness what is isnt could come of it a delirium of joy and yes andwhat the awakening exiles satiety reproaches probably hate nonsense thats only a morbid fancy im sorry you think so lee but its the only way i can see it intui tion tells me we must wait for the briefest moment he sat gaz ing at her in wistful silence never had she appeared to him so beautiful so adorably desirable his whole being ached to possess her the subtle per fume she exhaled like the scent of flowers warm and sweet intoxicated him then abruptly his arms were about her he had drawn her close his lips were avidly upon hers and swift as winged darts the ardent seconds sped it was she at length who all at once drew away startled i heard something she whispered calverts smile was indulgent youre full of fancies today dar ling he told her softly but she lifted a cautioning finger no she breathed still nervous with alarm someone jarred the door a draft probably already she was on her feet and crossing the room precipitately she turned the knob drawing the door in ward the corridor was empty you see he said still im unconvinced was her re joinder again he smiled you are morbid today but if elliot should come in unex pectedly think of it very well suppose he should all the better hed learn for himself then what you refuse to tell him that wbuld be far worse she de clared there is but one way as ive told you we must wait for what until when ive already told you for what weve spoken of it many times how can i say when but it wont be long dear i feel that your feeling isnt much to tie to we may have to wait for years for the apoplexy hes been cautioned against i wont talk of it she said drop ping limply into a chair because you really have no more faith in it than i vanderslice is an alarmist and hollands right in giv ing his warning little heed hes too young a man to have brittle arteries fortyfive isnt old any more oh why will you make me go over that again she had turned to him imploringly dr vanderslice is not an alarmist he named a dozen men at least weve known no older than elliot who went in that way but he refuses to be careful he eats and drinks what he likes takes practically no exercise and makes no effort what ever to control his temper there can i tell you be but one end ive urged him to be careful until i calvert frowning caught her up youve urged him he cried naturally would you have me do otherwise i couldnt have done it thats the one reason why ive asked you not to come here if you should meet what might not happen this way my conscience is clear my conscience is less sensitive and once more a smilethis time but a faint onelifted slightly the corners of his sensitive cleanshaven mouth lee oh i admit it why lie natu rally i want him out of the way hes standing in the middle of the road to my happiness and yours we might push him aside but you wont have that you are determined that we shant go on until hes dead it is you my dear who make that condition not i again adam was blaming eve for his temptation but if eve had any defense ready she was prevented from voicing it by the falling at that moment of a light tap on the door calvert im pulsively sprang up but it was only a maid with tea what is isnt when she was gone and he held a cap in his hand he said why did you say wed be safe from interruption here if there was a possi bility of him returning at any moment or of tea being brought in because the possibilities were most remote ordinarily hes rarely home before seven even then he doesnt come here tonight we are dining at his brothers hell be in earlier but i shall not expect him before six when i heard that movement of the door though it occurred to me that he might possibly have come and asked for me and that one of the maids had unthinkingly mentioned your name a guilty conscience you know as for the tea i had ordered that for five thirty calvert glanced at the bijou of a timepiece on biancas escritoire across the room it indicated fiveforty unless i wish to precipitate an apo plectic seizure and so hasten our happi ness id better be off pretty quickly then he said i think youll be safe until six she returned lightly suppose i refuse to go until you promise to release me from my agree ment not to follow you to the other side you mustnt ask that dear but i do ask it thats why im here my mind is made up i wont wait three months no nor one month either i cant endure the thought of it im going to follow you by the next boat you mean youll break your word no i mean you must release me but i cant surely you wont make it so hard for me id never have a moments peace but if i agree to be most careful theres no reason why we shouldnt be able to see each other in london and paris or wherever you go quite as se cretly as here in new york for ten minutes they argued without reaching agreement in the end his eyes on the little clock calvert said very well you shall have until to morrow to think it over further we go aboard tomorrow night you know bianca told him and sail early thursday morning i understand that but youll lunch with me tomorrow if nothing happens yes what can happen anything arent we on the knees of the gods do you want to drive me quite dotty if youre not at giros at one ill come here if youre not here ill be at the pier when you arrive and ill kiss you goodbye right under his nose yes if it kills him i know of nothing to keep me from being at giros at one thats better he said smiling as he put down his cup and at giros youll free me from my agreement you must darling i cant do that ever oh lee you must see it my way you must bear it bravely as i am bearing it you wont change i wont change nor will i he seized her almost roughly in one long final embrace kissed her again and again and the next moment was running lightly down the broad curv ing staircase snatching up his hat and walkingstick from the halltable where in thoughtless indiscretion he had left them he passed out through the door held open by the maid and turned towards fifth avenue still deeply absorbed in his problem his eyes on vacancy he quite failed to observe the limousine which at the mo ment his feet touched the sidewalk was already drawing in before the holland residence elliot hollands faculties however he being less singly engrossedwere more generally alert he not only ob served the emerging caller he identified him chapter ii giros as any sophisticated new yorker will tell you is an italian res what is isnt taurant with a highclass italian clien tle outwardly unpretentious snug gled cozily between taller brownstone fronts on a crossstreet off broadway in the vicinity of lincoln square it is of another world from that of park avenue and its nabobs which is but little less than a mile to the eastward yet rarely does the italian ambassador forego at least one dinner at giros on the occasions of his metropolitan visits and the prince of operatic tenors is a regular patron as a rendezvous for young calvert and bianca holland it very nearly ap proached the ideal while near enough to their homes to be convenient of ac cess detection was the most remote of possibilities yet it provided invariably a variedly delicious menu and the serv ice was as enticingly perfect as that of the smartest restaurant in the city on the day following his indiscreet visit to the holland home calvert ar rived at giros some minutes in advance of the appointed hour of one as was his habit he avoided the larger front room preferring to reach the smaller one in the rear by means of the con necting sidepassage rather than risk the thousandth chance of recognition their tablethe one to which they had been directed on their initial visit more than a year ago and which on sub sequent occasions he had invariably re served by telephonewas located in a partially curtained alcove and not un til he was under the alcove arch did he see that it was unoccupied in his impatience overestimating the time involved in the journey from his wall street office he imagined himself late and the absence of bianca in its first effect was a sickening letdown if nothing happens she had said and there recurred to him too that phrase of hers we are on the knees of the gods but consulting his watch he was re assured she had still six minutes he sat down and of the hovering waiter ordered a cocktail when it was brought and he had drunk it and lighted a cigarette he heard a clock in the front room strike one from that moment he began counting the minutes the fact that she was rarely punctual somehow gave him little con solation today was not like other days if you are not there at one he had told her ill come here he had meant that he still meant it but he must he supposed give her some grace it would only mess things up to goand miss her the question was how long should he wait he contented himself for five min utes his eyes fastened on the edge of the curtain in constant expectation then he gave her five minutes more when it was half gone he resolved that he would not wait beyond the quarter hour he began tapping on the table with the edge of the menucard estimating each tap as a second in this way he counted two minutes more he had begun on the third minute when she came curiously enough he was actually surprised to see her his hope had be come attenuated to that degree he rose but he had no words im awfully sorry she was saying but i couldnt get here a second soon er at the last minute cecile insisted on another fitting of one of my frocks and i was late getting to her because but you must know yourself lee how it is there are always a hundred things to do the last day so long as youre here its all right he smiled but i nearly had the wil lies waiting he had forestalled the waiter by tak ing her wrap and drawing out her chair for her and now when she was seat ed he availed himself of the opportu nity still standing behind her to touch with appreciatively caressing hand the velvet of her throat and cheek by neither a jot nor tittle had he re ceded from his determination of the previous day to follow her abroad whether or no but he had no inten tion to mar their luncheon hour by in troducing the subject before dessert what is isnt and in order to guard against any pos sible broaching of it on her part he had predetermined his initial topic even to the extent of holding in mind his open ing sentence curiously enough though when the order had been given and they were alone they both spoke at once and both in identically the same words ive something to tell you then in chorus they laughed at the coincidence and never to calvert watching her had bianca been he thought just like this yesterday he had fancied her eclipsing all past ra diances of desirability but today her loveliness held for him an added charm her skin was fairer clearer more deli cately tinted her eyes brighter yet brimming more with the love he craved above all things and he sobered ab ruptly under the distress of the realiza tion that should he have permitted her to have her way he would now be look ing at her for the last time for what would seem at least a century it was in the hope that she might mean to tell him she had yielded that he granted her the precedence he had so jealously striven to keep very well dear he said my story can wait elliot saw you yesterday that was her news saw me yes leaving the house there were no fatal results how do you know there might have been i saw him an hour ago myself he was quite fit then well what hap pened he said that it was evident he was not taking me away any too soon was that all it was quite enough as he said it but it wasnt all he called you some horrid names and you too oh no he blamed himself rather he said he never questioned my fidel ity im too cold a woman to lose my head but in the long run even i might prove not altogether immune to the flattery of an unscrupulous libertine he was glad he had taken steps in time to save me what a cur calvert muttered still im glad he saw me im glad he regarded me as dangerous it must have added to his sense of insecurity what a fool to think that by taking you abroad he can alter the situation any he doesnt understand you see his vanity is something prodigious he im agines that by devotion at this late day he can make me forget you calverts mouth twitched under the stab of that by devotion and the lan cinating pang it inflicted good god he murmured through teeth tightclosed the thought of you going toto that she leant nearer to him pressing against the tableedge oh lee she breathed sympathet ically you have nothing to fear you know you havent it isnt that i doubt you he pro tested you cant think that its only the thought of to what youll be subjected to his kisses and embraces every minute ill be picturing you in his arms i know what the torture will be but youre exaggerating it elliot isnt like you hes seldom demonstra tive and i you wouldnt know me if you could see me with him im glacial i am really stop he commanded stop youre only making it worse and almost savagely he ground out the red cinder of his cigarette in the basin of the little iron matchstand for a little space neither spoke bi anca her eyes all pity gazed at his drawn profile as he sat with face avert ed his chin lowered and his eyes fixed on the red velvet carpet presently she said but you had something to tell me what is it im curious it was all of half a minute before he responded then he faced her once more oh that he said it was only what is isnt that i called on your husband this morning she started at the words caught her breath with a little gulp and her eyes widened youyou called she began yes but dont be alarmed we had no words you werent mentioned because all our messengers were out i like a fool volunteered to deliver the letter of credit that hes to pay your expenses with on the other side i was going that way and i fancied that id only have to hand it to his managing clerk but hed left instructions that the mes senger should be shown in under the circumstances i couldnt very well re fuse could i but i dont understand why he wanted to make sure that it was all right i suppose so as to avoid fur ther delay if it wasnt and was it naturally our house rarely makes errors weve been too long at the game but if there had been a mistake in every line hed never have detected one it was most amusing he pre tended to look it over but my presence rattled him didnt take in a word he was reading and i just stood there watching his face grow redder and red der by the minute and wishing to god that a little vein might burst in his brain and hurry him to kingdom come i must have laughed aloud at his vexa tionat his obvious discomfitureif i hadnt been so intent on that wish oh lee its the truth why shouldnt i confess it ordinarily im not a very good hater bee but if hating could kill elliot holland hed be dead at this minute my dearest there was hurt as well as deprecation in her tone i wish you wouldnt say such things our love should be above hatred and her lip quivered the waiter came then and calvert was perforce silent when having placed the blue points before them the waiter once more effaced himself the ardent young lover on second thought suppressed his intended de fence i hope you have nothing today to hurry away for he said instead and it was with a little temporary glow of satisfaction that he heard her answer nothing the whole afternoon is yours if you want it want it he echoed it can be measured by minutes and i long for the immeasurable an halfhour passed they were picking at breasts of quail broiled to a turn under crisp bacon strips and sip ping a dry still wine which imparted a certain temporary warmth of content ment when a sudden jangle of brass curtainrings and a swift movement aside of the crimson plush hangings at biancas back caused them both to start calvert abruptly apprehensive lifted his gaze and biancas lovely head exe cuted a quick turn so that simul taneously they were conscious of their invaded privacy a tall thin gentlemanly appearing man vandykebearded and slightly bald was regarding them from the mid dle of the archway both recognized him he was elliot hollands elder brother robert both too were in stantly aware of a stem gravity of visage which communicated something more unusual than simple alarm and both were mute under the weight of it nor did he either bow or speak un til advancing he stood between them at the tables end and then he addressed bianca i have been trying to locate you since twelvethirty he said in a voice ominously hushed something tragic has happened calverts eyes went to the face of the woman he loved it was white as pa per and she was staring frightenedly at her brotherinlaw elliot she questioned breathing the name he nodded calvert got to his feet there was what is isnt but one inference holland was dead his wish had come true but he ex perienced no delight the shock of it numbed him the scene in which he was taking part seemed like a dream in which biancas white face and tear less piteous eyes dominated every thing i have a taxi waiting he heard robert holland say he saw the white face rise it ap peared to him to float upward he took a step her wrap but already it was in hollands hands he was holding it for her if theres anything i can he be gan but no one paid him the slightest at tention the two figures moved away si lently the curtains swayed were swept aside fell back into their places he was alone beside the table in the alcove chapter iii it occurred to lee calvert later as the taxicab in which he was being driven to his club whirled recklessly through columbus circle that robert holland after that first look from the archway had not once turned his face to him and he smiled to himself with a partially recovered and momen tarily quickening complacency at his presumptuous egotism in imagining that he would it was not unlikely that his brother had taken him into his confidence but even if this were not so the bare fact of his sisterinlaw lunching tetea tete in an obscure restaurant with a man much his brothers junior would have been sufficient and especially at such a time to provoke his antagonism he was willing in view of the cir cumstances to make for bianca every possible allowance it was but natural that crushed to a stupor by the sudden ness of the tidings she should have been so obsessed by them as to lose perception of everything else even he himself had been nearly knocked out by it nevertheless as he now calmly reviewed the episode he could not wholly assuage the hurt of her to tal inobservance there was no get ting away from the fact that she had forgotten him entirely and left him without either a glance or a word but not until later at the club with the earlier editions of the evening pa pers about him did the possibility occur to him that it might after all have been other than mere forgetting that it might indeed have been in recollec tion and horror of those idly spoken words at the table about wishing a little cerebral vein would break and then if hating would kill hed be dead this minute suppose he thought she should believe that that hating can kill and that my hating killed him no two of the newspaper stories were quite the same still they all agreed pretty well as to the time and it was very evident to calvert that the apoplectic strokethey were unani mous on apoplexy as the causemust have almost immediately followed his call he remembered looking at his watch as he came down in the elevator and that it was ten minutes or so after twelve he had been anxious then about his appointment at giros for he had still another call to make and there was no telling with the crowded traffic conditions how long it would take him to get uptown by taxi and the papers had it that manning the managing clerk found elliot hol land apparently lifeless upon entering his office at quarterpast twelve the more calvert thought about this small margin the less he liked it for tunately none of the accounts men tioned his name but he had told bi anca and women were in a way such undependable creatures they were given at times to the weirdest sort of fancies which they denominated intui tions here the very thing had happened that he most wished foror thought he didand it might prove disastrous what is isnt now that holland was gone he actu wished him back if he had only insisted on taking to him that letter credit filson the chief clerk of department had been reluctant to let him thered be a boy available in half an hour he said butyes hed insisted he wanted to see holland be fore he sailed he had told bianca he didnt expect to but he did he would have been disappointed if he had not knowing that he possessed the love of this mans wife his craving was to face him and silently to gloat over him and in his heart he had said watching the husbands discom fiture you may take her away from me in body but in spirit well still be together because we belong to one another he had come away triumphant ex ulting in the conviction that he held the upper hand and that nothing could displace him and here but two hours later death was mocking him elliot bolland dead was usurping his su premacy he touched the bell on the table and when a waiter responded he ordered a highball the club lounge was near ly deserted in one corner three men probably new memberswhom he did not know were in interested con verse unconsciously after lighting a fresh cigarettehe had been smoking incessantlyhis gaze lingered upon them it rested there when the waiter reappeared with his tray and the clink of glass broke in upon his abstraction but when his drink had been mixed and was at his lips a voice high pitched and pentrating drew his atten tion once more to that comer a fourth man had joined the others was stand ing beside them and it was he who was speaking yes everybodys talking of it downtown calvert heard most sen sational thing thats happened in years it came out on the ticker first you know as apoplexy all the papers had it that but there seems no doubt now that the poor chap was murdered calverts glass slipped from his sud denly nerveless fingers struck the rounded leather arm of his chair and dropped to the floor it didnt break the thickness of the rug saved itbut there was a tinkling reverberation and the speaker looked around he saw calvert bending to recover it then he went on no doubt of it stabbed they say with a hatpin or something like it thats all thats definite but theres no end of theories having returned his empty glass to the silvered tray lee calvert rose from his chair and stood a moment attacked by a sensation of giddiness that was new to him objects were circling and there was an unwonted sense of ful ness in his head he rested a hand on the chairback and so steadied him self the vertigo or whatever it was passed he told himself that he needed air the lounge was hot and close in the reception hall he turned to the coat room window on his right and was waiting for his overcoat hat and walk ingstick when he heard behind him the words theres mr calvert now sir he wheeled sharply facing a heavy set redhaired and moustached man in a dark grey coat and soft hat and knew instantly his errand it was prepos terous of course absurd and most aggravating but it was equally un avoidable he was about to be ar rested superbly he pulled himself together he even managed a smile of greet ing in just a moment he said the boys getting my things then ill go with you to onlookers it must appear that the burly caller had come by appointment chapter iv emerging in a measure from her daze in the taxicab with robert hol land silent and sombre beside her there was one question which rose paramount in the mind of bianca and what is isnt clamored for answer and strangely enough it was a question which in his pondering had not once addressed it self to calvert she was perplexed be yond measure to know how her brother inlaw had even after that hour and more of delay discovered that she was at giros and it was not till the day was spent that awful afternoon of crowding privileged callers close relatives of elliots and her own and that evening of crowding memoriesthat her curi osity was satisfied much as she wished to know she would have sacrificed her tongue rather than ask robert holland and he was the last man to have vol unteered information on to him so delicate a matter throughout the ordeal of that pre mature and precipitate homecoming succeeded by that seemingly endless lis tening to a detailed narrative of just what had happened at the law offices preceding and following the discovery of the sagging lifeless body in the re volving chair and finally the exchange of expressions of sympathy and con dolence with kinsfolk bianca after the initial shock of surprise bore herself with commendable bravery tactfully she managed by sheer force of will to steer a middle course between an exhibition of too much feel ing and of too little gaining thus for herself undeserved commendation for her admirable selfcontrol in the face of an overwhelming sorrow and avoiding the criticism of the captious for lack of emotion not to say heartlessness for the expenditure of nervous force involved in this successful endeavor however she had subsequently to pay with the departure of the last visitor there descended upon her an avalanche of imaginings born of swift reaction the objective gave place to the sub jective she became the prey of her own introspection she had been if not unfaithful in the larger acceptation of that term certainly undutiful self reproach seized upon her and exacted its measure of requital she was haunted by her dead in her opaltinted boudoir to which she had fled at the first moment of freedom her husband awaited her he moved constantly before her he was in every chair he sat where yester day lee calvert had sat beside her on the small white and lavender sofa and always though he spoke no word there was accusation in the fixed stare of his small misty grey eyes accusa tion and reproach as in a panorama there unrolled be fore her scene after scene of their life together the four years of which were crowded into a space of minutes there was too their first meeting at a newport garden party recalling her hasty appraisement of him and her utter indifference it was followed by his proposal on the moonlit deck of his yacht her reluctance to wound him with a definite refusal and the subse quent appeal of her mother not idly to reject so advantageous an opportunity with a keen pang of reflected memory she saw again her wedding and her monstrously miscalled honeymoon and all the horrid pictures of her direful awakening to the bondage of a mar riage on which eros frowned how often in those early months had she wished herself dead how many times had she considered the ways and means of selfdestruction and yet been too cowardly to put them to practice and then after the coming into her life of lee calvert how wondrously had she changed no longer was there anything desirable in deathher own death she wanted life then life at its full and presently she had come to realize that nothing but divorce or elliot hollands death could give it to her the former she very soon learned must be regarded as even a more re mote possibility than the latter her parents were of that conservative ele ment which frowns upon the legal rup ture of the marriage tie as both an im morality and a sacrilege and her hus band an egoist of egoists as well as a strange admixture of ice and quick fierce flame would release her only up what is isnt the most direct evidence of dis loyalty yesterday was not the first time that she had heard lee wish him dead they rarely met that he didnt and though she never failed to rebuke him she was conscious now that she too silently and treacherously for more than two years had entertained the same desire so looking as she was forced to look into that accusing re proachful ghostly face ever before her it was this which gave to it its greatest power of torture in an effort to exorcise the obsession bianca rang for her maid marie bourgois long in her service was a spare active greyhaired wo man of fortyodd efficient to a degree kindhearted and sympathetic yet with an abundance of stern common sense ah madame she crooned as one glance at her mistresss tortured eyes touched a tender spot in her it is not right that you should be alone it was on biancas tonguetip to say but its because im not alone that im miserable she said instead however i wanted to be nevertheless you are right marie when i am alone i think and think oh such horrid things and my brain wont stop its like a woundup machine if i could only sleep madame shall sleep marie assured her it is that you have given your self too much to those people when you should have sent for le docteur and gone straight to bed but a warm bath perhaps and if i brush madames hair yes and bianca agreeing the maid be came instantly busy emerging from the bath the young widow of hours was encouraged to find that she could now look at the little sofa or any one of the chairs without seeing it occupied her visitant had left her and thus relieved when com fortably seated with cushions at her back and marie occupied with her hair brush the question of the taxicab re curred and once more clamored for answer tell me marie she said how poor monsieurs brother ascertained where i was so as to bring me the bad news ah that it was most simple madame no one here knew of course but when i told him madame always considerate had preferred to employ a taxi rather than take out poor griggs the chauffeur who was still weak from the grippe he had but to ask the com pany from which it was ordered as it was i who called up for madame i knew and i gave him the number but the taxi had not returned so we had to wait leaving instructions that when it came in it should be sent here again at once with the same driver bianca said nothing and marie ex pecting a word of praise for the way she had shared in the accomplishment asked was it not well madame well oh yes marie very well she answered it was really her maids first indis cretion but the circumstances were extraordinary and she could not blame her still she was uncomfortable over the revelation it involved she was op pressed by a fear that robert holland might make use of it she did not be lieve him friendly to her a conviction was strong upon her that he was in his brothers confidence and if he cared to he could make her position decidedly unpleasant by circu lating the story that he had found her following her husbands tragic death lunching surreptitiously with mr cal vert in an italian restaurant but with all her misgivings she had not the vaguest notion as to how this incident was eventually to develop for by good fortune more than good management the news of calverts ar rest and the charge of murder had not yet reached her she was still under the impression that her husband had died naturally of apoplexy just as what is isnt dr vanderslice had warned he might and as she always imagined he would chapter v the more sensational newspapers of thursday morning printed diagrams of the holland delray amp dallas law offices on the sixteenth floor of one of the taller labyrinthine buildings of lower broadway in one respect at least they differed from the average offices of their size in possessing but one entrance and stress was laid up on this point in order to impress upon readers the fact that whoever was guilty of mr hollands untimely taking off must have come and gone by that door a dotted line had been drawn to in dicate the course of a caller seeking the senior member of the law firm it be gan in the corridor where he would step from one of the elevators and con tinued thence to this single means of access twenty yards distant crossing the sill he would then it showed find himself within a small oblong railed off space and facing a little table at which sat usually the office boy whose duty it was to attend to callers assuming that he has an appoint ment with mr holland the news paper continued he passes through a swinging gate at his left and crosses this outer office given over to clerks accountants stenographers and the telephone operator at her switchboard and enters through a green baizecov ered door punctured by a glass oval the office library it is an oblong room its right and far walls hidden by serried files of calfbound law reports in cases reaching to the ceiling a partition to the left divides its full length from the private offices of the three firm mem bers each with its own groundglass paneled door the first is that of mr holland the second of mr delray and the far one of mr dallas a green velvet carpet covers the library floor and a long directors table and seven or eight chairs all of mahogany consti tute in addition to the bookcases its furnishing above the table a shaded electrolier always lighted supplements the scant illumination afforded by the ground glass the dotted line of the diagram turned into mr hollands office and the accompanying letterpress went on to call attention to the fact that even with the officedoor ajar a person seat ed at the library table could not see mr hollands desk and chair which were near the right dividing wall and close to the door connecting with the delray office lee calvert in a tombs cell ex amined the diagrams with an amusedly satiric interest but read the sensation ally colored accounts of the tragedy with careful and serious attention editorially as well as reportorially the press he gathered was noncommittal guardedly it theorized more boldly it alluded to the obvious necessity of the arrest recounting the fact that the vie tim had been found dead five minutes after the departure of the prisoner and that no one apparently had entered the private office in the interim but the general tendency of all the newspapers was to play up the mystery since the standing of the accuseda junior member of the old and distinguished banking house of gardener brothers was so unimpeachable that in the ab sence of motiveand as yet no motive had been ascertainedit was almost inconceivable that he should be guilty that at all events was the view em bodied nearly verbatim in the most conservative morning journal of the metropolis and it was the editorial key note of all the others moreover it bore out to a nicety the expressed opinion of owen wills his counsel with whom he had had a long and most encouraging conference following his apprehension at the club and his ar raignment at police headquarters theres nothing to it old chap wills had assured him its absurd why in the name of all thats good and bad should you want to put elliot hol land of all persons out of the way what is isnt and calvert had replied evasively yes thats the point why but no sooner were the words ut tered than he questioned their wisdom it was not good policy to deceive ones lawyer yet how could he tell wills of his love for bianca and the pitch to which he had been wrought by her imminent departure for europe he had no better no closer friend in all new york than owen but he had never so much as hinted to him his ro mantic attachment never probably had there been a love affair so carefully abd successfully guarded he had been fearful therefore that in their eager scenting some one at least of the newspapers might have got wind of his secret and what he had hardly thought of yesterday at the time began to loom larger and larger as a menacing peril suppose robert holland should be interviewed and tell where and under what circumstances he had found bianca suppose the maid by whom he was admitted to the holland house on tuesday or the maid who served tea to them together in biancas bou doir should be questioned by some abiquitous reporter but as no one of these things had happened he was re assured after all it was best that he had said nothing at any moment now the real culprit might be detected and his own release would follow at the worst it could be only a question of a little while before wills would get the matter be fore the grand jury which because of this lack of motive would refuse to indict him so altogether after reading the newspapers calverts spirits rose bianca was free and after a year at most just to satisfy mrs grundy and the conventions they would be married it was everything considered not such a great price to pay for such a glorious consummation meanwhile owen mills dark dap per and energetic with a manner that was both disarming and engaging had called at the offices of holland delray amp dallas and was closeted with the lastnamed he had of course announced him self as representing calvert and had explained his mission by the statement that after examining the diagrams in the newspapers he had become inter ested in that middle office occupied he understood by mr delray primarily that he added though i should like to have at first hand an explicit account of precisely what hap pened you know yourself my dear fellow how inaccurate and inconsistent the papers are george dallas a youngish man slightly bald and wearing shellrimmed glasses which accentuated a high and beetling brow yielded with charming grace from a drawer of his desk he took a documental appearing sheaf of typed sheets of legal cap backed in blue and pinned together at the top with brass eyelets i have here he said what are practically affidavits though not yet executed of everyone who was in the office yesterday before at and after the occurrence that of manning our managing clerk covers most of the ground the others are more or less confirmatory shall i read it or would you prefer to do so yourself wills said that if mr dallas would be so good hed be glad to hear him whereupon leisurely and in a pleasant voice with a clearness of articulation which wills envied he began ill omit the usual opening the affiant is frederick manning of west th street who has been our managing clerk for five years he ar rived at the office yesterday morning at nine oclock or thereabouts he goes on in the course of the next half hour i had occasion to enter the library there was no one in it the doors to mr hollands and mr dallass offices were open and the offices were unoccu pied mr delrays office door was closed and locked from the library side not finding in its place the book i wished and seeing no books in the other what is isnt offices i unlocked mr delrays door discovered the book on his desk and took it with me relocking the door permit me to explain mr dallas interrupted his reading to say that mr delray has been absent since the first of august and that his office is rarely used wills nodded and the reader con tinued from that time until my discov ery of mr hollands body i was con tinuously present in the outer office and saw everyone who entered or left the library and the private offices mr dallas arrived at went in to his office and left again at for special sessions edward galton a law stu dent came in shortly after ten and read in the library until nearly halfpast eleven while he was there mr hol lands brotherinlaw stephen arrow smith called and asked for mr hol land i told him that i was not certain that mr holland would be down that day as he was sailing early the next morning for europe and had about completed all his arrangements for sev eral months absence he said he knew thatabout his sailingbut that he had a partial engagement to meet him here that morning he went into the library to wait it was probably ten minutes later that mr holland got me on the tele phone and informed me that he would be down at noon he asked me to call up gardener brothers in the meantime and instruct them to have his letter of credit here without fail by twelve i did so then i looked in the library and told mr arrowsmith what i had learned as i held the door open ed ward galton passed me going out mr arrowsmith and i chatted for a mo ment and he finally decided to attend to some other matter meanwhile and left the office saying he would be back in time to catch mr holland he had hardly left when he re turned for his umbrella which he had forgotten he said it looked like snow a minute later he went out again and i did not see him until after my dis covery meanwhile edward galton had come in again in company with two other students frank hippe and john tumulty they were reading when at ten minutes to twelve mr holland en tered the letter of credit had not come and he was very angry i pointed out the fact that he had said noon and that there were still ten minutes to spare in spite of that he got gardener brothers on the wire and spoke very sharply i gathered that he was told it was on the way the reader paused and wills asked with a smile if that was supposed to constitute a motive for murder sharp words over the telephone he explained when dallas looked per plexed if so none of us would be safe the junior member however lack ing a sense of humor solemnly con tinued his reading mr calvert of gardener broth ers arrived with the letter of credit at i was watching the clock he came to my desk with it and i asked him to hand it himself to mr hol land he passed through the library door and five minutes later came out again and left the office shortly after thatnot over five minutes at the most i myself went to mr hollands office a question had occurred to me that required an answer from him be fore he sailed and i thought best to get it at once as otherwise i might for get it the door to his office was closed i knocked fancied i heard him answer and went in to my astonishment his body was sagging to the right over the arm of his revolving chair his head drooping forward at an angle and the fingers of his right hand resting on the floor his eyes were closed or half closed and i thought he had fainted i spoke to him but he did not re spond i said sharply mr holland the words were without effect i lifted him up and straightened him in his chair it was evident to me then that he was totally unconscious per haps moribund his flesh i observed what is isnt was warm and i could not believe him dead i ran in haste to the front office crying as i did so mr hollands un conscious he must have a doctor at once in all my experience i had never before been called upon to get a physician in that part of the city and i was at a loss what to do kate gil lender our telephone operator came to the rescue she put in an emergency call for an ambulance returning to mr hollands office i found the three students there and the whole outeroffice force i think followed me frank hippe said to me hes dead he had unbuttoned his waistcoat and put his ear to his chest and there was no observable heart beat together he and andrew force the mail clerk and i carried the body from the chair to the leather couch on the other side of the room in spite of hippes assertion we did everything we could think of to restore consciousness but of course without any effect while we were working mr arrow smith returned he was greatly shocked and seemed very much moved it was twenty minutes before the ambu lance surgeon arrived he made a cursory examination of the body as it lay on the couch and pronounced it a case of death from apoplexy mr arrowsmith told me he would call up mr robert holland and have him break the news to mrs holland and he did so at the same time on our second wire the ambulance surgeon re ported the case to the coroner the coroners physician dr win ters reached the office at about one thrity i was present when he ex amined the body it was a much more thorough examination than that of dr michelson the ambulance surgeon he discovered a small puncture in the neck just at the base of the skull made evi dently by a sharp skewerlike piece of steel there had been very little bleed ing the hair there was slightly matted and a small bloodstain was on the col lar subsequently he made a search of the private office and found under mr hollands desk an oldfashioned wire bill or notefile consisting of a sharp upright of sharpened steel set in a square iron base the upright was bloodstained he questioned me close ly and i gave him all the facts em bodied in this affidavit it was not un til after three oclock that i learned of the arrest of mr lee calvert mr dallas lowered the sheaf of typed sheets and looked at owen wills who was making a pencilled note on the back of an envelope shall i read the others he asked is that the end of mannings wills enquired in turn it is the junior member answered nodding in the others is there any identifica tion of the oldfashioned file no no one in this office had ever seen it before i understand thank you the others merely confirm manning just that ill read them if you like oh no i shant trouble you youre very good but i should like to see mr hollands office if i may you certainly may mr dallas returned the affidavits to his drawer and rising held open his door and motioned to wills to precede him at the next doorit bore upon its groundglass panel the lettering mr delraythe visitor paused this room is still locked i as sume still locked wills saw the key protruding from its escutcheon the hammond office was also locked and mr dallas stepping to the baize covered door pushed it ajar and called mr manning if you please the young man who appeared wills scrutinized closely he had noticed him in the outer office on entering but he now held an augmented interest he was probably about twentysix years of age of medium height with brown hair inclined to curl and clean shaven his eyes wills noted were hazel and they struck him as shrewd s sdec what is isnt as did also his closelipped mouth but he would hardly consider him danger ous his forte very evidently was de tail at mr dallass request manning took from a pocket a key and opened the door to the scene of the tragedy the office was half again as large as mr dallass the flattop desk of polished mahogany stood slantwise on the right the chair behind it faced the entrance diagonally its back was close to the door connecting with mr delrays room wills walked over and turned the knob of this door it is locked mr dallas volun teered has been locked since mid summer and the key manning has it as wills was about to go he said what is your personal theory of the affair or havent you any the junior member hesitated to me of course he answered presently it seems too terrible to be true yet the conclusion is obvious only one man could have done it the man who was last in this room with him ah there is i recall now in the statement of each of the three young men who sat in the library a vital point which you probably do not know un til your client entered this room the door was open he closed it when he entered and he closed it after him when he left in the absence of motive returned wills that has little weight he probably expected to be railed at and possibly to have some sharp words hurled after him but theres a most impelling mo tive mr dallas rejoined if hes been frank with you you must know it he was carrying on an affaire with his victims wife mr holland had dis covered it it was to separate them that he was about to take mrs holland abroad owen wills flushed angrily that he said sharply is an infer nal fabrication and we will prove it mr dallas smiled and we will prove that calvert went redhanded from here to keep an as signation with her chapter vi despite the ministrations of the effi cient marie bianca holland had slept but lightly and so sleeping had been harassed by disturbing dreams from which repeatedly she started starkly awake in all of them elliot her hus band vigorously alive was at grips with lee calvert usually he was cho king him in onethe most terrify inghe had slain him and wringing her hands in an insufferable frenzy of woe she knelt beside his mangled and distorted cadaver beseeching him to speak daylight found her on the verge of nervous collapse and marie taking matters in her own hands because she feared a refusal should she ask permis sion telephoned indirectly for dr van derslice that is to say she called up biancas most intimate friend mrs stanny rhysdael and besought her to halve the responsibility which she promptly did but at the same time her tone one of condolent anxiety she added im coming straight down to see her a woman without a confidante is an anomaly womens sorrows are light ened and their joys are heightened it seems by sharing no matter how in clined to discretion there is almost in variably one of their own sex in whose sympathetic keeping they entrust their secrets and while calvert would have lost a limb rather than hint his ro mance to his closest friend bianca hol land had from the very first discussed every phase of it with sarah rhysdael it was not yet nine oclockan un conscionable hour for any smart wom an to be abroadwhen sarah without so much as tapping burst into biancas chamber and with a little cry of greet ing flew to her bedside and precipi tately flung herself upon her oh you poor poor dear she mur what is isnt mured burying her face between the others neck and shoulder and inhaling the fragrance of biancas favorite french sachet then for a space both wept sarah uncontrollably but bianca in a series of hysterical spasms which her will was powerless to command marie standing in the bathroom door regarded the scene with approval it was the first time her mistress had cried and she believed with ovid that grief is satisfied and carried off by tears to think dear sarah managed to say at length sitting on the edge of the bed and dabbing at her moist lashes and cheeks that this awful thing should to you she was half a head shorter than bi anca and fair but for the unceasing she waged against overplumpness she would have been chubby as it was she was most daintily moulded bianca still sobbing but more re frainedly was without words but the more volatile sarah continued yerday was terrible enough but this mornings papers i wonder you are alive to the wretched woman propped against the pillows however this ant nothing she didnt care what the papers might say what additional trails they might give even if they could have got robert hollands story of his discovery it was all one to her knew now the solitary secret of her misery she had found it in her dreams elliot holland dead was more powerful than elliot holland alive to keep lee calvert from her there had ever been a time in all their acquaint ance when she needed him as she did now and there had never been a time when he was so securely held from her she knew nothing of the actual con dictions of how by the machinery of the he was pinioned she still saw him a free man in every sense but one she saw him at liberty to go and come as he pleased everywhere save to her m whom alone convention barred him for the sake of her good name lest the world should see in his coming the casting of shadows behind he must deprive both her and himself of the consoling sweetness of communion but sarah rhysdael had no inkling of the truth naturally enough she had gathered from maries concern that her friend had gone nervously to pieces not over her husbands death but over this gruesome charge against and im prisonment of the man she loved nothing else she felt could account for it nothing else could warrant it sarah came not to fortify not to brace not even to comfort she came dolorously to sympathize to mingle her tears with the tears of the sufferer and to follow her sacrificially as she traversed her via crucis poor lee she went on its sim ply awful for him too no one can be lieve that he did it and yet theres no one else that could but thats the newspapers you know stanny says that theyll never convict him i do hope that it was at this point that bianca springing up wideeyed gripped her wrist what are you saying she cried in sudden agitation aroused by the dis turbing pregnancy of a phrase what are you saying sarah was startled she was so taken by surprise indeed that just for a moment she could not recollect what she had been saying certainly nothing disloyal though she knew that my dear she gasped parrying feinting never convict him bianca re peated what do you mean that is what stanny says her friend qualified you dontyou cant believe that they will convict whom convict of what sarah paled with fright even now she did not divine the truth it did not yet occur to her that bianca knew less than she there was she thought but one explanation the horror had af fected her friends reason she was not herself poor thing she turned about her gaze seeking marie but what is isnt the frenchwoman was gone her im pulse was to run she had never been alone with a demented person before she did not know how to treat one biancas grip on her wrist however was tightening she tried to release her arm just a minute dear she pleaded but the pressure of the circling fingers waxed stronger convict whom convict of what tell me bianca repeated insistently try to think try to remember bee sarah rattled nervously she re called having heard that insane persons must me humored but no one has done anything someone has you know that poor elliot didnt kill himself he wasnt killed who says he was killed the newspapers everyone but theyve arrested the wrong man we all know that lee couldnt have done it it was in this wise that the news came to the wretched bianca and she dropped under it as if an axe had crushed through her skull her hold on sarahs wrist relaxed suddenly and she fell back among her pillows ghastly white and inert at the same moment a tap sounded on the door which sarah was too frightened to hear she was still sit ting halfparalyzed with alarm on the beds edge when a hand was laid on her shoulder and she started with a violent tremor a big broadshouldered man grey haired and with a scant grey beard trimmed to a point was standing be hind her dr vanderslice had arrived in the nick of time chapter vii owen wills had gone straight from the holland delray amp dallas offices to the tombs and his client indignantly as he had resented and repudiated the dallas declaration of motive as an in fernal fabrication he was nevertheless greatly disturbed by it and he was moreover infuriate that lee calvert should have concealed if true so vital an element but was it true it was inconceivable that dallas could make such an assertion without pretty con vincing evidence and yet it was barely in reason that considering the close ness of their intimacy calvert had been able to suppress so completely an at tachment of this kind until client and counsel were face to face therefore and the question had been put and answered there was room for doubt with the truth established wills exasperation rose to a high pitch he was a temperamental young man abundantly talented who took his pro fession with great seriousness and his own cleverness made him intolerant of the least evidence of stupidity in those he believed in youre an ass he stormed his cheeks flushed to the temples and his eyes blazing chivalry be damned this was no time for chivalry of that sort a man accused of crime should be as candid with his attorney as he is with his other self and i refuse to act for a man who isnt hollands firm will throw all the weight of its combined forcesand that includes in side knowledgein with the office of the district attorney it will practically prepare his case for him its got this and god only knows what else its got whereas you you poor simpleton have put me at a disadvantage from the start and i wont accept the handi cap how do i know what else you may have up your sleeve were beaten before the flag falls left at the post so i stop right here because i decline to come in a bad last retain somebody else i wash my hands of you calvert a little ashamed struggled to force a smile oh come old chap he urged youre making a mountain out of a molehill suppose i had told you yes terday what difference could it have made owen wills did not deign to answer what is isnt he was picking up his hat then he moved towards the door but on the threshold he halted and turned send for lilligore he advised hes a better lawyer than i dare ever hope to be if any fellow can pull you through he can and he was gone it was marvin lilligore who repre sented calvert at the coroners inquest when he was held for the grand jury and it was marvin lilligore who as at torney of record applied for a tran script of the grand jury minutes after calvert was indicted for im possible as such an eventuality had seemed to him knowing his own inno cence the prosecution had experienced little difficulty in establishing a prima facie case the newspapers meanwhile had made all the capital possible out of owen willss withdrawal aided and abetted in this by the holland office wills they pointed out was the accused mans most intimate friendfor years they had been closer than brothers and calvert had retained him immedi ately following his arrest for twenty four hours wills had worked assidu ously and then for some reason which could only be surmised seeing that either he nor the prisoner nor the prisoners present counsel would throw any light on the matter he had precipi tely withdrawn the situation anomalous as it ap peared at first glance was not so diffi cult of solution as some seemed to im agine so one of the yellows put it editorially there were many prece ants for mr willss course indeed was not the first time that he himself had so acted in the majendie case it miight be remembered he had done pre cisely the same thing and it was ex amined at that time to be due to a dis agreement with his client as to the pol icy of defense mr wills was an able ist and jealous of his reputation and so on and so on with the effect of the distinct impression that so precarious was calverts position that wills who knew him best could see hope of acquittal in but one direction in spite of this however and the whole combined campaign to try the case in the press there was no word of denial or even of protest from either the wills or the lilligore office early in november bianca masquer ading under her maiden name and ac companied by marie had gone to at lantic city dr vanderslice had so advised and there with marvin lil ligore as intermediary a daily exchange of letters with lee calvert had been es tablished than this she could have had no bet ter medicine under its stimulus her nerves strengthened and by degrees her lost poise was reestablished for weeksever since that morning when sarah rhysdael had so illadvisedly hurled at her the crushing fact of mur der and arrestdoubt and apprehen sion had been her hourly companions her power to reason had been woefully crippled three sentences of lee cal verts had echoed and reechoed with condemning emphasis my conscience isnt so sensitive i nearly had the willies waiting if hating would kill elliot holland hed be dead this minute and with each repetition her torture had increased calverts first letter however did much to exorcise these dread phan toms her vision slowly cleared dimly she began to see and with each succeeding communication her sense of proportion grew until she marveled over her recent blindness lee wrote her of owen willss defection and of his retention of marvin lilligore of the latter he said i have every confi dence in him hes a bigger man than owen and when he promises me ac quittal as he does every time i see him i know that hell accomplish it bianca furiously resented owens course she knew him and had liked him but with reservations he was capricious inconsistent impulsive and she could never quite reconcile lees unqualified admiration for him nev ertheless she felt that nothing could what is isnt justify his desertion of his friend in such an extremity it was indefensible egregiously so one morningit was just after the indictmentwhile in a wheelchair on the boardwalk with marie beside her owen wills emerging from the throng like a pixy from leafage stood at her elbow lifting his hat a pleased con gratulatory smile on his lips if she could have escaped him she would but in taking her thus un awares he had made escape save at the expense of crass crudeness im possible i heard youd been ill he said i can see no signs of it i hear youve been horrid bianca gave him back yet you dont appear ashamed theres a reason was his rejoin der naturally satisfactory to yourself i suppose though i can hardly conceive even that i think it might even satisfy you if i were at liberty to share it youre much too credulous he shrugged slightly and tossed his sleek dark head let the future an swer i can wait you expect to be justified then and exonerated he added nod ding by the way may i call ive something to ask you where are you stopping im not sure that i care to receive you i cant condone disloyalty i dont ask you to i shant i have something else to ask that is much more important that is why i am down here why not ask it now then it will save you time it might be overheard more than that you may have to put on your thinking cap to answer is it she began but he inter rupted her of course it is but you dont know what i was going to say pardon me i know very well out of the fulness of the heart the mouth speaketh you think only of one thing these days i know that she gave him then the name of her hotel shall we say five this after noon she added you are very good he answered and putting on his hat was submerged in the crowd once more over the teatable in the parlor of biancas suite that afternoon with a dark steelgrey sea spreading away be fore them to where at the misty horizon it seemedto melt and rise in vapor mixing with the pale november sky owen wills produced a little red leather memorandum book and read to her one after another five pencilled names do they mean anything to you he asked as he finished and bianca an swered to the best of my recollection ive never heard but two of them before and they are frederick manning and stephen arrowsmith try to recollect didnt your hus band ever mention edward galton he might have who is he a young man who read law in his office he wouldnt have been likely to ive seen young men reading there but they were never presented to me any of them not frank hippe either nor john tumulty bianca shook her head did he ever say anything of man ning he mentioned him at times yes did he seem to like him or did he complain of him i dont recall that he ever com plained he wouldnt to me you know or praised either you know arrowsmith i sup pose very slightly he married a sister of elliots but she died before we were married i think elliot was trus tee of some property she left and of which mr arrowsmith drew the in come what is isnt they were on friendly terms then i think so i never heard other wise wills returned the redleather book to his waistcoat pocket but if youre no longer lees coun sel why this effort at investigation bianca asked perplexed because im interested was his swer im still his friend you know he didnt commit the crime we both know that yet someone did if we can discover who then lee will go free sometimes thats the shortest cut wouldnt you like to help me find on id do anything possible she con sented a quickened interest in her ex pression more indeed than in her words but it seems such a hopeless task no one in the office would have done it im sure they wouldnt not any more than lee im not so sure still you may be right but if it was anyone other than a person in the list of five i read to you then we have a certainty to begin on and that is that manning has lied and he paused suddenly but thats absurd manning is corroborated by the other fourby every one of men barely five minutes elapsed be tween lees leaving and mannings dis covery someone in the office must have done it arrowsmith didnt come in until later they say that leaves felly four to choose from manning and the three law students and if one of the students did it then the other two who were in the library are accesso ries and what can i do even in that case owen wills bent nearer to her possibly nothing but possibly still a great deal you can go care fully through your husbands corre spondence i mean his private letters theres a mass of them i suppose it wont be a light task but you may un earth bad blood you may discover an animus you may be the means of saving lee calvert from the electric chair for i may tell you now that his case otherwise is a weak one chapter viii society from the first had refused to take the charge against calvert seri ously had he been like any one of two score or more men whose names were on its tonguetip it would have said not at all unlikely but lee calvert never he was not that sort he was too levelheaded too abstemious and not in the least emo tional why this affair of his with bianca holland was a point in his favor not for a very long time had society had such a surprising morsel as that even the most unconscionable gossip mongers had never had an inkling and now that it was out only a small minority dared say that it had gone be yond the restrained stage men of such circumspection were not the men who with malice prepense would walk boldly into the office of an acquaint ance and with glovedhand hammer a crude needlelike thing of steel between his skull and vertebrae and with a dozen or more office employes within a few yards of the scene the whole edifice it seemed must fall of its own weight the district attorney must be a fool or else gone suddenly mad society however is but a small sec tor of the circle which is called the body politic and the body politic as a whole being less well informed was inclined generally to take the opposite view it was not the district attorney who was the fool or madman it was the prisoner how many cases had there been of almost exact similarity cases proven too beyond all question in which the defendants counsel pleaded brainstorm because there was noth ing else to plead that was how the great public which fed the newspapers as well as being fed by them regarded the case and it was from this great public and not that small sector that when in february the case came to trial the jury was drawn what is isnt a rumor had got into print and so gone abroad that the widow of the slain manthe sweetheart of the accused was to be called as a states witness and because of this more than any thing else the courtroom became a magnet for all classes from the elite to the proletariat it drew them from the very beginning that they might miss nothing connected with her and the case in which she was involved they attended on the opening day in throngs though all but the most inexperienced knew that she would not be present interestedly they sat through the long monotony of choosing the good men and true who were to pass judgment on the admitted evidence to one auditor in particular this se lection of the jury was especially inter esting he occupied a seat at the right end of the second row directly under the jury box a dark dapper nervously energeticappearing young gentleman with hair as smoothly black and shining as patentleather and a small black moustache like a rectangle of court plaster between his straight sensitive nose and his too red lips he wore an inconspicuous but wellcut suit of heavy blue serge quite dark and sat with crossed legs on which rested his over coat and soft hat it was owen wills that which particularly interested him was the battle of the opposing at torneys for and against two types of jurors the state was evidently anxious to pick from the panel at least a majority of men who were elderly married middle or lowerclass and re ligiouslyinclined to the verge of nar rowness whereas marvin lilligore in the interest of his client was both desirous and determined to pack the box if possible with bachelors of means preferably young and if not socially eminent at least worldly wise on very few of those questioned was it possible for their minds to meet with the inevitable consequence that their permitted quota of peremptory chal lenges was approaching exhaustion be fore the requisite twelve were half chosen for two days the conflict raged with small advantage to either on the third day however that which might have been foreseen from the first hap pened for from the first the type pre ferred by the defense had been in the minority the panel had dwindled neither side had a peremptory challenge left and the court impatient of the prolonged bickering became suddenly arbitrary and ruled out one challenge to the favor after another as rapidly as they were voiced so that in the end the jury sworn was presumably the district attorneys other things being equal in the proportion of seven to five in the meantime owing to crush of the curious it had become necessary to limit the attendance to those fortunate enough to secure cards of admission and by the third day many of the regulars who came early had their regular seats owen wills having chosen his in the beginning retained it and so did the middleaged man who had been seated toward that end of the second row when wills pushed past him to take the place beyond directly under the jury box he was a lean wiry sinewy creature of perhaps fortyfive or six clean shaven and partially bald his hair including that of his heavy eyebrows was a light tawny brown and his eyes a dim watery bluegrey the whites of which like his skin tinged with the yellow of old parchment his clothes they included a coat and trousers of brown worsted with a soiled pinstripe in it and a waistcoat of thickribbed corduroy of a darker brownwere an index of the man they indicated a sport so to speak rather gone to seed his shoes were much wornthey were tan oxfords evidently though masked by shabby soiled duncolored spats and the tan overcoat which he had thrown over the back of the bench be fore sitting down was threadbare at the edges his hat was a brown derby of about the same color as his hair wills in spite of his interest in the what is isnt juryselection now and then glanced observantly at him without seeming to do so and he took in all and more than is here recorded indeed on that first day he had noticed in crowding past him that he exhaled an unmistak able smell of alcohol and after that the only change was in variation of degree that which drew willss attention most fixedly upon his neighbor was an inarticulate something that escaped him on the first day when calvert under guard took his place in the dock it was more in the nature of a gaspa suppressed gaspwills thought than anything else but whether it indi cated surprise or pity or dismay it was difficult for him to determine out of the corner of his eye he tried to gather something more from the mans ex pression without any positive success he ascertained only that his gaze con tinued fixed upon the prisoner with an unfaltering intensity a more casual observer than wills would probably have divined that he was endeavoring to decide in advance of the evidence whether calvert was innocent or guilty but the young lawyer had a theory which militated against such a con clusion and as in partial justification of this it was but a minute or so later that the gazer turned to him with goodlooking chap isnt he his portraits in the papers havent done him justice dont wonder he made a hit with hollands wife for answer wills nodded pleasantly wihout opening his lips it was never theless the beginning of an acquaint ance which was to ripen as the trial progressed so thoroughly had the case been fea tured in the newsprints that the dis trict attorneys outline of it to the jury presented nothing that was not already common property and those who hung on his words hoping and expect ing some sensational revelation had small reward as ultimately developed however there were generalities in the arraignment which were of such lati tude as to include certain effective sur prises cleverly reserved for the wit ness stand undiscounted by so much as a suggestion in advance they came in the second stage of the states presentation when having proved the corpus delicti it became in cumbent to establish a strongly impell ing motive seeing that there was no single actual witness to the commission of the crime that bianca holland would be called for this purpose had been as already stated rather widely rumored and in connection with the rumor it was believed by the many who had followed the matter from the first that her testi mony would be chiefly as to the luncheon at giros on the day of the murder and generally concerning her relations with the accused certainly even the most sensationally imaginative could hardly have foreseen what was prepared for them including not mere ly the bolt from the blue furnished by bianca herself with lowered eyes and in a voice so faint as to be nearly in audible but the corroboration from a member of her own household as well as from her deceased husbands brother there had been something more than a distinctly audible stir in the court room when her name was called there had been a susurationstarting faintly like a faint whisper of the wind in a forestand rising to a murmur as of rushing waters old judge mccready his abundant white hair seeming to bristle and his clear blue eyes snapping rapped thunderously for order and the voices were stilled the silence following was one of a strained expectancy then suddenly there was a slight recurrence necks were craned at the back of the room a man stood up a dozen followed his example in an instant more than half the assemblage was on its feet a door to the right behind the jury box had opened and a black close fitting toque draped with a widows veil had become visible again the courts gavel echoed re what is isnt soundingly and a clerk was crying take your seats or the courtroom will be cleared as bianca sank into the capacious armchair on the elevation of the wit ness stand one could have heard a pin drop with a blackgloved hand she lifted her veil from her face sweeping it back over her shoulder her face was marble white in its sable setting and calm as a nuns owen wills noted that she had dropped her gaze to her hands which she folded in her lap the district attorney stepping close waited while she was sworn this formality ended he put to her the no less formal questions as to her name her residence and her relation ship to the victim of the crime it was his duty to probe give me the date please of your marriage bianca gave it you were married four years then lacking about a month when you were widowed yes her examiner paused thoughtfully for several seconds his eyes turned to a window across the courtroom through which a grey sky was visible then turning he said abruptly you know the prisoner at the bar i do bianca answered her poise undisturbed how long have you known him two years how well have you known him in spite of her a faint color crept into the whiteness of her face very well he is the best friend i have your husband was fond of him too my husband scarcely knew him the district attorney smiled you mean by that i assume that mr holland was not fond of him to know him is to love him but not knowing him your husband couldnt love him was he indifferent to him marvin lilligore objected the district attorney was drawing con clusions unwarranted by the witnesss answers he asked that his assump tion be stricken out and the court so ruled the district attorney bowed then he asked again was your husband indifferent to him my husband disliked him bianca answered why he thought that mr calvert was supplanting him in my affections that was how he put it in plain english he was jealous isnt that so yes you were unhappy with your hus band yes how long had you been unhappy with him biancas eyes dropped to her gloved hands again from the day i mar ried him she answered so low that the jury couldnt hear it and the court stenographer was asked to read it from his notes but you were about to go abroad with him yes the prisoner knew that yes what did he say about it i dont remember his words try he wished me to get out of going if possible either that or consent to his following us when did he ask that i dont remember was it more than once it was several times whenever we met wasnt the last time on the after noon prior to the murder for the first time since taking the witness stand biancas control of her vision eluded her her regard slipped like a bird between the wires of its cage and darted to a meeting that she had willed to deny it it met that of the man she loved and hovered there ca ressing and caressed calvert as perfectly composed as in what is isnt in his own office and the pink of smart ness flashed to her approval and en couragement it was as though he said be frank the truth can harm neither of us and bianca her regard still hover ing said yes in answer to the dis trict attorneys question but you saw each other after that yes when and where the following day between one and two at giros restaurant he didnt plead with you then to give up your trip no he seemed more resigned was that it he didnt seem resigned how did he seem nervous he appeared distressedmore dis tressed than everat the prospect of my going but he never once asked you not to no didnt that strike you as peculiar no we settled that definitely the day before you settled it definitely he knew the day before that there was no hope of your retracting yes youd never given him any hope on previous occasions had you no but that didnt stop him did it no the district attorney took a step nearer to the witness did he speak to you at luncheon about his call on your husband that morning yes what did he say about it he merely told me that he had gone there to deliver a letter of credit didnt he say how your husband received him was he cold was he polite was there a quarrel i remember him saying that mr holland seemed vexed what made him say that did he tell you how he exhibited his vexa tion he spoke of him flushing i think of his face being red that suggested apoplexy of course naturally did he say anything about him be ing likely to die of apoplexy he knew that mr hollands physi cian had cautioned him in that respect youre sure of that quite sure i told him myself and you remember of course that when your husbands body was first discovered it was supposed he had died of an apoplectic seizure yes well now mrs holland i want you to tell me candidly if you do not now regard it as a peculiar coincidence that your friend coming to you direct from your husbands office where in fact your husband was lying dead sup posedly of apoplexy at that moment and had been so lying before this friend could have left the office building should have spoken of his flushing of his being vexed of his face being red and for the first time since learning of your proposed going abroad not have put in a final plea for you to forego that european visit marvin lilligore was on his feet be fore the question was concluded dont answer mrs holland he cautioned and addressing the court i object your honor how the wit ness may or may not regard the testi mony is not admissible as evidence the objection was sustained just as the district attorney knew it would be yet he had notwithstanding managed by his question to get his desired inti mation before the jury later in cross examination marvin lilligore might strive to obliterate its effect but the reasoning was too sound he believed not to weigh against the accused chapter ix it is the practice of many of the more successful legal practitioners in direct examination as well as in crossexami what is isnt nation to spring without warning from one topic or feature of their case to another of distinctly contrasting inter est the district attorney had passed very lightly over the matter of bianca hollands relations with lee calvert he had apparently been satisfied with her responses to the effect that she had known him very well for two years and she had experienced no little relief at being let off so easily but almost on top of his failure to get upon the rec ord an opinion from her as to the sig nificance his point gathered from the incident at giros he took her at one bound back to that question of rela tions with a pretense of kindly considera tion he prefaced his query with a state ment as to her privilege if to answer would tend to degrade or incriminate her she was at liberty to refuse on that ground and then he shot his bolt were or were not your relations with the prisoner at the bar meretri cious bianca seemed to quiver and then wilt under the impact her lids drooped her hands gripped the arms of her chair she had been sitting up rather tense she slipped back until she rested against the woven cane net work behind her shame dyed her cheeks her counsel indignantly voiced his objection the district attorney com bated it and the court sustained him the question was repeated they were not bianca murmured merely platonic a sneer accom panied the words the witness was silent and this time judge mccready came to her res cue i think he said that the witness has already made it clear that she re gards the word meretricious at one pole and the term platonic at the other she will admit i believe a happy mean the district attorney bowed i am grateful to your honor he said i shall be glad to accept the witnesss definition of just what the re lations were but i may add that i purpose to prove there was more than a mere brotherly and sisterly affection existing he turned again to the witness do you admit that mrs holland he asked biancas yes was just audible the prisoner was in the habit of kissing you embracing you the audience strained to catch her answer we were and are very much in love with each other very clearly with perfect enuncia tion and telling emphasis in a voice of infinite refinement and melody yet with an unmistakable prideglorying in deed in the confessionshe spoke her eyes not on her interlocutor but on lee calvert on lee calverts eyes rather which met them directly in mutual caress the spirit of romance which has a place in the hearts of all men rose to her the courtroom palpitated with appreciation and threatened applause a buzz like the first ripple of wind stirring the leaves in a wood was de tected by the presiding genius on the bench and once more his gavel beat a warning tattoo on the block at his right hand owen wills watching the district attorneyhe was a large man of mid dle age and sandy complexionsaw his jaw set and two lines deepen between his eyebrows his witness had cun ningly circumvented him had turned his purpose to her own profit and the profit of the man she loved and be lieved in still her answer had not been wholly relevant it implied assent but it lacked explicit confession would the questioner demand a definite yes or no could he take that risk of antagonizing a jury now suddenly more than half disposed in her favor and so inclined to resent so much as a tinge of persecution wills was disposed to think he wouldnt and wills was right that is all mrs holland he said i thank you what is isnt her crossexamination by marvin lilligore served merely to make of her a heroinea beautiful woman sinned against by an unfeeling and unsympa etic husband yet rigidly holding her lf indeed if not in inclination to the letter of her marital covenant counsel for the defence too when his turn came did much to riddle the testimony of the states corroborating witnessesthe maid who admitted cal vert to the holland home on the after oon preceding the crime and who had watched and listened through a keyhole to that scene in the libraryboudoir and robert holland the dead lawyers van dykbearded brother he showed that the maid was in her masters pay that to make good she had sometimes invented visits from calvert that she depended on her memory rather than written notes for her re port of conversations and he showed also that aside from the finding of mrs holland and the accused lunching at giros on the day of the crime rob ert holland knew only what his brother had told him and that that almost en tirely was a repetition of information furnished by the fallible maid the district attorney however had not released bianca without a reserva tion he had foreseen pretty nearly just what had happened and in letting her go then when there was the danger which wills had divined it was with the idea in view of recalling her later to rebut lilligores deductions for however meagre the effect of his early efforts he had at least assured himself of the witnesss scrupulous veracity if the maid of the keyhole had told more or less of fact mrs holland must and should give it the proper balance by contributing the exact truth more over in order to gain the most telling effect he reserved this for his penulti mate effort it was the general opinion up to this time that the state had signally failed in making out a case and that should nothing more convincing be educed the defense would win hands down no jury would send a reputable gentleman to the electric chair simply because he had been alone in an office with a man who was found dead five minutes later and with no more impelling motive than his being in love with the mans wife and about to be separated from her calvert had heard with a confirming fillip to his confidence the district at torney announce that he would close his case with the recalling of one wit ness and the examination of one other and it was with no lessening of his as surance that he heard the clerk name bianca holland as the former she smiled at him as she again took her place on the stand her composure as compared with that of the first day visibly marked mrs holland the examiner began while she was still settling herself in the chair im sorry to trouble you again but there are some points in the testimony of the maid we had here which as they appear to be in dispute i wish you to set right for us i want you to think back to the afternoon prior to thethe decease of your husband and tell us in your own way as nearly as possible what was said and done dur ing calverts call on you after a moment bianca in a quiet tone briefly outlined in general terms that which was asked she began by saying that there had been an under standing between them that he should not call at her home but the occasion was unusual he had apologized and she had overlooked it as she had pre viously testified he asked her to find some way out of going at that point she was interrupted did he tell you he had been in pur gatory i think he did use that expression did he say that the thought of your going was driving him insane not that i remember try to remember he saidim not sure just how he used itbut that separation or the thought of separation was maddening i merely wished to get those points clear will you please go on what is isnt bianca continued there is little more to tell we had tea i said that elliot would be home soon as we were dining out that evening i promised to lunch with him the next day you recall nothing else nothing vital from the table by which he stood he took up some typewritten sheets a transcript of the maids testimony perhaps if i refresh your memory you will didnt you sayperhaps not in so many words but at least give the impressionthat you would never be entirely his until your husband was dead i said until i was free but you had your husbands death in mind and your lover knew you had isnt that so bianca hesitated she began to see now where he was leading her my husband had been warned of apoplexy he was fullblooded and answer my question please yes or no i may have dont you know you had didnt you say that you were sure to be free before long i dont remember using those words in other words then you both wanted the happiness that he stood in the way of you had no grounds on which to divorce him and you would not give him grounds to divorce you death was the only way wasnt it you are saying that not i im asking you you must answer and the answer is obvious was there any other possible way to free dom she knew that she was trapped and despairing said no of course not still i then death was the only way yes what was it your caller said about his conscience i dont recall well then what was it you said about yours i think i said to keep my conscience clear id rather he and my husband shouldnt meet exactly and what did the man who is now here on trial say in re ply im not certain what he said didnt he say that if he could in duce a fatal stroke of apoplexy in your lord and master it wouldnt bother his conscience any im sure he didnt say that but that was the meaning of what he said wasnt it he may have said that his con science was less sensitive than mine words to that effect yes can you interpret that in any way different from my interpretation im sure he didnt mean it as you put it that is most charitable of you the facts indicate that he meant even more than he said but on marvin lilligores appeal this comment was stricken from the record when the witness was turned over to him he declined to crossexamine and the state asked that james finnerty be called this final witness was it promptly appeared a detective connected with the district attorneys office a short thickset young irishman with blue eyes and bristling chestnut hair when he had been sworn the dis trict attorney produced from a pocket a small paperwrapped parcel and tearing off the wrapping passed to the witness the object thus revealed not until it was in the detectives hand did it become visible to the seeking eyes of the packed courtroom when it did a flutter of quickened interest swept the room from end to end it was a small iron and steel paperfile the counter part apparently of the one employed in the killing of elliot holland will you kindly examine that the witness turned it over a couple of times regarding it from all sides have you seen it before i have how do you know what is isnt i identify a letter f that i scratched on it when and where did you first see it in the banking house of gardener brothers wall and nassau streets on december th last in what part of the banking house in the storeroom in the basement were there others like it not exactly there were several patterns some were of brass had you ever seen one precisely like it i had where in your office sir the one that is now herethis one and the district attorney took up from the table the file found beneath the desk of the victim yes sir your honor said the prosecutor taking the file from the witness i offer this in evidence and ask that it be marked exhibit x the court nodded crossexamine mr lilligore compared the exhibits they were as like as two pins his face was serious here at the last moment was something really danger ous something it would be difficult to combat abruptly he turned to the witness december th was a sunday was it not it was yes sir how did you get into gardener thers storeroom on that day the janitor let me in why didnt you go on a weekday i wanted a chance to look round without interruption wasnt it that you wished to keep your visit a secret from the firm no you asked the janitor not to men tion your having been there didnt you i may have didnt you well yes we werent for giving our case away i thought so did you give him money orjust a cigar i slipped him a couple of smokes thats all three days later the case went to the jury following a forceful logical argument for conviction on the part of the district attorney in which he em phasized particularly the sheer impossi bility of the crime having been com mitted by other hands than those of the prisoner and he backed up his con tention with a clever and convincing linking together of the evidence bear ing on the impelling force of passion for the victims wife and the admitted madness purgatory and a con science palsied by amorous desire de nied unsatisfied the closing appeal of the defense was eloquent to a degree yet it had no more proven fundamental fact for its basis than a hitherto stainless char acterand that qualified by an admit ted fracture of the tenth command ment and a playing fast and loose with the seventh the perilous injustice of relying on evidence of a purely cir cumstantial nature was dwelt upon at length it was indeed lilligores sole reliance the charge of judge mccready was a model of impartiality he told the jury just what to consider and what to ignore and he cautioned them against accepting as true circumstances unsup ported by evidence sufficiently strong to appeal to their reason for twenty hours with each tick of the clock portentous the question hung balanced hope and fear seesawed in the hearts of lee calvert and bianca holland until it seemed to both of them that even the worst would be a relief the suspense itself became unbearable torture the rack and the thumbscrew appeared humane in comparison and then when torment could do no more a whisper came the judge had been summoned the jury had arrived at a decision bianca in the judges chambers sur rounded by friends saw the slight fig ure with the rubicund face and white what is isnt hair and beard enter hurriedly and thrust his arms into the flowing sleeves of his black silk gown of office then her eyes closed and she sat as in a coma scarcely breathing calvert back in the dock once more watched the twelve men with his fate in their keeping file solemnly through the door from the jury room and take their places the usual formalities began and ended he had risen at command and looked upon the jury he had been looked upon in turn the usual ques tions had been put and nowafter aeons it seemed to him the foremans mouth had opened for that last answer guilty of murder in the first de gree chapter x within a week judge mccready was in possession of sufficient facts provided by marvin lilligore to war rant him he believed in granting cal vert a new trial on the ground of fresh ly discovered evidence not hitherto available it developed then that the old judge was himself by no means satisfied with the justice of the verdict rendered he had really been most friendly to the accused from the be ginning and was personally of the opinion that there was no warrant for conviction so when lilligore offered to prove if given the chance that even more mysterious crimesthough less serioushad been committed in the holland delray amp dallas offices since the murder he took the view that such evidence would in all likelihood be all that was necessary to throw the balance to the side of acquittal there was no mention then of the suspicion attaching to arrowsmith owen wills working in secret with lilligore had been more than half con vinced from the first that this neerdo well brotherinlaw was the perpetrator of the crime he had divined it on that occasion of his interview with mr dallas when the latter had so obliging ly read to him the managing clerks affidavit and he had made notes of certain statements at the time inclu ding that concerning the visitors re turn for his umbrella and his absence until the office was in excitement over the discovery of the dead body but when the petition for a new trial was presented wills still lacked a full assurance of the mans guilt and for so much as a whisper of the pointing finger to get abroad might make hope less the certainty toward which he was still energetically laboring he had nevertheless lost no time in conveying to bianca holland his high hopes it was she indeed who had quickened his early suspicion and con tributed a valuable addition to the evi dence by her discovery in that mass of her husbands private correspondence of a threatening letter from arrow smith written within a fortnight of the murder and for his friend calverts consol ing he had sent him through lilligore a promise to free him before easter tell him he had said that im the architect of his deliverance ive built it up story by story now im going to put the roof on in spite of the efforts of the district attorneys office toward delay the new trial was squeezed into a rift in the calendar in midapril and much to the surprise of the holland delray amp dallas office about everyone em ployed there from firmmember to officeboy was subpoenaed by the de fence the prosecution relied almost wholly on its original evidence supple mented by its deductions and the mov ing oratory of its exponent coupled with his acknowledged gift for effective crossexamination indeed in order that expedition should characterize the proceedings it was mutually agreed by counsel that much of the testimony taken in the former action should be simply read into this from the record about the only exception on the part of the district attorney was in his re calling of bianca holland when she was previously on the standand she what is isnt was there twice it will be remembered he had let her go once because he feared to pursue his point lest he an tagonize the jury and again because to question her on the original point would be to lose an effect he had secured only after considerable effort in this proceeding however he called her directly following the reading of the maids testimony and his first ques tion had to do with that part of it which dealt with the embrace and the kiss do you wish to swear that the eye sight of the maid was at fault in this instance he asked i do not bianca answered those who are deeply in love are given to mu tual caresses you kissed passionately that is the word in evidence also that it was a long kiss you do not wish to qual ify those terms they are both comparative terms how passionately or how long is hardly of consequence is it i was asking you i measured neither the hour given is between five and fivethirty in the afternoon is that correct i believe so and you parted at about six yes you kissed him goodbye i did even though you knew he had mur der in his heart i knew nothing of the kind didnt you testify at the other trial that he had told you his conscience was not sensitive regarding the provocation of a fatal apoplectic seizure in your husband did i you did the record proves it then why ask me again because i want to connect it be use i want to show that feeling as he did your kisses were an added en gagement to the commission of a crime you had already discussed and less than nineteen hours after that im mediately following a call from this lover of yours your husband was found murdered wasnt he i believe so mr lilligore had no questions and the rather monotonous reading of the record continued it was not until this reading was fin ished that anything approaching a sur prise rewarded either the auditors or those more nearly interested that the defence was about to introduce testi mony so favorable to the prisoner as possibly to reverse the previous verdict was of course well understood and there had been more or less conjecture as to what this was but no one from the district attorney himself to the bluecoated cerberus at the door was prepared for such testimony appar ently it had no bearing whatever it was absolutely extraneous and before five questions had been put to manning holland delray amp dallass managing clerkwho was the first witness called the prosecutor was on his feet object ing on the ground of irrelevancy and immateriality the court however already advised as to the bearing was lenient and manning in answer to the lilligore in terrogations rehearsed succinctly all that he knew concerning the mysterious disappearances from the law offices of a certain document and a certain vol ume of law reports the occurrences mentioned by wills to arrowsmith on the afternoon of calverts conviction it seemed that barely a quarter of an hour had elapsed from the time of manning putting the document in the safe at his side until being desirous of looking at it again it was not to be found and he was most positive that no one had been near the safe in the meantime nor was the taking of the law book from mr delrays office the one formerly occupied by the late mr hollandless perplexing mr delray had stepped into the library leaving the book on his desk in less than five minutes returning it was gone a week later both the document and the book were returned by messen ger an effort had been made to trace what is isnt the sender but it was unsuccessful mr delray himself furnished the lat ter facts and they were corroborated by a dozen other witnesses each of whom swore to ignorance of how the disappearance had been effected with the purpose evidently of asso ciating these seemingly disconnected matters with the event of the murder each witness was questioned as to his or her presence in the office on the day of the greater crime and particularly as to the coming and going of mr stephen arrowsmith manning adhered closely to his testi mony as given in the former trial he was sure that arrowsmith had returned for his umbrella had secured it and had immediately gone out again from that moment he was absent the wit ness said until after the discovery of the body and the telephone operator and mail clerk supported him some of the others were not so sure after this lapse of time it was hardly possible they should remember this introduction of the name of ar rowsmith had the effect of transmuting a negative interest into a positive one the audience was quick to see in it the emergence of a hithero unmentioned suspect and when a little later the clerk of the court called three times the name leda arrowsmith leda arrow smith leda arrowsmith the entire room was on tiptoe there came presently through a side doorfor both she and the man whose name she bore by courtesy though sum moned had been kept in an anteroom until nowa tall blonde rather show ily yet poorly dressed woman of some beauty in spite of lines of dissipa tion having given her name and address she was asked are you stephen arrowsmiths wife im called that she answered and smiled shamelessly you mean youve never been mar ried to him thats the idea you get me youve lived together how many years five or six you know his financial condition pretty well then just as well as he does moneys been pretty tight of late eh youve said it you both need clothes dont you you only have to look at us to see that how long is it since steve had an umbrella so long i dont remember i know he hasnt had one since we took the room on twentysecond street and were on our second year there now thats all the district attorney asked two questions have you an umbrella no doesnt arrowsmith borrow one now and then i never knew him to when leda had been led back to the anteroom john dumphrey was called a lettercarrier at the rear of the room rose and came forward does your route include the offices of holland delray amp dallas was marvin lilligores first question after the oath had been administered it does yes sir tell the jury please what happened there on the morning of february sev enteenth last i called to deliver the mail as usual but as the mail clerk was not at his desk and there was a postagedue letter i took it to mr manning when he turned his back to get the six cents due i was standing by the open safe there was a bluebacked paper there and i slipped it out and put it under a stack of letters i had in my hand had you orders to do that i had from whom the assistant postmaster thats all on crossexamination the witness said that he was under the impression what is isnt it was a bit of fun he had been given explicit directions and had had to wait several days for just the right opportu nity if it would be any satisfaction for you to know itit was lilligore who spoke addressing his adversaryi ar ranged it or rather my office did he turned to the clerk call martin cleary please cleary was a young irishman a windowcleaner he said he had en employed in february by the su perintendent of the office building in which the holland delray amp dallas offices were on the morning of val etines day he was cleaning the win dows of those offices he was in the middle private office it was unoccu ped at the time it was nearly noon when he finished there he opened the connecting door to the first private of fice there had been a gentleman en gaged there when he began which was why he did the middleroom windows first when he opened the door he saw that the gentleman was gone there was a book on the desk by which he had been sitting the witness picked it up and stuck it beneath his jumper then he heard the noon hour strike so he went back to the middle office closed the connecting door took up his pail and brushes and other tools and went out through the library he gave the book to the superintendent who had ordered him to pick up anything handy that was likely to be missed like the lettercarrier he had understood it was just for a practical joke the audience now was being greatly entertained it was almost as amusing as a vaudeville performance and lilli gore with the soul of an impresario introduced a fourth sensational feature he called the leadinglady so to speak for the defence the state had depended on bianca holland to establish a motive on the part of the accused the defense would prove by her that stephen arrowsmith had even a stronger motive bianca an impressive contrast in her mourning with the garish mistress of her dead husbands profligate brother inlaw took from the hand of the prisoners counsel a proffered let ter have you ever seen that before he asked i have tell the jury where and when if you please i found it among my husbands correspondence about a month ago by whom is it written and signed by stephen arrowsmith who mar ried mr hollands youngest sister marvin lilligore reached for it again i ask to read it and offer it in evi dence the court bowed the letter dated a week prior to the murder ran dear e h i have just learned that you are going abroad for an indefinite stay sev eral times of late i have tried to get an in terview with you without success i must see you before you go and you must arrange to make me a substantial payment on account of my properties if you refuse me i will not be responsible for the consequences im a desperate man and my back is against the wall i would be justified in taking extreme measures you have been starving me for years now i must eat or well its your own risk dont try me too far to lilligores surprise the district attorney offered no objection the final witness for the defense was owen wills he took his place on the stand carrying a pigskin traveling bag which he placed beside the chair un like pandoras fabled box the one gift that emerged from this bag when it was opened was the gift of hope hope for calvert for its contents quite overthrew what had been in the first trial an apparently damning bit of evi dence against him the bag was practically filled with paperfiles each of the identical pattern used by hollands slayer and each tagged with a different name and ad dress from a hundred new york business houses and offices wills had personally collected them what is isnt chapter xi following the delivery of the ver dict at the former trial owen wills and the man who had sat at his left throughout the entire proceedings had left the criminal courts building to gether crossed the street and entered a saloon on the corner the afternoon was bitter cold it had begun to snow wills wore a minklined coat with an otter collar the lean sinewy middle aged man shivered in his tan overcoat with the threadbare edges in response to willss invitation he said rye whiskey and when the bottle was before him he poured out a full glass and with heres to you drank it undiluted at a single gulp wills drank the highball of scotch that was before him more leisurely he was facing the wide barwindow and noting the snow which had suddenly thickened so that the court building op posite was hidden by its white curtain said we should have brought our um brellas this morning his companion paused in the act of lighting a cigarette and glanced oyer his shoulder oh just a squall he said i hate umbrellas havent carried one in years im rather like a cat wills re joined hate to get a drop on me however it may not last this isnt a bad place to spend the time suppose we take that table over there have another rye when they were seated the lean man pouring his second drink said fore gone conclusion that verdict eh do you think so sure nobody else to do it but he apparently not buthave you heard of whats happened in those law offices since not another murder wills smiled well hardly only thefts petty thefts two of them what ice do they cut theyre more mysterious than the murder calvert was there to kill hol land but no one was there to steal a document from the office safe or to take a volume from the desk in the room where the killing was done how do you meanno one there there were clerks stenographers fel lows reading law werent there oh yes i suppose so but no one with a motive persons like that dont steal just for fun you know kleptomania nonsense it would have to have been an acute case and the odds against it are so great its untenable the other finished his second drink thats true enough he said i know in a way or did most of the people in those offices holland was a family connection of mine wills appeared surprised really he queried then your interest in the trial wasnt altogether impersonal no i was subpoenaed by the de fense though i dont know what for i didnt come in until after the deed was done never laid eyes on calvert till i saw him in court but i had to be there every day and they didnt call me after all a connection of hollands eh wills said his surprise still echoing then of course you hadnt much sympathy with the accused i had and i hadnt hows that elliot and i never got on i hated him but to kill a man because you want his wifethats going a little too far i should say it is i always under stood that holland was a very fine character wasnt he he was a scoundrel the speaker rapped on the table and when the bar tender looked at him he ordered a repe tition of their refreshment wills passing him his cigarette case said a scoundrel why you amaze me yes a damned scoundrel with all his money he persisted for his own selfish personal interest in keeping me what is isnt in something pretty close to penury i should never have thought that of him wills rejoined now that hes out of the way ill come into my own and it was the same sort of thing he worked on his wife yes and on that fellow calvert they were starving for each other but he was determined to keep her for him self i dont wonder calvert drove that steel point into his brain he was forced to it you might have been tempted to do it yourself eh might have been i was more than once i was his manner and tone were almost ferocious i dont see now how i kept from it your better nature i suppose probably or lack of nerve it takes nerve you know to sneak up on a man from behind and with a hard swift blow drive a steel point into his brain some nerve believe me i can readily understand that youve got to be close to insanity to do it ive been close to insanity for more than six months he drank his third brimming glass of whiskey neat would you like to hear about it i should indeed said wills if you dont mind his companion markedly reticent throughout the trial had become con trastingly loquacious under the stimu lus of his libations he didnt mind he told his story fluently with consid erable elaboration and not unpictur esquely wills meanwhile taking care to keep the narrators glass filled and garettes at his hand i married elliot hollands young est sister he began when i was twentyeight years old i was a clerk in a shipping office at the time with nothing but my salary to depend on and the family disapproved of me for that reason you know how those rich and fashionable families are but three years after we were made one her father died and she came in for some thing like a quarter of a million it seemed that with that quarter of a million the pair had a pretty lively time of it they went around the world they lived in paris for a year and in london for another then the wife was killed in a motorcar accident there were no children she had not made a will the bulk of her estate was invested in real property under the law the widower was en titled to the income from this for life but of course could not touch the prin cipal the personal property he soon squandered he had developed a pas sion for gambling especially for horseracing at thirtyeight there was nothing left but the income from the realty he had attached to himself a beautiful young woman of the half world to whom he could deny nothing she asked for to provide the required funds he postponed and postponed the payment of mortgage interests allowed taxes to accumulate the properties to run down for lack of needed repairs tenants refused to renew leases and new ten ants were not to be had when fore closure was threatened he went to el liot holland and elliot holland had agreed to advance what was necessary to pay the arrears of taxes and interest and to put the properties into proper repair in consideration of this though he was to be made trustee there was nothing for the poor brotherinlaw to do but accept but he wasnt in the least grateful holland was not doing it for him he knew that he was doing it for himself and the others to whom the realty would eventually re vert i cant altogether agree with you there wills interrupted he might have let the mortgages be foreclosed bought it all in at sheriffs sale and cut you out altogether that would have meant a bigger in vestment this way he paid less and accomplished practically the same re sult every dollar that came in he turned back into the properties en larged them remodeled them kept them always in superfine condition i got almost nothing sometimes less than what is isnt nothing and my hands were tied persuasion had no effect on him threats he laughed at he was a piece of stone hard as iron and cold as ice in the six months prior to hishis death i had less than four hundred dollars and i went through hell he paused to refresh himself and light another cigarette then were you ever in love he asked putting down his glass not very seriously then you wont be able to under stand try me wills suggested im mad over leda shes beyond words to describe shes been devotion itself but she wasnt made for pov erty she wilts under it shes put up with things hoping for a turn last fall she met a manan acquaintance of a friend of herswho admired her at sight she told me all about it hed do about everything in the world for her but marry her hes a mil lionaire twice over hed give her all she craved apartment clothes jew els automobile chauffeur everything can you imagine how i felt i saw her fading every day and could do nothing and i knew she had that of fer in her mind every minute he let it stand open i wanted her to be happy oh god how i wanted it id have broken into a bank and looted it for her if i could dont you see how i was tempted with that real estate out of hollands hands and with a trust company that wouldnt put every penny of income back into it id soon be getting fifty thousand a year do you wonder i was tempted no i dont wills answered the lean sinewy man leant nearer to him across the table i am tempted beyond my strength he whisperedalmost ten minutes later wills was driving him uptown in a taxicab he was drunk his story told he had gone to pieces suddenly after the final drink there are some dipsomaniacs like that shay he stammered as the vehicle turned into west twentysecond street where he and his lightolove lived in one big secondfloor front room you gotta come in an shee leda shes worth killin a man for thank you wills returned but youll have to excuse me this evening ill come some other day which re minds me who am i to ask for you havent given me your name arrowshmith stephen arrow shmith whash yoursh mine wills queried oh yes balderdash im sorry i havent a card he saw him out and watched as he climbed the high stoop leaving gaping footprints in the cushions of snow that covered the steps of course he had known from the first that it was stephen arrowsmith lilligore had subpoenaed him at willss request and wills had selected that seat beside him with precisely this end in view hate umbrellas havent carried one in years he quoted with a smile as the taxi sped eastward seeking fifth avenue beyond the curtain of feather like flakes thats the key that will open poor lees prison door for him chapter xii on leaving the stand after his testi mony in the second trial wills slipped out of the courtroom through the side door his work was finished he wished he might stay for lilligores summingup it would be quite differ ent he knew from that barren oratori cal effort which came at the end of the former trial this time it was he who had everything and the district attor ney nothing never had there been a more complete turning of the tables that double plant of the lettercar rier and the windowcleaner was some thing to be proud of and the young lawyer smiled with pleasure for it was he who had suggested it and arranged it lilligore had only to make vivid the application which the jury must al ready see for themselves what is isnt it is far from safe to pin ones faith to the obvious that would be lilligores text it was so obvious that a lettercarrier could have no use for a legal document which did not concern him that it never entered mannings mind to consider him nor was it less obvious that a windowcleaner was not a man to take away a volume of law reports and what could be more obvious than that a man who having started to leave an office returns for his umbrella goes out directly he has secured it you take it for granted youd wager your life on it youd be positive even that you saw him go in other words from certain given facts we take other facts for granted we say this is or that is but to learn later that what is very often isnt lee calvert apparently must have killed elliot holland there was seemingly no other conclusion no one else could possibly have got into that room and he had a motive for de siring his death even had arrow smiths motive been known he must be absolved because he was absent at the time no wonder that first jury con victed but now it was different a doubt at least had been raised and the finding of a file in the gardener broth ers storeroom identical with that found bloodstained beneath elliot hollands desk had lost all its significance seeing that such files were apparently scattered all over manhattan island yes owen wills had no doubt what ever now that lee calvert would be ac quitted the judge himself would re fuse to accept a verdict otherwise it would not be in keeping with the evi dence so in so far as freeing his friend went his work was finished but there was now a supplementary labor before him lee calvert must be absolved as well as acquitted the real culprit must be brought to book and the real culprit he felt sure was waiting here in the anteroom trepidantly atremble in all probability because of what leda his ledahad told him of her brief examination but when he opened the anteroom door it was to find the room empty in the corridor he came upon the offi cer who had had the witnesses in charge what have you done with them he asked nothing sir the woman testified and i understood the man wasnt to be called i heard mr lilligore say that you were his last witness they asked if they might go and i let them wills descended in the elevator to the ground floor and crossed the street to the saloon on the corner it was an even chance that hed find them in the back room but they were not he took a taxicab across town to the ninth avenue elevated and traveled northward alighting at twentythird street whence he walked two blocks to their lodgings they were not there for a long while he stood on the corner watching for their return while he waited a newsboy came by bawling an extra he bought the paper and saw in great headlines calvert acquitted it was between ten and eleven that same night when owen wills rang the doorbell of the holland home in east sixtyfirst street and handing a carte de visite to the maid who responded asked for mrs holland he waited in the small reception room to the left of the entrance hall in which lee cal vert had so restlessly paced on a cer tain october afternoon six months be fore waited to be eventually led up the same broad curving staircase and along the same softly carpeted corridor to the same door in the little room that was like a hol lowed opal bianca and lee were to gether their countenances seemed transfigured and owen caught in his heart a reflection of the radiance their joy overflowed their gratitude was too profound too poignant for words what is isnt they made him sit between them on the little white and lavender sofa bare ly large enough for three each clasp ing one of his hands no i havent been lost he made answer to their chorused question ive been completing my labor of love i thought you might care to know that you may now write finis to your tale of woe it required some waiting on my part but i was repaid arrow smith his leda and i had quite a ses sion this evening in their one room it was nearly eight when they returned and i had been sentineling the house since before five you dont mean that he confessed it was bianca who asked everything fully i convinced him that i knew i outlined just what had happened and he admitted or cor rected when he went back supposed ly for an umbrella which didnt exist he slipped into delrays office unlock ing the door and relocking it on the in side he found thenand he consid ered it great luckthat the key also fitted the connecting door to hollands room his evil idea was to strangle he has very strong hands but ques tioned his success in looking about for something that might serve his pur pose he opened the drawers of del rays deskonly two or three were lockedand at the back of one of them found that file he said there were two there i suppose the other is in the drawer yet having done what hed made up his mind to do he waited in delrays room until he heard the hue and cry raised and then slipped out into the library again not a soul saw him indeed he got as far as the out er office everybody was in the hol land room and with backs turned all he had to do was go in there too and ask what had happened hes been arrested calvert asked but of course he has owen wills shook his head no he answered he gave us the slip and he took leda with him i had a warrant in my pocket you know he went back of a screen in a corner of the room to get his hat or ledas wrap or something at least he said that but whatever it was he ap peared unable to find it and called for the woman so she joined him neither of them came out again what there was a window there this too from calvert no old chap not a window a gun he shot her and then himself before i could turn round dead both of them naturally he wouldnt leave leda for that millionaire the end the trouble with women is that the older they grow the more romantic they become and the more romantic they become the older they look virtue is womans ability to put out the small fires which she is continually starting east and west by lord dunsany it was dead of night and midwinter a frightful wind was bringing sleet from the east the long sere grasses were wailing two specks of light ap eared on the desolate plain a man in a hansom cab was driving alone in north china alone with the driver and the de jected horse the driver wore a good waterproof cape and of course an oiled silk hat but the man in the cab wore nothing but evening dress he did not have the glass door down because the horse fell so frequently the sleet had put his cigar out and it was too cold to sleep the two lamps flared in the wind by the uncertain light of a candle lamp that flickered inside the cab a manchu shepherd that saw the vehicle pass where he watched his sheep on the plain in fear of wolves for the first time saw evening dress and though he saw it dimly and what he saw was wet it was like a backward glance of a thousand years for as his civilization is so much older than ours they have presumably passed through all that kind of thing he watched it stoically not wonder ing at a new thing if indeed it be new to china meditated on it awhile in a manner strange to us and when he had added to his philosophy what little could be derived from the sight of this hansom cab returned to his contem plation of that nights chances of wolves and to such occasional thoughts as he drew at times for his comfort out of the legends of china that have been reserved for such uses and on such a night their comfort was greatly need ed he thought of the legend of a dragonlady more fair than the flowers are without an equal amongst daugh ters of men humanly lovely to look on although her sire was a dragon yet one who traced his descent from gods of the elder days and so it was that she went in all her ways divine like the earliest ones of her race who were bolder than the emperor she had come down one day out of her little land a grassy valley hidden amongst the mountains by the way of the mountain passes she came down and the rocks of the rugged pass rang like little bells about her as her bare feet went by like silver bells to please her and the sound was like the sound of the dromedaries of a prince when they come home at eveningtheir sil ver bells are ringing and the village folk are glad she had come down to pick the en chanted poppy that grew and grows to this dayif only men might find it in a field at the feet of the mountains if one should pick it happiness would come to all yellow men victory with out fighting good wages and ceaseless ease she came down all fair from the mountains and as the legend pleasant ly passed through his mind in the bit terest hour of the night which comes before dawn two lights appeared and another hansom went by the man in the second cab was dressed the same as the first he was wetter than the first for the sleet had fallen all night but evening dress is evening dress all the world over the driver wore the same oiled hat the same waterproof cape as the other and when the cab had passed the darkness swirled back where the two small lamps east and west had been and the slush poured into the wheeltracks and nothing remained but the speculations of the shepherd to tell that a hansom cab had been in that part of china presently even these ceased and he was back with the early legends again in contemplation of se rener things and the storm and the cold and the darkness made one last effort and shook the bones of that shepherd and rattled the teeth in the head that mused on the flowery fables and suddenly it was morning you saw the outlines of the sheep all of a sudden the shepherd counted them no wolf had come you could see them all quite clearly and in the pale light of the earliest morning the third hansom appeared with its lamps still burning looking ridiculous in the daylight they came out of the east with the sleet and were all going due westwards and the occupant of the third cab also wore evening dress calmly that manchu shepherd with out curiosity still less with wonder but as one who would see whatever life has to show him stood for four hours to see if another would come the sleet and the east wind continued and at the end of four hours another came the driver was urging it on as fast as he could as though he were trying to make the most of the daylight his cab bys cape was flapping wildly about him inside the cab a man in evening dress was being jolted up and down by the unevenness of the plain this was of course that famous race from pittsburg to piccadilly going round by the long way that started one night after dinner from mr flagdrops house and was won by mr kagg driv ing the honourable alfred fortescue whose father it will be remembered was hagar dermstein and became by let ters patent sir edgar fortescue and finally lord st george the manchu shepherd stood there till evening and when he saw that no more cabs would come turned home ward in search of food and the rice prepared for him was hot and good all the more after the bit ter coldness of that sleet and when he had consumed it he perused his ex perience turning over again in his mind each detail of the cabs he had seen and from that his thoughts slipped calmly to the glorious history of china going back to the indecorous times be fore calmness came and beyond those times to the happy days of the earth when the gods and dragons were here and china was young and lighting his opium pipe and casting his thoughts easily forward he looked to the time when the dragons shall come again and for a long while then his mind reposed itself in such a dignified calm that no thought stirred there at all from which when he was aroused he cast off his lethargy as a man emerges from the baths refreshed cleansed and contented and put away from his mus ings the things he had seen on the plain as being evil and of the nature of dreams or futile illusions the results of activity which troubleth calm and then he turned his mind toward the shape of god the one the ineffable who sits by the lotus lily whose shape is the shape of peace and divineth ac tivity and sent out his thanks to him that he had cast all bad customs west ward out of china as a woman throws household dirt out of her basket far out into neighbouring gardens from thankfulness he turned to calm again and out of calm to sleep twilight of love by l m hussey i he entered the library as a part of his routine a way to put behind him certain of the hours this afternoon it was very quiet and he chose one of the long tables that was deserted save for a young woman frowning over a book as if the typog raphy were extraordinarily poor he seated himself and fingered without opening two or three abandoned vol umes on the table meanwhile glancing about the room he recognized some of the habitues a short swarthy man with black eyes set a little slantwiseprobably a hindu was taking notes from a volume printed in some oriental tongue pome roy had seen him a score of times once he had looked idly over the fellows shoulder at the book he seemed to be translating it was printed in scrolllike characters sanscrit no doubt a very old man in a corner was read ing a romance another old man who came there every day read nothing at all but staring down at the floor seemed to have achieved almost a nir vana of emptiness pomeroy sighed it was depressing he formulated a half wish that he had gone back to his rooms however he could have done nothing there but sleep now he glanced sideways at the girl he observed that her brow was still furrowed her lips moved slowly like those of a child that can scarcely read dropping his eyes to her book he saw that it was printed in german evi dently she knew very little of the lan guage her presence gave him a mild curiosity now he scrutinized her more thor oughly her features were not bad but they had an indefinable touch of insufficiency something was wanting to make them attractive more definitely she was too pale and her brown hair luxuriant enough he thought needed a skilful touch here and there to bring out the charm of pleasant curves in all she gave him a vague impression of pathosthe pathetic air that arises from selfdepreciation disagreeable in a woman presently she turned a page he observed her perplexed frown deep en he wondered why she was endeav ouring to read a language obviously un familiar whilst he still regarded her speculat ing in his minds idleness she suddenly dropped the book gave it a little push away from her and uttered a low ex clamation of discontent then aware that someone was near she looked up met his eyes and flushed a little he smiled struck a snag he asked for a moment she hesitated as if conventionally weighing the propriety of answering him her eyes passed over his face in a swift appraisal evi dently the fact that he was not young reassured her of course i have she replied when i went to school i studied some french and some german but not enough to know anything about either just enough to tantalize me every now and then i get the idea that ill do some hard work on one or the other of these languagesi al ways fail she frowned naively her rather un usual purpose amused him why did she trouble herself with such concerns twilight of love she was young enough to have other thoughts in her head what were you trying to read to day he asked she tapped the open book oh some poems she said discon solately heines theres one here about a nightingale that someone told me was exceptionally good i cant make it out pomeroy reached for the book let me translate it for you he said he took up the book and read the verses he paused smiled at her and deliv ered the lines literally death is the cool night life is the sultry day now it grows dark i am drowsy the day has made me sad over my bed a tree looms up therein a young nightingale is singing she sings only of love i hear it even in dreams he lowered the book and she nodded at him with an expression of bitterness yes she said you do it easily i can never learn anything sometimes it seems to me that im about the most useless person in the world her frank discontent interested him stirred his curiosity moreover it pleased him to talk with her a young girl this was more agreeable than the dullness of his club or any of his books of which he was mostly tired or the stupid staring out of his window at home until he fell asleep she was pal pably a somewhat melancholy one find ing a lack in life and herself regarding her more critically he came to the opinion that she was not without charm her face needed a cer tain assurance and more the habit of smiles a smile might easily give a glamour to her features she was wait ing for him to speak he drew his chair a little nearer youve been frank he said let us suppose we really know each other betterconfidantes in a sense its pleasant to talk to yousomebody new somebody thats young that has all sorts of unknown possibilities ahead i dont discover much to interest me any more youre young youre at that excellent time when living is a sort of constant experience in unrealityso you understand i mean that your expectations are more intimate in fact more real than the things that actually happen she was resting her chin in her el bow looking intently into his face at his concluding words she surprised him by exhaling a sharp contemptuous sniff he met her eyes a moment ig nored her exclamation and continued imagine my position he said im nearly fifty years olda bad time of life when youve nothing that youre persuaded is important enough to do in a few years ill be an old man im certainly long past being a young one just now you find me hanging in the air so to speak neither young nor entirely old an extremely uncomfortable age he laughed a little but her face re mained grave dropping her elbow she began to speak uttering her words in her some what monotonous voice a voice lacking cadences its all right for you to talk to me if you want to she said but you cer tainly wont find me interesting i used to believe i could interest some bodyi never could i wish i were twice as old as i amid be your age you talk about expecting things i wish i could stop expecting her lips came together firmly pressed out into a harsh line he met her eyes for an instant they regarded each other with a steady gaze what is the matter he asked whats happened to you she tapped her fingers impatiently on the edge of the table dont tell me about not being able to discover any interest she said its not that i cant imagine interesting thingsyou cant have what would in terest you he began to question her and for a time she answered him with the same colour of bitterness in her sentences but little by little a part of this mood seemed to pass their talk became more twilight of love circumstantial she told him more about herself she lived with her mother one of those singular aloof women it seemed out of touch with the customary actu alities a christian scientist or some thing of the sort the two women had very little interest in each other for they were at opposite poles so the girl was left wholly to herself she spent her time as one will to whom the hours are periods that must be bridged in some waywithout en thusiasm in discontent not infrequent ly he thouught in emotions of despair certainly he had been right in his ini tial surmiseshe lacked assurance yet she was interesting glancing about him his eyes strayed to the dial of the large clock on the wall and it surprised him to discover that nearly two hours had passed a measure of genial comfort entered his consciousness it had been an agree able afternoon the girl was speaking now telling him something or other about her early home he listened perfunctorily more interested in the scrutiny of her face watching her moving lips her little halflistless gestures more composed now her face lost the greater part of its tenseness the lines were more gracile the curves were more young his appreciation of her youth in creased it was refreshing to sit near a young girl to receive some of her con fidences to find in a degree an easy intimacy with her it surprised him when he reflected upon the rarity of this experience he knew some women but not young women no girls she made him feel less old himself it was flattering to perceive that she acknowl edged his capacity to understand her to enter into sympathy with her to com prehend the subtleties of her thought she did not wrap herself in the cloak of reticence with which the young make themselves inscrutable to the old by her frankness she acknowledged his own inner youth she paused glanced up at the clock and rising suddenly told him she must go but well see each other again he suggested her eyes met his a moment and then she smiled it was the first fullcurved smile she had given him and in that second he discovered a swift and touch ing charm in her face opening her little handbag she took out a card she extended her hand with the card be tween her fingers and smiling his thanks he took it yes she said if you want to talk to me again you can come some even ing and see me im nearly always home theres theres nothing better to do her concluding sentence was voiced with a return of the old bitter touch for a moment she stood near the table with a somewhat awkward hesitancy neither spoke again rather abruptly she walked away his eyes followed her as she walked the length of the room he was in good spirits when he stood up and with a glance about him stepped toward the door himself his mind dwelt upon the girl as he made his way out of the building and took a taxi home ii he let a day or two pass but in the end he found himself impatient and he wrote to her it was with some hesitation that he did this for now he felt the gap of their ages it looked a little silly for him to call on her he tried to persuade him self that he went as an old friend might go in a fatherly way perhaps and to a degree this facile interpretation of his interest satisfied him inwardly how ever he knew his emotions were more complex he sat down at his desk and wrote her a short note addressed the envel ope scanned the namevirginia my linand found its sound agreeable then sealing the letter he walked to the window and looked out idly at the street he lived near the center of things twilight of love and there was always a crowd going back and forth beneath his windows the street was full of automobiles that struggled for precedence it was often his custom to stand here in a sort of sensual and intellectual numbness per mitting the minutes with which he had nothing better to do to pass un heeded today he felt more in touch with things more of the urge and sen sation of life the girl he thought had something to do with that it was good to know young friends she answered his note promptly two days later he set out to call on her when her reply came he had studied the handwriting with interest it had some character she set down her words in a nervous chirography a little difficult to read there was no school girlish roundness to her writing her script accentuated his sense of her com plexity her curious psychology he went over in his mind the details of their single surprising meeting and found her personality very shadowy for all her frankness she had by no means revealed herself at a suitable time in the evening he set out unusually eager interested and anxious for their renewed conversation but as he approached her street he found himself shrinking a little his customary aloofness asserted itself his habit of routine his cautious tendency to only the repetition of tried and in significant events once or twice he thought he would not go back there was a palpable lack of proportion in this callan almost old man a young girl but his admis sion that he was nearly old stayed his retreat he was old enough to aban don some conventions no one would misinterpret his actions she lived on an obscure street a faintly shabby street one of those thor oughfares that having passed their original importance seem to withdraw from the uses of other streets in a sort of spinsterlike and ineffectual disdain the houses were old their fronts stained their brown steps worn into hollows it was all very quiet he stopped in front of her house ascended to the outer landing and rang the bell following upon his ring there was some sort of a subdued confusion in side a moment later the girl herself came to the door for an instant his glance passed over her shoulder and he made out a pair of disappearing feet going up the stairs this was doubtless the mother the mother of unrealities now his eyes re turned to the girl she was holding the door open for him to enter her lips unexpectedly were smiling the smile disconcerted him a little he had imagined this moment of meet ing seeing it in terms of their initial encounter then she had not displayed the habit of smiles he followed her into the house they turned from the hall and entered the parlour he stood awkwardly near the door a moment until she pulled two chairs near each other and invited him to sit down their eyes met and she was still smiling her appearance surprised him she seemed not more young but more ardent less harsh less selfdeny ing her cheeks that he remembered as marked by an even pallor had touches of colour her frock was girl lish attractive the white throat emerged from it in a gracious column she began to speak about something some trivial comment and as he lis tened an astonishing understanding pre sented itself she had prepared elabo rately for his visit he saw her seated an hour or more before her mirror tinting her cheeks and lips arranging her hair trying the effect of her dresses for her he had come not in the fatherly role but as an opportunity a chance miraculously found as a young man might he began to smile he was touched and he moved his chair an inch or two nearer hers as a gesture of unspoken intimacy but more than anything else pome roy was flattered anticipating some twilight of love embarrassment in this meeting he had planned a demeanour and a trend of conversation that would accentuate his age and thus make them both at ease now he dismissed this purpose without hesitation he felt closer to the girl and grate ful to her in that she had perceived and accepted his fundamental youth frank ly rather than in terms of the exterior given him by the years his conscious ness of a barrier between them passed like an unpleasant season old tantaliz ing warmths caressed his spirit he was suddenly proud quietly elated and he believed that in spite of all his dis illusionments he might still be capable of ardour there came a moment of pause in their little conversation he leaned to ward the girl and spoke in a low voice the chances of life are curious he said how unexpectedly i met you and how luckily she answered do you realty feel that yes really i wanted to know somebody dreadfully i wasabso lutely lonely im sure that were going to know each other well he said ive felt very much alone myself in these times one needs some good friend an intimate dont put it in that way she inter rupted him it isnt that were going to know each other somehow i feel weve been so frank so quick to under stand each other that already theres an air of old acquaintanceship about us she paused they looked across the space between them their eyes met both were silent a certain necessity not fully appar ent stirred in these moments like an other atmosphere another air to breathe something in its effect more potent than speech to which speech was inadequate pomeroy found that he was strangely nervous even a little embarrassed he was uncertain and without confi dence his gaze wavered and his eyes dropped from hers passing to the smile on her lips apprehending the faint suggestive droop of her head the little pulsing rhythm of her breathing visible in a slight filling and contraction of her slender throat she seemed to wait to want to expect almost in fear he put out his hand and his fingers touched hers she did not push his hand away but urged him with a swift responding pressure his uncertainty passed his assurance was given life he drew her toward him his arms enclosed her and he kissed her a second later he was whispering his only halfbelieved fears dear he said youre so young you need a young lover ive come too late and you only imagine that you can care for me in a few years ill be an old manyoull have to forget me she did not answer but touched his face with languorous fingers and each caress astonished him with its given de light little by little he began to accept the miracle this recrudesence of old joys the new youth the fabulous rena scence of dreams his mild spirit found even a certain justification in it he had been too kind to women and they too clever for him he recalled in an in stant of recollection the undeserved pain that had come from his former wife close to this young girl in the charmed prison of her arms a mystical understanding seemed to reveal itself a law of life about to be fulfilled that assured him at last a compensation a weighing in the other side of the scales earned pleasure for pain presently their conversation was re newed and they began to confide the in timacies of their lives she was very discontented sometimes she was almost hopeless her mother the woman of strange faiths lived in another world and was in no sense a companion she suffered from being alone she had known moments of profound despair ill take you away from all this he said but her confessions made her a little melancholy and when he arose to go twilight of love when they kissed again she looked into his eyes gravely ive wanted a lover for a long time she said first i wanted a young lover and no one came i used to go outofdoors at night and walk and walk and then i hoped that id find an adventure but everything was common and i would come back home almost sick i feel safe with you you know some of the disappointments of life he kissed her again and waved to her as she stood at the door watching him go down the street but her final words had chilled him a little a part of her charm was spoiled for the mo ment there was some return to his first impressions of her when he had felt at once her insufficiency her almost old maidish pathos her confession had sullied a part of the glamour deprived him of some portion of his pride his role was not so much that of one who conquered miraculously in spite of the oppressive years but of one who was accepted with pathetic eagerness be cause there were no others presently however this cloud to his pleasure was dissipated by warmer recollections and the charm of the hours in prospect when he reached his rooms he was smiling before retiring he looked at himself earnestly in the glass measuring his face against his age the study seemed to satisfy him for he was still smiling as he turned out the light and stepped into bed iii the next morning he wrote his first love letter since the days of his youth this was a profound pleasure in the afternoon he went to his club and found the old fellows there strangely agree able since they seemed so inferior to himself they were old and their words and acts acknowledged the fact he had a secret they could never understand someone told him he was looking ex ceptionally well and asked for the ad dress of his doctor he laughed at the ass but said nothing that evening they went out together to dinner and once more he found her wholly charming the moment of doubt the pathetic moment with which the first evening had been clouded was gone and made no return when they entered the restaurant she slipped her hand through his arm and he was proud of their advance through the aisle of tables it seemed to him that many men must envy him especially those who were old in the full sense with their youth gone forever he was not old this was the initiation of some months of entire delight they did all that young lovers would do they walked arm in arm through the streets they motored out into the country and dined together in the obscure dining rooms of village inns they went to the theaters and afterwards visited the cabarets sometimes they remained at home and read stories out of the maga zines to each other he still strolled into his club from time to time but no one knew of his love affair it seemed impossible to confide this although his secret knowl edge of it never failed to establish his sense of superiority but to make the others know of his luckhe shrank from that on this point his feelings were complex he felt them for the first time on one of those occasions when he and virginia were having din ner together they had gone to a roof garden and during the progress of the dinner he was surprised to see one of the old fel lows of his club come in with another man a stranger suddenly he devel oped a desire to remain unobserved the girl across the table was smiling at him with affectionate glances he did not want this idiot to see her in a measure he was ashamed ashamed that the other might suspect his response to these languorous smiles his wish was attained the two men passed without observing him or the girl afterwards he accused himself of a certain baseness because of his unexpected shame twilight of love the memory of this incident passed for the glowing days overshadowed it they were very close to each other now and in his secret way he indulged all the minutse of love he wrote her nearly every day fill ing his letters with sentimental phrases that stirred him deeply as they flowed poetically from under his eager pen he brought her flowers and gifts he watched her moods by her side he in clined his head to catch her lowspoken words oblivious to any that might watch him she was always tender al ways sweet yet presently he thought he observed a change she seemed to pass from the languor of her customary moods to an almost inevitable and surprising ar dour as if some fresh flame burned in her heart this was manifested to him not so much in embraces of greater fervour in kisses that pressed more warmly on his lips as in the surprising new glow of her eyes the sudden enigmatic smiles the unexpected rapturous in takings of breathin ways that curi ously were almost divorced from his participation sometimes when he talked to her she scarcely seemed to hear watching her face he would see her eyes open wider looking past him as if at some thing precious beyond his forgotten nearness frequently he was surprised on coming to her home to find her al most cold she would take his hand press his fingers perfunctorily and without apparent response and then yield herself to his greeting embrace perhaps a moment later she would seem all fire that remote fire confus ing that began to bring him doubts he found too that they were not to gether so frequently for a long time he had seen her nearly every evening now she made excuses but often after an absence of several days she repaid him with hysterical embraces nevertheless his assurance was dim inished by disturbing uncertainties he no longer felt in a continuous un swerving stream that consciousness of superiority and pride something had interposed itself betwixt them an im palpable veil fogging his certainties one evening as he was preparing to call at her home his telephone rang on answering he found it was she ask ing to be excused pleading a headache deeply disappointed he consented and the hours before bedtime loomed up before him like impassable obstacles it had been three days since they were together he seated himself in a chair discon solate and stared down at the carpet slowly he reviewed the difficulties of the past few weeks no word of any change had passed between themand suddenly he felt that an understanding was necessary in a measure they had lost the habit of confidence accepting each other too easily they no longer had those inti mate talks that searched out inner mu tual secrets he felt that he must tell her of his fears of his perturbations she would see then she would confide and the days of old assurance like a returning tide would flow warmly back again as he resolved upon this his doubts cleared he felt easier and the simple confession seemed all that was neces sary but he was impatient to make it many times he got up and walked about the room strode to the window and stared down at the crowded street full of shadows and the hurry of dusk shapes it seemed impossible to wait for another day he determined to go now she would be glad in the end for his coming a few minutes later he was in the street as he neared her house his mood ex panded his heart beat faster and his pace was more hurried some of the old confident delight was in his blood again the romantic joy of playing the young lover he turned a corner he was on her street passing an arc lamp he glanced at his watch and found it later than he had supposedafter ten oclock per s sdec twilight of love haps she was in bed he slowed his step a little and to a certain extent be gan to regret his precipitancy but now he was near her home and after all it would harm nothing to stop and see if there were still lights in the house he was already looking up at the door when he saw it open he heard her voice she came outthere was a young man at her side they stood talking a moment and then the young fellow ran down the steps and hurried up the street from time to time he turned back and waved his hand in the shadow watching this pomeroy had the bitter remembrance of his own parody of this part his many goings from this house waving back at the figure on the doorstep he still stood on the pavement in a numbness of emotion the young man disappeared around the other corner the girl before going in looked idly across the street and then turning her head glanced in the direction of the old man a few yards distant for a few seconds she regarded him without recognition this passed she comprehended his identity her body straightened followed by a faint swaying that made her lean against the doorframe as if in support still numbed pomeroy approached her un questioningly with no search for a mo tive she made him an abrupt gesture of beckoning and ascending the steps he followed her into the house they en tered the parlour and here she turned and faced him i knew youd discover some time she said i hadnt the heart the courage to tell you he was without words he stared at her stupidly his mind was strange ly empty all agility of thought passed as if under the malignancy of a curse he felt tired he felt old dont blame me she said i thought i wanted you i wanted some body and you came i waited so long i was so hopeless you were gentle you were kindit seemed to me i could give up the things i had dreamed just to be sure of your kindness your af fection how could i tell i was about to find the young man she paused she waited for him to speak but still there were no words to say he began to feel oppressed as if in that familiar room there was an in sufficiency of air to satisfy the dry crav ing of his lungs he turned suddenly strode out into the hall and like one who escapes he ran down the steps and walked swiftly away he thought he heard her calling af ter him but ha did not turn at the sound of her voice he hurried his re treating steps a moment later the night air and the quiet brooding streets returned to him his lost mental processes immediately an immeasurable bitterness entered his mind he recalled the girl as he had first seen heralmost charmless ineffectual pathetic in her self depreciation then he had played this simple ironic part his task had been not to furnish love but assurance he had assured her swept away her doubts destroyed the memory of her old disappointments brought into being the possibility of her charmfor someone else his bitterness passed into anger his eyes reenacted the witnessed scene of partingthe young man the faithless girl as he thought of the other man his anger increased and a malevolent desire to destroy burnt savagely in his mind he was strong enough for this not too old for this he had been walking without pur pose without goal now glancing up he was surprised to see the street of his club already he could make out some idle shapes at the big windows in this instant of orientation he was at the summit of his rageand also the sum mit of his romantic efflorescence a second later the flame collapsedand he found himself stumbling up the steps of the club the doorman obsequiously pulled back the doors he walked in unstead ily a couple of old fellows nodded at him he sank into one of the cushioned twilight of love chairs and an immense enervation seemed to possess his body but little by little this weariness passed he began to experience a curi ous unexpected sense of ease that puz zled him slowly be glanced about the old men were stretched out like him in their chairs placid they were at ease too he began to understand after all this was the desiderate es tate they were all at ease together they shared the same placidity the calm of fulfillment the calm of forgotten hopes no one of them was under the necessity of dreaming any more they were at a truce with dreams they were all old men he sighed he no longer found him self in any superior instead he felt the slow suffusing warmth of fra ternity the alpine wanderers by florence wilkinson perhaps at beaded evening when all the lake towns shine from vevey to saint gingolph and in a twilight line by every alpine valley tinkle the homeward kine comes a remembered footfall that footfall will be mine you wake some crystal morning see monte rosa glow suddenly you remember

simplified matters two dreams dwell in her eyes by mary carolyn davies two dreams dwell in her eyes i cannot see them there but bow in humble wise my head in prayer two songs sing in her eyes i cannot hear them sing but ah i hold my breath with listening after all it scarcely pays to tell the truth people would much rather have you lie than hear you tell the same story twice a doctor is headed for success when his women patients begin to hate his wife on receiving a luncheon invitation by laura kent mason dear alfredo i am not going to have lunch eon with you on tuesday the reason is that i am dead not really dead of course i havent suddenly de parted this life and left behind an astral body to scrawl this on my best paper on tuesday instead of lunching with you i shall probably be at bernice evans calmly eating my way through a womans luncheon and adding my bit to the usual talk of husbands high prices and housekeeping the part of me that you think you like is deadthough it died before you met me so of course the part of me that would have wanted to be with you is dead too i am writing this alfredo because i am old and being old and a woman and quite average i am a fool and it pleases me to be frank this one time and to journey into sentimentality of course you will say that i am not oldor i hope you willand it is dear of you you wont understand just here at first what i mean by being dead when you have finished per haps of course i like you alfredo you know that so that is not the reason i am refusing now and for always to have luncheon or tea or dinner with youor to see you at all except in a crowd and then i shall be quite unin teresting and impersonal i have always liked youweve known each other such a little while your type i mean i dont know whether we found each other at the rayolds party because you like the type of woman i used to bebefore i went outor because your type makes love to all women every man i have ever been in love with or interested in except my husbandhas been your type and too men of your type boys i should say since it is a type that remains forever youthfulare the only ones i have ever attracted so at the rayolds party when after fifteen minutes we were well be yond the first stages of getting ac quainted and i could see the weeks stretch out our weeks it came to me that i was deadhad been for a long time the night i met you and the next day i thought of you i knew you would write or phone me i knew youd be at the parkinson dinner and that id have tea with you the next day and the nextand then a note it was a dear little note alfredo but theres no use going on there was a faint thrill alfredo when you took my hand a stirring of a thousand memories but the dead do not waken easily and too it is more peaceful pleasant being dead i shall miss the live things of course colour brilliancy emotions but we who are dead cannot choose for contentment for the absence of sensation of ecstasy and pain we must pay and truth fully i prefer being the way i am if we saw the thing through i know what would happen you know too unless you are very young first there would be hours of pleasure in seeing one another the bringing of on receiving a luncheon invitation little remembered loved things for the other to knowsensations books mu sic the turning inside out of the show places of our minds and heartsand the glow of being together but for me being dead these things would be but faint echoings of other affairs material things take up more than their share do you know ive grey hairs alfredo whenever my hair was being dressed preparatory to see ing you id have to remember them so you wouldnt know and massages ugh but lines around the mouth of the one whom you want to kissthat would never do for one as young as you and freshnessdo you know how important and how difficult that is i wonderalways being crisp and dainty always carrying around the halo of an unsullied fragility it isnt easy when one is my age and with out that you see it is the work of being loved that i cannot face it is much too diffi cult always being clever and happy always ready to make your moods mine to respond to your emotions and yet to be alluring and shining i cant go through it again we would go on i know pleasantly enough i would be very fond of you too fond perhaps thats another thingeven now im emotional and i cant afford to be sleepless nights i must rest you knowand days of thinking of you and letting you intrude upon my stupidly comfortable routine wed grow fond of one another and youd expect me to be always ready to go to the theater with you to explore some odd part of town some little quaint restaurant i know each of them would mean the spending of time and energy pleasant oh yes but ive done them all i havent a thrill left ive seen so many unique restau rantsive walked down so many pleasant lanes then one of us would get tired perhaps it would be youand i might forget and worry you with notes and telephone calls and trying to keep you to myselfand youd see the grey hairs and the lines and notice where my shoulders were too fatthink of the humiliation of being thrown aside even nicely by you or if i quit caring even the amount i was able to careand i could be quite fond of you for a little while youd be the oneand you might threaten something un pleasant and worry me and id wonder if i had spoiled your futureand id remember a time when i did spoil a future years ago and that would worry me all over again so you see it would be fun to know you better alfredo i love your playing i think youve something really good in your wishing cycle and your weather suite is dear but play ing i can see you your long white fingers on the keyboardof course you have nice hands alfredo youd play things to me things others have played and little improvisations too youd even compose a piece for me i know if i proved very nicewith a little odd name to itand youd play it in pub lic when i was there and send me a glance that no one else would under stand but thats the trouble alfredo the flamecoloured sunrise in my living room that too was painted for me and the bas relief over the mantel ive known other slim white fingers youd feel sorry for me because i was unhappily married and id let you sympathize with me and lead you on to believe that my husband was a dull stupid sort a mere worm linked for life to me who am so fragile sensitive youd say how i hate your husband and youd call me by the name youd have made up for me by that time how i hate him thinking about him when i am not here with you he seems soso brutal masculine and id drop my eyes and let you think that you were right about him it isnt the truth of course i am most comfortably happily married but that frederick is a won derful man he is a great reader though id never have let you guess it on receiving a luncheon invitation and reads a great number of things i cant understand sometimes he tells me about some of them and i pretend ive read them when im out fred erick is sensitive far more than i am and he has other qualities of whose very meaning im only half aware honesty a great decency and kindness a squareness and patience i could never possess the joy of being able to live with frederick of being part of the glowing domesticity that he has created makes livingfor the part of me that is still alivequite worth while as for the romance that you feel frederick has missedisnt his busi ness quite as romantic as the selfish pursuit of a single art the development of a personal talent frederick is a mere business man and yet all alone without any encouragement or symp athy from mei was quite too busy being alive to bother about himfred erick has seen and developed until he is the head of a complete organization a miniature city he pulls the ropes of fifty lives giving sympathy and help and encouragement oh yes im quite the middleclass wife awed at her hus bands business

me you see you had thought of me as some thing quite different hadnt you i used to be i too have had dreams and a gypsy heart now alfredo that part of me is dead i cannot have luncheon with you on tuesday my dreams by paul tanaquil my dreams are the flickering shadows that dead leaves cast over the face of tombs when the wind blows they shall know by harold cook i shall tell them this morning the policeman at fortysecond and the avenue who lifts a heavy hand like god lest men kill each other i shall tell him and all the porters in the grand central station and they will have a new interest in me those men no longer will the policeman stay me but the thousand others from crossing the avenue nor will the porters see only three bags and a box and hopes of a quarter when i tell them that last night by the black water by the dark blue water under a tree that bent over us as trees bend over lovers in the meadows of heaven your hands learned my face and your mouth my mouth and afire with a new knowledge our eyes shone through the darkness like four stars ah they will notice me those men and touch their caps and say good morning and i will answer them as a man should who has been touched with ecstasy but i shall not tell the little blonde waitress who served me my breakfast for i think she wise maiden has already suspected the dawn by john c cavendish i it was during the ceremony of her sisters wedding that little ruth had for the first time those curious de sires the wedding had interested her of course it was the culmination of an enlivening courtship for two years ruth had enjoyed herself hugely she was not quite thirteen when howard first began to call at their home it was she who had first caught them making love thereafter she planned and exe cuted unnumbered charming ambus cades for them the garden was never safe neither was the house she was as slim as a spear of grass she could walk as softly as a cat the smallest tree was adequate to her concealment stand ing straight pressed against the warm bark she used to wait with gleeful patience presently their voices would be heard in the garden their footsteps their laughter on the occasions of her best luck they would sit down very near in the grass close and intimate peeping around the tree waiting for the opti mum instant shed leap from her am bush just at that second when their lips closed in a kiss a shrill laugh a taunt or two a catcalland little ruth would run bounding across the lawn like a mischievous goat or else a favourite thing was to wrap herself in the folds of the draw ingroom curtains how many a time they had missed her there passed right by her brushed against her taut small body to enter the room in seeming iso lation on these occasions she liked to make ghost noises small rappings little clickings with her teeth a faraway ambiguous whistle suddenly realiz ing that they were observed edith would spring up from the sofa rush to the curtains and shake her out of them you little fiend she would cry ruth always mocked her with her boisterous laughter yet for several months before their marriage she had somehow felt quieter she no longer enjoyed plaguing the pair although her interest in them was in no degree diminished a vague ap prehension of seriousness came into her mind something in this love affair troubled her it was the sort of feel ing one might have during the slow gathering of a storm she found herself immensely inter ested in the accumulating trousseau she liked to finger the silken under garments the lacy camisoles tie and untie pink and blue ribbons stand near the bed gazing down upon pretty frocks spread out for friends she herself consented to hemstitch half a dozen sheer handkerchiefs with embroideries in the corners the work gave her solemn uncomprehended emotions then it was decided that her own dress to wear at the wedding could have a really long skirt that would make her a woman she urged an other point and it was granted she could wear her hair up any way she wanted to dress it and it will never be down again she thought no more tails the wedding was very quiet they held it in their own home some rela the dawn tives were there a few friends and the lohengrin march was played on the piano as edith and howard came into the drawingroom they stood in front of the minister both of them tremendously serious someone tit tered nervously from a corner across the room and the sound seemed to add something to the moments curious solemnity ruth in her dress with the long skirt with her abundant gold hair up and coiled in braids about her head watched with widening eyes the minister began to speak her mind did not record all the words but she knew they were very portentous and then at last the pair turned to ward each other edith was strangely pale save for sudden little gusts of colour that came and went in her cheeks like the leaping of flame and howard took her hand and they kissed before all in the room a moment later everyone was on his or her feet they crowded about the bride they kissed her they shook hands with the bridegroom but ruth remained seated and a strange new thrill tingled in her senses in some way that final kiss had awakened her from all the many she had seen these two exchange it touched her senses to response it put dreams chasing through her mind suddenly vicariously she knew some of the pleasure of that kiss herself and understood the wanting of ca resses someone touched her on the shoul der it was one of her aunts whats the matter ruth she asked why are you so solemn ruth stood up hastily she blushed she was ashamed lest everyone could read her thoughts she looked about nervously shifted the weight of her slim body from foot to foot and awk wardly clasped and unclasped her fingers in front of her in some way she had lost her assur ance and a tremulous something of which she was half afraid had entered into her world ii they had gone now edith and howard and she was alone in the house with her father and mother the silent rooms seemed oppressively quiet and strange ruth avoided her mother inasmuch as now for the first time in her life she was experiencing emotions that could not be confided she knew her mother would not under stand her mother would laugh and that would hurt she liked best to go out into the gar den where she could sit for hours star ing up into the bluish green shadows of the trees watching the clouds pass like white and pink birds across the space of the sky listening to the suggestive murmur of the unseen wind stirring the grass and leaves there were no more scrambling ascents of trees no more searches for woodchuck holes with the dog no more wild rolling down the slope of the little hill behind the woods she was very quiet very subdued for the first time in her life it came to her that this was a beautiful place the garden the little woods the old house its beauty made her melan choly and touched her imagination she tried to conjure up the faces and acts of people who had been here be fore she was born before she ever drew a breath she wondered if some other girl like herself had lived here and wanted the things she dreamed of presently her father noticed her ab straction and in the evening when she came indoors at the sound of the dinner gong her eyes cast down her lips silent he would make fun of her look at our ruth hed exclaim to her mother since you let her put her hair up shes grown too old for any of us sometimes ruth blushed she felt very silly but inwardly she was angry these people did not understand they were miles away from her the spring passed into the first days of summer one morning ruth was wandering through the garden with the disconsolate dog when looking over the the dawn top of a separating hedge she per ceived that their neighbours boy had come home on vacation from his first term at preparatory school he was standing out on the lawn of the next house and she was astonished to ob serve that he looked entirely like a man the change was so pronounced that she did not recognize him at first now he wore long trousers his hair did not spring up wildly all over his head as it used to it was combed back straight and clipped very short above his col lar he gripped a little curved pipe between his teeth and now and then a gust of smoke swirled about his face and dissolved in sunshine this was an astonishing transforma tion and ruth stared earnestly across the hedge a moment later he turned and saw her they looked at each other for several seconds without smil ing without any gesture of recogni tion he was the first to gain aplomb he nodded his head and began to walk toward the hedge she did not move but she felt her cheeks warm with swift blushes she knew she would not be able to talk with him for her tongue seemed incredibly dumb she wanted to run away how impossible that was when he was still some feet distant he spoke hello ruth he exclaimed im awfully glad to see you she answered him her greeting was mechanical she noticed now that his voice had changed also he came up to the green barrier smiling just got back last night he said glad tooalthough lawrenceville is a very decent place whatve you been doing with yourself nothing walter she answered everything looks just the same around here he went on slow as ever nothing doing no life but ive had plenty of that this year and i guess a little rest wont hurt me he laughed and the sound of his laughter implied fabulous experiences he returned his pipe to his mouth and puffed languidly for several seconds he even appeared a little bored gazing at his face ruth was in a torment she wanted to say something something that would interest him something in keeping with his experi ence it came to her instantly that he must have met dozens of girls in the past year how did they talk to him but nothing save a stupidity passed her lips did you like it away from home she asked ohpretty fair pretty fair he answered speaking through halfclosed teeth from which the stem of his pipe dangled with an almost personal non chalance better than sticking around here of course he looked back across the lawn theres the old man he said wants me to drive him into town this morning will you be home all day this afternoon we want to have a talk for old times sake if youre around when i get back ill come over he nodded easily and stepped briskly away she watched him go until afraid that he would turn back and see her she dropped her eyes and walked slowly through the thick grass for the first time she noticed how rapidly her heart was beating then he was coming over to see her in the afternoon she was afraid she did not know how to talk to him he had seen so much how stupid he would find her iii she had nothing to say at lunch be cause of her inward excitement she wanted to get up from the table sup pose he would come looking for her while she was still indoors yet when she was free she remained indoors she was frightened running up to her room she changed her frock she had a fullsize dress ingtable of her own nowthe one that edith used to have sitting before the dawn this she arranged her gold hair it came to her then how often she had watched her sister doing this expectant of howards coming her slim fingers dropped from the coils of her hair fell on the edge of the table lay there flexed as she looked musingly into the glass what a new world had unfold ed itself to her in the old days she used to tease edith at her toilet that was ages ago then she was a child wore little dresses that ended just below her knees and let her hair fly wildly over her shoulders or wound it into a long tail that flopped against her back as she walked her mood became a little melancholy she almost regretted the old days the days when she was still a child it was hard to be grown up this feeling passed into one of pride her cheeks flushed a little her blood ran a little faster a sense of the allure of the days to come entered her mind like a fragrance like a wine she raised her hands again and began patting in the angles of her hair in the glass she met her own eyes and smiled in pleasure at her reflected image at last she was ready but now her fear had returned she stood up went to the door hesitated came back she wanted to go she lacked the courage what would they talk about what would she say it seemed impossible for her to talk to him her imagina tion conceived him as an almost fabu lous being mysterious inscrutable in vain she tried to reassure herself that she had known him for years raced with him through the woods climbed trees faster than she could climb them caught field mice that he could never catch now he was a stranger another being finally she forced herself to go out doors and was greatly relieved to dis cover that the garden was empty she sat down on an old bench under a tree half an hour passed her mind was almost without thoughts in a nirvana of formless but delightful dreams someone called her she looked up he was there he was dressed in a light suit cut very tight with slanting pockets and a jaunty belt to the coat he wore no hat and his hair was combed back met iculously and shone with high lights in the sun his appearance pleased and frightened her he was so tremen dously assured she was so timid sorry i didnt get back sooner he said the old boy is a slow old per son wont let me let her out at all wait till i take you out ruth ill show you some real driving he sat down beside her crossed his legs and lighting a cigarette began to tell her about his experiences at prep school his escapades astonished her she said nothing at all listened nodded her head tried to cover her nervousness with an easy smile this attentiveness pleased him and he expanded became still more at ease and talked without pause he began to speak about the sports at school i didnt get on the team this year but ill make it this coming term her admiration escaped her lips in a naive assuring oh i know you will i think so he remarked com placently of course i know it a second later she regretted her fer vor he met her eyes saw her admir ing glances and with a smile he put out his hand to touch her his fingers touched her arm and a curious flush tingled along her skin she wanted to jump up and run away but she was powerless to move he took her hand little ruth he said caressingly the warmth of his tone terrified her she arose suddenly whats the matter he asked ohi honestly i must go in its late i must go in youll excuse me youll come again she broke off abruptly and turning walked away almost at a run whilst he remained seated staring after her in surprise the dawn as she reached the gravel path that led up to the house she glanced back and saw him standing now looking after her this glimpse of him gave her a sudden profound depression what would he think of her how absurd how stupid she had acted she ran into the house and the tears trembled in her eyes threatening the corners with big drops in the hall she met her mother with an envelope in her hand ruth was glad that it was a little dark she did not want her mother to see her face this is a letter from edith said her mother she wants us both to come in tomorrow to stay with her a few days ruth was silent i cant go now her mother went on maybe youd like to go alone i guess edith is a little lonesome how ard is away for a week the proposal came to ruth as an unexpected avenue of escape it seemed to her now that it would be impossible to stay here meet walter again with the shame of her flight so recent oh yes she cried yes mother let me go myself iv she left early the next morning riding into the city on the same train with her father at the station he put her into a taxi in which she drove to ediths apartment edith met her kissed her warmly and then they made a tour of the little apartment together everything was very pretty and ruth felt a sentimental glow in the understanding of her sis ters happiness she was immensely pleased with the reception edith gave her edith treat ed her as if she were a very important guest there was no reference to the days when she had been so foolish they were like two women together her aplomb returned quickly she became grave womanly at ease in the afternoon they went shopping and before their return stopped in at a tea room where they had small cakes and several cups of tea this was an insinuating place quiet remote full of murmured conversation ruth watched young men and young women come in together sit at the little tables talk with their heads close she felt a part of this life accustomed to it her nature seemed to expand and her experience was augmented when they arrived home edith de veloped a headache and decided to go to bed soon after dinner im sorry dear she said why dont you take a bit of a walk that seemed an excellent notion and presently as it grew dusk she went out alone near the apartment house a young man passed her who reminded her sud denly of walter it surprised her then to realize that she had completely forgotten him his memory now brought only a faint flush of her yesterdays discomfort perhaps she had been stupid and afraid but it did not matter the clamor of the city was in her ears singing there like a promise it announced the theme of limitless opportunity by some means she had grown more assured ruth paused at the corner and stood there watching the crowds her eye examined all the girls who passed scru tinizing them with critical judgment the aloofness of those moments gave her a sense of superiority above all her emotions she was ex cited expectant the potentiality of some vague enchantment to disclose itself presently stirred in her blood in a day in an hour she had changed from the city she had acquired something of the citys audacity a man passed glanced at her she met his eyes he turned back and smiled in quick response scarcely un derstanding the significance of her act she returned his smile he approached her and took off his hat good evening he said she answered something without at tending her words for now her heart the dawn was beating faster her assurance had gone her fears had returned her eyes dropped yet not before they had recorded the details of his face he was not a schoolboy like walter he was a man he spoke to her again her lips de nied her will to answer what is the matter he asked youre not afraid of me are you lit tle girl i didnt want to frighten you you smiled i thought you wanted me to talk to you something in the sudden tenderness of his voice shamed and angered her how quickly he had penetrated her se cret he saw how young she was how little she knew at first in the dusk she had deceived him but only until he had come closer and spoken to her she resented his changed attitude and found his sudden consideration hate ful her cheeks flushed she raised her eyes and met his own fearlessly no i dont want to know you she said what right have you to speak to me please let me alone he looked a little surprised an in stant later he smiled and gave her a slight bow i beg your pardon he said be careful when you smile the next time replacing his hat he turned and walked away she stared after him until his figure was obscured in the dark lost in the crowd her mind reviewed the encounter and little by little her anger passed into a sense of satisfaction it seemed to her that a very significant experience had been added to her necessary knowledge for a moment at least she had fooled him for an instant she had been able to play the part of a woman a few more words a slight increase of her assuranceand she could have talked to him easily she looked about her with confidence the next time she knew she would succeed ruth turned slowly and walked back the way she had come her thoughts were not definite they were vague as mists but their nature was wholly pleasant when she reached the apartment house she was smiling in the elevator she bent toward the mirrors at the side of the cage patted her hair read justed a hairpin took out her powder puff and powdered her nose shameless ly some of the mysteries of life those mysteries that aroused her fears were passing but the allure was im mensely more potent v two days later ruth went back to her home she met her father in the evening and returned with him at the door her mother kissed her as if hers had been an absence of years this display of emotion made ruth smile a little with the indulgence of one who has acquired a philosophy of toleration how little her mother understood how blind she was for her ruth was still a child still the object of protection it did not matter perhaps her mother would never understand the change there was a pleasant dinner during which ruth talked more than ordina rily telling everything about edith her home her habits the excitements of the city once or twice she was surprised by a certain intent look with which her mother met her eyes it puzzled her a little but she went on relating the in cidents of her trip after dinner her father retired to some work in his study but her mother remained for some moments they were silent ruth grew a little embarrassed at last she stood up looked about her with a counterfeited languor and prepared to escape then her mother arose came around the table and with a sur prising impulse circled the girl in her arms she said nothing at all she only embraced her hugged her close and kissed her young smooth cheek con cealed in this act there was some emo tion too subtle for expression and in a measure ruth sensed it in the touch the dawn of her mothers arms there were com mingled a pathos of remembrance of hope of fear of resignation it was almost a silent caress of parting when words are not said lest they loose the hysteria of tears it acknowledged a barrier yet established a sympathy then ruth knew that her mother un derstood a moment later her mother left the room and almost unconsciously she wandered out into the garden only a faint light remained flushing in the western sky the lingering ghost of the departed day it was the hour of hush the crickets were not yet singing a few feet in the air close to the lower branches of a tree a school of gnats danced their last figure before the night she had been there only a few mo ments when she heard quick footsteps in the grass without turning she knew that walter had seen her and was coming an intuitive certainty told her that he had been watching waiting for her appearance his nearness gave her none of her old fears no former trepidation an immeasurable experience seemed to lie between that last encounter and the sec ond of this hour she was even indif ferent she comprehended walterhe was no mystery a schoolboy it was almost childish to talk to him hello he said im awfully glad youve come back terribly slow around here in the dusk she smiled wanly in scrutably he looked at her face and something in her expression this new mysterious pose puzzled him shook his assurance his easy words died on his lips he stood in front of her awk wardly holding his hat in his hands let us take a little walk she said she moved off across the lawn and sheeplike he followed at her side in a moment her languor passed yet a cer tain melancholy persisted there was no mystery in himbut there was ex citement the excitement of tormenting him of fooling him of stirring the emo tions of his wanting this was her role and now she under stood it at last her heart had the knowl edge of her power and her cunning now she was a woman the lake by frances o j gaither the west wind blew again last night and swept the water hyacinths in now yellow sands go blue bedight like some embroidered mandarin a melancholy man is one who has remembered more than he has forgotten the power of love by winthrop parkhurst he often read in the newspapers of men who exacted obedience from their wives with stinging whips from his boyhood up indeed he had heard sodden stories of wife beatings without end and from all such tales of vulgar violence his aris tocratic temperament revolted as from an illmixed drink so when he married he resolved to conduct his home entirely on the principles of love in his own house at any rate he decided there should never be one harsh word one angry look to mar the placid perfection of his married life his plan worked remarkably well the devotion of his wife was ex traordinary when a disagreement seemed imminent he steadfastly re fused to raise his hand and such is the power of love that his wife thereupon immediately agreed to do anything in the world that he wished later on he gave her the cheque my life is glad by harry kemp my life is glad because of you you give me things as sweet as dew soft as the falling of a flower that breaks into a silken shower your raining kisses cover me and break in petals over me a mans ambition is a happy marriage a womans a romantic one répétition générale by george jean nathan and h l mencken on pedagogyin nearly all of the modern literature of pedagogy there is a false assumption and that is the as sumption that the aim of education is to fill the mind with knowledge the fact is that its aim is almost exactly the contrary that is to say a man who has been competently educated is not one who has been crammed with the orthodox knowledge of his time and country but one who has been emptied of the orthodox knowledge of his time and country ie of the common stock of superstitions prejudices manias phobias and delusions the human mind even in its lowest forms is never actually hollow on the contrary it teems and seethes with ideas and most of them are held as immovable certain ties it is the purpose of anything properly describable as a liberal edu cation to break down these certainties shoulder them out of the mind and so make headroom for the small body of current ideas that are actually true this body is never large the process of enlightenment consists largely of ex amining and rejecting them a man of sound education is one who holds all his ideas a bit gingerly and is always ready to dismiss them such an education is not easily pro curable at the average university that is because the great majority of the men who teach in such universities are themselves not educated they are sim ply schoolmastered the result is that instead of purging the students mind of its inherited and acquired bilge they devote themselves to forcing more bilge into it in the most favourable cases this fills the cranial cavity with a dense mass of heterogeneous debris almost colloidal in its gumminess and unworkableness in not a few cases it causes actual explosions and we have say a college socialist the cocktail and the womanthe effect of cocktailsor any other alco holic beverageupon women is curi ously unlike the effect of such tonics upon men take for example the re lation of the effect of alcoholic in dulgence to amour a man and a wo man mutually intrigued are seated at table the man drinks a cocktail then another then another then another with each successive tipple he becomes more and more excited over the charms of his fair companion more and more eloquent more and more eager to im print a smack behind her little pink seashell of an ear as one cocktail follows its predecessor down his ali mentary canal he waxes amorous crescendo fortissimo but consider now the woman after her first cocktail she is in a mood precisely like the mood of the man after his first cocktail after the second she is in a mood precisely like the man after his second but comes now the curious change though his third cocktail increases the mans ardour her third cocktail almost in stantaneously decreases the womans as if struck by a ghostly streak of lightning as if touched by some occult hand the womans mood suddenly achieves a certain restraint a peculiar rigidity a trace of coolness the mans s sdec repetition generale third cocktail has sent his acumen packing the womans third has brought her acumen back with a rush she is lit true enoughas lit as the manbut she is yet by some esoteric phenomenon again master of him and of the situation all of which is respectfully sub mitted to such teetotaler moralists as believe that when a woman has had three cocktails she is completely in the villains power and ripe for the italianos pathological notethe exact na ture of disease is a matter that still gives pause to mm the pathologists all that may be said with certainty is that a given condition is an apparent departure from the normal or that it tends to destroy the organism and pro duce death as for mere abnormality it would be rather absurd to assume that it is to be regarded ipso facto as regrettable the perfectly normal human being the absolutely average man is surely anything but an ideal creature a great many admittedly abnormal men even in the direction of what is called disease are his obvious superiors and this class includes many socalled men of genius as for the fact that disease tends to produce death this is a matter of small signifi cance life itself tends to produce death living is a sort of gradual dying all that distinguishes what is known as a healthy man from what is known as a diseased man is that the latter prom ises to die soonerand even this prob ability is not always borne out by the event men afflicted with diseases re garded as fatal often live so long that their physicians begin to regard them as personal enemies and poison them to get them out of the way the fact is that certain diseased states are very favourable to the higher functioning of the organismmore fa vourable indeed than states of health one of the diseases that american sailors were saved from during the late war by the virtuous watchfulness of the hon josephus daniels is of such curious effect upon the mental powers that under certain conditions it would be much more sensible to call it a bene fit than to call it a handicap true enough ninetynine out of a hundred victims who show signs of its mental effect move toward insanity but the hundredth moves toward genius beet hoven nietzsche and schopenhauer were such victims if the word may be used of giants the mild toxemia ac companying the disease kept them keyed up to stupendous effort all three died of it in the end but while they lived it acted upon them like some extraordinarily powerful stimulant and there is not the slightest doubt that their great achievements were at least partly due to it in this case of course ideas of loath someness reinforce mere fear and so most sane men would rather do with out the stimulation than face the dis ease but there are other maladies not popularly regarded as loathsome which also seem to prick up the intellect one of them is tuberculosis it is perfectly possible that the superior mental de velopment of the white races may be due to the fact that they have suffered from tuberculosis for many centuries history shows a vast number of ex traordinary consumptives and it is common observation that even the stupidest man once he is attacked by the tubercle bacilli begins to exhibit unusual mental alertness perhaps the time will come when promising young men instead of being protected from such diseases at all hazards will be deliberately infected with them just as soils are now inoculated with nitrogen liberating bacteria this plan of course will tend to diminish the length of their days but that will be no objection to it for its aim will not be to improve the candi dates quantitatively but to improve them qualitatively the science of hygiene which is largely in the hands of gushers and quacks lays too much stress upon mere longevity and when repetition generale it gets beyond longevity it seeks only the good of common men to produce better stockbrokers congressmen knights of pythias sons of the revo lution dollarayear patriots corner grocerymen labour leaders and other such cocci it is necessary of course to keep them physically well if they are valuable at all it is chiefly as physi cal machines they serve to reverse and complete the great nitrogenfixing process of vegetable life but if it were possible to produce a chopin with a few doses of tubercle bacilli even at the cost of killing him at thirtynine it would surely be worth while and if a technique is ever worked out for producing a beethoven or even making measurably more likely the produc tion of a beethoven with any other pathogenic organisms then certainly only idiots will complain if they kill him at fiftyseven on young

birthcontrollers is grounded upon the doctrine that it is an intoler able outrage for a woman to have to submit to motherhood when her private fancies may rather incline to automo biling shopping or going to the movies for this curse the husband is blamed the whole crime is laid to his swinish selfishness with the highest respect pish my private suspicion support ed by long observation copious prayer and the most laborious cogitation is that no woman delights in motherhood so vastly as this woman who theo retically abhors it she experiences in fact a double delight on the one hand there is the caressing of her vanitya thing enjoyed by every wo man when she achieves the banality of viable offspring and on the other hand there is the fine chance it gives her to play the martyra chance that every woman seeks as diligently as a man seeks ease i am convinced in deed that all these socalled unwilling mothers wallow in their martyrdom that they revel in the opportunity to be pitied made

great the sacrifices a man makes for his womenfolk they always regard him as a selfish fellow and cherish the theory that it would be easily possible to im prove him this is because the essen tial interests of man and woman are eternally antithetical a man may yield over and over again but in the long run he must occasionally look out for himselfand it is these occasions that his womenfolk remember the typical domestic situation shows a woman try ing to induce a man to do something that he doesnt want to do or to re frain from something that he does want to do this is true in his bachelor days when his mother or his sister is his antagonist it is preeminently true just before his marriage when the girl who has marked him down is hard at the colossal job of overcoming his re luctance and after marriage it is so true that there is hardly need to state it one of the things every man dis covers to his disquiet is that his wife after the first playacting is over re gards him essentially as his mother used to regard himthat is as a self worshipper who needs to be policed and an idiot who needs to be protected the notion that women admire their menfolks is pure moonshine the most they ever achieve in that direction is to pity them when a woman genuinely loves a man it is a sign that she regards him much as a healthy man regards a onearmed and epileptic soldier the

oscar wilde set repetition generale down his abstract conclusions some years ago in the london saturday review but platitude though it is it still remains for some professor to offer up the concrete proofs at least one such proof occurs to me and this proof is to be found unless i am great ly mistaken in the way life has imi tated the drama in the matter of wo mans confession of sin fifteen years ago when a woman confessed the stain on her past to a man she imitated the maneuvers of the leading woman char acter in the then already long popular henry arthur james drama there were sniffles a la rachel neve tears a la mrs dane tremulous allusions to innocence taken off guard to betrayed trust to moonlight chopin and other such sentimental knockout drops id been brought up in a vil lage i was a child in knowledge i knew nothing of life nothing of the world he was very kind to me he was rich and distinguished and flattered me by his notice and ioh why didnt somebody warn me why did they keep me ignorant i didnt even love him not in that waynot as i love you i tell you i knew nothing nothing nothing till it was too late etc etc but today when a woman confesses an indiscretion of her past to a man does she follow the henry arthur jones model she does not she fol lows the manchester school modelas typified for example by some such dramatist as the late stanley houghton no longer

hence life in this particular department sees fit to change its latest imitation and proceeds drolly to mimic instead the panto mime america as infantin practically all discussions of american history ideals and character the notion that americans constitute the youngest of great peoples is employed as a rubber stamp the phrase in fact turns up incessantly the average editorial writer would be hamstrung if he were deprived of it what lies behind it is the plain fact that the american re public compared to certain other exist ing governments is relatively young but the american republic is surely not identical with the american people they might overturn it tomorrow and set up a monarchy and still remain the same american people the truth is that as a people they go back fully three hundred years and that even their government is older than those of most other nations e g france ger many england italy moreover it is absurd to say that there is anything properly describable as youthfulness in the american stock americans in the overwhelming main are not young but old they are either wornout individuals detached from other nations or the descendants of such wornout individuals and they show all the signs of senescence what appears to be youth in them is rather second childhood one of the main in dications of that second childhood is their singular timorousness they do not embrace ideas eagerly like such young peoples as the slavs they dis trust all ideas instinctively and have to be brought to accept them by an elabor ate process of suggestion most of what passes for thinking in america is done abroad and chiefly in england if the english once ceased telling americans what to think about every thing from politics to literature and from social amenity to

acutely understands women that makes his plays so un usually interesting but the fact that he acutely understands his fellow mans understanding of women in this dif ference lies at once the secret of the humour and the secret of the pathos of the very talented doctors writings on musicof all forms of the up lift perhaps the most futile is that which addresses itself to educating the proletariat in music the theory be hind it is that a taste for music is an elevating passion and that if the great masses of the plain people could be in noculated with it they would cease to herd into the movingpicture theaters or to listen to socialists or to beat their wives and children the defect in this theory lies in the fact that such a taste granting it to be elevating simply can not be implanted either it is born in a man or it is not born in him if it is then he will get gratification for it at whatever costhe will hear music if hell freezes over but if it isnt then no amount of education will ever change himhe will remain stone deaf until the last sad scene on the gallows no child who has this congenital taste ever has to be urged or tempted or taught to love music it takes to tone inevitably and irresistibly nothing can restrain it what is more it always tries to make music for the delight in sounds is invariably accompanied by a great desire to produce them i have never encountered an exception to this rule all genuine musiclovers try to make music they may do it badly and even absurdly but nevertheless they do it any man who pretends to a delight in the toneart and yet has never learned the scale of c major any and every such man is a fraud the operahouses of the world are crowded with such liars you will even find hundreds of them in the con certhalls though here the suffering they have to undergo to keep up their pretense is almost too much for them to bear many of them true enough de ceive themselves they are honest in the sense that they credit their own buncombe but it is buncombe none the less music of course has room for philanthropy the cost of giving an orchestral concert is so great that ordinary musiclovers could not often pay for it here the way is open for rich backers most of whom have no more ear for music than so many chinamen nearly all the opera of the world is so supported a few rich and socially ambitious cads pay the bills their wives posture obscenely in the boxes and the genuine musiclovers up stairs and down enjoy the more or less harmonious flow of sound but this business doesnt make musiclovers it merely gives pleasure to musiclovers who already exist in twentyfive years i am sure the metropolitan opera company hasnt converted a single musichater on the contrary it has probably disgusted and alienated many thousands of fainthearted quasi musiclovers ie persons with no more than the most nebulous taste for musicso nebulous that one or two evenings of tremendous gargling by fat tenors is enough to kill it altogether in the united states the number of genuine musiclovers is probably very low there are whole states eg alabama arkansas and idaho in which it would be difficult to muster a

fortune to meet coincidentally another wooman of equal charm and equal ap peal since it is a matter of not in frequent occurrence for a man to fall love with another woman after he has engaged himself to the one woman with whom he has believed himself singly in love is it not perfectly reason able to assume that had he initially met both women simultaneously he would have been taken with each of them equally the bachelor is a monument to wo mens charm unlike the married man he offers up constant proof of the charm of several women as opposed in the bigoted instance of the former agnostic to

protect the man who is superior only in law against the man who is superior in fact if it is demo cratic it seeks to protect the man who is inferior against both superiors the aim of all government is to regiment men to make them as much alike as possible to combat originality among them all it can see in origi nality is potential change and hence an invasion of its prerogatives the most dangerous man to any government is the sort of man who is able to think things out for himself without regard to the prevailing superstitions and taboos almost inevitably he comes to the conclusion that the government he lives under i imperfect and so he tries to change it nine times out of ten of course he is wrong that is to say the kind of government he thus unlawfully inclines to is probably just as bad as the kind he proposes to supplant this explains why revolution seldom accomplishes anything of genuine value after a revolution to be sure the revolutionists always try to con vince doubters

of pain it is rare to find a male scandalmonger perhaps the reason is that men always talk about themselves the negligible ones by mifflin crane her elation gave her a fluctuant charm enlivened the somewhat sagging lines of her face lent her eyes a sudden moist depth and filled her lips with colour he was surprised to find her almost pretty and the murmur of her yes was sweetly voiced they kissed and her response to his lips had in it the fervour of a long wanting his arms gave her visions the understanding and the recreation of a thousand romantic moments read in books the triumphant hours of heroines returned to her mindtheir words their response she was one of them now she understood their joys often she had reasoned upon her need and almost convinced of its never tobeattained felicity had endeavoured to persuade herself that her desire was futile and unworthy the years pass ing with her hopes had brought to her this ascetic renunciation again and again seeing men on the street she tried to despise them in the cars she met their eyes with malevolent stares at business she shamed their superior pretenses with her efficiency but some book a poem a painting a sentimental moving picture or worse the sight of oblivious lovers in the park or walking arm in arm outdoors would tear down all her defences and destroy the acid of her selfprotective asceti cism with a sweet heady poison bringing her to the collapse of secret tears now like the others like the victo rious ones she had a man he had come to her miraculouslya new clerk in the office not a good one at first she had despised him with an unusual venom but as if her happy fortune were the purpose of a benign fate whose tool he was he took her harshness with a smile he greeted her each morning with a polite and even deferential nod and at last he came to see her that had been a momentous night she remembered her perturbations her flutterings before the mirror her al most desperate endeavour to touch her features into grace to fluff her scant hair to an appearance of abundance to hide the angularity of her figure with a deceptive frock now assured hearing his words of marvelous affection the hours of first tremulous fears seemed almost silly a sense of strength of power of hidden charm had been given to her and the early hesitancies were obliterated by these triumphant moments she looked at him almost coquettishly became wholly unafraid his face was serious he was talking of their future i expect something better from the old man pretty soon he said maybe youve noticed that he gives me a good bit of attention lately i think well be in shape to get married before many months she smiled tenderly youre sure you want me she asked he answered with a kiss tell me again what you feel she demanded he repeated his declarations she caused him to embroider the theme say the words again and again modulated in coloratura but ever of the same im port her ears could never tire of this her sense of wonder seemed boundless she even accepted his declaration the negligible ones that she was beautiful hearing it with a serious mind why not how of ten with a despairing effort at comfort as one who yields to a last hope how ever fabulous had she repeated to her self the doctrine that beauty is only skin deep the lover at last would see beneath her trivial imperfections and find within all the allure all the tenderness even all the beauty to thrill and content him he was before her now the one for whom she had hoped gazing at her with these clairvoyant eyes of her faith and perceiving the truth that he uttered she was beauti ful yes it was true as he talked returning again to the discussion of his plans she watched his face she knew that he was not hand some there were many lacks in his features his nose needed more defini tion less of that melted look the col our of his hair was indeterminate and its texture too coarse his eyes were somewhat small his lips too heavy his chin needed strength but these defi ciencies gave no chill to her enthusiasm she had a secret strength for their sur mounting he had stopped talking now and they were looking at each other with tender glances what did it matter that he was not wholly the man she could have wanted he was not heroic he was not conquering he was not handsome it was all of no moment he supplied through nature the one fundamental necessity he was above all a man and to him a man any man she could give these other things her ro mantic imagination long suppressed sufficed to invest him with all the vir tues reality had withheld in her mind by her imagination she would see him as he ought to have been in her eyes she would vision his pulchritude his nobility his strength his heroism and in a vague way looking at her un lovely face he understood this it was her compensating gift for if she was not the woman of his best desire she was at least the one who ministered best to his pride compre hending dimly his own weakness his own triviality he saw that no other woman save one like her could look at him as she did give him this warming glance of pride offer him this expres sion of unearned homage and so he was not without content they both had gifts for each other these negligible ones harpsichord by winthrop parkhurst like hands that stray across the yellowed keys of an old spinet whereon only dance the phantom fingers of my memories or ivory ghostly feet of dead romance your beauty brushed my spirit and the keys trembled to find that at a single glance from your grave eyes they sang as though a breeze had blown from heaven and struck a chord by chance lost love by morris dallett i i saw suzannes wide eye before she caught sight of me and by the time she had recognized in a black suit and yellow hatwhich drew at tention away from greying hairthe ambling playwright of three years he fore i had marked her drooping mouth and the rouge on her lips i had noted too the slant to her hat and the pretty brown ringlets of hair beneath in truth i had remarked the fact that suzanne was almost exactly the same girl who had left the musical comedy stage some time before to marry a young friend of mine and i was sur prised that she had not changed i never had understood the affair she was a very fast girla bad girl as i had known herand he was actu ally prudish to see them one could have understood an affair but surely not marriage so i was glad when suzanne recog nized me and waved a prettily gloved hand from across the sidewalk hello she called i sauntered over to her and stam mered a little breathlessly how are you hungry she answered and slipped her hand through my arm take me to luncheon i willingly hurried her into the near est cafe the headwaiter who had known me in my earlier days seeing whom i was with led us to a nicely secluded table he looked surprised am i as old as all that i mur mured changing my hat check from a trouser into a vest pocket i come here several times a week and he recognized me she smiled back and began taking off her gloves i looked at her again the gloves were long and bright red matching in colour a belt around her waist and a cluster of cherries on the little hat the dress itself was black knitted like a sweater the heels of her shoes were red like the gloves and her lips that i had noticed before i was trying to find out the condi tion of her hands when she turned to me suddenly and said you look so well i know you havent been writing lately i smiled all over admitting the fact while ordering luncheon sorry i cant buy you anything de cent to drink i said do you want something to drink world without end amen she called a waiter to her side and talked to him he seemed to under stand and hurried off i have a little gin left she went on turning back to me and they are going to put it into a lemonade for us i stumbled through a prayer of thanks and asked the obvious question with my eyes oh then you havent been hear ing about me no i have been away ive been divorced from curtis for three months really yes almost four months now ah you arent very surprised i expected something of the sort why lost love i knew youand him and ive lived several years of glorious life but you dont know the reason no her eyes almost closed and she bit her lip no i saw that the subject was not open for discussion just yet so i bided my time and thanked godwho was cer tainly the wrong personfor the extra gin i had expected that the meat course would result in a story but it was not until the waiter was pouring russian dressing over hearts of lettuce that suzanne remarked i have the baby oh i answered vaguely wonder ing why i hadnt instinctively known that there had been a baby i am going to tell you the story becausei dont know why to tell you the truth i suppose it is because you are the sort of person one usually does tell stories to i leaned over the table in anticipa tion look at your cuff it was in the salad you knew curtis she went on i answered that i did well then it will be more inter esting to you she stopped for a moment and seemed to be thinking i am going back to the time i met him but before that i want to tell you that i am inherently good bad ness is a cultivated attraction with me i accepted suzannes statement with some reservation and she knew it you dont know i did know a good deal three years before we had played around together and i had gleaned her history from her own lips but her past was not the main part of her life the present was the play and the past was merely the incidental music lending atmosphere she had been born in lancaster pennsylvania and had gone to school there for nine years up to the age of sixteen when she became a waitress in a restaurant she had been a good girl a backward shy slip of a thing with no manners or anything else of evident importance to the world but from in cidental diners who took her on auto mobile rides and said things she learned that she was of importance most of her friends already knew that one of the momentary travelers was a man connected with the theatrical profession and he promised suzanne that when he reached new york he would find her a position in a chorus she had listened to other promises be fore so when a letter arrived from a prominent producerof whom she later saw a great dealshe was sur prised of course it was the chance of her life she took it her friends who would become local shopgirls envied her andfor such is the way of womensaid very nasty things be hind her back but that didnt feaze suzanne her career was startedand in new york holy of holies a chorus girl who wanted to keep alive devoted most of her energies in those days of a few years ago to en terprise offstage living cost a lot and to get a really substantial meal from an ordinary afterthetheatre party was something which required more than ordinary sagacity but suzanne was apt and she learned to do it to do it well her reputaion how ever rose in indirect proporion to her success the memories of broad country meadows and dew on wet grass often troubled her and at such times she felt that a breath of fresh air was impera tive it was absolutely necessary to get away from square city blocks and high hats and waldorf lunches to ask a young friend to motor her out wouldnt bring the desired freedom it only meant dinner in a roadhouse sandwiched in between thick slices of unsavory bread in the guise of auto mobiling so suzanne had taken to dressing in simple sincere little frocks each sun day and after escaping the city by train wandering out and through the countryside she loved dusty roads lost love and houses of woodnot to live in but to look at for two or three hours a week i had heard several versions of the story that she left new york over weekends but this i knew to be the true explanation suzanne repeated the statement that she was inherently good but you know i had to live and i had to learn how i did it pretty well i suppose it was because i was partly french and being bad with me was not as is usual in america merely being vulgar but you understand all thatin fact i think you told me to go ahead it was on one of my much talkedabout walks in the country that i met curtis i was walking along a country road on one side of me was a field with a springhouse and a little beyond it a stream on the other side was a farm yard filled with sheep i was watching the stream and wondering whether or not i could still swim when i nearly stumbled over a man who was sitting down taking sand out of his shoe it was curtis i went right on after ex cusing myself and didnt think any more about him a little further down the road i went over to the stream took off my shoes and dabbled my feet in the water the place was nearly a hundred yards off the road and the pool was screened by a grove of young maple trees i had been there only a few minutes when curtis appeared he was terri bly fussed but i knew what to do and what to say so in ten minutes we were talking easily he didnt know who i was and i didnt tell him i was out in the coun ty and i wanted to fit in to go away from myself so we talked along for some time and i left him about five oclock to go back into town he had told me that he lived in the country to be alone and i realized that my dream would come true if i could get away well i did get away and i left him thinking that he had been talking to an angel it was a kindness on my part you would understand that he had appealed to me almost more than anyone i had ever known somehow and then too he hadnt fallen in love with me most men didor thought they didand said so but i went back to the city i still remembered the boy on the road and once i looked for him but he wasnt there that day it must have been three months later that i met him at the stage door and went off with him in a taxi how did you find me i asked i just happened in town and went to the theater isnt it nice but you didnt know who you were talking to before did you i should say i didnt he was as shy as a kid and i saw that he was impressed instead of dis illusioned it rather spoiled my dream though where are you taking me now i asked him to eat and drink i thought that you didnt approve of that sort of thing i drink some he was no more sophisticated or at ease with me than a schoolboy i saw my game and began playing it you see he had come into the spiders web and it was his own fault but what will people say when they see you with me i asked i dont know do you know what a reputation i have no i am supposedly the worst girl in that company are you oh i know how to kiss i an swered and laughed we dined and drank champagne the wine went straight to his head as i had done and in the taxi going back he kissed me suzanne stopped talking while the waiter poured her another cup of cof lost love fee i lighted a cigarette and remarked encouragingly yes as you can imagine she went on the result was that he fell in love with my wickedness and i with his good ness he liked the things about me that another man in love would have hated he revelled in stories i told him he wanted me to dress indecently and paint my lips red can you under stand it yes i assented as you say he was in love with your badness i leaned back and thought for a mo ment the story pleased me like a good wine my writers instincts were blooming under it please go on i said ii the day after that evening for in stance she continued he came and apologized for having given me the kiss but seeing that i didnt mind he wanted to talk about it he wanted me to tell him what other men did i never understood that either but anyway i grew to care for him i didnt show it because we were seldom alone and on big parties i had to act up to my reputation but i did begin to care he loved me in a way i had never been loved before he was younger than most of the men i knew and he was nice he had money and it seemed that his family was traveling in the west so he was absolutely free lucky child but listen one evening we were going to my apartment in a taxi cur tis always came as far as the door with me this time he proposed marriage my first thought was that he was drunk but i soon saw that to the contrary he was rather sober and very serious so i told him to come up to talk it over as soon as we got to the living room i took him by the lapels of his coat and looked him in the eyes now look here curtis i said youre a young kid and i like you be cause you are what you are but youve got to learn why do you know that a girl could sue you for breach of promise after a thing like that you want to be careful what you say i meant it he said i want to marry you you dont want to marry me i do i know what i want i want to marry you we argued for some time at last i said i cant break my contract i dont want to make you break it you want me to stay in that part yes why not oh why not he asked again i dont love you curtis all that i want is for you to keep on acting the way you have been suzanne smiled to herself and i laughed much too loudlywhich i real ized and looked around to see if any one had noticed so you married him yes i married him i often wondered how it happened we were married in a little country church i insisted on that though curtis much preferred a big affair in the city our honeymoon lasted over the weekend on monday he came down to the station to see me off he was coming into town later goodbye dearie for a little time he was a little proud of this assimi lated loveword dont forget tonight no i wont dont you forget to telephone no goodbye goodbye we kissed and as the train took me away i had time to collect my thoughts in the first place i realized that our wild honeymoonwe had been half drunk most of the timehad bound him even closer to me you know it was such a fool marriage it wasnt a real marriage at all in spite of the license and the minister i had an idea that things might as well break up just where they were but the prospect of the jewelry and all lost love that curtis was giving me kept me to him mercenary i know but i was living on my own and when i played a big game like this one i had to toss for high stakes well that night curtis came into town and we went on the same old kind of a wild party that we had been used to i flirted with most and drank with the rest the only difference was that it was more exciting for the other men because i was married and more bor ing for me because i knew where the evening would end curtis was a new man though he was a much different person from the one i had picked up on that memorable day in the country he was sophisti cated now and talked wines women and war as though he had been at such parties ever since his fingers were large enough to handle a wine glass but he was still as lightheaded as ever one cocktail to him was worth three in any one else i didnt know that i cared for him the way i did until i saw one of the other women in the party talking to him in an undertone she was murmuring about something which was evidently serious to her though he laughed i leaned over to him and pulled at his sleeve you know a thing like that will clear my head in a second curt i said go way wont you listen im busy cant you see im busy well im your wife and i want you to talk to me run along dearie later so that evening we had our first row on the way home i was all in the wrong but in the morning he came and apologized it was so like himi mean like the boy i had known in the beginningthat i began to care even more i was not only his wife but he treated me at times like a sister the next night we were to go on another party this one larger than any we had both been on together as usual we had cocktails before leaving the apartment i forgot to tell you didnt i that we kept my place in town as well as his country house that was one of his ideas well this night i suddenly got afraid and i didnt want to go curtis was getting to be too much for me lets not go this evening i said what lets not go why not dearie im tired tired yes it isnt any wonder either of course we wont go then do you mind no i dont mind but it would have been good fun he was keenly disappointed and i knew it i knew too that i couldnt keep him away from that sort of thing long he had started fast living and was making up for all the years he had missed you can see my position and it was a curious one for a bride wasnt it i was beginning to feel that i was living a nightmare you see the trou ble was that i loved him well i finally made up my mind and planned accordingly one night about two weeks after that we went into the country again for saturday and sunday i had bro ken my contract with the manager of the company and he had been nice about it but i didnt expect curtis to see the best side he was standing at a cabinet examining a bottle when i spoke to him remember that this was less than a month after the night he proposed to me jack i said i have given up my part what do you mean he didnt move his eyes from the bottle i mean i resignedbroke my con tract why because i am going to have a baby crash went the precious stuff all over a new red carpet and my husband was on his knees beside me suzanne had by accident as she was talking knocked a glass off the table lost love and while the waiter was clearing away the splinters she rested and sipped some water yes he kneeled over beside me and while we remained there in that po sition i seemed to feel wella sort of revelation i seemed to see the glory of everything love children the world and its peoplei knew that i loved and i knew that i could never go back again to the existence i had left the life he had found me in those few seconds were beautiful for the mo ment i was a sort of god and in that moment while i was glorified my hus band was realizing the inadvisability of our having a child he mentioned it to me even anyway i changed i had always rouged and painted now i scarcely powdered i had always dressed lightly and so thinly that part of my reputa tion was based on the fact tha the tops of my black silk stockings were vis ible through my gowns but now i wore what i thought was modest and be coming to a mother i stopped drink ing and i stopped telling stories and saying things i wouldnt have wanted my future baby to hear i didnt go out all i did was sit by myself or motor out into the country or talk to curtis and curtis was bored and didnt want to be with me any longer where as he had craved my company every minute in the old days now he was glad to be away he didnt recognize in me his former companion i suppose it was different be fore we had always greeted each other with long kisses and things like that when we met after being apart for a few hours but now i was so quiet andohthe kisses were different he gradually grew away from me little by little he took to spending his evenings in town by the time my baby was born he was running around with the gayest set in town a lot of my old friends he was never sober enough for the idea that he had a family to sink into his head you can see what it must have been for me one evening he came in about three oclock then he said he would give me my divorce it was just two weeks later before the papers had been served that he asked to talk to me i was living in his country house and i thought that it was only right and fair that i let him say what he wanted he came in and i hardly recognized him he had been in a sanitarium for two weeks we talked he was sorry almost brokenhearted suzanne he said its all my fault and now i realize it we have a baby its born of two people both of whom have played fast and loose and one of whom is changed the other wants to change in the same way will you let me if you dont theres only this same life left for me you want to change curtis yes you think i could go on with you if any woman can you can yes perhaps you are big enough curtis can you change can you be a father and a husband now i realize that you married one kind of a woman and had another kind for a wife he said that he thought he could but he couldnt and so he gave me a divorce you still love him i said yes i do such is the way of women suzanne smiled absently it suddenly struck me that there was rouge on her cheeks and lips and blue over her eyes i also noticedi couldnt help itthat her dress was cut low far too low for the daytime wondered whether she realized how low it was she must have

croon of the sea was about our ears the tang of the wet wind stung our faces and the path led over the hill to the stars between the clasp of your hand and mine lay trust as deep as the sky and in my heart love a shining flame as steadfast as the island light circling great arms towards infinite space marriage is the surest device in the world for proving to a man that he is always wrong the beanstalk one act of a play by john chapin mosher as you remember the story jack began to climb at once the beanstalk that had grown so suddenly from this world to another but the story does not tell how jack becoming a little tired halfway tip the stalk lay down to rest on a leaf rather broader than the others the stage where this scene is played is on that leaf and one may see from the audience still others leading upward and down ward in a gigantic green circular stairway the thick heavy stalk rising rigid through the center as the curtain lifts jack comes about the turn of the stalk he wears a grey and scarlet gherkin an impudent cap and carries a staff of heavy oak he pauses a moment and appraises this restingplace then peers down around the stalk whence he has come jack it is a long journey he peers up the green stalk pats it af fectionately and speaks to it how strong you arei have a long way yet to go he throws his staff and cap on the floorlike leaf squats and rips a crust from the loaf of bread he has carried in his wallet i need not hurry i can eat now he munches a moment with keen rel ish but even here one may not be altogether undisturbed jack grows suddenly aware that someone des cends the stairway of the beanstalk and quickly he distinguishes a girls voice girl singing as she comes down i sang a song and they laughed at me three hills and a tree five birds and a bee they laughed at me i sang the song jack a girlhere she comes about the corner and stands still on seeing jack she wears a stiff starched pinafore and her hair is drawn back from her forehead in to two neat braids under one arm she carries a huge book really much too heavy for her altogether she is much the sort of person who is not unaccustomed to a civic order of things where fairy godmothers upset the schemes of committees and dwarfs control and individuals oc casionally drift into naps that last a hundred years or if she does not wholly understand it as some of our intellectuals have been compelled at last to acknowledge at least she has gown a little grave in an effort to seek the meaning and the cause and the effect of such conditions because each understands the sig nificance of their meeting here neith er stirs at once but they stare silently and even fearlessly for they are young at each other at last jack speaks the beanstalk jack we are half way between the worlds the girl i know jack and when a boy and a girl meet half way between the worlds they love the girl nodding for that is what love is jack rising gallantly wont you sit down the girl stepping down on the leaf thank you i will she gladly puts down the book and sits on it beside him jack i am not surprised somehow to meet you here the girl if i had not thought that i might chance upon you here i should not have dared to leave my world jack to dare to leave your world that is to come halfway to love the girl suddenly poor boy it was harder for you you had to come up the beanstalk jack manfully poohi am not tired the girl such a long way they lean over the edge of the leaf and gaze down jack how far away it is and how small the houses are i never knew before i never saw it until from this high dis tant placehow small a place my own town was and how wide the world spreads out beyond it the girl that is where you lived jack there where the poplar trees give way a little and there the road winds past the mill and theres the grave yard from here it is as level as the square we dances in that white straight line across the hills is the great highway even from here we cannot see its ending the girl but i am content now not to see any further jack and is your world like that one also the girl we too have squares to dance in and graveyards and long white highways that lead away across the hills jack with a new alarm surely it cannot be the same as mine the girl sadly it looks as though it werebut i am quite sure it is not there is no one like you there jack ah nothere is no other world like that there could not be the girl suddenly why did you come away jack i can run i can run swifter than any lad on our countryside and i would run in the morningoutrun them all in the morning swift over hillsswift through the brackentill there in the breast of the hills where a pool is id stand for an instant strip bare and thenand then then as the first rays of dawn hit the water id the beanstalk divedeep with the suns first days id sink down through that water the girl yesyes jack they did not wish me to run they wished me to go at dawn to the mill and at noon still they would hold me they would hold me at the mill but at noon i was far away where the berries hang red and full on the briars and the grass grows cool in the shade of for ests and woodlands without an end and at night though sometimes i danced on the square i sought rather yonder the strange black ways where only the stars will venture to guide where the gnomes grope forth from their mines in doubt whether flowers that last but a day have a charm their gold has not also the girl and they did not wish to allow you this jack they told me i must be wisethat i must learn the precepts of the sages that i must build myself a redtiled house and toil at day to make the grain grow rich and ripe they talked so much of what this world is but do i not know as much as they of this world do i not know of the depths of the pool of the flat purple lilies that grow in the marsh and the drawings of shadows the evenings make and their precepts why what do they tell of the rain in your face or the touching of hands in the dance i was young and they warned me of living is to be young a time only to learn to be old in the girl shaking her head fiercely they did not understand you jack but you why have you left your country the girl in my book this book i wrote my thoughts the thoughts that stole to me in the night that creep over the grey hills to me that the wings of the swal lows told me oh it is a great wisdom but they would not listen to me jack in amazement they would not listen to you the girl i went to the councillors and i stood before their great council tables where they pondered their affairs of state and i told them the magic of play and the truths of unbelievable things of the prayers in childrens gestures and the wisdom in old womens eyes i told them the love that a soldier has for an enemys strength and the nimble way a laughing word could make them friends forever i begged them to seek that beauty that huddles beyond palace gates i told them the gospel of streets and of common troubled peo ple and i told them the unsaid things in the stories they told them selves jack history the girl yeshistory what it was the sleeping beauty feared when the prince wakened her why it was cin derella danced best of all her last dance and the music that each strand of hair played to rapunzels lover jack you must have helped them greatly in their counsels the girl they were too old they would not listen and at last i took my book and came away i could not live in a land where the wise would not listen and the young might not speak jack ahit is that way in all worlds the girl but i shall make them listen in your world the beanstalk jack dubiously how the girl i shall because of you jack me the girl for i have learned why the wings of the swallows beat a tune on the winds for me and why the night whispered to me it was for you it was that i might go to your world and tell them of you how wise the waters and the woods had made youthat i might show them what they had not seen the clearness of your eyes and the pre cious strength of your hands jack leaping up and i see too what i must do i shall force my way to those grey coun cillors and place your book with the thoughts the night whispered to you and the swallows wings beat out on the winds for you before their old eyes and they will not dare not to read they will not dare for that is why i have been made strong and why while i was young i came halfway to live the girl also standing then we must part now they are silent before this terrible logic at last jack says jack i cannot i shall go back to my land with you the girl no when you have met love in the place between two worlds you may not return to your world this is so very obvious to them that they do not question it but after an other moments silence jack stoops and picks up the book as he does so he noticcs the rim of the leaf jack there are clouds in the west but still the sun scorches the vine see the leaf has a yellow edge the girl you must climb slowly and not let the sun beat too hot upon you jack i am glad that the leaves of the vine will shade you see they droop a lit tle and they will fan you gently as you go down the girl then we shall meet jack yeswhen the councillors have read your book and brought a new happi ness to your world the girl and when your world begs that you return and run again across their hills jack we shall come here again the girl to this place between two worlds jack for that we are strong we live and our journeys are not overlong the girl and if i am late will you wait me jack could i do otherwise here and will your journey up be overwearying the girl ah no for i shall be on my way to you very solemnly jack bends to her and kisses her once on the lips then he seizes her book and hands her his staff they stand a moment in part ing silent then the girl turns to the downward step of the stairway of leases she waves him her last fare well and disappears about the stalk as she descends she sings the beanstalk the girl singing i sang a song and they laughed at me three hills and a tree five birds and a bee they laughed at me i sang the song ohi sang the song jack jubilantly i sang the song he catches the book firmly under his arm and turns to climb as he does so he pauses a moment to run his hand caressingly about the great stalk suddenly stopping short that was not there before that rift ing in the stalk he looks out over the sky those clouds move swiftly toward the sun from far below the girls voice comes up to him the girl i sang the song jack what have i to fear nowi sang the song he takes the first step of the leaves with a vault and runs up the stair way gaily balancing the book on his shoulder but the clouds were mov ing more swiftly than he thought and a darkness spreads all at once about the vine and the heavy stalk trembles in the storm sounding still clearly through the darkness come the voices of the boy and the girl jack from above sing little girl sing the girl from below i am singingsinging all the way jack only a little while and then it will be light again the girl i can hear you boy down here i can hear you jack and your song comes even here to me the girl at last i have reached your world my boy where are you now jack a moment later your song gave me a new swiftness it has brought me too to your world the girl only a little while jack yesonly a little while and then we shall come back again a great gust of wind drowns their voices then passes carrying with it the storm clouds again there is light but the storm has worked its will and through the very center a great rift cuts in half the beanstalk all women have a secret hope that people regard them as just a bit dangerous a friend is an acquaintance who is on the way to being an enemy the reward of modesty by james dallas her name never appeared in letters more than half an inch high she alluded to her own ability in the most disparaging fashion and regarded a press agent as the height of bad taste her picture never decorated cigar boxes she preferred to bathe in water rather than in milk she had a holy horror of divorce every night after the play she drove straight home as a model young woman of excellent character it would have been hard to find her equal as an actress she was a dismal failure dusk by irmengarde eberle the wind is coming home old and walking slow quietly over the houses and quietly through the street passing the silent trees and over the broad fields the wind is coming home the old familiar way tenderly touching the earth and kissing the sleepdrugd bay and wondering how he ever went so heartlessly away the wind is coming home still he has far to go he has been out to the ends of the earth and now he wonders why the wind is getting old and he has the heart to die two gentlemen of caracas by l m hussey i in the city of caracas at that time the two most prominent and power ful politicians after the president of the republic were ruiz valdivieso and jesus maria perez when the news spread through the city that for no apparent reason the son of valdivieso had insulted both the daughter and wife of perez in pub lic and that young valdivieso had been taken off to jail there was quite naturally an intense interest on the part of everybody an eager expect ancy the curious part of the affair was that the two men were in no way political enemies but held their posi tions in the ministry through an amal gamation of their separate influences a confederacy both had been in their day powerful caudillos and there were still plenty of valdiviesistas and perezistas who would have followed either of their leaders through any adventure the news of the insult was carried about very rapidly the fashionable cafes were at once the centers of voluble speculation ruiz valdiviesos son was in the hands of the police what would ruiz valdivieso do as a matter of fact the father of the incarcerated boy was at that moment on his way to perezs home having previously talked with him over the telephone the acquaintance with his sons escapade had come to him very quickly after its accomplishment he was astonishedand immensely an noyed he dismissed his informant with more curtness than the fellow really deserved and then stood alone in his study pulling at his long moustache and occasionally biting his full lips no explanation occurred to him for the action of his boy moreover what ever provocation he might have had the act so far as his fathers interests were concerned was unjustifiable ruiz valdivieso understood his posi tion with complete clarity he was not the secretario general through the love of the president but because of that excellencys fear and alone the chief would not fear him would doubtless be strong enough to destroy him he was powerful be cause he was the one half of an ap parently indissoluble confederacy pe rez the other he had no wish above all things damnable to break with pe rez he cursed his son liberally walking up and down the large room with a dark frown on his dusky countenance finally he went to the telephone and called his friends home the gober nador himself answered hello said the secretary this is ruiz how are you my friend of course youve heard all about his ex travagant business yeswhat the devil is the matter with your son valdivieso snorted into the receiver the good god only knows what happened to the boy he exclaimed a boy is a terrible trial you may be sure i had nothing to do with it i want to come over at once i want to apologize perez laughed well im relieved he said come over anytime there will be a lot of two gentlemen of caracas asinine talk going aroundwe must make our position very plain a few compliments were exchanged over the wire and the two receivers were hung up valdivieso went to the mirror and examined his face in the glass he carefully straightened his white tie smoothed down his shirtfront whipped a fleck of tobacco stain from his upper lip he looked less perturbed he felt more assured perez had doubtless been as worried as himself he walked down the long flight of steps and got into the car that was waiting in front of his chalet the car pulled away and swung into the street two or three men observed his depart ure recognized him and looked after the disappearing automobile with keen interest no doubt he is going to the police they said but valdivieso had so far no sym pathy with his son and was content that the boy should suffer the humiliation of a night in jail naturally he would be subjected to no severities it would probably be a good thing for him so the father smiling a little now looked out on the avenue and leisurely contemplated the crowds on the side walk el paraiso was still crowded at that hour the bands in the public squares had just finished playing the opera had let out a short time before and thirsty men were hurrying for their nightly tables at the cafes the lighted city lay like a gay jewel be tween the impenetrable shadows of the mountains that flanked it on either side perez lived on the same street the street that housed most of the promi nent people of the capital it was not long before the car drew up at his door the gobernador was waiting and the two friends shook hands with a com plete and relieving cordiality brandy and soda was served to them at once in tall glasses and they sat down to talk have little heraclia and the se nora returned asked valdivieso perez nodded he sipped his brandy with a smile yes then theyve told you all about it ive heard nothing but the barest facts myself what did that wretched boy do the gobernador touched the arm of his friend with a caressing gesture he continued to smile amiably larger than ruiz valdivieso older in appear ance his big body composed in the chair had the effect of profound solid ity and impressive calm never mind the boy he said dont call him names what about my own son doesnt he get me into hot water at every turn it is the way with these youths when their spirits are high and they have the pride that comes with good blood and a good name i more than suspect it was a little re action of jealousy jealousy what do you mean well my friend i think your young son has had part of an eye at least on heraclia i think so ah you never metioned this perez laughed his face was ruddy from the effect of the brandy and his good humor no ive been waiting and the confounded girlbless the good god you havent a girl theyre more worry than any boyhas probably been a lit tle cold to him i dont know i havent questioned her but this is what happened the women had de cided they didnt care for the opera tonight and had given the box to the hidalgos who have a houseful of friends from argentina then they changed their minds i secured them tickets in the parquet and heraclia and my wife got themselves ready and left at the usual time when they were taken to their seats they unexpect edly found your boy sitting on the aisle my girl was in front of her mother and she stood for a moment expecting your son to rise and let them pass but the infant spread out his legs and ig nored them it would have been neces sary to climb over him two gentlemen of caracas the impudent whelp exclaimed ruiz valdivieso perez laughed again he took a swallow from the glass in front of him and looked about the room with an ap praising and contented glance he en joyed his home he enjoyed his posi tion and the momentary threat to his security was proving more of a mole hill than any mountain his geniality expanded well and then he went on he eraclias temper is no soft one and she called an attendant and ordered your son removed the boy showed signs of intending to fight the fellow then and there so of course the police took him off hes probably home by this timeyoull find him when you re turn while you were coming over i telephoned to herrara and told him i had no complaint against the boy told him to let him out a few further words on this topic and the two friends began to speak of other things they progressed at last to their favourite theme political in trigue their commingled voices made a sonorous hum in the lofty room perez sat at ease in his large chair his impressive bulk accentuated by the expansive gestures of his big jewelled hand the secretary lean nervous rest less as a jaguar from the mountain for t of the avila moved about his slen est hands in a lithe accompaniment to der speech jumped now and then out his chair and paced the room rapidly resumed his seat with a feline swift ness the two were illumined by the sub dued aurine glow of a lighted dome suspended on brass chains above their heads they looked picturesque con inspiratorial two intriguing figures out of an antique time at last ruiz valdivieso arose to go his friend stood up and accompanied him to the high folding doors of the room a servant brought his hat and coat he walked out into the corridor alone as he approached the vestibule he saw a slender figure standing there like a morose shadow he recognized pe rezs son cesar a boy somewhere near the age of his own child the young man was facing him but seemed not to see him ruiz valdivieso smiled at the shadow buenas noches he said there was no answer he walked down the steps to the garden in front frowning a little considerably sur prised a half hour later undressing for bed he attached no significance to the incident perhaps the boy in some abstraction had not seen him pass ii but cesar perez had seen him very plainly and heard him say good night with open ears by his own volition he had not chosen to acknowledge the greeting of the secretarys nod nor his parting words it did not matter to him that his father had determined to ignore the insult at the opera he thought less of his father for that if his parent for purposes of policy was not conscious of the honour of their name he himself was now old enough and young enoughto be acutely aware of it and young julio valdivieso had an noyed him more than once in the past now he had committed an act of direct aggression cesars ardent and romantic imagi nation conceived a score of requitals all of which seemed trivial and inade quate he was doubtless awake in the house longer than anyone else that night he lay sleeplessly in his bed turning from side to side like a young forest animal watchful in the night waiting in a hidden lair when he finally went to sleep he had not yet de termined on a satisfactory course of action he did not see his father in the morning he breakfasted with herac lia who related again with indigna tion the incident of the preceding two gentlemen of caracas night her brother said nothing he ate in silence staring at his plate with a savage animosity the girl rather careless of his atten tion sensing nothing of his inner thought expanded upon her theme an grily for the mere pleasure of vehe ment speech at last she began to talk of something else and presently cesar arose and left the room without a word he had learned now that through some error young julio valdidieso had not been set at liberty the night before he was to leave the jail that morning so much the better for his own pur poses it would be easier to approach him he put on his hat and went out very quietly he had an idea it was not yet too late to intercept julio he hurried to the plaza bolivar half running along the street his soft hat pulled down over his eyes in the manner of a french apache he did not slacken his pace until he was in the square itself and then crossing over to the cafe he stood under the gaudy sign that read cerve ceria lounging and waiting on one corner was the old cathedral he had no eyes for that he looked in another direction toward the sinister pile of stones that marked the jail keeping his gaze on the door two soldiers walked languidly up and down in front of the building passing and repassing each other the sunlight laid a gold calm over the square a faint smell of incense sug gesting the lure of pagan rites drifted out of the open door of the cathedral and was lost in the immensity of the warm morning air and then cesar saw young valdivie so in front of the jail he must have come around from the side he ap peared there quite suddenly like a hated apparition cesars romantic pride sent a quick rage like a hot current through all the intricacies of his veins into the very tips of his slim fingers he saw julio walk past the two guards with an erect and contemptuous carriage he saw him turn the corner and disappear then he ran directly across the square swiftly turned the corner himself and directly in front was the slender back of his antagonist he made no cry of warning but leaped upon him like a springing cat julio unexpectant collapsed immedi ately and the two went down to the ground with a thud cesar had buried his hands in the hair of his enemy and endeavouring to deliver upward kicks with his bent legs he meanwhile pulled ferociously at the thick wiry strands the pain was very great and tears rushed out of young valdiviesos eyes blinding him he was lying flat on his face unable to free his hands a sav age body squirmed on top of him thrusting a pair of cruelly sharp knees in his back he had no idea who had attacked him he was astonished and more than that the obscurity of the onslaught sincerely frightened him and he now began to fill the air with screams for help windows were raised womens faces appeared men came running out of the buildings the two soldiers left their stations in front of the jail and hurried around the corner cesar felt himself seized from be hind and in a moment he was pulled from the prostrate form beneath him but the tenacity of his hold upon julios hair was such that a liberal amount was forcefully detached and came away in his hands like a trophy of the engagement one of the guards held him by the arm the other helped julio to his feet an eager crowd gath ered and recognizing the boys began to laugh julio staggering upon the enclosing arm of the soldier was blinded a mo ment more by the tears that rolled out of his eyes from pain from rage from fright and then a second before the two were led off toward the jail he saw cesar perez he understood everything his mind was illuminated as by the sud den appearance of a searching light two gentlemen of caracas iii herrara the governor of the na tional prison was extremely annoyed when he learned that his charge of the night before had been returned to him with an additional burden of equal weight the son of jesus maria perez also an orderly told him of the ar rest and he kicked the fellow liberally for bringing him such unpleasant news che cebron he exclaimed the orderly retreated with an anx ious precipitation these caudillos cried herrara in the privacy of his office they keep a mans soul in perpetual tor ment here i have both the precious devils of their sons in keeping and god knows how theyll look at me for having done my duty the only thing he could do was tele phone the two parents immediately he talked to them with many respectful phrases perez was the more amiable which was natural he felt that his boy af ter all had had some justification he laughed when herrara gave him the news and asked him to be good enough to release both the young men at once then he called ruiz valdivieso the secretary a more excitable man than his friend was considerably per turbed he had heard all the details of the attack and was angry at the vic iousness with which cesar perez had mauled and pummeled his son it seemed to him highly unnecessary un provoked brutaland he remembered the refusal of the young man to speak to him the night before he pulled nervously at his ponderous jet moustache and certain halfthought suspicions came into his mind and em bittered his outlook like an unexpected and sinister shadow falling across his footsteps he had no faults he had no confidence he suspected all men suppose perez the gobernador were not the open sincere man he seemed even one of his position might be capa ble of petty treachery however he concealed his irritations when perez talked to him the gober nador was actually jovial his sentences came over the wire between the punc tuations of his heavy laugh scowling drawing down his jetty brows ruiz valdivieso could imagine the man as he held the instrument in his hand the fat yellow face smiling obscenely the paunchy belly shaking with his mirth he had an extreme difficulty in keeping the phrases of his answers within a required suavity well ruiz said perez we thought we had settled the whole affair between us last nightbut we reck oned without our boys i suppose its better anyhow eh theyve worked out their own justice and now we can feel more easy it was necessary to agree but when the secretary returned the receiver to its hook his irritation was shown in the savage and abrupt click of the instru ment when his son appeared however he showed no softness no amelioration of his temper no leniency he glared at the young man with a ferocity that was easy to one of his ardent nature he demanded to know if the boy through a continued exercise of his imbecile folly desired to ruin him to break all his important connections to drive him into a tangle of inextricable difficul ties julio was frightened and impressed and his private plans for a swift re venge were for the time overshadowed by the vigour of his fathers words he determined to wait to bide a more pro pitious occasion at this point the regrettable affair might have settled down into a state of indefinite suspension had it not been for an ironic act of young cesar perez when the guards had pulled him from the prostrate and howling form of julio a little of his adversarys thick hair had come away in his hands on the way to the jail he had thrust this trophy into his pocket finding it there a few days later he was immensely de lighted he took an acute pleasure in turning the dozen or two threads be two gentlemen of caracas tween his thumb and finger and think ing of the admirable requital he had taken for julios dishonorable aggres sion and then there came to him a sar donic inspiration his dark eyes gleamed joyfully as the thought oc curred to him his face was illumined with a rosicrucian grin he jumped up from the chair in which he had been seated and hurried to his desk he searched for letter paper and wrote these words without salutation signature or comment here are your wires i return them to you he placed the note with the threads of hair in an envelope and mailed them to julio valdivieso the letter was duly delivered to ju lio his rage on reading the scornful words on finding the uprooted hair transported him into a frenzy of un reasoning anger he was malignantly insulted he was flaunted he was de fied he remembered all his ills all his injuries at the hands of the perez fam ily he recalled a scene with the girl he raclia confided to no one and the shameful rejection of his ardour came back into his mind like a poison like the toxin of a malign disease the re straining influence of his father was no barrier adequate to the damming of his abounding animosity he spent the day in bitter and torturing thoughts in extravagant planning and when even ing approached he dressed carefully with a sinister deliberation and went out to find cesar perez he took his way down el paraiso that admirable avenue on which at this time of day his enemy would most like ly be discovered it was still twilight but the arcs of the city were now light ed adding the glamour of artificiality to the glow of a departing tropical sun looking down the avenue he could still discern the luxuriant green mounds of the hills that rose up out of the val ley like billows of verdure melting at last into the sides of the citys two mountains people were coming out of their houses the bands in the squares were beginning to play many pedes trians in passing recognized him and spoke to him he acknowledged no greetings he walked as in a sublima tion of abstraction his countenance dark and intent his purpose astonish ing in its direct simplicity he came to the southern end of the boulevard into the region of popular cafes and now his eyes moved about actively he searched all the faces in the passing crowds he approached one of the larger cafes la espania and here fortune served him he was near the door looking about when he observed an automobile draw up close to the side walk his eye caught the heraldic shield of perez embossed upon the pol ished door of the car within the ve hicle he saw the gobernador another manand cesar his face flushed violently his fingers tensed into two fists he seized his low er lips between his bared teeth ob serving that the trio were about to alight from the car he drew back into the shadow of the canopy that hung over the entrance to la espania the two men got out of the car first cesar who had been driving followed them they crossed the pavement toward the cafe then julio disclosed himself he emerged from the shadows like a cat from concealment and with low ered head rushed at the young perez his arms were outstretched his fingers were curved like clutching talons his body was bent forward cesar did not see him and would have been taken inevitably by a com plete surprise had it not been for the quick intervention of his father but old perez with the long custom of wariness with the habit of ceaseless alertness never suggested by his obese exterior saw the enraged boy the mo ment he emerged from the shadows of the canopy his huge arm was sud denly interposed like an impenetrable barrier the unseeing julio collided with it like a futile wave he staggered two gentlemen of caracas back he raised his face and stared then perez describing a circle with his arm that seemed scarcely more than an expansive gesture swept him off his feet tumbled him to the pavement with a ludicrous ease a crowd was collect ing a policeman hurried up the oliceman recognized the gob ernador and saluted him perez ut tered a few contemptuous words take this young ruffian where he will be safe he said and young julio was pulled to his feet and like the victim of the same recurrent disaster was led off in im potent confusion the other party proceeded into la espania iv the secretario general of the re public ruiz valdivieso had gone that afternoon to guaira the seaport nearest to the inland city of caracas no one knew of his departure and it was conse quently impossible to communicate the news of his sons third incarceration at guaira he concluded certain private business and then going to the seaside home of a friend spent the balance of the afternoon in agreeable conversation with his friend and two or three ac quaintances the day was unusually warm and the comfort of the company was ac complished by the frequent service of tall glasses of iced brandyandsoda they sat outdoors in a little latticed pa vilion that opened to the sea an over tone of waves breaking themselves on the short cliffs mingled with the sound of their voices the conversation went into reminis cent channels ruiz valdivieso re tailed his days as an active caudillo days and nights in the saddle and anx ious hours he drank brandyandsoda out of the tall glasses and his heart warmed with reminiscence the old days of difficulties of hardships of uncertainties returned in vivid remem bered pictures his gestures grew lar ger his eye brighter his carriage more erect they toasted his old suc cesses he gave them a hearty response as the hours passed it became in creasingly manifest that such an agree able company could not be immediately disbanded the secretario general made a suggestion why shouldnt they all accompany him back to the capital very little more than a two hours ride and conclude the evening pleasantly at la cerveceria no one could think of anything better than this they hurried away together to catch the next return ing train in the car fresh glasses of brandy andsoda were brought them and the conversation continued with the ut most communion of feeling the sec retarys friend had seen service as a young man in peru and he related his experiences he told of an amusing adventure with the wife of his colonel the talk turned to women now they grouped themselves closer together their dark faces flushed their eyes brighter their glances suggestive they told many isolated anecdotes they went back to the memories of their earliest affairs they constructed gen eralizations all agreed on one thing pertaining to the latin females the french women were the most lascivi ous the spanish women the most lov ing the italian women the most pas sionate if you were unfaithful to a french woman you probably found that she had got ahead of you anyway with another man if you were faith less to your spanish mistress she would often try to kill herself if you were untrue to an italian she would more than likely try to kill you the train pulled into the terminal at cara cas and the friends alighted arm in arm they took a taxi to the plaza and got out at the cerveceria ruiz valdivieso led the way into the cafe the tables were crowded many voices vibrated in the air in an harmonious hum a score of people recognized the secretary and outting down their drinks pausing in whatever words they were saying suspending the gestures of the moment they stared two gentlemen of caracas at him they fastened their eager eyes upon him in surprise in expectancy in curiosity for a moment he was oblivious to the stir he was making and then meet ing gaping faces on every hand he stopped short in the center of the room and frowned he looked about him angrily scanning the staring faces at the tables then a man named silva an old valdiviesista came hurrying to him through an oblique channel of silent tables after a moment the secretary observed his anxious approach and concentrated his stare upon silvas pro pitiatory countenance what the devil is the matter he asked silva came very close he bent for ward he spoke softly into the ear of his chief you havent heard the news then senor ah listen senor i learned of it less than an hour ago i heard it from one who saw the whole affair julio is im prisoned again your friend senor perez attacked him in front of la es pania he knocked him to the pave ment with one sweep of his arm and then caused him to be taken to jail i had this from a very good fellow who saw the whole affair everyone knows ask anyone senor ruiz valdivieso stood erect and frowning staring at his inform ant there was no change in his contract ed visage unless it were the slight deepening of the ruddy colour in his cheeks his friends closed around him there was an eager chatter in the midst of his companions like one lost in the contemplation of remote con cerns ruiz valdivieso stod in utter silence at last he took a step toward an empty table a few yards distant stop ping abruptly turning suddenly he made a gesture for silva to follow him the fellow and his friends trailed be hind him to the table they sat down and silva stood at the side of his chief respectful and waiting for a few seconds the seated man the center of all interest was silent then he turned to silva and spoke antonio he said you can serve me very well si senor i want you to go to my home he said he paused he stared at his hands that lay spread out on the table under his eyes and get my revolver he added the valdiviesista turned sharply and hurried out of the restaurant the old caudillo was silent a waiter ap proached and with glances of eager curiosity took the order from one of the company he returned after a mo ment with fresh glasses of brandyand soda ruiz valdivieso raised his glass and drank the beverage in a long uninter rupted swallow he replaced the glass sharply raised his eyes and stared at the faces of his attentive friends caballeros he said this man whom i imagined was my friend has taken this means to insult my name i dont know what he imagines what he proposes what his schemes are cer tainly he underestimates unhappily for him the decision of my character when antonio silva returns with my weapon i shall go to la espana and shoot him at his table he paused again looked down for a further second raised his eyes once more however he must know he said i wish one of you would go to the es pania and tell him what i intend there was a second of hesitation but finally one of the company stood up and glancing at the others for a hesi tant instant turned and walked slowly toward the door the waiter brought fresh drinks an eager exclamatory conversation broke out like an eruption of pentup talk among the remaining companions at the table ruiz valdivieso said little his face two gentlemen of caracas assumed an implacable harshness and an unswerving determination all his suspicions were confirmed he did not seek to comprehend the motives of pe rezthey might be a hundredfold his experience had taught him that intrigue and treachery were above everything the immutable characteristics of politi cal life in the republic this deeply understood truth was the explication in general of every thing in his childish trust in his in fantile absence of suspicion he had al lowed the initiative to grow in the hands of the other the affair had progressed to the situation of open and flaunting insults his face grew harder his lips fur ther compressed the waiter returned for a third time he drank his brandy andsoda as before in a single swal low and now he saw antonio silva re entering the cafe the man approached him swiftly and stood in silence at his elbow all the company understood they arose ruiz valdivieso gripping the edge of his chair stood up his sight blurred a little and here was a singing in his ears he remembered suddenly that he had been drinking since the af ternoon his legs felt a trifle unsteady two of his friends divining his need took his arms together in a waver ing progress they moved toward the door silva with admirable foresight had brought his chiefs automobile they all got in with deep gravity and were swiftly driven away v the night air blowing against his face made the senses of ruiz valdi vieso swim he closed his eyes he was weary he felt incapable of action his hand flexed and inert pressed lightly against his coat pocket touch ing the bulging contour of the revolver that had been thrust there by silva he breathed heavily his head fell a little to one side about him were his friends conversing in sputtering inco herencies they turned into the boulevard the car proceeded down the broad avenue silently and swiftly in front the chauffeur turned and looked back ex pectantly the motion become slower they stopped the men in the back turned their heads and stared they had stopped before the lighted front of la espania ruiz valdivieso grasped the cush ions of the car and pulled himself to his feet he alighted heavily his friends supported him and in doing so support ed themselves they zigzagged across the pavement and into the cafe near the entrance they sighted jesus maria perez seated drinking sur rounded by his friends he had been drinking steadily all evening and when the news of the sec retarys intent was brought to him the service of drinks had been accelerated someone had brought him a weapon for his protection now it lay across his fat knees shaded by the folds of the tablecloth shadowy sinister sugges tive at a concerted exclamation from his companions he looked up ruiz valdivieso was standing at the door perezs friends jumped up and drew to one side the two who supported the secretary staggered away from him both men were left alone a clear space around each the secretary bracing himself on his widely spread legs looked at the blurred flushed visage of his former friend the latter gripping the edge of the table arose with heavy lurches of his big shoulders something slid from his knees and unheeded dropped to the floor with a metallic clatter for a moment the secretary stood near the door his body unsteady his legs bending from time to time at the knees his head twisting in a faint tremour then he passed his hand over his inadequate eyes and essayed a step further two gentlemen of caracas perezs visage drew closer he saw more clearly he saw the face of the man with whom he had fought against apparent ly insuperable odds with whom he had sat in the early days through long hours of the anxious nights with whom he had been joined in an unbroken confederacy of many successful years his recollections flocked into his mind like vivid ghosts returning in a throng his heart seemed to grow great within his breast seemed to ex pand and warm and soften until it pressed against his lungs and made his breath come short the face of his old friend of his ancient confederate grew large before his swimming gaze he staggered forward his arms were outstretched the tears rushed into his eyes and overflowed upon his dark cheeks he fell against the table he fell into the supporting arms of his be loved friend they clasped each other in an em brace of fraternity and love they cried upon each others shoulders they pressed their moist cheeks together their friends drew about them an other table was pulled up the waiter brought fresh drinks a toast was made to perez and every man drank it another was made to valdivieso and the glasses were emptied someone be gan an old italian song of battle after midnight heaped into two au tomobiles the party set out for the jail someone had remembered julio and it was proposed they all go and secure his release the gobernador and the secretary sat in one car with their arms about each other and their heads rest ing upon their two shoulders they complained in ineffectual voices that the night was chill that they did not want to go out they demanded where they were going they wanted to know what it was all about the source by t f mitchell on a raw blustery day in december he clambered aboard a fifth avenue bus and made his swaying way to the top engrossed in the moving panorama below he neglected to hold onto his hat and suddenly a gust of wind blew it off he gazed after it with indifference and made no attempt at salvage getting another was such a simple matter he dined in a res taurant every evening all men of course are fools but they are reminded of it a good deal less often if they remain single intelligence is a faculty bestowed upon man in order that he may hide his imbecility the years ahead by muna lee along time ago emily scott had ceased to expect happiness through herself it was for that reason perhaps that she dreamed con fidently of an abundance of joy through her children especially through mar jorie the girl touched with the won der of youth was amazingly unlike her mother in appearance only the mother herself realized how like they were in reality and only the mother remem bered how through the difficult un lovely years of marjories sickly baby hood she had comforted herself with the thought she will repay me for all this some timewhen she is my big girl the years while marjorie was grow ing up had been scarcely less difficult life was hard at every point in that rough country to which they had pur sued an elusive promise of fortune or an elusive longing for change for more vivid lifeolin scott himself hardly knew whichand emily was too busy trying to soften the rigours of circum stance for her children to question much or to philosophize at all marjorie did not make the struggle easier as a little girl she was not one of the round merry kissable children who are playful and comforting as a puppy she was not even a pleasant child shy intensely reserved apt to give way to passions of anger distrust ful of other children and distrusted by them hers was hardly a happy child hood she found her one delight in reading in reading as savagely and as illconsideredly as a starving man eats devouring whatever book came to her hand then snatching at another sometimes emily was glad that her child could plunge herself into other worlds than this of sticky clay streets and cramped wooden houses and never quite enough food at any meal some times it troubled her and it troubled her deeply one day to find marjorie poring over a huge mailorder cata logue pencil in hand these are the things ill get when i grow up she explained in answer to her mothers questioning look well have curtains for the windows then and plenty of cups i love cata logues dont let them make you unhappy emily cautioned gravely and after wards picking up the order blank scrawled over in the angular childish hand she read with blurred eyes the list marked for mother gloves a bathrobe a blue velvet suit a garnet brooch the hard years did not seem to harm marjorie so much as her mother had feared growing older she lost much of her painful shyness and most of her distrust and she even developed a sur prising slender darkeyed attractive ness the cramped uncomfortable house remained cramped and uncom fortable there was still nowhere to re ceive callers except in one of the two bedrooms but on the occasions when marjories turn came to entertain the sundayschool class emily took down the bed moved in a table from the kitchen and spent the entire morning in toiling over cookies and blancmange her eyes began to fail by the time she was thirtytwo from sitting up late at night to work on a dress that must be finished for a party for a school ever cise for easternot always marjories the years ahead dresses now for the other children were growing too and emily wasted much of her sight even on little adas clothes she did not mind her chil dren had so little that she was fiercely proud to give them herselfbut it re mained marjorie to whom she looked most for repayment when she is my big girl she would repeat to herself old age loom ing ahead of her as a state of rest of security of blessed inaction she hoped frankly that marjorie would not marry she herself had found little actual happiness in mar riage remembering olin scott as he had been at twentyfive an eager im petuous lover in white flannels whose wooing had dazzled her into a tremu lous certainty that happiness lay just ahead viewing him dispassionately as he was now honest wellintentioned in effectual the victim of a world in which he had too much faith emily doubted that any marriage could bring happiness to her child and she craved happiness for marjorie that would atone for her own life for poverty and for work that had overtaxed her strength and for deprivation upon senseless depriva tion if it must be let her marry but emily was glad when marjorie seemed not to care for the high school boys about whom her friends chattered nor to find other company so interesting as her books that amazing heterogeneous assembly in which the wandering jew the story of an african farm middlemarch and jean ingelows poems were the favourites emily was never quite sure whether or not marjorie enjoyed her girlhood contrasting it with her own she be lieved marjorie must be the happier in spite of the unchanging poverty into which dreams ran as into a blind alley emilys parents had died when was too small to remember them there had been no relatives barely money enough to place her in a colourless barnlike boardingschool where she spent year after year in sensitive loneliness it was in the boardingschool that she had met olin scotts cousin and through her olin scott himself marriage had followedand deepening povertyand the increasing faith that she would realize the happiness of life among her children when they were grown and she might rest the fear which had visited her some times in marjories childhood the chill ing disbelief of life which engendered an apprehension that there might prove to be disappointment in the childs own naturea fear induced by that unchild ish reserve and those unchildish rages passed entirely as the girl grew older marjorie was finefibred and sweet and true of a most unusual qualitya qual ity that only her mothers heart appre ciated emily told herself halfsad and halfproud she and her daughter be came all things to one anotherabove all they were friends and in that friendship emily felt that the fulfil ment of her dream was at hand after all it was like marjorie to fall in love swiftly and irrevocably real izing the fact emily realized its inevi tableness realized that she should have foreseen it and by a supreme and stern selfmastery she was even able to be glad in marjories gladness to believe in the happiness ahead of her child as marjorie herself believed in it as she too had believed when olin scott whispered in the moonlight of a forgotten autumn circumstances seemed to unite in fa vouring marjories chances for happi ness jim was strong and big and gen tle with an appreciation of marjories fineness of spirit which won emilys love and he was able to give marjorie all those things which her mother had longed she might have during that pov ertynarrowed girlhood emily was even able to face bravely the prospect of living half across the continent from marjorie well send for you every summer jim told her tenderly as her own son might have done and some day well arrange matters so that we shall all be together with that joy in prospect emily thought of the hard years behind of the years ahead the promise of the years ahead and wondered selfreproachfully that she could have doubted life it will be worth it all she said to herself tenderlymy big girl it was before the summer which was to have been crowned with that first promised visit that marjorie died died leaving her baby a few days old grief did not crush emily she could not have the luxury of giving way to grief after all there were her other chil dren whom she loved with their cease less demands upon her time and strength in the stricken sleeplessness of the first nights after jims despair ing telegram one gleam of solace came to her perhaps jim will let me take care of marjories baby she said to herself perhaps she will grow up to seem like marjorie lines written on a day of doubt by virginie griffiths there was a woman in the hospital today one of the kind with satin slippers and ideal perfume and she thought we were wonderful and truly angels of mercy she would just love to be a nurse and now i am wondering i am wondering just how much she would love those three years of training the long weeks of night duty with the terrible feeling about three oclock in the morning that you must sleep or die the worry on tonsil night for fear some youngster may hemorrhage the hamburg steak and poor coffee at midnight supper the getting up during the day for lectures and the outpatient service where you go down into the slums to help some italian or polish woman have her baby and the operating room where you stand for hours on a tiled floor and serve an exacting surgeon and then polish the instruments and wash bloodsoaked linen and after graduating the living in a suitcase with the constant companionship of a sick personday and night and men taking the attitude of but i can tell you you understand things of that sort i am wondering just how much she would love it seeing things by john temple i really must be suffering from hallucinations when i started dancing with florence i noticed that she had on white kid slippers of this fact i am positive

tourneys and of knights and ladies lovebegone aunt ida by thyra samter winslow i andrew hunnywell en tered into matrimony with a com plexity of emotionsthe usual doubts and misgivings that assail the abouttobebenedick plus a certain fear and distrust of the bride herself he knew that marriage was a most serious step under any circumstance to be pon dered and weighed usually too andrew considered with a nice thoughtfulness each move that he took yet he married ethyl apperson no wonder he felt he didnt understand even himself no wonder the event thrilled him while it fright enedheld out delightful possibilities of unknown dangers ethyl apperson was a new yorker not one of the usual fiveyearsoutof thewest sort andrew was that kind himself ethyl had been born in new york city it seemed unbelievable until made aware of that fact andrew had taken it for granted that new yorkers were added to the city by birth only on the east side the new york that andrew knew personally was populated by others like himself the ambitious unappreciated misunder stood youth of the little towns there was something to be distrusted sus pected about the native new yorker andrew had been brought up with a distrust for all city folks he had read stories and heard stories about city slickers and he had believed nearly all of them the city was a synonym for wickedness the villain was always a city man the scarlet woman was al ways a product and inhabitant of the city although he knew that evil wom en and crime did exist in piedmont missouri the town he admitted having honored by his birth he felt that the crimes of piedmont were moderate de cent rural ones besides they were always committed by people outside of his immediate social circle andrew had been brought up in a decent christian home his father might come to table in his shirt sleeves ornamented with redcovered rubber sleeve bands but his mother clad in a neat and abovesuspicion two year old hat always went to church on sunday morning he was raised to regard the saturday night bath as far more of a reality than material for rude humor he didnt like sundayschool but it never occurred to him that he might rebel against it or omit learning his sundayschool lesson on saturday night while the bath water was getting hot in two kettles on the kitchen range andrews older sister nellie mar ried douglas splicer whose father was partner in the lumber mill the year ambition moved andrew cityward the year before his older brother sefton had married minnie pelly who had lived next door to the hunnywells for ten years the hunnywells were solid citizens in new york andrew got a job with a wholesale silk company he was af fable and neat after a few years of metropolitan polish and learning of silk business jargon he became a competent salesman which carried with it what andrew thought quite a decent salary socially too andrew was well sat isfied on coming to new york feel ing the need of a helping hand he had attendedonce or twicethe church that his family had gone to at home then realizing that the city church aunt ida was not a social mentor and that with out his mother he could sleep late sun day mornings he stopped going next he looked up some former piedmont people but found that they had settled into an uninteresting de cently piedmont routine of living that was not what he had come to new york in search of after a little while he found his own circle gay young blades from akron piqua jefferson city and points west all bent now as he was on making good he met girls too a musical student from monticello indiana a teacher from cascade wisconsin taking a post graduate course in pedagogy at colum bia university a trained nurse from livingston tennessee he even met a chorus girl who had gone to school with fred millway in tenaboya alabama and an illustrator from ashtabula ohio in groups they went to the theater descending from the topmost row of the gallery as their salaries ad vanced substituting for the glass of soda at a liggett drug store a bite to eat at a jazz cabaret if andrew at tended the theater and cafes usually visited by outoftowners biennial vaca tionists buyers and the like he didnt realize it he wouldnt have cared if he had he felt he was seeing life he was a real new yorker the best kind there were other new yorkers of coursewicked ones the ones that made decent godfearing folks shud der the sort his mother and father and sefton and nellie had warned him againstthe born new yorkers so from the first andrew knew the kind of a girl ethyl apperson was his upbringing warned him his pied mont principles of decency cried out she fascinated himthat was it he should have fought against her yet from the first the web she wove proved too strong ii andrew never even really met ethyl in approved piedmont fashion no one ever brought her forward blushing hopefully and muttered the cabalistic piedmont formula mr hunnywell meet my friend miss ethyl apperson at which andrew and ethyl should have completed the ceremony with a pert and respective im pleased to meet you and how dee do no ethyl came as a stenographer to bernheim orlindorfer and obrien silks she came unheralded one mon day in september she looked wicked seductive even at first glancea tall girl with bright brown eyes and light hair and a way of looking at you that suggested half a wink the third day there ethyl offered andrew some chocolates and teased him about his tie andrew should have kept away from her from that moment he knew that three days later ethyl confided to him that shed been born in new york and had never been farther away than at lantic city although the fact seemed unbeliev able it immediately placed ethyl in the other class of new yorkers he knew she was a girl of no principles and with only a desire to lure men on she had been graduated from a new york high school which was about as far educationally as most of the girls he knew had gone she had com pleted her education at a business col lege but even the most alluring of city types need not be wholly without learn ing ethyl wore clothes far beyond her means andrew knew and fresh flow ers even he was accustomed to girls who dressed nicely and had felt that the girls he went with had stylebut well ethyl was different the way she spelled her name for one thing so sophisticated and the way shed pull her powder puff out of her purse any time and apply powder to her al waystoowhite nose or pursing her mouth into a peculiar formation apply a lip stick conscientiously asking of anyone who happened to be around did i get it on straight and then smoothing her lip with a glitteringly aunt ida manicured little finger she had a smile and side glance for every man in the office what would minnie and nellie think of her andrew found himself strangely un der the spell of ethyl he squirmed agreeably under her charms he found himself watching for her com ing in the morningshe was always latetrying to get a word with her whenever he could during the day he couldnt break away her thin white hands her toored lips her pert man ners bewitched him the other girls he knew in new yorknew yorkers now but small town girls firstceased to interest him he could think only of ethyl he was as madly in love as a neat decent little fellow of his type could beand with a new yorker named ethyl he was amazed at his own boldness finally he asked if he might call he felt that this would be a testwould disillusion him hed see the kind of a home ethyl came fromthe spell would be broken oh dont come out to the house ethyl said not tonight anyhow aunt mary and the three kids are there their apartment is being redecorated and the small of paint makes aunt mary ill ill tell you lets have din ner some place down here and go to the movies soshe was ashamed of her home or not prepared yet that he might see it well he knew that much any how that evening was the pleasantest andrew had ever spent the little french restaurant ethyl suggested she knew dozens just like it all over townseemed mysterious different the motion picture theater seemed made just for the two of them he loved the music that night the pres ence of ethyl the fragrance of her hed never had such an opportunity to smell the perfume she used as in that semidark warm theaterher little laughs made him half dizzy he reached over for her thin white hand and found it soft and very yielding she didnt pull away with a joke as other girls lie knew would have done it was quite wonderful afterward they went for a bite to eat ethyl chose rather a quiet restaurant and said she had to hurry home or her motherd worry she was a deep one was ethyl the outside of ethyls apartment house told him nothing it was in a respectable section of harlem a six story building of red brick ornamented with the usual white stone the usual skeleton of fire escapes the regulation vulgarly ornate entrance hall ethyl held out a slim white hand at the door of the elevator had a fine time see you tomorrow she said as the elevator boy a huge negro in a uniform several sizes too small for him opened the door that elevator man bet he knows a thing or two he could tell me about ethyl thought andrew on his way home he had an engagement with a cou ple of the fellows the next night the night after he took ethyl to dinner at one of the better hotels and then to a musical comedy she had to go home immediately afterward some friends of mamas are there for the evening and i promised to get home in time for the eats she told him but when they reached her apart ment house the slouching negro the yawning elevator she dismissed him again with a wave of her hand and a see you tomorrow could it be pos sible that ethyl was leading a double life she seemed all right of course worked hard was a good stenographer andrew knew that and yetof course she spoke of her family little thingsher mother had been to a card party some relatives had been there for dinner her father had been over in new jersey for a weekend of shooting with some friends from the place where he was employed it didnt seem quite right andrews father didnt go shoot ing his mother didnt play cards hed aunt ida never seen one of ethyls family even as the days passed andrew grew more fascinated if possible he con tinued asking ethyl to go places with him and she nearly always accepted once in a while a boy i used to go to school with or an old friend had made a previous engagement the day after these engagements ethyl some times came to the office wearing a cor sage of violets once there was even a solitary orchid in the center andrew suggested that he call on ethyl at her home she always had an excuserelatives would be there and would tease them her father wasnt feeling well he wouldnt have a good timewhy not stay downtown one night after they had dined to gether ethyl suggested that they go to see there you go again one of the newest musical comedies andrew consented readily at the theater ethyl looked around searching for someone there she is she said at last who asked andrew mama she said shed be here see look up there the second row in the balcony see shes waving so andrew got the first view of his future motherinlaw his heart sank though it was no worse than he had expected she was a large woman with light hair arranged in an elabo rate coiffure her dress was dark but it was rounded at the neck and was tight over an ample bosom she was with a woman in bright blue and two middleclass men which is your father asked an drew oh neither one of those ethyl answered papa hates theaters you cant drag him inside thats mamas cousin mrs brooks and her husband and her husbands brother mama goes with them quite a lot mrs brooks has a son just my agemaybe youve heard me speak of cousin bert it was even worse than andrew had pictured itethyl a born new yorker whose mother undoubtedly peroxided her hair and who went to the theater with a man other than her husband imagine a respectable matron of pied mont the mother of grown children going to the theater with another man and yet ethyl was sweet and soft and fragrantand yes andrew even ad mitted it her wickedness her urbanity reinforced her other charms andrew didnt want to get married he had a comfortable but small apart ment in madison avenue which he called his rooms before he met ethyl he had spent pleasant evenings with a few of the men he knew a sim ple dinner a vaudeville or a music show or just talking in some cafe or in the rooms of a member of the group or he had gone to odd parties he even knew an artist or two and several people who lived in greenwich village he took a girl or two to din ner or the theater he went to queer basement restaurants calling the dirt and unpleasantness atmosphere or to queer halffurnished studios sit ting around until long past his usual bed time drinking weak tea or argu ing over books he hadnt read or things he only half understood and calling it bohemia andrew was well satisfied with him self he didnt want to get married yet one night of his own free will he proposed marriage to ethyl apperson and ethyl accepted him he didnt know exactly what brought on the proposal it might have been a frequency of engagements ethyl had had with other men a boy i went to school with or mr jackson who was at helmar jones amp company with me an awfully nice fellow or a boy who lived in our apartment building when i was a kid hes a young lawer now and awfully smart it might have been because ethyl was ethyl sweet and fragrant and al luring with a background of city wickedness and city knowledge why you couldnt tell what kind of a life ethyl had led or what she might do maybe even now she was just lead ing him onwith ethyl things would be mysterious attractive fascinating aunt ida ethyl born in new york a wicked city girl iii the day after ethyl accepted his proposalit had occurred most fitting ly in one of new yorks gayest res taurants with an accompaniment of jazz and a halfdressed girl in pink singing what are you going to do about that she met him in one of the corridors of dernheim orlindorfer and obrien and said andrew just think were engaged and youve never met any of my folks i hinted to mama how things were and she says youre to come in sunday for dinner and meet the family andrew nodded he had insisted the night before that they marry im mediatelyin a day or two in fact he found he couldnt get his mind on his work when ethyl was there in the office he didnt even care whether mr j ames of the ames store can terbury conn ordered silk or not when any minute he might see ethyl fresh fluffy passing by an open door ethyl wouldnt work when they were marriedhe had money enough for that and ethylwhat if she changed her mind about marrying him it didnt seem possible that such a se ductive bewitching city girl would be willing to marry an ordinary fellow like him once married though he felt he could breathe easier he could man age her he looked forward to itto toning down her city waysher wick edness though he didnt know the form her wickedness or his instruction might take that sunday of meeting ethyls peo ple always remained a sort of a hazy nightmare to andrew he never quite remembered what happened ethyl in a new white dress met him at the door immediately he seemed surrounded by a pack all barking at once these gradually resolved themselves into peo ple ethyls people her mother blonde and rather fat with a ready laugh overdresed redcheeked rather loud her father a tall sallow man nearly bald who spoke little half a dozen cousins three or four aunts an assort ment of odd relatives there was much laughter and talk good natured teasing of him and ethyl a taking for granted a natural acceptance of ethyls affair pleasantries then a dining table set with quantities of deli catessen he got away finally ethyl went to the door with him and looking around to be sure no one was there he kissed her did the folks frighten you she asked i guess it seems pretty bad meeting them this way but you wont get them all at once like this very often you see mama has four sis ters and they all have children and dad has two brothers here in new york youll like them when you get used to them we have lots of fun andrew felt vaguely disturbed about the relatives though he was too much in love with ethyl to take them seri ously they did not fit in with his idea of ethyl however there was noth ing alluring wicked about them to be sure a few of the girl cousins were as slim and almost as fair as ethyl herself with the distinguishing mark of the city girl one of them looked every inch a screen vampire though she talked with a lisp andrew noticed stillso many respectable looking rela tives oh well he wasnt going to marry the family that was certain the next day at the office ethyl seemed as bewitching as alluring as ever a few days afterward they were married andrew lay awake the night before his marriage thinking of it he was going to marry ethyl ethyl a city girlwith a past like as notwith charming litle ways of holding her head of flirting of looking out of the corners of her eyesethyl they were married in church ethyls people had a favorite denomination it seemed though of course they never attended services although it was not the same church andrew had attended aunt ida in piedmont and though marrying a girl like ethyl in a church seemed doub ly wicked andrew was glad to write his people about ithe would keep them from finding out the truth shield them he would pretend that ethyl was the sort of a girl his mother or minnie or nellie might know only ethyls parents were at the mar riage ceremonyandrew had requested that ethyl wore a new suit a charm ing suit andrew thought her mother wore black elaborately braided and trimmed in red and black beads her father a suit of peculiarly ugly purple blue well he was married to ethyl at last at first they went to live in two rooms in a small hotel near where ethyls parents livedless trouble than housekeepingjust the two of them so near the folks too the hotel was the clifton middle class not especially well arranged or managed or furnished with a small basement cafe ethyl had suggested this the first weeks of matrimony were quite as pleasant as andrew had antici pated though perhaps a bit more mod erate ethyl was sweet and loving and fragrant andrew thought she succeed ed in hiding her evil ways quite well and though he looked for symptoms of badness he admitted to himself that ethyl acted quite the part of the model bride andrew liked the clifton too until meeting an old acquaintance a few weeks later and telling him of his mar riage and where he was living the ac quaintance had raised eyebrows rather a shady reputation the clifton he said did you know that indeed i didnt well leave there at once of course andrew had an swered but he had been secretly thrilled at the thought of having lived in a hotel of doubtful reputation of course ethyl had known about the clifton born in new york there were a lot of things she knew andrew questioned her about the hotel that evening nonsense she said ive known about this place all my life why jack wilson the boy i used to go with be fore i met youi went to high school with him remember i told youhas lived here for years a lot of other people i know too jack wilsonwas that why ethyl had picked out the clifton ethyl he said sternly you havent seen jack lately have you ethyl giggled you silly thing of course not dont make such big eyes at me wolf or ill think youre trying to eat me but andrew continued to be serious ethyl he said i m not going to dwell on this but if i ever doubt you its all off you know what i mean wewe couldnt remain togetherif ii suspected you of course ii trust you i just wanted you to know ethyl tweaked his hair dont take it so hard she said and giggled again you bet it would be all off if you doubted me the one thing i couldnt stand would be a hus band who snooped or was suspicious one suspicionandout you go she made a pretty little gesture of throwing him out of the door andrew didnt say anything else he didnt tell ethyl he doubted her but he began watching her actions a little closer after all born in new york city living there all your life without the influences of a small townethyl seemed innocent enough now but the corrupting influences to which she had been subjectedthe way she had been raised they must leave the clifton that was certain that would be a good first step to take andrew was sorry his rooms were not available but they were just for balchelors and too in passing them he had seen that the small swinging for rent sign had been taken down ethyl and he went househunting then they finally found a small apart ment near ethyls mother and her other relativesnot far from the clifton it was the part of new york ethyl aunt ida liked shed be lonely in any other part she said the apartment seemed quite comfortable to andrew there were five rooms a living room of fair size a diningroom with a great cluster of lights above where the table would come two small bedrooms a kitchen wearing a new coat of white paint and a neat bath just think how lucky we are dear ethyl said one of papas brothers is with a wholesale furniture company and we can get everything at wholesale prices so their shopping did not prove as pleasantly romantic as andrew had hoped somehow he had dreamed of hunting through funny little shops for things no with the money ethyls parents gave her with some ethyl had saved for this very purpose and with his contribution they had just enough to buy the things ethyl desired a big threepiece overstuffed set for the living room covered with green and rose imitation tapestry a dining room set of six chairs with shiny black leath er seats a glassed china closet an enormous buffet and a set of ivory enameled furniture for one bedroom and a four poster bed and colonial highboy in mahogany for the other there were bright colored rugs too and ethyl bought yards of flowered chintz for curtains although he felt that something was lacking when the furniture was in and the curtains up andrew had to admit that things looked mighty bright and cozy he was quite well satisfied and enjoyed his lit tle home until he met daisy mallory one of the greenwich village artists he had known before his marriage he met her at a small tea shop where he lunched occasionally dont tell me youre married she gurgled and when he did tell her she asked innumerable questions and finally asked about his apartment weve got a mighty pretty little place he boasted my wifes got good taste about things a new york girl you know and her uncles a mem ber of a large wholesale furniture house so we got things at cost mighty good looking too notcommercial stuff miss mal lory gave a litle shriek well we paid for it if thats com mercial andrew laughed comfortably oh dear said miss mallory do tell me about it andrew told her a little mentioning the overstuffed set of which ethyl was so proud the dining room set the bedroom things how funny laughed miss mal lory not at all politely oh you funny boy you dont mind my laughing do you andrew of course in a year or two youll outgrow it and furnish againbuta rocking chairan over stuffed rocking chairand two com plete bedroom setsand a table with a pedestal and six leathercovered chairs what a charming place you might have had picking up odd things at auc tion good reproductions even a carved chest of drawers an odd table some painted things a vase or two in lustre some goodlooking polychrome candlesticksoh well youre young youll learn but the conversation left andrew de pressed he hadnt guessed that his apartment was so dreadfully ugly or middle class ethylwith her siren smiles and alluring red mouth shouldnt have had commonplace desires for sets and imitation tapestrywhy she should have had chiffon draperieslike some hed seen in a studio once in chelsea villageand why a tiger skin of course on the whole though andrew was quite happy the first year of his mar riage though it was not just what he had expected there were no wild moments no dark suspicions no tan talizing fears life became smooth uneventful ethyl would meet him at the office for dinner always charming ly dressed smiling he didnt like the way she flirted with a new salesman named brown and he watched her ra ther closely while she was there but outside of that theyd go to a favorite restaurant aunt ida for dinner then or the theater but as andrew found that it cost a good deal more than twice as much to support one than two there was not much money for luxuries other nights they were invited to dinners or parties given by relatives or friends of ethyl stupid parties usually with poorly prepared food too many people who laughed at nothing and all spoke at once dancing a talking ma chine that ground out endless songs some evenings they spent at home reading or talking though when some one didnt drop in ethyl fell asleep along about eight ethyl was not a good cook she had been busy down town before marriage and her mother who didnt like to cook either had said ethyl will learn like we all do when the time comes so ethyl was learning now using an drews money for experiments and the results were not all he hoped for but ethyl was still soft and cozy and fragrant though andrew was not as thrilled over the perfume she used as he had been it was expensive for one thing and for another she used too much of it her nightgowns always smelled of it and so did her hair and even the rooms but the worst thing about being mar ried was ethyls relatives andrew rather liked ethyls mother when he grew used to her though she always talked too loud used too much per fume of a grade inferior to that used by her daughter and insisted on calling him son she went with them occa sionally to the theater and laughed so heartily at the jokes that people turned around to look at her and too she had an annoying manner of putting her arm around him with heavy affection ethyls father was the least objec tional relative ethyl had he used cheap tobacco and would smoke only his own leaving the apartment reek ing with it hours after his departure but aside from that he was inoffensive talking little though he breathed rather heavily and had an habitual cough the other relativesandrew shud dered when he thought of them they would troop in at all hours when they were least expected or wantedpretty cousins with languid or affectionate suitors for tea on sunday afternoons aunts dropping in for dinner uncles coming over on sunday mornings to borrow things ethyls aunt mary was a disagreeable woman with a pert way of making decisionsbut andrews abomination was aunt ida aunt ida was a widow who lived alone with one son joe a fat lazy fel low andrew thought him aunt idas most unpleasant characteristic to an drew was a habit of asking questions shed ask questions about anything everything sometimes going on with another question without waiting for an answer sometimes repeating her question two or three times each time in a shriller more impatient voice aunt ida too would handle things nervously picking up the books on the living room table little packages be longing to someone else small orna ments she would finger things put them back take them up again she wore always several bead chains that clinked together unpleasantly when she moved or shrugged her shoulders which she did frequently or when she fingered them which she did nearly al ways when she had nothing else in her hands altogether andrew found aunt ida impossible andrew spoke to ethyl about her relatives especially about aunt ida ethyl sulked a little but promised to see about it after all she pointed out she couldnt tell her own people not to come to see her could she iv as time passed andrew found life growing more and more unpleasant disillusion came fast instead of the wicked person he had surmised even perhaps hoped ethyl to be she settled down into commonplace mediocrity she was heavy stupid dull unimagina tive of coursesometimes andrew thought that the real ethyl was far dif aunt ida ferent that she was really all he had hoped her that this was just a pose but there were few evidences of it as the days passed ethyl bought her clothes wholesale though one of her innumerable rela tives getting them at splendid bargains but quite robbing shopping of its charms she always looked well when she was out with andrew well groomed citified but in the house to save her clothes she took to wearing rather dissreputable kimonos and house gowns cotton things of no particular charm she did her cooking in these which were always too long and the hems were always dirty where they swept the floors her perfume too became more annoying and the one odor for merly so fragrant became cloyingly un pleasant and andrew finally had to ask her not to use any perfume at all with relatives coming in to dinner or afterwards parties he could not avoid without a quarrel calls he was forced to make occasionally attending the theater or having dinner down town andrew found himself in the center of a web of thickest middleclass respectability dull uninspired when he was first married he feared that his mother or minnie or nellie would have disapproved of his city wife he was quite sure that they would disapprove now not because his wife was the siren he had at first feared her but because she was untidy lazy a poor house eeper shiftless sometimes andrew would meet some of his old friends to them he soon learned to give a tinted version of his romance he did not dare admit the mediocrity into which he had sunk a little couple in the midst of decent middleclass stupid stifling relatives if by chance his friends met ethyl wellgroomed flirty laughing they were able to believe easily andrews tales of excitement happiness but an drew knew that his friends were living far more of a wild city life than he was they had more money for one thingethyl was not economical then too ethyl no longer enjoyed the things he did the cafes that were the loudest and fullest of color that andrew regarded as the life ethyl began to think rather stupid she could see nothing in the secondclass vaude ville acts that formed the features of the cabaret she had been a vaudeville attendant since she was ten and the acts seemed to her now to lack inter est and novelty if he had remained single andrew thought that he still might have been a part of real city life as he saw it gay bohemian parties might still have been open to him they were nowif he could go to them he tried taking ethyl to a few but she called the studios dirty holes and didnt get on well with the women saying they were silly and affected and finally refusing to go altogether with andrews pied mont principles of how a young hus band ought to act he did not think of going without her andrew knew that the life he was leadinggetting up as late as possible to the ringing of an alarm clock a hurried bath and a shave a bite of poorly prepared breakfast a day in the silk district home to a poorly prepared dinner with maybe a relative dropping in in the evening was exactly the same life he might have led in piedmontany place finally andrew rebelled against one thing his nerves were beginning to get on edge and he didnt sleep well at night he wanted quiet he said and peace while he was at home ethyl must keep her relatives away ethyl sulked and cried but finally promised to try a few cousins disap peared an aunt or so but at no time were ethyl and andrew free from un expected visits aunt ida was per haps the worst one with only one son to look after she had a great deal of time to herself it was only natural shed drop in to see her favorite niece bringing a jar of homemade jelly a homebaked cakeaunt ida had more domestic talents than her sistersand then stay to dinner so as to see andrew then unless fat slowwitted joe called for her andrew would be compelled aunt ida to escort her home just a step you know five long city blocksand aunt ida usually chose a rainy day for her visits listen here said andrew one eve ning after he returned from aunt idas this has got to stop ive stood for a lot i wont stand for this any more you get mei never want to see aunt ida againor hear her name cry if you want to thats my last word ethyl did cry but she didnt know what to do about it she had never seen andrew quite so angry raised in the midst of her people she thought it rather pleasant to have so many aunts and cousins to be one of such a jolly circle but in a vague way she saw andrews point of view the next day she spoke to her mother about it men are funny creatures offered her mother with the wisdom of twenty five years of married life youve got to humor them i hate to hurt idas feelingsshes a good soul though she is kind of fidgetty you leave it to me ill tell ida that andrew aint well that shed better not go to see you while hes home for a while then if she dont come in while hes home hell be all right you can be careful not to mention her name to him men are queer about likes and dislikes you can go to see ida once in a while in the daytime thatll keep her from feel ing bad and straighten things out soaunt ida was blotted out of the life of andrew he never saw her again ethyl in her little recountings of daily activities saw that they were free from the mention of this despised relative v things should have gone smoothly aunt ida out of the way but they didnt andrew grew cranky over trifles life was not shaping itself as he had hoped once more he started suspecting ethyl of small deceits asking questions which he thought skilful to ferret out her actions of the day when he found that ethyls life was quite above sus picion he grew more and more annoyed he wasnt saving money though he had had several raises this worried him ethyls cooking did not improve her gravies had a layer of grease on the top of them her biscuits were heavy and tasted of baking powder she preferred small packages of delicates sen meats and salads to the big roasts and joints that had been the pieces de resistance of his mothers meals in piedmont ethyls conversation too grew more stupid tiresome it was wholly taken up with telling what had happened dur ing the day the old friend she had met on fifth avenue what cousin helen had bought for the new baby this was this life andrew grew a bit pale he grew more and more suspicious though he knew too well how groundless his sus picions were he got to leaving the silk company half an hour before his usual time in order to call for ethyl at the place where she had said she was going to spend the afternoon a friends or a cousins or the matinee that he nearly always met her or that ethyl always produced a plausible alibi only made andrew a little more sullen ethyl too was a bit disappointed in the joys of matrimony before mar riage andrew had seemed so jolly and friendly she had thought that mar riage would mean a good time and add ing a pleasant husband to the little gath erings of the clan like cousin ruths husband billy why billy could play the violineven rag on ithe was the life of the party when they all met on sunday afternoons or saturday nights they were all awfully fond of him andrewwhy andrew was ridiculous it was all right a couple going only with each other before marriage but nowwhy more and more andrew was trying to take her away from her own people his friendsstupid folks from small towns who thought new york a kind of a circus but ethyl resented most of all an drews attitude toward her aunt ida it seemed so narrow childish obstin aunt ida ate aunt idas son joe went to den ver on business and aunt ida all alone gave up her apartment and moved to the clifton where in two tiny rooms and bath she was near her many rela tives and quite comfortable nowif andrew was only sensible aunt ida could have come in for a meal with them occasionally as she did with the rest of the folks not oftennot more than once a week or so living in a hotel is lonely of course aunt ida had the rest of the familybut ethyl disliked being the one member who could not invite her it made her seem apart different so she got into the habit of dropping into the clifton when she knew aunt ida would be at home talking to her spending perhaps an hour she liked seeing aunt ida partly out of family fondness partly be cause she felt that she was doing some thing andrew objected to ethyl dropped in to the clifton to see aunt ida one thursday afternoon on her way home from a bridge party her dinner was to be picked up at the deli catessen store on her way home so she didnt have to hurry about thatshe hated cooking aunt ida was at home and they had a pleasant little talk about the carlson babies who were getting over the mumps about jennies engage ment to a naval lieutenant about the dinner mary had given for birdie rogers she kissed aunt ida goodbye quite warmly as she left making no reference to andrews taste in the mat ter of disliking inlaws then she tripped outa very successful little visit in the lobby of the hotel ethyl met jack wilson who was just coming in she had known jack for years and thought him a fine fellow always jolly and polite they talked for a few min utes standing near the desk as jack asked for his mail which way you going asked jack im going right home im late as anything now you wont mind if i walk home with you too nice to go up to my room weather like this a block or two not more than that ive got some marketing to do and my husbandyou dont know that man if i walked home with a man he didnt know and he saw mewell it wouldnt be safe thats all so jack wilson walked part of the way home with ethyl and they chatted about people they knew plays they had seen a new neighborhood moving pic ture house when she had dismissed wilson ethyl hurried into the nearest delica tessen shop bought some cold sliced tongue some potato salad baked beans in a little tinone of the specialties of that particular shopa few pickles and olives a slice of raisin cake andrew was there when she got in to the apartment she heard him mov ing about in the living room hello dear she called carelessly andrew didnt answer she dropped her packages on the dining room table and hurried in to him whats the matter dear not feeling well she looked at his face it was dark with anger but there was something else there too a sort of triumph ethyl looked at him amazed whatevers the matter andrew she asked youyou he sputtered and point ed a finger at her she giggled he couldnt be as angry as he looked he must be fooling what has got into you what are you making faces for and pointing at me cat got your tongue andrew grew a trifle calmer where were you today ethyl he asked slowly me where was i why i went to lucy mcgibneys to play bridge i told you i was going tell me the truth its too late for lies what do you mean that is the truth thenyou went no place else ethyl remembered aunt ida shed forgotten that aunt ida had ss dec aunt ida been kept out of sight so long she knew how andrew hated the mention of her name still even at that an drew hadnt told her she couldnt go there but only that he didnt want to see or hear of her well what if i did she said pout ing what if you did my god he burst out running his hands through his hair what if you didmy wife my wifei should have known when i married yougave you my name a girl raised and born in the city still i trusted you married you andrew have you gone crazy i can go to see auntaunt ida if i want to without you acting like this cant i aunt ida andrew gave a strange theatrical laugh aunt ida thats good to think of you trying to put a thing like that over on me aunt ida sounds like one of those stories you read aboutwife tells her husband shes been visiting her auntlater on trusting husband finds out aunts been dead two years yes i know you cant get away with that not with me andrew youre not in earnest you dont thinkwhyi did go to see aunt ida really aunt ida lives at the clifton i pre sume there was a sneer in the words why of course if youd let me talk about her youd know that been there for six months ever since joe went to denver andrew was in no mood for listening he understoodnow the scales had been torn from his eyes hadnt he suspected from the first only today at noon he had told himself that ethyl had been born in new york that she must be bad it was when he had passed his former rooms in madison avenue and had seen the little swing for rent sign that the thought had come to him another fool gone into matrimony he had mused but the memory of the little for rent sign had remained he had given up peace freedomfor mar riage such a marriage yethadnt he married a city woman wellnow he knew the worstthis was the way outand now andrew knew that it was the way out he had been looking for all along suddenly andrews marriage be came no longer a sea of mediocrity of commonplaces of annoying middle class relatives it became metamor phosed into his worst suspicions if marriage had been middle class regu lar that would have been all right de cent respectable but thisno he had been fooled tricked all along he had been the victim of a gigantic plot he had been deceived into believing ethyl a sweet innocent she was what he had thought her from the first a siren a city girl a daceiver he was justified he picked up his hat from the table walked toward the door youyou city girl he said youve found your match at last you could fool me for a while but evil comes out ive been watching you waiting tonight i was near the clif ton and i remembered what id heard of its shady reputation although you

mountain fable mechanically he reached for his watch he remembered that the superintend ant of the building in madison avenue was always around until eight it was quite seven if he hurried he could

sauntered down the mountainside dropping mottled turbid wraiths of decay the air was like an old priest disrobing without embarrassment before the dark and candid gaze of night but these things brought no pause to the saucily determined squirrel his eyes were hungrily upturned to where the stars hungicily clustered nuts dotting trees of solitude he saw the stars just over the horizon and they seemed to grow on trees that he could reach so he scampered on from branch to branch wondering why the fairy nuttrees ran away from him but looking down he spied a softly wildcheeked mountain pool and there a handful of fairy nuts bit into the indigo cupping them with a squeal of weary happiness the squirrel plunged into the mountain pool and as he drowned within its soundless heart the fairy nuts were jigging over him like the unheard stirring of a poem a girls first kiss is always innocent if she is destined for a brilliant career the second will also seem so heavenly sophists by maurice lazar mrs primrose was tranquil during her husbands loosely woven and thunderously shouted tirade she was familiar with most of his characteristics having lived many years with him and his phrases were wasted on her but her familiarity could not check her sudden fright when he dragged a bulky revolver from his respectable frockcoat and shook it be fore rocketts gusty nostrils you dirty dog cried primrose who was an instructor in sociology at the university where rockett lectured on greek literature ill show you that educated people have some principles to compromise my wife this way what a scandal couldnt you have refrained from dragging me into it did you have to force me to see what was going on so callousso shame less no wonder people have been pat ronizing me they knew oh what shall i do what will become of me he shook the revolver again and kicked rocketts shins shut up he said as his wifes eyes pleaded for sympathy i want no word from you you have been very indiscreet a wife owes her husband discretion above all else he aimed another kick at rockett who was moving toward the door and delivered it with unexpected energy rocketts footsteps were accelerated the kick was repeated rockett began to run he trotted awkwardly into the hallway and then upstairs to the floor above he was pursued closely by primrose floor followed floor and soon they reached the gravel roof of the apartment building through the open door of the sky light primrose galloped with lowered head toward rockett and battered him down and sat upon his heaving abdo men they occupied this singular posi tion several moments before they could again breathe still panting rockett said this is terribly ridiculous the awesome distance from the com plicated inhabitants of the restless city to the clear specks of light in the sky reminded primrose of the microscopic quality of himself and his surroundings the quiet night made him intensely conscious of his unhappiness no he said its all very serious you have made an ass of yourself you have placed me in an embarrassing position you used to be socially inter ested in my wife but your egoism was too much for you it caught fire from the sparks of her flattery you could no longer restrain yourself your attentions to her became very obvious your conduct was insolently reckless now the three of us are undone how trivial seem the things that lead us to disaster you are a shameless fellow be gracious old man rockett pleaded this gravel pinches my back we are innocent your wife and i believe me we shared nothing other than an intellectual companion ship your wife is a good woman and an apt pupil she enjoyed my dis courses on literature ha she did not need you for that i was always ready to serve her intel lectual requirements but it is too late i shall have to divorce her dont be absurd your wife is amazingly virtuous she has been do mesticated beyond measure and is a heavenly sophists sheep for modesty you should hold yourself in debt to me please put up that gun it is a hideous thing for a man like you to be handling be grate ful to me few women have been amused as i have amused mrs prim rose consider the result she has re fined her sense of humour refined primrose shouted how high do you find yourself in the univer sal scheme i feel like killing you i really dont know what i shall do some day you will be done away with as professor corbell was you re member him he was an instructor in physiological chemistry but had more women in his classes than men i im agine the men couldnt stand him like you he was promiscuous that is not true said rockett professor corbell was never promiscu ous in his relations with women but variable he was a profound man and his knowledge of physiology may have endowed his activities with colour and grace he was familiar with the work ings of nature thats why women liked him your assumption is false and dis gusting you cant know what women think of men like corbell you could never get their views of such men i dont want their views said rockett mine are sufficiently con fusing and my back hurts please get up and talk this over sensibly you shouldnt speak of such things as wom ens views that is a very foolish gen eralization women are personal and independent in keeping with their na tures as are most men unlike you the intelligent women i have known have been naturally and unconsciously expe dient and have never offended my deli cate tastes with disquisitions on human conduct and here are you sitting on my middle poking me with a revolver which you dare not use and complain ing of my generous regard for your wife your mind is rich with miscon ceptions your complaints are vulgar they betray your ignorance of the laws of attraction by which life is incessant ly renewed its bad enough for us all that most human creatures obfuscate those laws of attraction with their moral classifications without having a fairly intelligent person like yourself to help mortify the good cause of knowl edge by laws of attraction you refer to your misconduct with my wife prim rose inquired grimly admirable you not only witness but confirm my opinion of you but why use the term misconduct and rockett sighed happily werent you kissing my wife when i came in you shouldnt have come then you should have come home later or earlier such details as the timeliness of your appearances can cause serious social upheavals you should be more con siderate of your wife but joking done with i was bidding mrs primrose goodbye you have found some other wife dont be hasty i was bidding her goodbye because she enjoyed the tales i read from the mythologies so very much that when i tried to explain their sources she became indignant she wanted her scandal without intellectual trimmingsthe misdeeds so to speak minus the moralizing instead of ap preciating my learned but interesting explanations of the development of the ancient religions and mythologies she insisted upon having more stories like the one of dercetis the assyrian god dess who reproached herself for lead ing astray a nice young man and threw herself into a lake after giving birth to semiramis when i think of it it is i who should complain not you here i go and devote my efforts toward the broadening of mrs primroses views of life and for my pains i get into trou ble of course mrs primrose was at tentive and all that but her sympa thies were unintelligent they didnt go very far it seems to me that most women are characterized by their limi tations rather than their oh dry up you are a nincompoop when it comes to sociology said prim rose and know nothing as i told you heavenly sophists before of what women think your generalizations plainly show how blind you are to the forces that govern hu man society so go right on and strengthen my contempt for you i was about to point out rockett continued calmly that most women can be classified in so far as they make the pleasures of life tolerable as witty wise ugly comely intellectual vulgar discreet and sometimes but rarely in telligent unquestionably you are a profound ass cried primrose and i can waste no more time on you first you tell me not to generalize about women and then you go ahead and do so you are a disgrace to the reputable name of so ciety and if these were the days when manslaughter was common i should unhesitatingly kill you your explana tions of your conduct with my wife or i should say misconduct are incredible now my married life is a farce i shall have to simulate an affection for my wife she wont notice the difference rockett interjected and respect her although it will be very hard for me to do by all means keep things as they were before said rockett arising painfully from the gravel the moment primrose stood up live up to your moral code for it is far more important that you remain a man of principle than that you stray enjoyably from the road of exemplary social conduct im not ashamed of my obligations to people said primrose maybe thats why im so stupid undoubtedly said rockett and being stupid i cant fathom my wifes purpose in speaking disdain fully of you she did that frequently now that i think of it then you should have become sus picious of me long before this said rockett your wife is comely lack ing practically all the other virtues she was obliged to resort to the most ob vious subterfuges it is very common for some women to deride the men whose welfare they secretly worry over i dont know whether you get my mean ing but one of the stories that mrs primrose enjoyed told the experiences of queen hippolyte wife of acastus king of iolchos who accused peleus their guest of making violent demon strations of affection for her simply be cause he had disdained her own over tures to him now dont get excited continued rockett hastily hippolyte was an aw ful sneak and had a private grievance against her husband possibly thats why she is said to have been witty well im sorry my wife wasnt sufficiently sympathetic said primrose after all the entire matter is hardly worth a second thought not even a first said rockett mrs primrose laughed just then she startled both men for they had been unaware of her presence i felt sure you would shoot him she said wistfully to her husband but i suppose im not worth killing a man for i should say not said primrose un comfortably as he handed rockett a cigar mrs primrose regarded the men with much amusement she smiled cynically i heard every word of your conver sation i followed you both and stopped at the skylightstairs did he tell the truth regarding you inquired primrose well he forgot to say that i found him not at all exciting she said primrose laughed but you agree with me dont you rockett asked mournfully come down to tea said mrs primrose you are a pair of fools the octogenarian by c farley anderson he was seated in the public square dappled with sunlight that shifted through a tree over his head and enlivened his aspect with splotches of fluctuant brightness he was very quiet very composed notion was no longer easy to him his thin hands all knuckles and tightly stretched skin grasped a thick cane his black felt hat was pulled down to shade his eyes his chin fell forward on his chest where the white beard was spread out like a handful of loose un woven silk he felt the warmth of the sun and he enjoyed the quiet of the little park these were his only sensations there was no necessity for thinking in these moments and he preferred to mental activity the calm blank of his mind after too many years of thought one tires in a vague different way he was conscious of other people in the square two shouting children ran by his bench like the passing of swift little winds a woman slowly wheeled a baby coach along the gravelled path a boy and a girl sauntered by arm in armno one gave him any notice and he required none here he could sit without dreams without troubles almost in nirvana presently the sun fell slantwise over his shoulder and no longer warmed him quite as pleasantly then he knew the afternoon was nearly gone he grasped the thick cane firmly and pressing up on it stood on his feet for a moment he was motionless as his sense of di rection was no longer acute his hesi tancy passed he walked slowly out of the park following the proper path his home was not far away but there were three corners to cross and it took him longer to finish the journey than one might have suspected the crossings were always difficult for him he was afraid of the street cars the au tomobiles even of the horsedrawn ve hicles he always made three or four trials at each cornera step off the curb a withdrawal another abortive attempt until the final courage for a dash spurred him to its accomplishment sometimes a younger person paused long enough to understand his predica ment and then to his inner relief he was piloted over the street in safety this afternoon whilst still a block away from his home the agreeable calm of the park passed as usual from his spirits and his perturbation begana vague uneasiness a vague shrinking his illdefined emotion was in a mea sure similar to that of a young boy who returns to his mother in the un etsy fear that one of his recent esca pades may have reached her ears he tried to recall all his acts that day be fore leaving for his afternoon in the square now he remembered smok ing his pipe near the front window had he by any chance left it there with the objectionable ashes blowing over the floor a few yards from the house his pace became slower and he mounted the steps at last with an increased droop to his bent shoulders there was no one on the porch and he was glad of that because a moment before he had made an unlucky discovery just as he walked up the steps slowly with some slight pain in his the octogenarian knees his downwardcast eyes had made out an unfortunate oversight before leaving that afternoon one of the rules had been infringed he still wore his old spotted trousers that would anger mabel if she saw him for some reason she was touchy about the neighbours she said he shamed her when he went out looking like a tramp what did the neighbours care about him he made his way indoors safely without meeting her and going up stairs in relief changed his trousers at once then quite tired he sat down in a rocking chair near his little win dow the last rays of the sun illumined his old face sparkled in his grey ebard like points of coloured fire and added to his aspect an appearance of venera ble vision moreover it warmed him again and he began to doze his mouth dropped open a little and a gentle snor ing sound escaped sibilantly between his lips he was awakened by the repeated petulant calling of his name the shout ascended the stairs in a womans fal setto he answered suddenly and arose with an unsteady haste he was not yet entirely awake and the room was a trifle blurred the rec tangular opening of the dark door wa vered a little but he stumbled through the hall anxious to atone now by his promptness for the annoyance he had caused he descended the stairs as fast as he could clinging to the balustrade ma bel had returned to the diningroom when he got there and was already seat ed his son jim was also at his cus tomary place cant you try to keep awake when you know its almost dinner time she said her voice was sharp irritated nearly every evening i have to scream my lungs out at youi thought you were dead this time i thought id have to come upstairs and shake you he smiled a little the customary smile of dull apology the sun made me sleepy he said then i wish youd find some other time to sit in the sun he sat down he began to eat the food they put on his plate presently jim and his wife com menced a conversation and he felt more comfortablefor a moment they had forgotten him these were the in stants of his greatest contentwhen he knew that he was ignored then the sense of his uselessness was less op pressive and his fear of a misdemeanor less intense after a time something that jim said reminded him of an old circum stance thats like old bell he broke in he lived out in warren county when he ran for the sheriff he pasted up pos ters all over the roads that said vote for bell you all know bell i went down to see how the election turned and then i met old hoss mccormackhe always snuffled a little when he talked hoss said to me snff comin to see how old bell snff made out well snff he got beat we all knew bell all right we snff knewm too well he laughed at the reminiscence the others at the table were silent mabel leaned over to her husband and raised her eyes with an imploring significance as if supplicating some higher power for a gracious deliverance these tales were so old they had been repeated so many times what a real torture to hear them day after day before dinner was quite over the bell rang it was a neighbour with whom mabel was to attend a picture show the father and son were left at the table jim removed a cigar from his pocket and began to smoke they sat in si lence the smoke drifted across the room in undulating layers rising and falling with invisible currents of the lazy air the old man pushed his plate away and sat with his hands folded on the cloth in a measurable content while in this position he experienced a pe culiar sudden dizziness for a moment the octogenarian the vision of the room passed from his eyes as if the light had been swiftly turned out his head dropped forward the swayed a little in his chair a second later he felt jims supporting arm about him whats the matter with you his son asked the dizziness was gone and the room had resumed its normal aspect he raised his hand and passed it across his eyes i i dont know he replied slowly in hesitation jim stood near him a second longer and then returning to his chair took up his cigar and puffed rapidly as if annoyed but the old man seemed to feel still the pressure of his boys supporting arm across his shoulders even though jim was assuredly sitting down smok ing as before in some way his senses were more acute and irrationally old memories came back to him he looked at jim the face of the younger man changed under his scrutiny he seemed to see him again as in other years a boy eager for stories about the war it must have been nearly a quarter of a century since he had told one of these tales true incidents of his own youthful experiences when jim was young he used to enjoy his fathers re cital of the exciting chase after mor an with hobsons cavalrythey each had forty rounds of cartridges and the fight above cincinnati when the raider was captured that was a long time ago nowthe days when jim liked these stories an irrational sense of doubt possessed the old man then for an instant he wondered if his lis tner could have been someone else o it was jim but his boy had grown older and forgotten he stood up slowly and found that he was unsually tired his legs were not quite steady and his knees pained more than ordinarily with an unsteady gait he left the room whilst the younger man remained his chair still smoking ii going upstairs he groped his way through the dark hall and found his room all the streetlamps were glow ing but there was still a streak of dull light across the sky in the west he stared out of the window his white beard was nebulous in the gloom his face seemed ghostly as before his thoughts were turning back in vague reminiscence to past years he was thinking of himself yet with the detachment of one who re calls the exploits of another personal ity the fact of his youth the events of his younger years were not quite real to him time had carried him into a different world from which the cir cumstances of that former period seemed half fabulous then ascending through the scale of his years he came to that more recent timenot over a decade agowhen jim and mabel had been married with a dull scarcely comprehended regret he remembered the months when jim and he had lived alone together he recalled jims words when the boy had confessed his intention to marry youll stay with us dad he had said we both want you youll like mabel for a short time he had really found the new arrangement agreeable it was pleasant to watch these young people their enthusiasm their affection they returned to him some measure of his own forgotten romances gave him the precious emotion of living again made lost moments come back in vivid recol lections the faces of young girls the sweet faint smells of perfumes the sounds of stiff new silk rustling with a dainty tread he did not blame them or the change that had come it was natural and he ac cepted it with the resignation his pro longed lie had taught him many times he knew he was too old many times he understood his helplessness and his burden to these others before that problem his helplessness was accentu the octogenarian ated there was no solution that he could devise hours seemed to have passed he stirred in the chair and his legs his arms his back felt intensely weary he stood upthe former giddiness re turned he clutched the bed until it passed and then undressing slowly lay down at last to fall into an uncon sciousness that went from waking to sleeping in imperceptible stages but the next morning when he opened his eyes he discovered that something had happened to him in the night he tried to sit up in bed but his body would not obey the command of his will he repeated his effort sev eral times with no success then for a time he lay very quiet wondering puzzled at last he endea voured to call out his lips moved un evenly and only a strange incompre hensible sound passed between them now he understood in a way what had happened he made no further efforts to rise or speak he waited pa tiently for mabel to come in and find him the time passed very slowly but she entered his room at last she stared at him a moment an irritable question shaping itself for utteranceand then pausing her eyes widened a little and a flush of alarm coloured her cheeks whats the matter she asked he tried to answer the curious re pulsive noise was the only result she hurried across the room and stood by the side of his bed are you in pain she asked with a supreme effort he slowly shook his head from side to side i must go and get the doctor she said can you be alone a little while longer again concentrating his will he made the attempt of physical action this time his head nodded faintly up and down she stared a second longer and then ran out of the room another period of waiting passed during which time seemed suspended he had no measure of it he closed his eyes and when he opened them the doctor was leaning over him counting his pulse beats presently the doctor and mabel left the room together and he could hear them whispering in the hall the doc tors step then receded down the stairs mabel returned he closed his eyes and a benignant calm came over his spirits his mind was growing clearer now and it seemed to him that an immediate relief from all the vague discomforts if his later years was being vouchsafed in these moments he no longer felt useless and helpless nor experienced the urge and necessity of a difficult cunning in order to avoid mabels dis pleasure these terms and conditions had passed he believed he was at the end his spirit was very calm like a longtroubled sea at a truce in the end with the winds time as before was suspended sometimes mabel was in the room sometimes jim he was indifferent they gave him food and he did his best to swallow it their anxieties their ef forts seemed very silly but he did not want to trouble them he was conscious of a number of dawns a number of nightfalls but most of the time he slept then one morning opening his eyes he was surprised to find the old sensa tions in his fingers his arms his legs as an experimental effort he raised his hand he moved the fingers about the old response to his will had returned it was astonishing and for a time al though repeating the evidence he could scarcely bring himself to credit his eyes then at last with a sigh he accept ed the new fact he was going to get well his surprise went from him one who had lived so long had come to know the sardonic waggeries of life for several hours as mabel went in and out he hesitated in revealing the evidence of his progressing recovery he knew it would disappoint her as usual he strank from displeasing her but at last trying some whispered words in private he spoke as she brought in a tray set with his luncheon the octogenarian his voice startled her and she let a dish slide off to the floor where it splintered with a musical tinkle her face became a little pale and then he saw her try to smile he was grateful to her for this demeanor in no way did she accuse him of treacherous per versity but his complete recovery was more tedious than its beginning had led him to expect in a few days he was able to sit up but to walk about was still entirely impossible he resumed his place near the window from which he could look out at the street watching the young as they hurried along the pavements he had almost lost any kinship with them even with their common humanity more than ever he felt himself to be one of another world mabel still brought his food up and now her face wore a martyred look that troubled him he always felt easier when jim came home in the eve nng each night jim sat with him for an hour or so smoking his afterdinner cigar they exchanged very few words but he felt a certain comradery with jim the nearness of his boy gave him less a sense of utter isolation he hastily comprehended that there were possibilities of sympathy with jim if the effort had been worth while he be lieved he could have understood some of the terms of jims life and have en tered vicariously into its accompany ing emotions he went no further than this the vague assurance was enough but when he was able to walk about the house again his days acquired more anxiety he was not yet allowed to go out aloneand it was very difficult to keep all the necessary rules his mem ory was bad he left his pipe lying about he forgot to change to his clean clothes at dinner time he ate with too much noise he disarranged the pages of the newspaper so that mabel after luncheon had difficulty in reading it sometimes he forgot to come down to eat after he was called to his meals the martyred looks passed into words and mabels tongue became harsh again iii it was difficult for him to take up the old life once more that is with an en tire and forgetful resignation his age had given him the habit of unques tioning acceptanceyet this time he had been so certain of an end sitting near his window looking out at the street he thought of the calm hours of only a few weeks past when the uncertainty of his future had seem ingly departed when for the first time life his opponent appeared to throw down its plainly read cards upon the table often he sighed in regret but when another week had gone by a pleasant little excitement served to temper his melancholy in a few days he would be allowed the freedom to go out alone once more sit in the park be warmed by the sun it surprised him how delightful was this prospect he regarded it as a prisoner might the opening of barred impassable doors mabel lost some of her importance and the effect of her attacks grew negligible the day came in the afternoon he took his stick as before and opening the front door went out he trembled a little as he walked down the steps the sun embraced him like a welcoming mistress one of the neighbors spoke to him and smiled he returned the greeting with a benignant nod ahead of him were the streets and in a curious indefinite manner they seemed the ways of romantic potential ities he almost felt young freshly alive at the same time he was calm troubled with none of the anxieties of youth he thought of his age and derived a new satisfaction from the knowledge of his many years i am more than eighty now he thought it is remarkable that i can still walk about and enjoy this life once again he faced the problem of the street crossings tremulously as al ways but not exactly with fear the hazard of the attempt excited him he the octogenarian was glad of his danger glad that the goal of his bench in the little park was not to be attained without these mo ments of uncertainty all the ways of danger were nego tiated without disaster and just a little ahead he saw the trees fingered by un seen breezes and swaying a little at their tops the gravelled walks the empty benches with a contented sigh he turned in at the first entrance and walking a little farther sat down in a bench with the sun at his back it was just as before women with babies boys and girls together lone disconsolate men out of work idlers children at play yet for him it was endowed with some measure of a new significance he had come back against his desire to life and now he was compensated by a deceitful and evanescent sense of charm he looked all about him saw a familiar face or two and breathed at ease presently he heard a stick tapping in the gravel he looked around and saw another old man coming along the path their eyes met they were strang ers but the comradery of their age made them suddenly smile at each other he moved a little toward the edge of the bench by this action inviting the other old man to sit down his cour tesy was accepted and the new acquain tance painfully adjusted his body to the seat its a fine day said the old man yes a fine a very fine day he agreed guess we old timers are glad for that eh we dont have any love for sloppy weather do we they smiled at each other again the octogenarian laughed briefly seen enough of sloppy weather in my time he said his new friend was immediately reminiscent the sloppiest weather he said was back in sixtytwo down in ken tuckycumberland gap bragg al ways managed to grab his share of our commissary i remember how mad old buell was with our commissariat up in cincinnati he was looking over the lists of supplies and when he bawled out well that is plenty for us but are you sure youve got enough for bragg they both laughed they looked at each other in excitement they clasped each others hands the octogenarian began to relate one of his own expe riences whilst the other listened in si lence but impatiently waiting to coun ter with another story they tapped the ground with their sticks in enjoy ment leaning close to each other like venerable conspirators contemptuous of eavesdroppers the old days returned and forgetting jim and mabel forgetting all the cir cumstances of his later years his mind went back to these hours of his youth and all their lost allure his memory recalled former hazards and it seemed natural now that once he had accepted them and achieved their necessities and come through their dangers with courage and success he was young again he lived his former dreams he saw the departed shapes of his old hopes the hours passed too swiftly and only the warning of the sun made them separate they promised to meet again the next day they shook hands affec tionately and each walked off slowly separately through the park the octogenarian scarcely saw any of the objects about him he was still fascinated by the realities of other days for realities in these moments had long since ceased to exist for him he ignored the crossings abandoning him self to their trivial dangers with re gard passing slowly through the fa miliar streets his spirit went upon dif ferent and older ways that had gone with the years a spectacle of faces passed before his eyes he recalled the days before the war his first visit to the city his first romance something of the an cient stir of this moved in his bloid once more like the stimulation of a bustle drug he smiled he nodded to the octogenarian himself his lips moved with low poken words iv reaching his street he walked its length and in the same preoccupied mood mounted the steps of his house when he went in mabel encountered him in the hall and addressed him sharply why are you so foolish she ex claimed he stopped still smiling and stared at her oh you know what i mean she said here it is the first day you are out alone and you stay so long that almost begin to think something had happened to you i dont see why you have to give me so much worry and trouble you dont seem to realize that youre not a young man any more youve got to be mighty careful im tired of worry over you her words jangled a little in his ears but he did not comprehend their mean ing nor made any effort to catch a sig nificance from her sentences he still smiled turning slowly he began to go upstairs dont sit down and go to sleep she called jimll be home any min ute now he reached the landing and passing through the hall turned in at his room walking to his chair he seated him self with a sigh he found that the exertions of the day had made him very tired sighing again with content he leaned back in the chair permitting the old remembrances their full sway once more but now they were not entirely di vorced from the present moment in termingled with the old days that loomed somehow fabulous and strong in his mind were the indignities of his later years to these he gave a smile of indulgence after all he had lived more than these othersand their con cerns were trivial they had no re sounding memories they could not un derstand a curious numbness came over his senses he was extraordinarily tired he closed his eyes he seemed to sleep when mabel called him he did not answer she screamed up the stairs he gave her no response running up in anger she entered his room his eyes were still closed and all the colour had gone from his cheeks and now the end bequeathed as its last expres sion a venerable benignancy to his old face jim called the woman jim come up here quick the evil doers by john f lord both created untold agony for the human race both sent many people to the asylums nervous wrecks both increased many fold the unpleasant ness of city life their works were dissimilar and yet alike they could not rist without each other one manufactured pianos the other pianists a jest in the household by milnes levick it was a house with an upstairs and a downstairs a stout and pompous house upon which benignant age had laid the comfortable settledness of long use it was large firm established the very symbol of unsuspecting solidity there was a front stair with balus ters of black walnut carved in showy meaninglessness and a massive newel whose capital at a touch fell rakishly askew upon the steps an unvanquished axminster still showed the grimed re mains of once intricate colors about its bare browncorded places a beetling wall rose beside the flight curving for biddingly at the head there was red dened gold in the faded brown scroll of its papering at the foot hung a steel engraving remarkable for its size in the curve above was a niche solemn as a shrine severe as a mausoleum in this dimly lighted by the red globe of the gas jet in the upper hall was a statue a terra cotta figure turned a trifle awry that repairs with chewing gum might not be seen a statue of a windblown way farer bending over his pipe about the base was lettered the last match the stairs led to this and to the red globe beyond was mystery there was also a back stairway straight and steep and without carpet this the household used by preference the intactness of the house was pre served in the manner of an elaborate virtue the weight of imperative duty lay upon the tasks of its routine an im minent devastation threatened the most trivial lapse of custom lending sanctity by an implied analogy with the ven geance of providence yet the devo tion and the vigilance of its ways were flattery flattery of william of his domination of his respectability his material stableness his ordained right eousness the superiority of his un troubled progress through an incom prehensible world and it was unflag ging for to this in its diverse manifes tations william turned daily finding in it the attestation of an absolutism unabridged amid the five females each night the door opened at his sedate and satisfied approach and closed decisively upon those phases of life in which the misguided at times drew the boon of his sorrowful reproof upon his arrival the household moved sidereally they emerged from doors decorously like the figures of a me chanical thermometer carrie aunt myrtle aunt may grandma even corinne walking thus early in the paths of guile william would smooth his fat gray mustache before according carrie the kiss of an impeccable affection and she would smile easefully though he sel dom informed her less often confided she knew his outer life to the last detail she gathered news from a tone a word a gesture with the skill of years of marriage and could tell by the shadow of an irritation what in the day had crossed william and she would give the knowledge warningly to the others her sister his grandma corinne and a jest in the household docility would permeate the house anew so too could carrie divine the hid den sources of his laughter his smiles were even more reticent than his cen sure their causes he guarded appre hensively in part in patriarchial vigi lance but more because he feared that here in the household a breath of workaday rabelaisianism would cloud the glass through which the women viewed him he looked upon them at times as beings defenseless and infe rior again as exalted but always out side the human latitude permitted to himself only his wife emerged from these limitations of chivalric pretence brought nearer to him by the unspoken significances of long companionship she was younger in spirit than he and perhaps under this belief in his dignity he felt through her an authen tication of mirth a proof more real than any met outside the house on occasion he permitted her a glimpse into the origins of his merriment there was a feeling of security in the plump comfort of his house coat which as she offered it embraced carrie in the sense of safety in the implicitness of his trust in her comprehension and her reticence he felt no need to caution after all what harm he would ask himself contemplating the jovial lib erality of his expansiveness carrie was a woman of sense his proffers of temptation had the invariability of a ritual he quaked amply in his chair hoping to tantalize her into petition and his mustache would set provokingly like a seal car rie paid no heed till in time the titilla tion of memory and the need of pass ing a good jest along wrung chuckles from him and then carrie would ask what is so funny william would tell her a trifle unctuously as if explaining a technicality to a child and while he guided his laughter into the limit of propriety carrie would pretend to be put out would look at him with the corners of her mouth re pressed and say i dont think thats at all nice and as she took herself off william subsided swaggeringly less certain now chastened beneath his jus tifying expostulation while in his in nermost heart dwelt the grateful cer tainty of her discretion there was a vitality in carrie that imposed the need to share the qual ity of youth allied her more closely to his sister than to her own as william drew from her a sense of validity so she in turn found in aunt may a nexus with youth with the free realms of hope life was not yet stagnant for may to her enjoyment of these stories she brought a candor that renewed their relish for carrie she laughed frank ly with zest for the humanness of the anecdotes carrie could not have re peated them to her own sister myrtle was too refined she said too unsophis ticated but in truth she feared the prim cold intensity of myrtle shrank from the thought of her laughter as from an unsheathed claw mays laughter came low but unfet tered like a girls carrie censorious ness still in her gait would go straight to may giving the tale with williams very pauses and inflections and her eyes would shine at the appreciation that brought light to mays eyes may was careful not to let william hear her yet her wholehearted mirth lingered with carrie giving flavor to the eve ning a warm youngness in whose re flection william himself had a share on such occasions some occult scent drew myrtle to them she loitered chattering of neighborhood doings of the church social and all the while her curiosity lay like a reproach upon aunt may poor myrtle but she shouldnt be so priggish the younger woman set her will and felt it wave under the silent querulous insistence which only spite would deny for beneath the pet tiness of perseverance there was hun ger the pathos of desire for the world a jest in the household for experiences even so faint with the great laughing forces upon which aunt myrtle had set the frown of denial and aunt may would tell her half angered at herself for being drawn so crassly into the manner of secretive ness like a youngster feeling indeed something of shame even of complic ity before the acrid asperity of myrtles disapproval of the story of william of carrie and

vision of her old opaque eyes was smiling envy but no regret a wise amused and some what sad gaze that came to her often as she sat beside the cot of corinne on such nights as this little reminiscent

giggle close your peepers now grandma would say and there was silence till her own chuckle was again answered from the small bed a ripple of sniggers evoked by no more than the shadow of mirth by the suspicion that there was fun afoot mysteriously somewhere in all the bedrooms there was un heard response chuckles filled the housethe coy chuckles of carrie the amused chuckles of aunt may the

dimly bright among fine shifting screens of eyes and voices a visible darkness that looms on the sense like light is it your wit like a coloured ball between us tossed and rolling lifted and swung and caught is it your wit or your wisdom that keeps us playing still as despair and livelier than thought criticism at a gallop by george jean nathan i the argument of the writers for the dailies that the production of a piddling play like mark reeds defunct she would and she didsimply because a star actress happened to find its leading role rich in opportunities for personal exploita tion constitutes a loud hoot at the star system is of a piece with an argu ment which would maintain that be cause one sometimes finds a fly in noodle soup the fly constitutes a blanket case against noodle soup quite con trary to being an argument against the star system the presentation of such an exceptionally poor play as that named is an argument for the star system since by virtue of the barriers of amateurish writing and technic which it assiduously interposes against the stars talent it contrives to develop that talent as talent is ever developed when confronted with handicap and challenge an actor or an actress is not developed nor is the quality of acting best to be improved by good plays it takes bad plays to school and ripen if it is true that no actor has ever failed as hamlet it is equally true that no actress has ever failed as cyprienne but where a secondrate actor or actress can pass muster in a good play helped as he or she is by the authors fertile imagination finished writing and smooth technic it takes a firstrate actor or at least an actor of firstrate potentialities to get away with an unyielding hidebound bad play and any bad play that brings out the firstrate qualities of even a secondrate actor by offering that actor at every turn the difficult defiance of an authors shortcomings surely provides a good argument in favour of a system that develops and broadens our actors whether star or nonstar to argue further as have some of the gentlemen that the star system was in this particular case responsible for the production of the aforemen tioned opiate that save for the com placency of the star actress in question it assuredly would never have been produced is even more widely to miss the mark in support whereof i offer up the fact that another producing manager to whom the manuscript was originally submitted under the title of golf planned to present the play without a star and finally gave up the notion only because the play which he was then presenting in his con tractedfor theater turned out to be an unexpected financial success and be cause no other theater at an equally low rental permitting him to make a profit on a boxoffice as low as a week was available such a piece as she would and she did is infinitely less an argu ment against the star system than an argument against certain stars who are currently part of that system not against these stars as actors but against them as judges of manu scripts for one star like faversham or ditrichstein who generally knows a good play when he reads one there are two like miss grace

perhaps not wholly fair since the chorus girl is probably not much more especially lifelike in actual life the point is that hop wood instead of photographing his characters has merely silhouetted them and then to make the silhouette pass for a lifelike picture has cut a hole in the nose inserted the tip of his forefinger through the opening and mistaken its periodic wiggle for a vraisemblant satiric grimace a skil ful writer he has of course not neg lected to write into his play some comical lines but the humour of these lines uniformly moves from the line towards the characters mouth instead of the other way round his play is as funny as a falseface and has the same affinity with nature it is a seltzer siphon filled with yangylang a slapstick coated with sugar its chorus girls make one laugh not as helen greens or w e hills chorus girls make one laugh but as james forbes and roy mccardells it is a travesty atop a travesty mr belascos pro duction of the piece will alone be re sponsible for its success miss ina claire is absurdly starred above a com pany the least of whose principals is her superior in talent iii plumbing the astonishment and en thusiasm engendered among the local hazlitts theater managers and theater patrons by booth tarkingtons wholly delightful comedy clarence we dis cern the astonishment and enthusiasm always displayed by the parties in point when there is presented to them the unaccustomed spectacle of a play by a man who knows less about writ ing plays than he knows about what our coloured friends call writing writ ing so rare in the theater is the ap pearance of a man who knows how to write and so regular the appearance of men who know merely how to write plays that the advent of the former is almost always the occasion for a generally unanalyzed jubilee when the sammie shipmans and owen davises who know all about writing criticism at a gallop plays appear in the theater a three inch review is regarded as ample by the times square diderots but let there once in a great while pop up a shaw or a st john ervine or any other man who knows little or nothing of the accepted business of playwrit ing but a great deal about writing and the excitement becomes intense the critic in fannys first play who observed ironically if its by a good author its a good play and if its by a bad author its a bad play spoke less ironically than he knew in n the worst play by a good writer there is a touch of something however fleeting that one rarely finds in even the best play by a bad writer tark ingtons up from nowhere is a very awful affaira rubecut straight from the rumpbut even so there is in it a character and a line of dialogue or two the like of which the shipmans and their east is wests and the davises and their at nine fortyfives never even at their bestreveal this lat est tarkington effort clarence is a triumph of writing over playwrit ing there is in it not a trace of the dictated stage dialogue of his jay jouncer mentioned above of r u es lis and r s and all the other stenciled platform baggage of the broadway boxoffice cagliostros but instead the sort of writing done six hundred miles from broadway out in indiana on such things as penrod and seventeen in essence the play is of a rev robert spaulding out of the pri vate secretary dressed in khaki and introduced to the household of a clare kummer in execution it is drolly phrased shrewdly underwritten fresh mocking witty and it is admirably interpreted by a company in which the leading impressions are registered by the messrs alfred lunt and john flood miss elsie mackay and young helen hayes in the piece named adam and eva by the messrs bolton and middleton we have an essay at come dy of the above tarkington feather but though middleton at least pretty well understands the mazurka of the kings tongue the joint confection lacks quality the obvious attempt here was to dovetail the suavity and politeness of clare kummer with the broader and more positively provo cative situationhumour of winchell smith but the result is largely a jerky vaudeville wherein the suavity and politeness of miss kummer are achieved in such spectacles as that of a gentleman about to write a letter shaking a foun tain pen upon the drawingroom carpet and wherein the situation humour of smith is vainly sought in such venerable espiegleries of the two aday as that of the woman who desiring to make a touch by way of preface proceeds against the male with numerous elaborately disarming kisses add to these tactics such devices as a revamping of the old so called nigger act wherein a perfectly healthy man is made suddenly to feel ill through anothers frightening chron icle of his various symptoms with incidentally the ancient lowcomedy hokum of big latin words and gar nish further with such wheezes as i think its my nerves you mean your nerve and one gets the picture iv mr cosmo hamiltons scandal a dramatization of his serial story of the same title is a mossback relish of the species favourite of the cheap sex magazines the essay of which is the laborious titillation of the servant girls sruditse by providing her piece meal with fables of constantly im minent but never quite realized rape long since meat for the pantslat this sort of thing reached its apogee six or seven years ago with the publication of such masterpieces as chambers common law elizabeth robins my little sister and johnsons salamander a trio of grand ones that gave the cuisine sororities many a jolly bounce belatedly now comes along hamilton toting all the familiar criticism at a gallop baggage including the peter pancratic heroine and the hero who nevernever lands his work following closely the models named above lacks however even the superficial glitter of cham bers the superficial character draw ing of johnson or the superficial robins sense of timeliness it is the literal whangdoodle of the oldtime garvicelibbeyclay paperback with the ritz substituted for darrel ford manor and the avenue for south aud ley street yet for all its venerable formula this breed of story even when handled with the meagre skill of a hamilton rarely fails to round up the yokels the socalled sex wave never actually passes the height of the wave merely changes to argue from the occasional failure of such a play that the public no longer cares for such plays is as i have several times in the past pointed out to argue from the occasional failure of a haberdasher that men no longer care to wear underdrawers scandal is interpreted in its two central roles by miss francine larri more and mr charles cherry the former produces the sounds of human speech by pressing the tongue against the roof of the mouth screening off the vocal chords and diverting the resultant guggles through the nasal septa the latter though given to playing any role assigned him whether it be in john gabriel borkman or a trip to chinatown precisely as if it were edward faulkner in henry arthur jones the liars fortun ately finds the role here entrusted to him so much more like faulkner than like borkman or welland strong that the mere reprojection of his estab lished interpretation permits him to pass off his performance for a satis factory one mr hamiltons second bout with the boxoffice bears the title an ex change of wives and follows the same formula as the first here the author takes the mildewed theme of elmer harris thy neighbours wife and plays of a kidney fore and aft and fashions a jakefetcher wherein the characters talk like so many cynics calendars and smirk their ways crescendo to the adultery that never takes place the authors penetratingly original philosophy and wit are summed up in the plays key speech a man must make love to his wife all the time or some other man will an englishman mr ham ilton entertains us with the spec tacle of americans addressing each other as old son and old thing his trite situations and phraseological banalities he laboriously seeks to gloss over and conceal with such hack sub terfuges as likening this situation to a similar stereotyped stage situation and as observing of that cuckooed verbal banality that it is as the newspapers say even the minimum of skill exhibited in his other play is here lacking for all the hokum of its recipe its servant girl horsepower is therefore nil the presentation is absurdly miscast in each of its roles miss margaret dale plays one of the saucy young wives with all the abandon of a grandma and miss chrystal herne the other as if it were a role in the greenwich village follies mr winant is so drolly misplaced that it is not fair to hold his expository shortcomings against him mr lee baker occupies and plays the light comedy role

by that celebrated california in dian harry leon wilson who ought to be ashamed of himselfpass ing over such art works we come to thompson buchanans civilian clothes an available satiric theme is here after a good beginning ren dered negligible through superimpos ing upon it the treatment of vaudeville farce the notion of an aristocratic young woman who succumbs to a gaudy military uniform and hostilities even tually over finds its occupant in his kuppenheimers a vastly less engross ing spectacle a notion which i seem in reverse english to have encoun tered some fifteen or twenty years ago in a magazine story concern ing an aristocratic young woman who succumbs on the romantic west ern plains to a gaily bandannad and fringepanted cowboy and back in new york finds him in evening clothes a vastly less graceful figure this notion is rich in possibilities of gentle irony of these possibilities mr buchanan has unfortunately scratched only the surface and has reduced the general maneuvering of the theme to the more or less patent gestures of palace theater hibernicism two of his passages at satiric dialogue con cerned with snobbery are as well written as certain passages in the best of his pieces the cub but in the main his derisory whackstick fails to explode its torpedo his second act for example is frank low farce which while it furthers his plot fails signally in furthering his theme vi mr scarboroughs moonlight and honeysuckle is a gawky attempt at high comedy in the attempt to achieve wit the author resorts to the college paper expedient of paraphrasing old proverbs in the attempt to achieve comedy to the triple repetition of epi sode favourite of the dull german comedies of two decades ago in the attempt to achieve philosophical view point to the stock sentimentalities of the henry arthur jones exdrama the fable of a young girl who sum mons up a fictitious digression from morality in order to get rid of certain of her less admired suitors the play misses completely the mannerful light ness essential to its proper pitch the result is an amateurish quasicomedy whose characters are so many weak distillations from lothar schmidts only a dream whose sentiment is of the far out there in arizona just the skiesand you and i species and whose humour is founded largely upon wheezes on marriage miss ruth chatterton save for an enunciation so painstakingly precise that the impression is constantly of a little girl reciting in school does well a role not worth the doing the reviews of this play by certain of my friends of the daily press were not without their element of whimsi cality led to believe from the title moonlight and honeysuckle that the play was of the pollyanna sugar sonata variety and attending it with a heavy air these reviewers were sur prised to find it other than they thought so great was their relief thereat that they promptly mistook this pleasurable surprise for a virtue in the play itself and praised the play

story called the defective published in this magazine seven years ago i shall probably have something more to say of the play in a future chapter viii the circumstance that there ap peared in the theater a person who knew more about writing english than about writing what are called plays once again contrived to dumfound and overawe the reviewers and the public in the in stance of miss zoe akins and her declassee the story of tarkington and his clarence was here repeated the consequent turgescence in the newspapers reached the old tody ham ilton mark it was wonderful to be hold the

insufficient for its enthusiasm hooched up its account of the evening with enough exclamation points to stock all of street and smiths maga zines for a year the american the herald all ran around shouting and yelling as if the jail were burning and why simply because as i have ob served this akins girl knows that for all the persuasive dan frohmandave belascocolumbia university whiffle to the contrary plays are neither built nor rewritten but written in the first place she knows that a word rightly chosen may be more dramatic than a smashed wine glass and that a grace ful phrase may be more affecting than the whole caboodle of stage brats who ever trooped down the stairs on christmas eve in their nightgowns miss akins declassee while in no sense approaching to the sterling quality of her papa is if not a play of brilliant accomplishment at least a play of brilliant intention if her play itself lacks the quality of the antece dent play it is more or less certain that her original notes for this second play did not lack that quality i learn that she wrote declassee in two weeks time the lack of editing the occasion ally harsh theatricalism and the un polished corners of the manuscript as it is currently revealed upon the em pire stage make this not entirely in credible but behind these defects one discerns many marks of the peculiar talent that made papa the best thing of its fantastic kind in the modern theater the story of an english woman of title who goes to the social dogs and presently finds herself listen ing in america to the proposal of a onetime newsboy now a great million aire to make her his mistress the play lifts when its author concerns herself with writing and falls when she con cerns herself with drama her writ ing is consistently more dramatic than her drama the former reaching its height in two passages acts ii and iii between the englishwoman and the former newsboy makes for excel lent theater the latter with its card cheating melodrama and its indig nant confrontations is the conventional de croisset stuff miss akins must not permit herself to fall into the edward sheldon tech nic with its superficial flashiness its sedulous employment of easy fetches and its literary hocuspocus she is intrinsically too able an artist of the theater to have recourse to the presti digitation of boxoffice rubber stamps any hack playmaker of broadway can impress his auditors profoundly by dropping into his play a reference to conrad a few quotations from shake speare and an allusion to velasquez and sargent and any hack can im press the american doodles with non chalant references to the queen zoe akins may better leave such hokums to her rialto rivals she has some thing they have not something they never can have she has style she has culture she has a sophistication that though she happened to be born in st louis missouri was itself born somewhere across the seas she is as unamerican as caviar she is not for the general and she owes it to herself not to try to make herself so her declassee is an interesting work it is beyond the talents of ninetynine out of one hundred amer ican theatrical writers but it is zoe akins at her deliberate second best the willa sibert cather who wrote the story scandal should have brusquely touched it up before it left miss akins hands exeunt omnes by h l mencken i one of the hardest jobs that faces an american magazine editor in this onehundredandforty fourth year of the republic is that of keeping the poets from filling his magazine with lugubrious dithyrambs to on and against somatic death of spiritual death of course not many of them ever sing most of them in fact deny its existence in plain terms they are all sure of the immortality of the soul and in particular they are absolutely sure of the immortality of their own souls and of those of their best girls the most they ever allow to the prevailing materialism of the herds that lie bogged in prose is such a benefit of the half doubt as one finds in christina rossettis when i am dead but when it comes to somatic death the plain brutal death of coroners inquests and vital statistics their optimism vanishes and try as they may they cant get around the harsh fact that on such and such a day often appallingly near each and every one of us will heave a last sigh roll his eyes sadly turn his face to the wall and then suddenly change from a proud and highly complex mammal made in the image of god into a mere inert aggregate of disintegrating col loids made in the image of a stale cabbage the inevitability of it seems to fas cinate them they write about it more than they write about anything else save love every day my desk is burdened wih their manuscripts poems in which the poet serves notice that when his time comes he will die bravely and even a bit insolently poems in which he warns his girl that he will wait for her in heaven and keep his harp in tune poems in which he asks her grandly to forget him and above all to avoid torturing her self by vain repining at his grave poems in which he directs his heirs and assigns to bury him in some lonely romantic spot where the whip poorwills sing poems in which he hints that he will not rest easily if philistines are permitted to begaud his last anchorage with couronnes des perles poems in which he speaks jauntily of making a rendezvous with death as if death were a wench poems in which but there is no need to rehearse all of the varieties if you read the strophes that are strung along the bottoms of magazine pages you are familiar with all of them even in this great moral periodical despite my own excessive watchfulness and dr nathans general theory that both death and poetry are nuisances they have appeared multitudinously no doubt to your disgust as i say it is almost impossible to keep the min nesingers off the subject when my negro flops the morning bale of poetry manuscripts upon my desk and i pull up my chair to have at them i always make a bet with myself that of the first dozen at least seven will deal with death and it is so long since i lost that i dont remember it periodically i send out a circular to all the recognized poets of the land begging them in the name of god to be less mortuary but it never does any good more i doubt that it ever will or any other sort of appeal exeunt omnes take away death and love and you would rob poets of both their liver and their lights what would remain would be little more than a vacuum for the business of poetry remember is to set up a sweet denial of the harsh facts that confront all of us to soothe us in our agonies with emollient words in brief to lie comfortingly well what is the worst curse of life answer the kinetic overstimulation called love and what is the next worst answer the fear of death no wonder the poets give so much attention to both no other foe of human peace and hap piness is onehalf so potent and hence none other offers such oppor tunities to poetry and in fact to all art a sonnet designed to ease the dread of bankruptcy even if done by a great master would be banal for that dread is itself banal and so is bankruptcy consider now another great human phobia the fear of hell there was a day when it raged in the breast of nearly every man and in that day the poets produced antidotes that were very fine poems but today only the illiterate fear hell and so there is no more production of sound poetry in that department as you may suspect i tire of read ing so much necrotic verse in manu script and wish heartily that the poets would cease to assault me with it in prose curiously enough one observes a corresponding shortage true enough the short story of com merce shows a good many murders and suicides and not less than eight times a day i am made privy to the agonies of a widower or widow who on searching the papers of his wife or her husband immediately after her or his death discovers that she or he had a lover or a mistress but i speak of serious prose not of trade balderdash go to any public library and look under death human in the card index and you will be sur prised to find how few books there are on the subject worse nearly all the few are by psychical re searchers who regard death as a mere removal from one world to another or by new thoughters who appear to believe that it is little more than a sort of illusion once seeking to find out what death was physiologi cally that is to find out just what happened when a man died i put in a solid week without result there seemed to be nothing whatever on the subject finally after much weari ness i found what i was looking for in dr george w criles man an adaptive mechanism macmillan incidentally a very solid and original work much less heard of than it ought to be crile said that death was acidosis that it was caused by the failure of the organism to maintain the alkalinity necessary to its normal functioning and in the absence of any proofs or even argu ments to the contrary i accepted his notion forthwith and have held to it ever since i thus think of death as a sort of deleterious fermentation like that which goes on in a bottle of chateau margaux when it becomes corked life is a struggle not against sin not against the money power not against malicious animal magne tism but against hydrogen ions the healthy man is one in whom those ions as they are dissociated by cellular activity are immediately fixed by alkaline bases the sick man is one in whom the process has begun to lag with the hydrogen ions getting ahead the dying man is one in whom it is all over save the charges of fraud but here i get into chemical phys ics and not only run afoul of the revelation of god but also reveal perhaps a degree of ignorance verg ing upon intellectual coma what i started out to do was to call atten tion to the only fulllength and first rate treatise on death that i have ever encountered or heard of to wit aspects of death and correlated aspects of life by dr f parkes weber hoeber a fat hefty and extremely interesting tome the fruit of truly stupendous erudition what exeunt omnes dr weber has sought to do is to bring together in one volume all that has been said or thought about death since the time of the first human records not only by poets priests and philosophers but also by painters en gravers soldiers monarchs and the populace generally the author i take it is primarily a numismatist and he apparently began his work with a collection of inscriptions on coins and medals but as it stands it covers a vastly wider area one traces in chapter after chapter the ebb and flow of human ideas upon the subject of the human attitude to the last and greatest mystery of them all the notion of it as a mere transi tion to a higher plane of life the notion of it as a benign panacea for all human suffering the notion of it as an incentive to this or that way of living the notion of it as an impene trable enigma inevitable and inex plicable few of us stop to think how much the contemplation of death has colored human thought through out the ages there have been times when it almost shut out all other con cerns there has never been a time when it has not bulked enormously in the racial consciousness well what dr weber does in his book is to detach and set forth the salient ideas that have emerged from all that consideration and discussion to isolate the chief theories of death ancient and modern pagan and chris tian scientific and mystical sound and absurd the material thus digested is apall ingly copious if the learned author had confined himself to printed books alone he would have faced a labor fit for a new hercules but in addi tion to books he has given his atten tion to prints to medals to paintings to engraved gems and to monumental inscriptions his authorities range from st john on what is to happen at the day of judgment to sir william osler to what happens upon the normal human deathbed and from socrates on the relation of death to philosophy to havelock ellis on the effects of christian ideas of death upon the medieval temperament the one field that dr weber has overlooked is that of music a somewhat serious omis sion it is hard to think of a great composer who never wrote a funeral march or a requiem or at least a sad song to some departed love even old papa haydn had moments when he ceased to be merry and let his thought turn stealthily upon the doom ahead to me at all events the slow move ment of the military symphony is the saddest of music an elegy i take it on some young fellow who went out in the incomprehensible wars of those times and got himself horribly killed in a far place the trumpet blasts to wards the end fling themselves over his hasty grave in some remote cab bage field one hears before and after them the honest weeping of his com rades into their winepots in truth the shadow of death hangs over all the music of haydn life was gay in those last days of the holy roman empire but it was also precarious if the turks were not at the gate then there was a peasant rising some where in the hinterland or a pesti lence swept the land beethoven a generation later growled at death surlily but haydn faced it like a gentleman the romantic movement brought a sentimentalization of the tragedy it became a sort of orgy whenever wagner dealt with death he treated it as if it were some sort of gaudy tournament a thing less dreadful than ecstatic consider for example the charfreitag music in parsifal death music for the most memorable death in the history of the world i doubt that one hear ing it for the first time without pre vious warning would guess that it has to do with anything of the sort on the contrary i have a notion that the average auditor would guess that it is a musical setting for some lament able hugging match between a bay exeunt omnes reuth baritone seven feet in height and a german soprano weighing at least three hundred pounds but if dr weber thus neglects music he at least gives full measure in all other departments his book runs to nearly eight hundred pages and is largely set in very fine type but i have gone through it from end to end with the utmost interest the material in the main is excellently arranged instead of presenting it chronologically the author sorts it out by content and so gives in each chap ter a brief history of the idea with which it deals now and then he falls into an error though not often on page for example he says that albert bartholomews famous monu ment aux morts in pere lachaise cemetery represents the apotheosis of earthly existence the very gateway into knowledge and eternal life a glance at the monument is sufficient to show that this is not true bar tholomew candidates for immortality have anything but an air of facing apotheosis on the contrary they are plainly eager to remain in paris one could not imagine more reluctant dying but this perhaps is pushing criticism too far dr weber is en titled to his opinions his facts are not to be disputed his book is a model of diligent scholarship i commend it to you as a curious and fascinating novelty it will entertain you more than a wagonload of novels ii one idea i do not find in it the conception of death as the last and worst of all the practical jokes played upon poor mortals by the gods that idea apparently never occurred to the greeks who thought of almost every thing but nevertheless it has a cer tain soundness the hardest thing about death is not that men die tragic ally but that most of them die ri diculously if it were possible for all of us to make our exits at great moments swiftly cleanly decorously and in fine attitudes then the experi ence would be something to face heroically and with high and beautiful words but we commonly go off in no such gorgeous poetical way instead we die in raucous prose of arteriosclerosis of diabetes of tox emia of a noisome perforation in the ileocaecal region of carcinoma of the liver the abominable acidosis of dr crile sneaks upon us gradually paralyzing the adrenals flabbergasting the thyroid crippling the poor dear old liver and throwing its fog upon the brain thus the ontogenetic process is recapitulated in reverse order and we pass into the mental obscurity of infancy and then into the blank unconsciousness of the pre natal state and finally into the con dition of undifferentiated protoplasm a man does not die quickly and bril liantly like a lightning stroke he passes out by inches hesitatingly and one may almost add gingerly it is hard to say just when he is fully dead long after his heart has ceased to beat and his lungs have ceased to swell him up with the vanity of his species there are remote and obscure parts of him that still live on quite uncon cerned about the central catastrophe dr alexis carrel has cut them out and kept them alive for months the hair keeps on growing for a long while every time another one of the corpses of barbarossa or king james i is exhumed it is found that the hair is longer than it was the last time no doubt there are many parts of the body and perhaps even whole organs which wonder what it is all about when they find that they are on the way to the crematory burn a mans mortal remains and you inevitably bum a good portion of him alive and no doubt that portion sends alarmed messages to the unconscious brain like dissected tissue under anesthesia and the resultant shock brings the deceased before the hierarchy of heaven in a state of collapse with his face white sweat bespangling his forehead and a great thirst upon him exeunt omnes it would not be spitting into the eye of reason to argue that many a cre mated sundayschool superintendent thus confronting the ultimate tribunal in the aspect of a man taken with the goods has been put down as suffering from an uneasy conscience when what actually ailed him was simply surgical shock the cosmic process is not only incurably idiotic it is also indecently unjust but here i become medicolegal and perhaps gruesome what i had in mind when i began was this that the human tendency to make death dra matic and heroic has little excuse in the facts no doubt you remember the scene in the last act of hedda gabler in which dr brack comes in with the news of lovborgs sui cide hedda a true romantic instantly pictures lovborg putting the pistol to his temple and dying instantly and magnificently when brack tells her that the shot was actu ally through the breast she is disap pointed but soon begins to romanti cise that the breast she says is also a good place there is something beautiful in this a bit later she recurs to the charming theme in the breast ah then brack tells her the plain truth in the original thus nej det traf ham i underlivet edmund gosse in his first english translation of the play made the sentence no it struck him in the abdomen in the last edition william archer makes it no in the bowels abdomen is nearer to underlivet than bowels but belly would probably render the meaning better than either what brack wants to convey to hedda is the news that lovborgs death was not romantic in the least that he went to a brothel shot himself not through the cerebrum or the heart but through the duodenum or perhaps the jejunum and is at the moment of report awaiting autopsy at the chris tiania allgemeinekrankenhaus the shock floors her but it is a shock that all of us must learn to bear men upon whom we lavish our veneration reduce it to an absurdity at the end by dying of chronic cystitis or by choking upon marshmallows or dill pickles or as the result of getting cut by dirty barbers women whom we place upon pedestals worthy of the holy saints come down at last with mastoid abscesses or die obscenely of hiccoughs and we ourselves let us not have too much hope the chances are that if we go to war eager to leap superbly at the cannons mouth well be finished on the way by an ingrowing toenail or by being run over by an army truck driven by a former greek busboy and loaded with imitation schweizer cheeses made in oneida n y and that if we die in our own beds it will be of the measles or the jimjams the aforesaid dr crile in one of his smaller books a mechanistic view of war and peace has a good deal to say about death in war and in particular about the disparity be tween the glorious and inspiring pass ing imagined by the young soldier and the messy finish that is normally in store for him he shows two pic tures of war the one ideal and the other real the former is the familiar print the spirit of with the three patriots springing grandly to the attack one of them with a neat and romantic bandage around his head apparently to judge by his liveliness to cover a wound no worse than an average bee sting the latter picture is what the movie folks call a closeup of a french soldier who was struck just below the mouth by a german one pounder shell a soldier suddenly converted into the hideous simulacrum of a cruller what one notices espe cially is the curious expression upon what remains of his face an ex pression of the utmost surprise and indignation no doubt he marched off to the front firmly convinced that if he died at all it would be at the climax of some heroic charge up to his knees in blood and with his bayo exeunt omnes net run clear through a bavarian at least four feet in diameter he imagined the clean bullet through the heart the stately last gesture the final words therese sophie olympe marie suzette julie france go to the book and see what he got dr crile whose experience of war has soured him against it argues that the best way to abolish it would be to pro hibit such romantic prints as the spirit of and substitute therefor a series of actual photographs of dead and wounded men the plan is plainly of merit but it would be expensive imagine a war getting on its legs before the conversion of the populace had become complete think of the huge herds of spychasers letter openers pacifisthounds burlesons and other such operators that it would take to track down and confiscate all those pictures even so the vulgar horror of death would remain for as ellen la motte well says in her little book the backwash of war the finish of a civilian in a luxurious hospital with trained nurses fluttering over him and his pastor whooping and heaving for him at the foot of his bed is often quite as terrible as any form of exitus witnessed in war it is in fact always an unpleasant business let the poets disguise it all they may and the theologians obscure the issue with promises of postmortem felicity beyond the desserts of any human being you or i ever met the plain truth remains that it gives one pause to reflect that on some day not far away one must yield supinely to aci dosis sink into the mental darkness of an idiot and so suffer a withdrawal from these engaging scenes no says the nurse in faded pink tripping down the corridor with a hooch of rye for the diabetic in no has just passed out which is no asks the new nurse the one whose wife wore that awful hat this afternoon but all the authorities it is pleasant to know report that the final scene is placid enough dr weber quotes many of them the dying man doesnt struggle much and he isnt much afraid as his alkalies give out he succumbs to a blest stupidity his mind fogs he throws off as if it were a tattered garment his old hot lust for life his will power vanishes he submits decently he scarcely gives a damn iii a great many novels pile up and some of them eg those by james branch cabell louis wilkinson joseph hergesheimer marjorie pat terson and rita wellman promise agreeable reading but i am at the moment suffering from a great overdose of novels and so they must wait whether the story of a lover boniliveright is a novel or an attempt at a statement of fact i cant make out it is printed anony mously and purports to be a record of the authors passionate devotion to his wife the thing is done eloquently in quick vehement tempo and it would be idle to deny the force of it as a mere piece of writing whoever did it has a fluent and often highly crafty pen it is excellent stuff but i confess to a vast impatience with the tone of it the doctrine the point of view for a man beyond forty to be daffy with love seems quite as ab surd to me as for an archbishop to die of cholera morbus i simply cannot imagine a healthy male of such years mooning away his days over one of those rich dark blondes who seem to have absorbed the light and warmth of the sun do such blondes actually exist i presume to doubt it a blonde is often brilliant but she sel dom radiates anything properly de scribable as warmth on the contrary she throws off a sort of a chill she is the eternal feminine become static she suggests not thermal ideas but purely visual ideas but every man to his own theory at the time the present author describes the blonde of his adoration they have exeunt omnes been married for fifteen years and are the parents of four children think of a husband of such experi ence raving over his wife as if she were a follies girl glimpsed for the first time as from some peak in darien think of him eating out his heart with speculations as to just how much she loves him it seems to me that such frenzies after so many years take on a smack of the ludicrous they are against nature and hence against sound art but that is all i venture to say in contempt of the book it is well planned it is original it is full of an unmistakable glow de spite everything the author convinces one that he is in earnestthat he is actually the miraculous husband he pretends to be i offer it to you as a document of uncommon quality it is unlike anything else at present on sale in the departmentstores among the remaining books the most agreeable to my taste are new rivers of the north by hulbert footner doran and white shad ows in the south seas by frederick obrien century footner is a bad novelist but here writing a simple account of a journey to the alexandra falls near the mouth of the hay river in the far northwest of canada he manages to make a capital book why any sane man should face such multi plied hardships for the banal satisfac tion of seeing a secondrate waterfall is beyond my comprehension but footner and his companion plainly en joyed the trip immensely and he gets some of that joy into his story of it let him give over his bad novels and stick to exploring the volume of obrien is even more charming he went to the marquesan islands the scene of herman melvilles typee and of paul gauguins celebrated paintings came to good terms with the natives at once settled down in their manner of life and remained a year an immoral people but lately given over to cannibalism and even now guilty of gross violations of the seventh commandment they neverthe less turned out to be simple polite hospitable intelligent cleanly and amusing very few whites live among them obrien found a few drunken frenchmen in remote valleys and on one small island there was a swiss liv ing in great state but in the main the native life is but little corrupted however the diseases of christendom have got in if christian kultur still remains outside tuberculosis is rag ing in all the islands and the popula tion is rapidly diminishing the valley of typee which swarmed with state ly savages in melvilles day is now a desert obriens account of his ad ventures is romantic and often almost lyrical he has made a book worth reading the science of eating by alfred w mccann doran runs to more than four hundred pages of flatulent bombast this mccann it appears holds himself out to be an expert in dietetics and for all i know there may be some ground for his claim but he burdens his book with the two faults of prolixity and pecksniffery he always takes a hundred words to say what might be said in eight or ten and he always announces gravely that the notions he advocates are ordained of god and that flouting them is a sin against the holy ghost another volume in the same blowsy chautau qual manner is the sober world by randolph w smith jones a maudlin plea for prohibition in which nearly all the sorrows of the world are laid to the conspiracies of german brewers literature of this sort multi plies in america our national think ing once merely superficial now fast approaches the downright idiotic the english reviewers fall upon every such book with great delight the temptation to mock the gushing yankee is too strong to be resisted what a french a german or a scandinavian critic would think of that sort of pishposh it is painful to guess fortunately
