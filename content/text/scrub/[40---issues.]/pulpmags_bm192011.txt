mask a complete mystery novelette by harold ward chapter i in accordance with the promise made to you three days ago at exactly twelve oclock today the tower on the northeast corner of your office will be blown up i have no desire to shed innocent blood and ask you to see that the vicinity is kept clear of workmen at that hour you will realise that i am under con siderable expense and must insist that you reimburse me for the time lost while waiting for you to come to my terms you will therefore add ten thousand dollars to the original sum of fifty thousand dollars asked for for each week the amount demanded is un paid three days from today at the hour of twelve noon your office will be de molished unless you grant my demands later we will discuss the question of destroying your entire factory let to days explosion be a warning to you that i do not indulge in idle threats the man in the black mask john grimes the peppery little president of the elkhorn chemical company laid the letter on the table before him removed his glasses wiped them carefully then glared at the other members of the board of direc tors seated before him that is the latest sample of what i have been getting for the past two weeks mr larson he said quietly we have postponed action until you ar rived because in my estimation the threats are so different from those of the ordinary blackmailer that they war rant a more than superficial investiga tion twaddle interrupted weather beaten old slocum the senior member of the board with an angry snort the work of a crank declared innis the company attorney suavely it is a waste of time to read his let ters grimes ignored the interruptions waiting a second for the others none of whom seemed to care to venture an opinion probably no other company in the world has guarded the interests of its employes as has this one he went on for that reason we have never had labor troubles of any kind seem ingly our workmen are all satisfied and i cannot bring myself to believe that it is one of them my fellow directors do not agree with me but i want your opinion i chewed my cigar reflectively for a second i doubt if my advice will be worth much to you until i have gone deeper into the matter mr grimes i responded remember i arrived less than an hour ago and know absolutely nothing about conditions except what you have told me as i understand it you received your first communication from this mysterious blackmailerwhat did you say he calls himself the man in the black mask answered grimes his first letter came several days the man in the black mask ago as i understand it warning you of what to expect three days ago you received a second communication de manding the sum of fifty thousand dol lars payment to be made in a manner to be designated later if you agreed you were to run up a small white flag on the flag pole if not the factory was to be slightly damaged as a proof that he is able to carry out his threats am i right so far the grayhaired president nodded i take it that you have all racked your brains thinking of some one who has been injuredor fancied himself injuredin the past that you were unsuccessful is selfevident for you have mentioned no such person that practically eliminates covering that part of the field again not having raised the white flag your mysterious enemy sends you the letter you have just read have there been any other communi cations grimes snorted letters com munications my god ive been bombarded with them this one came by mail when i awoke this morning i found one on my dresser i find them in my coat pockets and pinned to the door of my room all along the same line but shorter all typewrit ten i raised my eyebrows inquiringly it looks like collusion on the part of some one in your own home if you will pardon the insinuation have you questioned your servants the little president motioned towards the big man in uniform at the foot of the table chief backus has had them both on the carpet he responded the policeman spoke for the first time it beats me he rumbled the cooks been with him ever since mrs grimes diedtwelve years ago the chauffeur and man of all work entered his service five years ago i took no chances though and gave em both the third degree id gamble my life on it that neither of them knows a thing about the thing the only other member of the household is mrs casey mr grimes sisterand shes a semiinvalid of course theres miss joan his niecebut one might as well suspect grimes him self as a kid like her crank or no crank mr larson the man who wrote those letters is a smooth proposition or he couldnt have planted them as he did right under the noses of everybody take my advice and do as i dosuspect everybody having thus delivered himself he settled back in his chair and puffed with noisy energy at his cigar innis laughed goodhumoredly the chief really takes the matter se riously too he declared hes even stationed men around the factory en trances to keep the crowd back at the noon hour and hes placed a man at the foot of the ladder leading up to the tower to keep anyone from getting up there and planting explosives taking no chances growled backus no chance of explosives being al ready placed in the tower is there i inquired i mean a bomb of some kind that could be set off by electricity ive gone over it with a fine tooth comb slocum snarled like an angry terrior in fact he reminded me for all the world of a whitehaired snapping little spitz ill tell you its foolishness to pay any more attention to these commu nications all foolishness i say lets get down to business grimes has allowed the thing to get on his nerves he forgets that he like myself is get ting along towards his dotage ten years ago he would have thrown them into the waste basket ill not vote to the man in the black mask pay the expenses of getting this detec tive here not a cent not a single copper if grimes wants him he can have himand pay him too there was a general nodding of heads around the table decidedly the atmosphere into which i had stepped at the request of president grimes was inclined to be frigid to say the least if not openly hostile innis diplomatic and suave arose with an apologetic smile to pour oil on the troubled waters mr grimes is probably justified in his worry in that he feels a sense of responsibility as president and general manager in pro tecting the companys interests on the other hand we as directors should vote to give him a clearance if anything happensand we are all of us confi dent that nothing will president grimes shrugged his shoul ders and turned to me as if to ask my advice i would suggest that you hold off your decision for a few seconds i answered to his implied question if your mysterious blackmailer is as prompt as he claims to be we will have but a short time to wait developments in just thirty seconds it will be twelve oclock instantly the gathering was hushed the smile died on innis lips slocum looked up his lips skinned back angrily then thought better of it and merely stared at backus who shifted his big frame uneasily in his chair grimes straightened up with a jerk and gazed into vacancy there was a general scraping of feet and a nervous clearing of throats despite the tension i could scarcely suppress a smile at the appearance of one of the directors james burke a young man with a pale sallow face and an habitually apologetic manner he half arose to his feet as if almost startled out of his wits then sat down again hurriedly and wiped the beads of perspiration from his forehead i no ticed that his hand shook like an aspen leaf and he snickered hysterically clearly his was the clearest case of funk i had ever witnessed the factory whistle blew a dull muffled explosion then chaos chapter ii i awoke with a start for a second i lay quiet my mind attempting to grope back over what had happened unable to comprehend outside i could hear shouts the clanging of bells the sound of footsteps on the stairs leading to the office my head ached dully but i was otherwise uninjured the big table overturned lay across my legs push ing it off i raised myself to a sitting position for an instant my brain whirled and everything grew black be fore me then the dizziness and feeling of nausea passed away and i was able to comprehend what was happening around me plaster from the ceiling and walls covered everything the air was filled with its thin white dust the pungent odor of explosives assailed my nostrils chairs were overturned books and papers lay scattered about the floor beside me lay grimes breathing heavily innis and slocum were hud dled together across the room the lat ter bleeding from a small cut on the forehead in one corner burke the man i had marked as a coward was sit ting up sobbing crooningly to himself the victim of hysteria evidently the other members of the board sprawled here and there in various attitudes backus raised himself to one elbow and gazed about stupidly the door was burst open with a crash and the room filled with rescuersfac tory workmen their black smudgy the man in the black mask faces expressing their wonderment i pulled myself clear of the table and started mechanically to look after grimes and those who seemed most in need of attention with the bellow of a maddened bull backus drew himself to his feet and el bowing his way through the throng about the door throwing men to right and left as he charged rushed up the damaged stairway leading to the tower above a physician emerged from some where but by the time of his arrival his services were in little demand for practically all of those who had been in the room at the time of the explosion were on their feet assuring each other of their safety aside from plastering up the cut in old man slocums head there was little for him to do even the officer at the foot of the stairway lead ing to the tower had escaped uninjured although the tower itself was a wreck a girleven to my dirt filled eyes a vision of loveliness in a cool white chif fonstruggled through the crowd of men in the outside hallway and threw her arms around the aged president are you hurt are you injured uncle grimes she demanded sob bingly the little man patted the girls shoul der not by a darned sight he chuckled it was worth the bump i got to prove to slocum that im not such a darned old fool as he claims i am now dry your eyes and meet mr larsoncap tain larson my niece joanmiss marne i should say he turned to the assembled directors with a beatific smile on his wrinkled face gentlemen he said gravely al though there was a twinkle in his eyes i hereby declare this meeting ad journed until ten oclock tomorrow morningat which time we will continue our discussion of our friend the man in the black mask larson you will be my guest while in town of course with a few terse orders to the super intendent as to the repairs in and about the office he followed his niece and my self to the waiting automobile below chuckling like a youngster at slocums discomfiture chapter iii i sat at the luncheon table and gazed across the wide expanse of cloth at the girl she was an enigmaa female puzzlea woman as could easily be seen unhampered by societys conven tions unaffected yet every bit a woman she was a beautyyes a beauty judged by any kind of rule yet there was something odd strange peculiar about heran elusive something that i could not comprehend she reminded me of a person laboring under a sorrow which she was struggling to keep hidden from the world she ate little to speak of seeming preoccupied and resisting my best efforts to carry on even a casual conversation grimes on the other hand was ex traordinarily cheerful caring more to all appearances for his victory over slo cum than for the property loss the com pany had suffered mrs casey the invalid plainly a neuroticexcitable and prone to hys teriasaid little excusing herself be fore the end of the meal was reached pleading a bad case of nerves as a re sult of the trouble at the factory luncheon over grimes with all the chipperness of a youngster of twenty declared that he intended motoring back to the factory to look things over naturally i was to accompany him miss marne aroused herself from her lethargy and insisted on going with us the man in the black mask she excused herself and before we had completed our cigars she danced into the room again attired in a natty motor ing costume her abstraction gone and gay as a butterfly taking the wheel her self i took the front seat with her while grimes lolled in the rear workmen had already completed the job of cleaning away the debris in the office a truck load of gravel and a pile of bricks gave evidence that despite the threats of the mysterious blackmailer to destroy the entire plant it was grimess intention to rush repairs as rapidly as possible as we climbed out of the machine backus who had been standing in the background his round red face wearing a puzzled expression stepped forward and greeted us find anything new chief grimes demanded the big man looked about him cau tiously then motioning us to one side produced from his pocket a small thin slightly bent piece of metal he handed it to the little president without a word grimes looked at it with a puzzled expression then passed it on to me im danged if i know what it is he admitted how about you lar son i gave the bit of metal a cursory ex amination then handed it to joan i think that the chief has struck oil the first shot i replied in other words that same piece of metal is a bit of the shell that kicked down your tower where did you find it chief in the upper room just over the of fice replied the officer it wasnt there this morning for i made a per sonal inspection and locked the door my self before stationing mitchell at the foot of the stairs shell jerked grimes non sense nevertheless i reiterated your tower was blown up with some kind of a shell you cant get away from the evidence backus wagged his head sagely as he replaced the metal in his pocket i had already won him for a friend i could readily see all right well admit its a shell then for the sake of argument grimes responded that doesnt put us any closer to the solution of the puzzle on the contrary i interrupted it does it stands to reason as any one who is acquainted with explosives will tell you that the shell was of small cali bre and filled with but very little high explosive else the damage would have been greater it was fired from some where and by somebody and from some sort of gun result we have but to find where the shell came from and we have your man in the black mask by the heels as well look for a needle in a hay stack my opinion is that some sort of explosive was planted in the tower in spite of the chiefs precautions and de tonated by electricitypossibly by wire less ive heard of such things dont you think that more probable than the idea you and backus have of some won derful gun and still more wonderful marksman not at all although my experience at the front taught me that despite the high point of efficiency reached by the gunners a direct hit is only scored acci dentallyunless the range is almost point blank ill venture the assertion that the gun from which that shell was fired is located not over two miles away in fact a mile would be a closer guess backus agreed with me for despite the fact that he was only a small town policeman he was no fool the man in the black mask the wizened president grinned sar donically youll be telling me next that you can point outthe place he laughed im almost tempted to say that i can i looked around me for a second then inquired by the way where does this creek lead from backus leaned forward excitedly by ginger he ejaculated youve hit it they shot down the creek they are located in the hills south of town its me to investigate on the contrary i returned youll do nothing of the sort chief youre too well known i am a stranger here and my face is unfamiliar probably even to the leader of the mysterious band let me look over the ground first i am likely to see things that might be hidden from you its my business j to search for the hidden things but its my place larsons right interrupted grimes a stranger is much more likely to suc ceed than a person so well known as yourself but i clapped the big officer on the shoul der i know just how you feel chief but ill promise to make no move until ive informed youthat is if i find any thing suspicious you can make the ar rests and get the credit all right and good luck he answered meanwhile ill scout around hre and see what else i can pick up i suppose that youll start right away this very minute just a second grimes exclaimed for all we know there maytgte spies lurking about why not let joan and me drive you back to the house from there you can skirt the hill in a south westerly direction and come down the creek instead of going up such a move will divert suspicion youre right i answered while the chief nodded a grudging assent let us get busy at oncethat is if you are through here mr grimes the little president proved himself a man of action by calling to joan and hastily climbing back into the mahine ten minutes later we were at home do you start immediately in quired joan who up to this time had taken no part in the conversation al though she had been an interested listener as soon as i have secured my re volver from my grip she accompanied me into the house grimes preferring to wait on the ver anda stating that he would go with me a short distance to show me the gen eral lay of the land as we reached the seclusion of the hallway joan turned to me a look of worry on her sweet face please dont go she whispered lowering hevoice purposely to keep her uncle from hearing i was astonished both by her tone and the words i dont understand i returned she seemed at a loss for words ii have a feeling that you will get into trouble she finally replied laying her hand on my arm i laughed ive been doing that all my life the worst i ever got was a dose of tear gas overseas havent you got any better reason than that only a womans intuition a womans reason she smiled in other words i dont want you to gobe cause thats all i can tell yoube cause im afraid that it will have to be a better reason than that to keep me from going i laughed your uncle hired me to run this thing down im draw ing a salary from him and the quicker i earn my salt the better she shrugged her shoulders prettily the man in the black mask as if dismissing the subject and turned aside into her own apartment chapter iv to change my attire for a garb more suited to walking over the rough ground and to look over the service revolver which had been packed away in my va lise did not occupy five minutes yet as i stepped out into the hallway i saw pinned against the panel of my door a typewritten note it read cut out your investigation or you will get into trouble too many people are involved in this affair for us to take chancesso keep out of it a word to the wise isor should be sufficient the man in the black mask hastily thrusting the missive into my pocket i hurried down the stairway looking in every direction for possible spies no one was in sight yet it was clear that someone inside the house had written that warningand that the writer was in league with the man who was threatening the factoryor was the man in the black mask him self only three people besides myself knew of my contemplated plan of ac tionbackus grimes and joan backus was eliminated by the fact that he was still at the scene of the explosion this left but two who were in the secret joan and her uncle was it possible that one of them was the traitor the idea startled me it seemed absurd yet one finds some strange things when investigating crime from the big living room the door of which was partly open came the click of a typewriter i halted momentarily and looked in joan was at work at the ma chine she looked up and smiled as she saw me i imagined however that there was a slight flush upon her cheeks and that she did not look me squarely in the eyes just practicing she responded in reply to my question uncle often lets me write his letters for him here at home she invited me to enter but i ex cused myself pleading haste and joined grimes outside my head was whirling for the mo mentary halt had given me time enough to discover that the ribbon on the ma chine she was using was a peculiar shade of green the note of warning i had received had been written with a green ribbon but that was not all lying on the floor beside herwhere it had evidently fallenwas half of a sheet of note paper and the other half unless my eyes deceived me was reposing in the pocket of my coat was joan marne the mysterious man in the black mask it seemed impossible farfetchedunthinkable yet there were half a dozeh clews lead ing in her direction and her actions in attempting to dissuade me from going into the matter any farther damned her i hated to believe the evi dence yet it was piling up against her chapter v to avoid needless description and at the same time give the reader a rough outline of the general lay of the land so that he may better understand the events which follow a rough map of elkhorn and vicinity is printed on the next page as will be seen by this sketch prac tically all of the wealthier residents of elkhorn most of whom were directors and stockholders in the chemical com pany resided along this country road where the contour of the land gave them better opportunities for spacious grounds and broad lawns than did the the man in the black mask little town itself huddled as it was be tween the hills grimes home was at the extreme south end of the road which ran from the factory around the hills grimes as excited as a youngster left me at the edge of the little forest southwest of his residence after giving concise directions regarding the best method of skirting the hill to the right and reaching the creek he pleaded to be allowed to accompany me but his common sense led him to agree with me that he like backus was too well known and too i wanted to be alone to diagnose the affair in my own mind joan appealed to me as no woman had ever appealed before yet i could not drive the idea from me that every step i took was tightening the coils about her for the first time in my career as a manhunter my sympa thies were all with the criminal under ordinary circumstances the natural thing for me to do would have been to follow the right bank of the creek from the base of the hill in stead however finding my view of the factory obstructed by the small growth of trees between the base of the hill and the creek and imagining that i could secure a clearer view from the opposite the man in the black mask bank i tested the depth of the water and finding that it appeared shallow sat down and removed my shoes and stock ings then turning up my trousers to the knees i forded the stream and on the opposite bank put my shoes etc on again taking up my search from that side it was approximately two oclock when i left grimes at the edge of the forest and nearly two hours later when i found myself in the gully between the two hills just opposite the swamp in the rear of the little presidents resi dence deciding that i had gone far enough in a northeasterly direction and finding nothing of a suspicious nature on the left bank of the creek i quickly forded the stream again and set off along the right bank intending to skirt the swamp returning to the house in time to dress for dinner suddenly i noticed a suspicious movement in a clump of bushes near the edge of the wooded hill i stopped short then dropped on hands and knees intending to creep forward and inves tigate as i did so a report came from the brush and a bullet whistled past my head had i been a tenth of a second later my life would probably have paid the penalty i am not a coward by any means but neither am i inclined to be fool hardy i dislike to take human life but i was forced to defend myself i re plied to the attack by pumping half a clip of shots into the clump from which the bullet had come at the same time dodging behind a convenient tree i remained for probably ten minutes keeping a sharp lookout for my antago nist then hearing nothing more i cautiously skirted the bushes approach ing them from behind my mysterious assailant had flown i found the spot from where he had fired however as an empty cartridge testi fied while the grass was tramped flat where he had been lying close by where it had been dropped in his flight was a handkerchief scented with lavender in the corner was em broidered the letter i innis the diplomatic attorney who had objected so strenuously though courteously to my retention as an in vestigator had i had noticed at the mornings meeting kept his handker chief strongly scented with lavender an odor which is extremely repugnant to meso repugnant that i had noted it particularly chapter vi here was a puzzle why should innisfor i now felt certain that it had been the lawyer who had fired upon meobject so strongly to my presence that he felt it necessary to murder me in order to put me out of the way could he be the mysterious masked man it did not seem probable and yet i had suspected joan marnewith no more evidence against herin fact not as muchas i had against the lawyer it pleased me to think that the trail was leading in another direction anybody but joan i felt evidently the note pinned to my door had told the truth there were too manypeople mixed up in the case to take any chances the band led by the masked mystery would not stop even at murder in order to carry out their ends clearly it was up to me to move cau tiously there was something decidedly rotten in denmark something was going on of which the little president was not informed the affair rather than being as simple as i had at first believed was rapidly assuming compli cations of gigantic proportions every time i turned around i bumped into some new piece of evidence there was the man in the black mask too much of it was it being planted in order to confuse me or as i was rapidly beginning to believe were more peopleand people of prominencein volved than appeared on the surface my brain whirling i started off in the direction of the house intending to place my suspicions squarely before grimes and find out before going any farther into the case just what he knew and what he suspectedfor i was growing of the opinion that he suspect ed something strongly against some one when he took sides squarely against his directors even to the extent of paying all bills himself i had proceeded scarcely a hundred yards when apeculiar threshing about in a thicket of coarse swamp grass at tracted my attention drawing my revolver as a matter of precautionfor my previous experience had taught me a lessoni crept for ward until i could almost touch the con fused tangle with my hand a crumpled heap of blue lay face downward i sprang forward and bent over the man it was backus chief i cried a groan answered me as easily as i could i turned the big policeman over and tearing open his coat and shirt found a tiny black hole through the chest close to the heart from which the crimson was slowly gushing he was dying that i could see at half a glance who shot you i demanded backus opened his eyes weakly he attempted to raise his arm as if to point the effort caused a paroxysm of coughing yet game to the last he tried to tell me his story gotidea he muttered followed creekmet man inblackmask it was his voice ended in a gurgle and he fell back in my armsdead chapter vii stick up your handsand do it quick i turned quicklymy hands moving heavenwardto gaze into the muzzle of a viciouslooking automatic in the hands of a dapperalmost daintylittle man attired in overalls his face covered entirely by a mask of dark gauze through two slits his eyes gleamed dangerously a large felt hat covered his head beneath it peeped a fringe of lightbrown hair plainly the entire makeup was a disguise before i had time to make more than a cursory survey however the masked man spoke again there is a revolver in your right hip pocket i saw you put it there when you bent over backus turn your back to me keep your left hand in the air and remove the gun with your right move lively i did as ordered now throw the gun into the creek quick with a light splash the weapon struck the water a dozen paces away now turn to your left and go ahead and keep your hands up a walk of possibly a hundred yards brought us to the edge of the swamp in response to my captors curt com mand i again swung to the left and a moment later found myself staring into the mouth of a cave the opening being however but little larger than an ordi nary door i passed through the gloomy entrance into the darkened interior my captor following close behind there was a sharp click and a huge stone slid almost noiselessly across the opening closing it completely it was as neat a piece of camouflage as i have ever gazed uponand i viewed the work of the best artists in the world overseas in fact so cleverly was the hillside disguised that one might recognizing the man in the mask he stopped short and allowed the weapon to slide slowly through his fingers until the butt rested on the floorpage the man in the black mask pass within a dozen feet of the opening and unless he knew the secret never observe it even portholes were cut in the rock blocked by heavy pieces of stone cut to fit and removable from the inside yet so covered as to be indistin guishable to the passerby i am confi dent that had occasion demanded the fortressfor a fortress was really what it waswould have withstood any ordi nary assault except the fire of heavy guns another click and the cavern was a blaze of light from a dozen or more electric bulbs suspended from the ceil ing the floor was of clean white sand while the walls as my later observation showed were of the peculiar sandstone out of which the cave was hewed a darkfaced man asleep on an army cot in a distant corner leaped to his feet rubbing his eyes from around a pro jection in one of the walls stepped a roughlooking fellow armed with a modern rifle recognizing the man in the mask he stopped short and allowed the weapon to slide slowly through his fingers until the butt rested on the floor gating at me quizzically this the chap who was doing the snooping around guvnor he in quired one of them snapped the masked man the other islying outside in the gully did you kill him the leader snarled like an angry dog its none of your business you ought to know by this time snell that when people interfere with me they get into trouble get me sall right sall right guvnor youre boss only when you took us on you said there would be no killing in the job with a shrug of his shoulders he stepped back a pace and sat down in one of the campchairs which were scat tered about the cavern the masked man replaced his weapon in his pocket and turned to me with an almost feminine gesture towards one of the chairs at the nearby table captain larson he said easily sit down and lets talk matters over will you have a cigar he passed a box of perfectos from a nearby table i selected one to my lik ing the masked man declining how ever as i returned the box to him hang it captain he exclaimed it does me good to see you take mat ters so nicely you and i are going to get along famously it would be a pleasure to work with a man like you but of course as you realize that is an impossibility you are worth money to meall kinds of it grimes and his bunch ought to be willing to put up at least ten thousand ransom for you meanwhile will you give me your paroleyour liberty inside the cave with certain restrictions or wont you i shrugged my shoulders whats the alternative i asked your ankle chained to the wall but how do you know that ill keep my parole another chuckle from behind the mask i know you by reputation you are a man of your word give it to me and i know youll keep it honestly i hate to think of chaining you up like a wild beastbut you understand its necessary under certain conditions whats your decision i accept illgive you my word to make no attempt to escape i reserve the right however to change my de cision at any time by notifying you may i ask questions as many as you like and about what you like i wont promise to answer them all though who are you an almost silvery laugh came from behind the mask who i am cuts no the man in the black mask figure he responded what i am is different i am a man with a mission that mission is to extract money from the rich i w w or bolsheviki the man in the black mask chuckled again neither i have gathered this little band about me to carry out my ideals after all neces sary expenses are paid the remainder of the money which i extort from the rich will be divided among the poor later i will move on to some new field of endeavor there you have the story in a nutshell you will probably call me insane i am not i am an idealist but this cave merely a part of the workings of an old stone quarry i discovered it quite by accident it is large and roomy and has been made thoroughly comfortable for my men and myself i light it by tapping one of the wires leading from the power plant the power company is rich and will never miss the electricity i use we depend on it for cooking also the smoke from a fire might be tray us you know i surmise that you used some sort of silencer when you fired upon the tower merely an enlargement of the maxim attached to a one pounder i got theltgun here by express in parts as i did all of my other equipment we are prepared to withstand almost any ordinary at tack for we have several machine guns and a large quantity of ammunition food we have in plenty there is a spring of fresh water bubbling out of the ground at the other end of the cave my men are all experts although i must confess that pedro my gunner he was trained in theitalian army and is an artist in his linemiscalculated slightly and hit the tower a trifle too low really it was inexcusable for he had the range down to inches he arose and stretched himself i must leave you now captain i trust there is no necessity for reminding you again of your parole may i ask one more question certainly you spoke of holding me for ran som suppose wethat is my friends and myselfdecide to pay immediately will i then be released or held here you will be kept here until our plans are matured whether you pay now or later and in case we refuse there was no hesitation on the part of the man as he replied in a voice of icy coldness let us not talk of unpleasant things you will be killedmurdered in cold bloodas a warningthat it is not wise to fight the man in the black mask i he turned upon his heel and disap peared around a corner of the wall chapter viii as the man in the black mask left me i sat down and took an inven tory of the affair as it stood up to date as a firstclass detective i had proven myself a successwith a vengeance speaking from the standpoint of a mili tary strategist i had attained my ob jective but the devil of it was that i couldnt let loose of it now that i had it i had succeeded in running the mys terious blackmailer to his lair and he had proved to be a boomerang for the probabilities were extremely strong that i would remain there for considerable time after he had departed for there was little likelihood that the board of directors would put up any large ransom to get me out of the hole into which i had succeeded in burying myself i might succeed in raising the amount my self were i at liberty but in my present circumstances things looked hopeless was i wrong in having given my the man in the black mask parole and thus preventing myself from attempting to escape of course i could always retract it but there was a cold manner about the masked leader which led me to believe that he would not hesitate a second in carrying out his threat to chain me to the wall the min ute i did so and chained to the wall i would beworse off than i now was on the other hand i might break my word of coursebut even detectives respect their honor and i have al ways found that in the long run it pays to be square even with crim inals i was aroused from my reverie by the reentrance of the object of my thoughts he held aside the curtain which covered the entrance to the rear of the cave through which he had gone shortly before and gazed at me for a second his eyes burning brightly through the holes in his mask did i or did i not warn you not to come past this spot he asked i i shook my head in the negative then let me do so now this blanket marks the entrance to the exit of the cave proper it is what was for merly one of the tunnels leading off from the quarry scattered here and there along its length are deepalmost bottomlesswaterfilled pits into which you might stumble in the darkness a fall into one of them would mean your death aside from that i do not wish to have you prying about there are things i do not care to have you see you understand i was about to make reply but evi dently taking my silence as consent with another curt nod he turned on his heel and again disappeared down the pas sageway as he turned i heard a faint tinkle and a small object fell to the floor of the cave unobserved i waited until i could no longer hear his footfalls on the sandy floor then i sprang to my feet and picked it up it was a hairpin there was no longer any doubt in my mind as to the identity of the man in the black mask the hairpin was con clusive evidence that it was joan marne i hated to believe it but the facts were indisputable i have never considered myself a womanhater nor a susceptible ladies man i have known them of all races and breeds but nevr had one impressed me almost as one pf their own number her positionto think that she had some good reason for her strange conduct only to have the face of the dying backus flash before my eyes she had killed himshot him in cold bloodand gloated over it afterwards no try as i would i could not find a single cir cumstance in her favor i was loath to admit it but i was fall ing in love i a manhunter was in love with a murderess cursing my self the hairpin the infernal mixup yes even joani hunted up my jailors and spent the remainder of the after noon in their company trying to forget chapter ix supper was served in a little niche off from the main cave there were six men in the party not counting mysdf one serving as cook the man in the black mask not making his appear ance on only one or two occasions had he ever dined with his men they informed me although he insisted that they be served with the best during his absence the members of his party were not at all reluctant in discussing him or his affairs treating me almost as one of their own number none of them it appeared had ever viewed his face he had gathered them almost from the ends of the earth pick ing one up here another therealways the man in the black mask working through a proxyeach select ed because of his particular fitness for the job pedro for instance had studied gun nery for years johnson was a ma chine gunner travis and snell were both experts with the rifle mcginnis was pedros assistant and a gunner of extraordinary ability himself while jenkins the negro chef was known so he informed me from one end of the country to the other as the best cook in the american expeditionary forces all were men from the lower walks of lifecrooks probably thugs gun menyet strange as it may seem proud of their records as soldiers they had made good in the army then discipline relaxed they had again fallen into their evil ways the pay was good the food was excellent and to a certain extent they were satisfiedespecially with the prospect of a fight in sightbut still they grumbled they had arrived only a few weeks before coming to elkhorn in the guise of laborers they had been met at the station by an unknown man disguised they believed who had directed them where to go to find the entrance to the cave here they met the man in the black mask and received their in structions which consisted simply in obeying orders and remaining inside of the cave day and night to date they had absolutely nothing to do except eat and sleep and take turns on guard with the exception of firing the one shell which had wrecked the tower already however the work was proving irksome and like all active men cooped up for a considerable period of time they growled considerably a fact which i believed when the time was ripe i could turn to good account for i was far from being ready to tamely abide by the mysterious leaders man date that i must either buy my liberty or calmly submit to being butchered as a warning to others there was nothing in my parole which prohibited my stir ring up an agitation i decided to take the bull by the horns and create an in ternal strife as soon as opportunity offered itself by starting a mutiny i might escape with a whole skin shortly after supper travis who was better educated than the rest and who appeared to be the natural leader during the absence of the masked chieftain took me on a tour of inspec tion of their retreat the cave proper was a huge affair hewn out of the solid sandstone pos sibly five hundred feet in length by half as wide the main cavern was bril liantly lighted opening off from it were innumerable tunnels and pockets where the light was a dim twilight shading off into blackest darkness shadowy dismalan altogether fitting refuge for a modern buccaneer one of the latter was illuminated and used as a barracks another as a kitchen and a third larger than the others as a storehouse judging from the numer ous boxes piled in the interior the masked leader evidently expected his occupancy to be a long one where their mysterious chieftain kept himself none of them knew it was their belief however that he had more men stationed in some of the other tunnels and that he was planning a gigantic coup of some kindpossibly a revolutionsooner or later and for this reason prohibited their entering the other outlets to avoid having the vari ous parties meet and compare notes he appeared only at intervals coming without warning and often disappear ing for a day or two at a time they were paid however not to ask ques tions and asked none although they were perfectly willing to answer any thing that i might ask and were willing to speculate as much as myself as to the identity of their mysterious leader b mnov the man in the black mask our trip of inspection over travis and i returned to the others when sud denly the curtain which marked the en trance to the tunnel used by the masked man parted and he appeared before us he nodded curtly to me and asked me to step aside for a second larson he said jerkilyalmost nervously i thoughtthey have dis covered backus body and are raising the devil things are getting more complicated all the time what are we going to do indeed i smiled you hardly thought that as big a thing as the mur der of the chief of police would pass unnoticed did you you should have realized that before you killed him he nodded his head grimly its awfulawful he muttered then he stopped suddenly i forgot he murmured you are in no position to give advice nor i to ask it i must work out my own salva tionmine and he was about to turn away hesi tated then again addressed me larson he said you can believe me or notprobably you wontbut i did not kill backus nor was i present when he met his death would to god i had been and i might have prevented it his agitation as well as his words puzzled me i noticed that his hand was shaking as he reached out mej chanically and selected a cigar from the box which stood on the table striking a match he applied the flame to the end as he did so i made a discovery which almost brought me to my feet with a jerk by the light of the match i noticed a small scar in the palm of his hand that morning i had noticed a similar scar on the palm of john grimes presi dent of the elkhorn chemical com pany the man in the black mask was not joan marne but her uncle john grimes the man who had hired me was the traitor who had betrayed his colleaguesthe murderer of henry backus but was he a short time before he had declined a cigar with the statement that he did not smoke now he was smoking and what about the hairpin i had found the case had me baffled it was growing more complex every min ute who was the man in the black mask chapter x i spent an uneventful night with my guards travis who as i have said seemed to be in charge taking me at my word and paying no attention to me ex cept to assign me to a bunk a guard however was posted not on my account but as my jailor informed me at the orders of the man in the black mask who had insisted that a sentinel be maintained at all hours of the day and night to ward against a possible surprise this routine had been maintained ever since they had occupied the cave i slept fittle during the early part of the night however there was con stantly revolving through my mind the question of who the mysterious leader wasif he was a man there was enough evidence against innis grimes and joan to have convicted any one of them before an average jury that was the troublethere was too much evi dence the more i studied over the situa tion the more i was convinced that there was a flaw in my reasoning some where one of the three was guilty but which finally i dropped off into a troubled sleep the last thing i was conscious of being a vague remembrance of an argu the man in the black mask ment between mcginnis and snell over the game of whist in which they were engaged i awakened with a start travis was shaking me as i opened my eyes he studied my face for a second then turned away its a cinch that you aint faking he remarked faking what do you mean i asked sleep he replied laconically mc ginnis disappeared while he was on guard and the old mans going to be raising merry hell before long thought maybe you had a hand in itmight have taken advantage of my decency to you and done for him during the night ill swear that i havent left my bunk since i went to bed i exclaimed i was about to continue my explana tions when i was interrupted by a shout from the other end of the cavern travis hurried away on the run slip ping into my trousers and shoes i fol lowed as speedily as i could as i turned the corner and entered the main cavern i met jenkins the big negros face was ashen he was trembling like a man with the ague they found him he exclaimed lordy lordy hes awful the big boss am certainly gwine to raise the debbil jf where did they find him i asked in the main cavern deadern a her ringall chopped to pieces and still wailing he hurried back to the pots and pans of his kitchen as i approached the little group under the electric light the man in the black mask looked up at me bad work here larson bad work he exclaimed i am safe in presuming that you had no hand in it am i not do i look or act like a murderer i demanded angrily if you think im up to such tricks why dont you lock me up he was about to reply when travis leaped into the gap ill vouch for larson governor he answered he was sleeping like a baby when i woke him up this morning the masked man turned upon snell whats this i hear about bad blood be tween you and mcginnis last night he snapped s true govnor strue an swered the gunman we made it up though and parted good friends god almighty i wouldnt croak a pal even if i did have a chewin match with him thata right interposed pedro i watcha da scrap they forgeta their troubles an quita friends mcginnis he sleepa wit me getta up and go ona guard when travis wakea him travis he cornea t bed all th while snell he sleepa sound i stooped over and examined the dead man it was as jenkins had said he had been literally hacked to pieces even his hands and face had been cut and slashed in a hundred places his murder was not the work of an ordi nary man but a fienda maniac the masked leader scratched his cheek perplexedly its a hell of a mess larsona hell of a mess oh if i only dared take you into my confi dence if i only dared as he made the gesture my glance involuntarily strayed to his hand on the palm was the peculiar scar i had noticed the night before there was no longer any doubt in my mind the masked chieftain of the blackmailing crew was john grimes joan and the attorney were exoner ated chapter xi in order to give the reader a more corpplete understanding of the strange the man in the black mask events with which i had to deal allow me to digress for an instant and quote from my diary which was written at the time and in which i jotted down each item as it occurred in order to re fresh my memory in case i ever man aged to escape and the matter ever came to trial the man in the black mask be comes a more and more perplexing character to me every hour i wrote i am certain that he is grimes and i am growing of the opinion the longer i observe him that the weazened presi dent of the elkhorn chemical company is a veritable dr jekyll and mr hyde i cannot understand him for in stance this morning when i first ob served him standing beside the body of mcginnis he appeared nervous and overwrought his walk was that of an old man while i was kneeling down examining the body he disappeared into one of the dark gloomy tunnels mut tering to himself whether he is a drug addict or not is a question i only know that when he reappeared some fifteen or twenty minutes later he was a new man in ac tions and appearance his step was elastic and his whole manner again that of the natural leader his eyes sparkled like coals of fire through the slits in his mask and strange to re late he appeared to have forgotten the entire incident stepping up to where we were stand ing about the body he looked down at the battered remnant of what had been mcginnis and demanded gruffly of travis well what the hells happened now travis looked at him queerly then with a shrug of his broad shoulders informed him that there had been noth ing of interest transpired since he left since i left he snarled hells bells i havent been here before i ex plain yourself dont stand there and try to make a monkey out of me naturally travis as well as the rest of us was somewhat perplexed for a second he attempted to argue with his leader but met with another angry re buff seeing that he was getting no where he finallyshut up like a clam refusing to say another word in spite of the others abuse i could see too that the others were growing angry at the masked leaders churlishness to wards their comrade for travis was popular with all finally however in response to his chiefs demand he went over the entire matter again when travis had finished his tale the masked man ordered the mutilated body prepared for burial giving his loudvoiced commands in so callous a manner that even the casehardened renegades under his commandthugs and dregs of humanity though they are were shocked well plant him outside after dark tonight he ended he was no good anyway then giving a number of sharp orders to his piratical crew he asked me to walk a short distance down the cave with him have you got any theories as to who might have killed him he de manded youre a detective and chanced to be on the ground as it were at the time of the killing show me that youre worth your salt deliver the murderer to me and ill reduce your ransom a thousand id like to see one of you highpriced detectives at work i shook my head and with a sneer ing remark regarding my ability he turned the subject by informing me that the body of backus had been taken away and hell was to pay itll teach them that im not the sort of man to be played with he chuckled tomorrow ill give them another sur the man in the black mask prise when pedro knocks a second chunk off the factory with his one pounder perhaps by that time they will awake to the fact that i mean business if they dont kick in ill knock the devil out of things the next time i debated with myself for a second then taking the bull by the horns i turned upon him suddenly why this masquerading mr grimes i asked what was your idea in getting me here on this case only to capture me and keep me a prisoner i am a poor man and you know it i can not pay the ransom you demand and why are you robbing your colleagues and yourself i got no further for he interrupted me by bursting into laughter grimes grimes he chortled you think that i am old man grimes by the almighty thats good and still laughing to himself he disappeared behind the curtain but that is not all the affair is growing more puzzling every minute i am more convinced than ever that he is insaneor a drug fiend for hardly had he disappeared before he returned his entire manner changed his body shaking nervously once more he was the feeble old manor the hysterical woman without a word he strode across the cave to the bruised and muti lated body of mcginnis and stood for a second looking down at it his shoulders hunched his entire attitude that of great sorrow and dejection then he turned on his heel and walked away as he disappeared behind the cur tain i will swear that i heard him sob bing yes crying like a woman and what is more i am certain that i heard him murmur as he went down the pas sageway murder murder a second mur der first baekus and now this poor misguided creature great god in heaven will it never end can this be the man who not ten minutes before brutally jested as he looked upon the cold dead clay that had done his bidding it is beyond me chapter xii shortly after writing the above i talked the matter over with travis he concurred with me fully that some thing was strangely amiss with the man he however did not agree with me that the masked leader was a drug addict being more of the opinion that he was insane he stated that he as well as the others had noticed other eccentricities on the part of their chief but never so marked as on the occasion just re ferred to the day passed uneventfully my guards whiling the time away playing cards smoking and sleeping there was nothing else for them to do and like myself the time hung heavily on their hands meanwhile i seized upon this as a good time to spread my seeds of discord using the masked mans pe culiarities as a basis on which to work they said little but i could see that the seed was not sown on unfertile ground for never is a man so ripe for dissen tion and mutiny as when his mind is unoccupied in this the masked mys tery showed the one big mistake in his leadershiphe did not give his men enough work it was his achilles heel my sole salvation if i was to save my own skinand i seized upon it the man in the black mask failed to show himself until shortly after dusk when just as we had completed our supper he suddenly made his appear ance and brusquely ordered johnson and snell to dig a shallow grave on the hillside they were about to comply when he turned upon jenkins who was whetting a carving knife preparatory to cutting some bacon for breakfast the man in the black mask jenkins he snapped what did you knife mac for no lying tell me the truth the big negro dropped his work sud denly his face taking on a grayish tinge the perspiration came out on his forehead in great beads he shook like a leaf the cigarette he was smoking dropping from his thick lips fo de lord sah i didnt do it he responded the leaders eyes glistened through the slits in his mask as he took a step closer to the colored man he remind ed me of a snake about to strike i could see the mens faces grow tense yet so strong was his command over them that not a word was spoken you lie damn you he snarled at the negro iye been doing a little in vestigating ive found the place where he was killedyour tracks are there in the sand i know that they are yours for ive compared them with measure ments let me tell you something you skunk he went on shaking his finger under the blacks nose you attempted to sneak up the passageway last night in an effort to find where i went to you disobeyed orders in so doing you wanted to turn states evidence if oc casion ever demanded mcginnis saw you and followed he was an honest maneven if he was a crook he over took you and accused you of trying to spy on me you turned on him and in the fight which followed you went after him with your razor when you had him down you finished him with your knife he was unarmed and stood no show its all written there in the sand as plainly as if id seen you do it before he could continue the big black was upon him knife upraised bellowing like a maniac the masked mans gun was out in an instant spit ting lead in a stream but not soon enough to stop the negros mad rush the knife plunged half a dozen times despite the fact that the frenzied black was mortally wounded we who had dodged out of range of the bullets leaped forward as the two men fell to the ground togetherbut too late bleeding from half a dozen wounds the masked man dragged himself to his feet and before we could interfere he placed his gun against the head of his late antagonist and pulled the trigger splattering out the negros brains then he hurled the weapon aside and with a ghastly attempt at raillery mur mured he got me damn him he got me the plays over the curtains about to drop larson you win after all with a convulsive shudder he fell across the body of the man he had killed and who had in turn killed him chapter xiii came another surprise for with a shrill piercing scream the masked mans double appeared from around the corner of a projecting rock and throw ing his arms about the neck of the dead man sobbed like a little child we were petrified with astonishment and at the same instant from the tunnel behind the curtain emerged a similar form he dashed into the group then as he saw his two doubles he stepped back too astonished for the instant for utterance my god is she dead he whis pered huskily he jerked the mask from his face and disclosed the wrinkled visage of president john grimes quick men he snapped for her sakefor the sake of joanill save you scatter down the tunnels hide yourselves somewhere any where theyre comingthe officers some one has betrayed you the cave is surrounded the man in the black mask before he could continue there came a glad scream from the masked man who was bending over the dead leader and joan marne her mask falling from her face threw her arms about her uncles neck sobbing with happi ness hands up all of you from every direction armed men poured into the cave surrounding us menacing us with their guns taking us all prisoners and at their head was the man who had given the terse com mandinnis the company attorney the man i had suspected of being the man in the black mask himself he stepped over to me and seized me by the hand congratulations larson he said burke got your letter but we had already paid over the money how ever well probably be able to recover it for i see that our masked mystery is dead and its probably hidden about the cave somewhere how in the world did you smuggle the note out and why didnt you send it to grimes or me instead of a whitelivered calf like burke the mere fact that you sent the warning to him scared him half out of his wits its a wonder he gave it to me at allthe sneaking little coward burkeletter i muttered dazedly why i sent no letter to burke or any one else ive been held a prisoner here ever since yesterday afternoon ive had no opportunity to send a letter to any one both grimes and the attorney crowd ed up to me but he said you did grimes chattered excitedly bless my soul if it hasnt got me puzzled you and me both answered innis but at any rate our masked black mailer has been laid low lets un mask him and see what he looks like stepping over to the dead man he jerked the mask from his face and dis closed the features now cold in death of jimmy burke the coward chapter xiv that night with the assistance of innis who was acting as states at torney during the absence of his part ner i succeeded in clearing up the mys tery joan and grimes accompanied us to burkes residence where among the papers hidden away in his desk we found the diary which not only showed the part he had played but implicated the cook at the grimes home as well as his various accomplices at the cave that burke was insane there is no doubt in my mind although innis dis agrees with me according to the story set forth in his diary he conceived the idea of blackmailing the chemical com pany of which he was a director fully a year before he commenced the operations which resulted in his death in many ways the man was an anomaly with the physique of a wo man he possessed the heart of a lion and the ambition of a napoleon raised a pampered and petted child of wealthy parents never allowed to mingle with other children of his age he saturated himself with literature of the blood and thunder type enjoying in his older years that which he was de prived of during his youth while wandering through the hills back of his residence he chanced upon the opening to the tunnel which led into the cave covered by weeds and under brush it had long since been forgotten even by the older residents of the place following the tunnel he finally emerged into the cave his explora tions showed him that it had not been entered for years leading from the cavern like the spokes of a wheel were unnumerable other tunnels crossing and recrossing each other making a perfect labyrinth the man in the black mask for the original workers in the stone quarrysome half a century before had followed only the peculiar veinlike formation through the sandstone instead of blasting out the entire hole as would be done in these modern times of high priced labor in every particular he had in his dis cussion with me told me the truth he did not need the money and actually according to his diary expected to rob his colleagues and himself only to turn the money over to the poor his prin cipal idea according to the story he left behind was to satisfy his longing for excitement he had laid his plans care fully even to the extent of bribing poor mrs mcgrady grimes motherly old cook into bombarding her employer with the notes he had written his piratical crew of gangsters he had recruited as travis had told me through a crooked employment agency and had assembled them just as they had said he had secured his weapons from a new york concern and shipped them by express as automobile parts the enlargement of the silencer for the one pounder was his own idea he was in every particular an odd character filled with good and evil and love of romance he was in many re spects a boy who would not grow up yet what to my mind shows his mental condition was his betrayal of his confederates for following the find ing of backus body the board of di rectors had capitulated despite the pro tests of grimes who suddenly became panicstricken on joans account as i will explain later and had hoisted the white flag and acting under instructions telephoned from what was afterwards discovered to have been a tapped wire near his residence had left the package of money on a stump close to the tunnel entrance the money in his possession he had deliberately telephoned to innis and grimesusing his own namegiving up to them the secret of the hidden en trance and telling them that i had writ ten him a hasty note with the instruc tions evidently he had not been able to re sist the temptation however of visiting his hidden cavern for the last time trusting on his ability to get away be fore the raid that he was an actor of extraordinary power was demonstrated by his ability to assume the two charac tersthe role of coward before his fel low board members and the gruff sharptoned leader in front of his men the money in the original package in which he had received it we found tucked away in the library safe that following his unsuccessful at tempt to murder me he had deliberately planned to implicate innis by planting the lavenderscented initialed handker chief was described in detail in the little book which he had so faithfully kept he had hated innis for years he confessed because of a boyish quarrel he felt that innis had wronged him and looking at the world from the warped standpoint he had assumed had never forgiven as a result of my testimony his con federates were given prison terms i being able to prove conclusively that they were accessories both before and after the fact of both the murder of the chief of police and the scheme to blackmail the factory and thus passed into history one of the strangest criminal characters i have ever met in my long career as a criminal investigator jimmy burke the man in the black mask chapter xv sitting in the parlor of the grimes home joan and grimes confessed to innis and myself the parts they had played in the strange affair the man in the black mask grimes had accidentally discovered the entrance to the tunnel shortly after leav ing me on the afternoon of my capture entering it he found a short distance from its mouth the cache where burke kept his various disguises just as he was about to leave to announce his dis covery he heard footsteps and hiding behind a fallen rock saw joan enter and donning one of the outfits strike boldly towards the cavern too astonished for utterance grimes hastened away laboring under the be lief that joan was herself the man in the black mask she had always been a romantic young woman and the old man feared that she had at last given way to her inclination later watching his opportunity he had made several visits to the cavern as for joans part in the affairit was purely accidental like all wo men she imagined that she possessed detective ability and because of grimes odd actions due to worry she had formed the conclusion that he was in financial straits and was himself the mysterious blackmailer as a child she had played in the old tunnel she remembered it now and shrewdly deduced it as the entrance to the hidingplace of the man in the black mask following backus dis covery of the shell fragment and my remark about the shot being fired down the creek she had attempted to dis suade me from entering into the case because of her fear that i would un mask her uncle this led her also to imitate the notes which had by means of the bribed cook been sent to grimes and to write and pin the counterfeit on my door there is nothing more to write she and grimes working at cross purposes suspecting each other created the mixup which puzzled me so greatly in the cave oddly enough they never chanced to meet nor to encounter burke because of the numerous tunnels through which they entered after leaving the main one chapter xvi my work was finished my fee had been paid i was ready to go back and yet i lingered at the invitation of john grimes for something stronger than the desire for a vacation held me in elkhorn yet after a week had passed i felt that i was no closer to my hearts de sire than i had been the first day i met her i felt too that i owed it to my self and my work to get back i announced my decision to joan one evening as we stood under the moon close to the vinecovered arbor she looked up at me her great eyes wist fully pathetic her soft hand resting on my arm and whispered as she had whispered on that eventful day when first we met dont goplease t smiled as i demanded her reason for asking me to remain it was the samea womans reason alwaysthe one little word because i felt the indefinable warmth and fragrance from her i saw the faint blush that swept over her face then my arms were around herand the reader must guess the rest my wife swears that she forced me to propose i am president and general manager of the elkhorn chemical company now president grimes resigned six months ago his work he says kept him from giving proper care and at tention to a certain redheaded young ster whom we have named jimmy burke larson for we owe our happiness to the man who brought us togetherthe man in the black mask then how the coroner leaned far over the desk to ask the question do you account for the undeniable fact that your fingerprints are on the handle of the daggerpage the unbelievable by j b hawley i during his world tour under taken at the behest and at the expense of the chinese govern ment song kee found much to admire in this country for ex ample he was impressed by a multi tude of our ways and customs and he frankly admitted their superiority over the chinese equivalent or substitute of much that is distinctly american in one respect however he contended that america was deficient in comparison with his own country this was in the detection of crime the occidental detective he stated one night in his precise smoothly spoken english is quite competent to deal with crime of the ordinary variety it is when he approaches the unusual the delicately subtle that he is lost and his inability he went on to handle successfully the extraordinary crime is due for the most part i think to his inability to believe in the unbe lievable police commissioner oglethorpe who was one of the half dozen men lounging in the smoking room of the travelers smiled it would seem to me he said and his voice was mildly sarcastic that de tection of crime depends less upon the detectives powers of belief than upon his powers of observation and his abil ity to uncover facts song kee shrugged his shoulders facts my dear commissioner he replied are the bane of your western civilization you are a very young peo ple it will be several centuries before you learn that facts are not necessarily truths had i a secret i would hide it not under a bushel of liesbut un der a bushel of facts the commissioner turned away yet judges and juries have an odd predilection for facts he murmured which they too often mistake as sign posts towards t ruth was song kees parting shot it was some weeks later that new york was startled by the murder of irene grenville she was an actress who had attained an unusual prominence partly because of her real histrionic abil ity and partly because of the strange tales of her private life which circulated throughout the city always there had been stories about her even in her early days when she had played small parts in an uptown stock company whispers about her wild ness and depravity had crept to the ears of those who knew her as she climbed higher on the professional ladder the whispers had become louder and reached a greater audience when at last she reached stardom she was known from the battery to the bronx as the wicked est woman on broadway that street popularly supposed to be a cesspool of iniquity now she had been found dead in the public hall of the hotel she had called home a knife had been thrust into her lovely bosom and all new york clam ored to know the identity of her mur derer the essential facts brought out at the coroners inquest were as follows sophie mallory a chambermaid in the the unbelievable ralston hotel where the deceased had lived stated that at sevenfifteen on the night of the murder she had been stand ing at one end of the public hallway on the fourth floor she was occupied at the time with the sorting of soiled linen pre paratory to sending it downstairs to the laundry she had seen miss grenville leave her rooms closing the door of her sittingroom which was near the end of the hall where the deponent was working the actress walked rapidly down the hall toward the elevator question by the coronerexcept for yourself was the deceased alone in the hall witnessno sir a man was com ing toward her from the other end of the hall questionhow far apart were they when you last saw them witnessabout five or six feet apart sir questionat that time had the man reached or passed the deceased witnessneither sir question by the foreman of the jurydid you recognize the man witness no sir not then the chambermaid went on with her story this was to the effect that she had resumed her task of sorting the linen turning her back on the hall where miss grenville and the man were walk ing but hardly had she turned and started her work before she had been startled by a shriek of agony terror stricken she had turned back to the hall there she saw the deceased lying on the floor the man was bending over her she had run to them and found miss grenville deadstabbed through the heart and the man bending over the body she had recognized as mr george grover a young man who had a suite on the floor above question did mr grover say any thing to you witnessno sir not to me direct ly sir but he kept repeating over and over good god shes dead shes dead sophie mallory was excused the next witness was detective sergeant de laney of the branch detective bureau delaney spoke in the calm unemotion al tone of a man to whom giving testi mony in court is an ordinary occurrence he stated that he had gone to the rals ton hotel on the night of the murder in response to a telephone call from the management he had found irene grenville dead she had been stabbed through the heart the dagger was still sticking in the body among the people gathered around the dead wom an he had spoken to sophie mallory and to george grover after he had heard the chambermaids story he had arrested grover on suspicion and besides he volunteered the man looked like he had done the trick he was white and shaking like a leaf further he testified that with the per mission of the coroner he had removed from the body of the deceased the fatal dagger and taken it to headquarters to be examined for fingerprints questionwere there fingerprints on the dagger witnessthere were questioncan you state whose witnessi can they were the fin gerprints of george grover the next witness was marie thibault an excitable frenchwoman who for many years had been maid to miss gren ville all that she had to tell was that george grover had been acquainted with her mistress and that there had been some bad feeling between them i cannot say what was the matter she said all i know is that the last time monsieur brought madmoiselle home from the theatre madmoiselle she say to me marie nevaire let me see that crazy man some more a hush fell over the courtroom when the unbelievable accompanied by a uniformed policeman george grover entered he was a young man of rather pleasing demeanor care fully but quietly dressed in normal circumstances he would have passed any where without causing remark now his face was pale and his eyes gleamed with a feverish excitement his suppressed emotion gave to his not distinctive fea tures an expression interesting and at the same time provocative of sympathy as he took the witness stand a woman in the rear of the courtroom cried out faintly he gave his testimony in a quiet sub dued manner speaking without emphasis or intonation like a man talking in his sleep after answering the usual formal questions as to name address and occu pation which last he gave as student of oriental languages he said that on the night of miss grenvilles rnurder he had gone down the stairs from the fifth floor to the fourth of the hotel to keep an appointment he had had in the apart ment of mr sito okawa an attache of the japanese embassy mr okawa had promised to lend him a book on certain japanese myths yes he had seen miss grenville arid had bowed to her what happened then the coroner asked i passed her the coroner smiled incredulously you passed her yes i passed her i had just taken a step or two when she cried out before i could turn she had fallen to the floor she was dead the coroner hesitated a moment re garding grover steadily before he asked his next question did you touch the dagger with which she was stabbed grover shuddered i did not he stated in the most im pressive tone he had used thus far then how the coroner leaned far over the desk to ask the question do you account for the undeniable fact that your fingerprints are on the handle of the dagger with bated breath the occupants of the courtroom awaited his reply it came in a low despairing voice i cannot account for it the witness answered the coroner leaned back in his chair when he spoke again it was almost in differently as though he were asking the question as a matter of form had you and the deceased quar reled the witness shook his head quarreled no he answered once i ventured to suggest to miss grenville that she was ruining herself by the kind of life she was leading she resented what she called my interference and told me that she did not want to see me again slowly almost languidly he left the witness stand one more witness remained to be ex amined this was the mr sito okawa with whom grover claimed to have had an appointment he was a short dapper japanese of the extremely intelligent type suave polite to the verge of the ridiculous after bowing low to the court and to the jury he took the witness stand he stated that on the night of the murder he had indeed had an appointment with mr grover to the best of his belief however the time when they were to have met in his rooms had been eight fifteen rather than sevenfifteen then the coroner sent the jury to their deliberations these did not con sume a great deal of time in less than five minutes the twelve men were back in their places the foreman ready to recite their verdict it was what everyone had expected irene grenville had come to her death from the blow of a dagger driven into her heart by one george grover whom they recommended should the unbelievable lie held to await action by the grand jury two days later the grand jury indict ed the unfortunate young man he was taken to the tombs to await trial and after a week or sonew york forgot all about him being concerned with matters of newer and greater importance the baseball season openedand a quite scandalous performance the work of a degenerate french playwright was be ing run at one of the largest theatres ii song kees participation in the gren ville murder case came about in a singu lar manner one night as he entered his club for dinner after an afternoon un profitably spent in investigating the ad ministration of the citys poorlaws the doorman told him that a visitor was awaiting him in the ladies room a visitor for me song kee in quired lifting his eyebrows yes sir a lady sir song kee turned slowly and entered the ladies room there standing be fore the onyx fireplace of which every member of the travelers is justly proud stood a woman she was young hand somely gowned and beautiful her love liness was not of the gorgeous riotous sort which startles one into instant ad miration but gentle modest like the beauty of a wildflower appealing not to the many but to the appreciative few song kee bowed low before her you wish to see me madam he asked with smiling courtesy are you mr song kee the wo man put her query in a voice of amazing fulness and depth at your service madam again song kee bowed almost to the floor the woman stood silent before him she seemed on the verge of speech but hesitated as though in search of adequate words then mr kee i am in frightful trouble ii have come to you to ask your help my help madam why i i know she interrrupted you do not even know who i am still she paused i am sylvia granger i was engaged she threw her head up proud ly i still am engaged to marry mr george grover song kees brow puckered into a puz zled frown the woman looked at him in amaze ment surely she said incredulously you must have heard of mr grover he is accused of the murder of miss gren ville a look of comprehension dawned in song kees face ah yes he said the actress in the hotel ralston i read of the case in the newspapers a wave of emotion swept over the woman oh mr kee she cried he didnt do it he couldnt have i dont care what they sayhe couldnt have she brushed her hand across her fore head swaying backward song kee sprang forward and helped her into a chair now miss ganger he said gently after a moment during which she had regained her selfcontrol please tell me as calmly as you can why you have come to me and what it is that you wish me to do the woman looked him full in the eyes i want you to help me to prove george grover innocent she said and then she hurried on as though to fore stall any possible refusal from song kee do you remember some weeks ago here in this club you and mr ogle thorpe had a discussion about the detec tion of crime you stated your belief she brushed her hand across her forehead swaying backwardpage the unbelievable in the superiority of the methods olyour own people my brother happened to overhear the conversation he repeated it to me and i am here mr kee to beg to implore you to use those methods in which you believe to investigate this frightful crime which has drawn into its net someone whom i hold dear you her voice was tremulous with despair you are my last hope for a little song kee remained silent staring contemplatively at the floor then he rose and began to pace the room miss granger he said at last paus ing before the woman whose eyes did not falter beneath his steady gaze in china men are taught to respect certain things as sacred one of these is the faith of a good woman i respect your faith in your fiances innocence i am inclined to do my small best to help you justify it but tell me what it is that makes you so sure of mr grovers in nocence as i recall the evidence brought out at the inquest it was strongly against him with the chinamans words a gleam of hope had come to sylvia granger she leaned forward eagerly i have no facts to justify my faith mr kee she said but i have what is worth innumerable factsmy knowl edge of the man i love you have said or implied that i am a good woman i believei hope i am but this i know i know that in my heart no man were he ever so clever could have reached the place george grover holds were he ca pable of imagining let alone committing the dastardly crime of which my fiance is accused song kee had listened carefully to her when she had finished he resumed his pacing to and fro stopping from time to time before her and gazing down at her with unseeing eyes he paused at last with the manner of one who has ar rived at a decision sylvia granger breathed you will help me it was more a prayer than a question song kee wrenched himself away from the thoughts which had absorbed him yes he said i will help you but do not expect too much all that i can do is to promise that i will look into this case as thoroughly as my poor abilities will permit sylvia granger sprang to her feet thank you thank you she cried and whether you succeed or whether you fail to save george please know that you will always have my gratitude and my friendship which should be more than enough reward for any man song kee said smiling as he bowed her out of the room iii the man who left his rooms on a side street off madison avenue was a far different song kee from the quietly dressed wellpoised man of the world who had promised help to sylvia gran ger at the traveler an hour or so earlier his clothes his linen his hata brown derby with an exceedingly curly brim were of the fashion of broadway rather than of fifth avenue his shoes were of a gorgeous tan contrasting gaily with pale lavender socks and in keeping with his clothes the man himself had changed the dignity which ordinarily characterized his man ner and expression was gone in its place was a sort of childishly goodna tured meekness not unattractive but in a way almost ridiculous he hurried westward until he had crossed eighth avenue midway in the block he paused before the doorway of thebranch detective bureau he looked up at the lighted windows and smiled to himself not long ago when his study of american customs and methods had led to an examination of the police system he had been a familiar the unbelievable and not unpopular figure in and around the old brownstone building often since then he had looked back with pleasure to the nights spent in the back room where the boys gathered and passed the time in spinning yarns of their experi ences a moment later song kee entered that back room he was greeted clamorous ly by its occupants laughing and jok ing he crossed to the table where a big man sat his chair tilted back against the wall his hat pulled forward over his eyes hello mr delaney song kee said in purring goodnatured tones the big man looked up well doggone it if it aint a ching aling hows your soul you yeller heathen whady want around here song kee took the mans rough greet ing in good part what do i want he laughed maybe i want to hear mr delaney tell about the grenville murder delaney glanced at him suspiciously say whats your interest in the grenville case he asked belligerently oh nothing much i just promised a friend id look into it delaney spat disgustedly well youll be wastin your time the case is an open and shut thing grovers the guy and we got him thats all there is about that i thought perhaps song kee be gan aw fergit it delaney interrupted the grenville dame was croaked and grover done it he was caught with the goods wasnt he didnt the cham bermaid see him well according to the papers she didnt actually see him stab the woman naw but she seen him near the woman just before she was stabbed and thats enough for me besides didnt we find his fingerprints on the dagger and he himself says he never touched it after it was in the woman then he must have touched it before mustnt he song kee shook his head meditatively ii suspose so he said still delaney pushed back his chair vio lently aw say you you make me sick always buttin in where you aint wanted you he paused then his manner changed say he went on some of the boys around here think im sore on you be cause of that little mess we had awhile ago now just to show em the kind of guy i am ill make you a proposition if you think you can get anythin out of this here grenville case ive missed go to it go as far as you like and ill help you song kees mild eyes gleamed with excitement you mean that mr delaney i said it didnt i song kee pulled up a chair and for a quarter of an hour the two men talked in whispers song kee speaking quickly and excitedly delaney listening and making replies in the tolerant manner one uses toward a child then they got up and left the building they took the subway downtown to headquarters where on delaneys au thority song kee was permitted to ex amine the dagger throught the agency of which irene grenville had met her death it was an oddly shaped weapon with a long handle roughly carved tapering toward the blade there was no guard dividing handle and blade the blade was of an unusual narrowness shaped like an enlarged bodkin very sharp at the point duller at the sides with delaney standing impatiently by song kee favored the deadly instru ment with a long examination twice he laid it back on the table and turned away from it but something about it seemed b mnov the unbelievable to fascinate him and he returned to it at last he drew a small rule from his pocket and measured it with great exact ness noting down the measurements on the back of an envelope upon which at the same time he made a most detailed drawing then he said to delaney is there any proof that this dagger belonged to grover not as i know of we didnt bother about that the fingerprints were enough for us what did he say about it aw of course he denied ever seein the thing before yes he would do that song kee said he picked up the dagger again hold ing it by the blade the end of the handle thus pointed at the detective i wonder he said why there should be all those little notches along the top of the handle delaney glanced at the weapon indif ferently why shouldnt there be aint it carved all over yes but song kee stopped and smiled at the detective maybe im just imagining things mr delaney he said leading the way from the room before the doorway of police head quarters song kee paused delaney he said did you find any motive for the killing of this grenville woman either by groveror by anyone else delaney puffed at a cigar he had just fired well i figure it this way grover was in love with the dame and he was what i call a onewomanguy but the onewomanoneman stuff didnt go with irene anything that wore pants and packed a wad of bills looked good to her grover got sore andwoof delaney made an expressive gesture but grover said fergit it kid i know what grover said r but well and delaney winked broadly the next day song kee devoted to the curious pursuit of reading old news papers f from publication office to publica tion office he went going through the files of the morning and evening dailies he himself could not have told exactly for what he was searching but he kept on looking and toward nightfall in a journal noted for its news of the theatri cal world he found an item which in trigued him surreptitiously he cut it from the paper and preserving it care fully in his pocketbook quietly hurried away he journeyed uptown to his rooms for a long time he sat motionless by the window staring unseeingly into the street his face was as devoid of ex pression as that of a wooden indian only his eyes were alive and they shone with a lively interest and an intense con centration suddenly an exclamation broke from his lips he jumped to his feet and with the quickness of thought changed into a dinner jacket and left he took a taxi to the ralston hotel and sent up his card to mr sito okawa after a few moments wait he was asked to ascend to the apartment of the jap anese attache he found the room to which he was admitted in some disorder open suit cases were on the floor a halfpacked english kitbag stood on a chair against which leaned a strapped bundle of um brellas and canes in the centre stood okawa in an embroidered jacket smok ing as he directed his valet in the busi ness of packing he came forward to greet song kee there ensued an exchange of cour tesies in which only two orientals could seriously indulge then my business mr okawa song the unbelievable kee said is of small importancea question about a mr grover whomi believe you knew sito okawa made a gesture of sad ness ah that poor young man he said in tone of deepest melancholy you believe him guilty then of the killing of this dancing woman i okawa shrugged his shoulders i believe nothing really how should i all i know is what the papers print ed about the unfortunate affair but your question my dear friend quite so song kee answered briskly it is about the appointment he is said to have had with you on the night of the murder are you quite sure it was for eightfifteen rather than seven fifteen as he has stated okawa contemplated the end of his cigarette consideringly sure mr song kee he said at length how can we be sure of any thing in this most remarkable world still i have the distinct impression that the hour set for our meeting was eight fifteen when did you make this appoint ment that same day at luncheon song kee sighed deeply the poor fellow he said im afraid there is nothing one can do for him i have tried but he sighed again then he pulled himself together and extended his hand it is most good of you to have re ceived me so kindly i will relieve you now of my troublesome presence as i can see that you are busy he pointed to the halfcompleted packing you are leaving town tomorrow or the next day okawa replied my duties at the legation will require my presence in washington and i prepare for the possibility of a sudden start song kee made his adieux he bowed low and still lower backing toward the door in his passage he stumbled against the bundle of umbrellas and canes lean ing against the chair and knocked them with a clatter to the floor his apologies for his awkwardness were absurdly profuse he picked up the things he had knocked down and stood fingering them nervously while he called himself several kinds of a clumsy ungainly fool okawa smilingly waved the apologies aside and relieving him of the bundle ac companied him to the door song kee looked out into the hall it was just here in front of this door that the tragedy occurred was it not he asked okawa shook his heaid no my friend a few feet further toward the elevator therejust beneath that electric globe song kee advanced to the spot in dicated slowly okawa followed him the chinaman stood silent for a mo ment so he said finally the dancing wo man was about here going in the direc tion of the elevator and mr grover came along about here okawa turned around so that he faced song kee the litle chinaman seemed to have forgotten okawas presence his eyes traveled slowly as though measuring distance down the hall they stopped at a point on the wall perhaps twenty feet away then he smiled contentedly as one quite satisfied with the progress of events a discreet cough from okawa brought him to himself he turned and again thanking the japanese for his courtesy hurried off down the hall at the desk downstairs he drew the clerk aside and presented a card bearing delaneys name and a request to the hotel management to give the bearer the unbelievable what assistance he might require tell me he said who occupied the room four doors down the hall from mr okawa on the night miss grenville was killed the clerk consulted the guests list that will be room fourthirtyeight the room was empty that night he an nounced and when rooms are empty are they left unlocked as a rule no but the maids are sometimes careless we cannot watch all the time and the room opposite song kee asked lets see that is count angellottis bedroom thank you song kee said as he turned away it was a smiling and somewhat excited song kee who stood at the entrance of the hotel and consulted his watch he hurried to a little chinese restau rant on fourth avenue where he in dulged in strange dishes with stranger names never printed on a chinese american menu then he dashed into the subway and was borne swiftly southward he came to the surface of the bridge he journeyed north on park row until it changed into the bowery then he turned into a side street leading through a ravine of illkept tenements toward the east river at a house not far from the corner he stopped he descended into the basement and knocked vigorously on a black greasy door a minute or so later the door was opened ever so slightly and from out of the darkness gleamed a pair of slanting eyes song kee said a few words in a southern chinese dialect and was ad mitted to the house take me to your most respected mas ter he said in the same tongue his guide led him along an evil smell ing hall up a flight of rickety stairs end ing in a sheet metal door with a key which dangled at his waist the guide opened the door and drew aside for song kee to pass the room song kee entered seemed only an antechamber to still another apartment it was empty but through a door at the rear could be heard the sound of many voices wait here the guide said with great respect and i will call my master he disappeared into the inner room returning shortly with another china man he was a man of many years whose emaciated frame was accentuated by the long plumcolored robe which hung in loose rich folds from his shoul ders when he recognized his visitor he bowed almost to the floor you do my poor house great honor he said in a thin quavering voice song kee drew near and spoke in low peremptory tones the aged chinaman bowed again then he turned to the servant go he ordered to the barbarian they name the rat and say to him that i would borrow the tools of his trade for an evening fifteen minutes later song kee left the house carrying in his pocket a ring of strangely shaped keys he returned to the ralston hotel this time he did not enter through the main doorway which faced the avenue but through a lesser entrance on the side street unconcernedly he strolled through the corridors until he reached a stairway leading to the upper floors when he was quite certain that he was unnoticed by any of the hotel employees he ran quickly up this stairway until it curved around the elevator shaft and he was free from observation then he made his way more slowly until he reached the fourth floor down the hallway in which irene grenville had been killed he moved cau the unbelievable tiously until he reached a certain door way a great sigh of relief came through his parted lips as looking up he saw that the transom was dark as quickly as though he were a profession al thief he drew the ring of oddly shaped keys from his pocket and tried them one by one until the lock beneath his hand turned softly as though stealing into a chamber of death he stole into the room his errand within took him no more than five or perhaps ten minutes to com plete then as silently and as cau tiously as he had entered he withdrew relocking the door behind him but he did not come away empty banded under his loose coat he clung firmly to something holding it eagerly as though it were of great value to him not caring now whether or not he were seen he walked boldly down the hall and waited for the elevator which a moment later bore him to the main corridor below now his hurry and excitement were over what he had set out to do he had accomplished leisurely he turned his steps homeward at a corner drug store he stopped and spent a few moments telephoning a half hour later he was in bed sleeping as quietly as a tired child iv the next morning at eleven oclock five people were gathered in police commissioner oglethorpes office at headquarters awaiting the coming of song kee the commissioner himself sat at his desk going through his morn ings mail detective sergeant delaney stood beside the window looking down into centre street and talked in subdued whispers to a representative from the district attorneys office in a far cor ner sat sylvia granger beside her fiance grover they did not talk but just sat there hand in hand waiting expec tantly at five minutes after the hour song kee was ushered into the room he was immaculately garbed in morning coat striped trousers and patent leather boots in one hand he carried a silk hat in the latest mode in the other a cane when delaney saw him he gasped in dress and manner he was so different from the little chinaman who used to lounge in the backroom of thebranch de tective bureau tolerated for his good nature and his generosity in the matter of fairly good cigars his surprise was changed to awe when he saw the commissioner rise and greet the chinaman with the respect one shows to an equal song kee bowed low to miss granger and the commissioner he greeted de laney with a genial wave of the hand then he hung his hat on the commis sioners rack and leaned his cane care fully against it these details attended to he seated himself comfortably in the centre of the room i must apologize for keeping you all waiting he said but my taxi was de layeda little argument between my driver and one of your excellent traffic policemen but now that i am here we can proceed at once with the matter in hand you are all here he continued at my request be assured i would not have sent for you had the affair not been urgent i have done three things proved the validity of certain statements i once made to you mr oglethorpe given miss granger the help she asked for and taken advantage of mr dela neys offer to go to it if i thought i could discover anything he had over looked in the grenville murder case a half suppressed snort from delaney interrupted him he turned yes mr delaney he said gently i have found several little things which you overlookedone of which is the real murderer of irene grenville the unbelievable sylvia granger started from her chair thenthen she began but words failed her and she sank back beside grover her eyes fixed doubtfully upon the chinaman miss granger song kee said smil ing across the room mr grover is as innocent as you or i of the grenville womans death in a few moments i think i shall be able to convince these gentlemen of that fact well youll have to go some young man the rather officious assistant dis trict attorney put in the evidence we have would be enough to convict the commissioner himself song kee laughed if wrongly applied he paused i can see that you like mr delaney have been taken in by facts and as i told mr oglethorpe once when we dis cussed these matters facts are not al ways signposts to the truth the clever criminal will conceal his crime beneath misleading facts rather than lies in this case the criminal chose to create facts pointing to the guilt of another and to use a phrase of your delightful slang you fell for it aw fer the love of mike get on this fromdelaney sotto voce song kee overheard him very well mr delaney i will get on he turned to the commissioner mr oglethorpe you will recall that my complaint about the occidental de tective concerned his inability to believe in the unbelievable that applied in this case mr delaney here who by the way is an efficient man was convinced beyond the shadow of a doubt that mr grover was guilty of the murder of irene grenville he was taken in by the facts presentedthe almost eyewitness to the actthe fingerprints on the dag ger when i suggested to him that per haps another might have killed the danc ing woman he laughed at me the idea was beyond belief and as such he would not believe in it delaney clenched his unlighted cigaf more firmly between his teeth and mut tered yes and id like to see the guy that could now ill admit song kee contin ued paying no attention to the interrup tion that mr delaney did not have the incentive that i had to believe in the unbelievable he had not had the plea sure of meeting miss granger nor had he drawn inspiration from her faith in her fiances innocence so but to go on i started to work from the point of view that the accused man was innocent therefore someone else must have committed the crime but who to find that out was my task and at the outset i was very much at sea i went to see my friend mr delaney but he could do little to help me his opinion you see waswell prejudiced however through his kindness i found out the names and all there was to know about the occupants of the rooms on the floor where the dancing woman had lived then this information was of little use one and all they were beyond suspicion then mr delaney brought me down here and showed me the fatal dagger here was something interesting and it seemed to me important could i but see it it was a queer knifevery long with a straight handle running into a needle shaped blade and there was something else peculiar about it the top of the handle was carved with little notches and they were not in keeping with the carving on the rest of the han dle also they were newly cut why i could not answerthen song kee paused his audience was silent tensely eagerly waiting for him to continue my next clue i found iii the files of one of your daily papers he went on the unbelievable i knew of no other place to seek the identity of someone who might desire miss grenvilles death but i reasoned that in some column of stage and broad way gossip i might find something to put me on the track i did it was only a tiny paragraph but it gave the reason why someonesomeone i knew of might kill the dancing woman it merely related the return to his own country of a young foreigner whom she had ruined in honor as well as in pocketbook this young foreigner came of a family that holds its honor very dear and by a strange coincidence the young mans brother had an apartment on the same floor with the woman who had dragged in the mud the honor of his family say you dont mean the dago count angellotti delaney shouted song kee held up his hand patience he said well come to that later in china he resumed we have a saying to the effect that truth grows out of thought and concentration i applied it in my rooms i gave myself over to meditation i had found someone who might have desired the death of the dancing woman if i could discover a way in which he could have killed her i might be making progress and after a little i did discover a way from out of the realm of my subconscious mind there flashed an idea what if the gren ville woman had not been stabbed at all but shot what if the instrument were not a daggerbut an arrow then i remembered that the people from whom the foreigner was sprung had been the worlds greatest archers since the tenth century also i remembered the freshly cut notches on the handle of the knifenotches which might be used to catch in the string of a bow he stopped and glanced around the room the impression he had made on his hearers was one that would have satisfied an actor most avid for attention oglethorpe and the assistant district attorney were listening intently syl via granger and her lover whose hand she still held were leaning forward their eyes glowing with excitement even delaney the skeptic had dropped his pose of indifference song kee continued my next step was to visit the scene of the crime to discoverwell if the thing could have been done as i had imagined and incidentally i paid my respects to mr sito okawa a most courteous gentleman that visit was productive of several things one was the knowledge of exactly where the dancing woman had been when she was killed and standing where she had been i saw the place from which an arrow could have been shot mr delaney had given me the approximate angle at which the knife had been driven into the body and this angle correspond ed to that which would have obtained had the woman been killed by an arrow shot through the open transom of a room twentyfive feet down the hall i left mr okawa and questioned the clerk of the hotel he told me that on the night of the murder the room in question had been unoccupied the room opposite was the bedroom of count angellotti then it was the dago you suspect ed delaney again broke out song kee smiled softly upon the now thoroughly excited detective he seemed about to answer him then he changed his mind and said will you pass me my cane mr delaney mr grover he said when delaney had handed him the cane have you ever seen this cane before he held out the bamboo stick grover started in surprise the seem ing irrelevance of the question dazed him for an instant then he looked closely at the cane why yes i think so he said hesi the unbelievable tatingly then yes yes i remember its but song kee stopped him sh he said quickly would you mind writing the name of its owner on that slip of paper on the desk beside you as grover obeyed he went on now gentlemen i must confess to a slight infraction of your laws the next thing i did was to provide myself with some skeleton keys armed with these i again visited the fourth floor of the ralston hotel in the room i un lawfully entered i found that for which i searched i found the bow that had driven the arrow into irene grenvilles breast he answered the question in their eyes you are wondering what i did with it i brought it here it is hjre he held out the cane look with a deft movement he pulled at the handle it came out of the bamboo stick and the handle was the hilt of a long evilly shaped knife the blade of which had been hidden in the hollow of the bamboo this he said in explanation is the arrow which brought death to the dancing woman through the kindness of mr delaney i was able to borrow it this morning and this he bent the long stick of bamboo is the bow string it with a piece of cord beyond the joints at either end and you have a deadly and effective weapon wait a minutewait a minute de laney shouted i beg your pardon mr commissioner but lets get this thing straight dye mean to say mister song kee that some guy who had it in for the grenville woman hid in the vacant room and potted her when she went down the hall exactly pretty fishy but we wont say nothin about that maybe though you wont mind tellin me if this cock and bull story of yours is true how grovers fingerprints come to be on the knife song kee smiled patiently how did your own get there minethey never were there song kee smiled again but less pa tiently listen mr delaney just a few moments ago i asked you to pass me my cane you did so giving it to me by the handle now providing someone who touched it after you wearing gloves and touching it only at its very end had pulled it from its sheath and using it as an arrow had shot it into a body whose fingerprints would then be on it he laughed outright at the expression on delaneys face i dont blame you he said for your surprise we are dealing in this case with a nr who was very subtlea man who manufactured not lies but facts to cover his crime one must marvel at him patiently he waited and studied the habits of the woman he had come to kill he found that she in variably left her apartments on her way to the theatre promptly at sevenfifteen he arranged that someone should be in the hall at that time on the night he in tended to murder her he even ar ranged that the fingerprints of that per son should be upon the weapon he was to use this he contrived by the very simple method which i have just now used to convince the skeptical mr de laney read mr grover the name of the murderer on the slip of paper you are holding in your hand in a trembling voice grover read the name he had written in compliance with song kees request that the identity of the owner of the cane be set down on paper rather than spoken sito okawa the unbelievable now tell us when and where you last saw mr okawas cane in the restaurant at luncheon on the day of the murder it was the occa sion upon which we made the appoint ment to meet in his rooms that night he was leaving without it when he remembered it and as i was nearer to it than he he asked me to hand it to him which you didand left your finger prints on the handle song kee rose and bowed like a show man finished with his exhibition at once everyone in the room began to talk plying him with questions the jangling of the telephone brought a tardy silence commissioner oglethorpe an swered it yes good god go on go on he left a jfote read it oglethorpe hung up the receiver with a bang he turned to his companions and said gravely sito okawa killed himself in the ralston hotel last night a note was found beside his body saying that he had killed irene grenville to avenge the dishonored name of his family everyone except song kee and de laney stared fixedly at the commission er delaney was watching the china man who was standing unmoved and unperturbed looking out of the win dow say mr song kee the detective said grimly what did you have to do with this last song kee shrugged perhaps nothingperhaps every thing he answered i dont know last night when i went to his room i left a message it was to the effect that it would be unfitting that the person of one of the samurai be held in bondage and punished by foreigners even in the enforcement of their laws it may be that he understood your friends here are trying to get me to admit ive been picking pockets lately and its not sopage the georgetown

noise in the distance rockland at you rockland this is marshal mcalpin at george town gimme prosecutor thornton or the sheriff right away hells apop pin down here theys bin a murder committed mebbe two hurry up now soon the marshal had the prosecutor on the wire and hastily disjointedly chopped out the facts as he knew them ill be right down thornton told him somewhat excited himself ill bring the sheriff and the coroner with me an hour and a half later a machine bearing four men came whirling into georgetown a great cloud of august dust eddying behind it the machine stopped and thornton alighted before the store and soft drink parlor con ducted by herman matthews wheres marshal mcalpin he in quired of herman over on the commons a block down and a block toward the right the prosecutor himself a young man dr garter the coroner bull dog dorgan a friend of thornton in years gone by now a chicago de tective who was visiting his people at rockland and sheriff perry con tinued on till they found a cluster of men marshal mcalpin saw them coming and with his best official decorum or dered the crowd back the county au thorities stepped into the circle and saw the body of a man about thirty lying on the ground who is he marshal the prose cutor asked harley mr thornton george har ley the marshal told him clerk of the lewis commercial bank the marshal seemed to place emphasis upon the lewis commercial bank as though it was an institution of which he and all georgetown were proud examine him please dr carter the prosecutor instructed now mar shal mcalpin tell what you know about it and who is the other person that might have been murdered the marshal told them that harrison j lewis president of the bank was the other supposed victim his body was at his home but marshal mcal pin could give them little information as to either case all he knew was that harleys body had been discovered on the common at dawn just as they now saw it no one had seen it placed there and there had not been a shot or a cry or an unusual sound during the night so far as he could learn no one had thought to look for tracks and the dust was now disturbed and mr lewis body had been found in his automobile at his home the georgetown mystery what do you find doctor thorn ton turned to the coroner a slight abrasion at the base of the skull was the answer thats all ex ternally i think his death was caused by a broken neck other than that i can discover nothing wrong thornton ordered the body taken to the village undertakers and the party was moving away when a youth came running and announced that the com mercial bank had been robbed john jacobsen the cashier had just opened up and found five thousand dollars missing money which had recently been deposited by farmers who had sold their wheat things are happening around here whistled the prosecutor come on well stop at the bank on the way to the lewis home at the bank everything was in or der mr jacobsen told the investiga tors he had found the doors locked as always the nontime locking safe closed as it had been every morning and papers and books undisturbed but on opening the safe he discovered that five thousand dollars was missing a search in the bank revealed noth ing a search outside revealed nothing there were no fingerprints to be seen on the safe as dorgan for one deter mined the person who opened it evi dently had exercised the greatest pre caution there was not even a track in the road that might have indicated a machine had been near the bank during the night did harley have a key to the bank thornton asked mr jacobsen yes he did always had one but you didnt find the money on his body did you no but we will look again did you find a pair of gloves of any kind a robber might have worn in open ing the safe mr jacobsen dorgan wanted to know no sir everything was left just as you see it when i found that the money was gone i cant imagine whats happened well i cant either thornton ad mitted he turned to leave the bank then stopped let me talk to you in private mr jacobsen and with the middleaged cashier a man of faultless habits he went into what had been mr lewis private office they were closeted half an hour dont believe he is guilty or knows anything about the robbery or the deaths thornton confided to dr carter sheriff perry and dorgan as they walked back to the undertakers however i guess it would be best to question him further later on they did not find the money on har ley neither did they find a pair of gloves they found the bank key but thornton said that proved nothing they went on to the lewis home the most pretentious of any in the town of a thousand people mrs lewis was reclining upon a divan weeping and hysterical she told them mr lewis was in his machine in front of the ga rage they went to the rear and there saw the corpse of the middleaged banker and leading business man of the community at the steering wheel of his car his arms clasped around the wheel and his head resting upon them as if he had fallen asleep dr carter made another examina tion there were no marks to indicate the banker had been the victim of foul play dr carter announced that he believed he died of heart disease when the four men returned to the house mrs lewis attended by an anx ious neighbor woman disposed them in chairs and returned to the diyan would you tell us mrs lewis what you know about this unfortunate occurrence the prosecutor began al the georgetown mystery most diffidently i suppose you know that the clerk of the bank also was found dead she nodded her head lips quivering i realize it is a painful situation mrs lewis and i will tie brief where was mr lewis last night in the car he leftleft yesterday afternoon for winton she sobbed he told me he had business to look after there and and might be gone for the night at this dorgan concentrated his steel blue eyes on mrs lewis she must have felt the intent scrutiny for she suddenly looked toward him as she did he perceived that she was a good looking woman and could not be the age of her husband there was a mo mentary alarm in her manner which however fled as quickly as it had come she took hold of herself and instead of being frightened and wary soon burst into a fresh fit of weeping there was such an air of abject misery about her that even dorgan seemed to be so moved that the glint in his eyes softened he did not tell you what his busi ness was thornton was saying no mr lewis nevnever told me about his business affairs try to be calm mrs lewis the prosecutor counseled we will not bother you long did you hear mr lewis return in the night or this morn ing no i slept soundly all night and did not know he washe was dead un til i got up this morning tell us about the discovery well i had arranged for a man to come today to mow the lawn she went on more concertedly the opportunity to tell what she knew apparently easing her mind dugganjohn duggan i had just come down to the kitchen i do not have steady help and there was no one in the house but me i was get ting a bite for breakfast making toast and putting the coffee on when mr duggan came running and told me the machine was standing in the drive and mr lewis was leaning over the wheel he didnt know he was dead but he thought there was something strange about it ii went out with him and and tried to arouse mr lewis but but i could not then i came back to the house and mr duggan went for marshal mcalpin iioh its aw ful awful she gave way to her grief again the prosecutor waited for her to re gain control of herself before he pur sued his questioning have you any idea of what might have become of the money or caused mr harleys death no was mr lewis afflicted with heart trouble did he show any symptoms grow weak or faint yes yes he had one or two attacks once in the bank he almost collapsed mr jacobsen knows about that well not bother you much longer mrs lewis theres just one thing more do you object to the body being held for a few days before burial per haps a postmortem may throw a little light on the case no i have no objections thank you ill do my best to clear this up two mysterious deaths here it is very unusual goodday the party tiptoed from the house prosecutor thornton said he was glad that was over as they walked away he asked dor gan what he thought of the situation jim merely replied he didnt know what to think it was obvious he did not wish to express an opinion so publicly back at the bank thornton inquired of mr jacobsen concerning harleys antecedents and was informed by the cashier that he knew little of harleys history in fact almost nothing mr lewis had engaged him in cleveland the georgetown mystery he believed although he couldnot be certain harley had talked of many places he had been without attaching himself to any one particularly he had come to georgetown a little more than a year ago and had always been on good terms with his employer mr jacobsen declared he was a very lik able and upright young man and re sented any inference from the prosecu tor that he might have been responsible for the disappearance of the five thou sand dollars do you suppose he might have had friends in another citycleveland for instancewho helped him rob the bank dorgan pressed ah no mr jacobsen replied dis missing the thought he could not have done it no certainly not well boys thornton said when they left the bank the second time the case resolves itself into this was har ley murdered and who got the money evidently as dr carter says lewis died of heart disease in his car he was getting well beyond fifty and thats very probable but something very un usual must have happened to harley to break his neck and the money of course did not walk away from the bank unassisted what caused harleys death and who took the moneythats for us to find out whats the answer dorgan jim flung up his hands in meaning less gesture after visiting the house where har ley had roomed and where they found the landlady in sincere mourning at harleys death the party returned to rockland ii well mr sphinx what do you make of it thornton wanted to know when he was alone with dorgan that evening in his office has there been a murder committed or two murders what in your opinion should be the course of the commonwealth the bulldog did not answer at once but stood looking out over the public square of rockland where the autos were massed we have cars nowadays where we used to have horses and buggies and hitchracks he said irrelevantly yes bill answered but we have people down here as always the same people with pretty much the same habits and beliefs and prejudices and loves and longings yes i guess so human nature does not change a great deal regardless of the advance of civilization does it no but whats that got to do with georgetown i dont know bill perhaps noth ing what do you think thornton sat staring at him and seemed to interpret his thoughts youre wrong jim he declared suddenly youre wrong well perhaps i am but that an cient situationan old husband a young wife and a young man why the man who would overlook that angle of this case would be a fool an abso lute fool bill an absolute fool how old do you say she is jim a little over thirty do i miss it far no i guess not i recall that she married him five or six years ago and she could not have been very old then shes just two or three years younger than you and i what were the circumstancesthe reason if i might put it that way no particular reason to my knowl edge probably because she had no other offer of marriage jim such things do happen you know thats probably true plain sort of woman isnt she the georgetown mystery yes plain too plain jim to bear out what youre hinting at thats my idea why i know her as i know ev ery one else in the county perhaps a little better than some and i know she has been very dutiful her nature to be so its rather ridiculous dorgan to jump at conclusions like that pre posterous a church worker the as sociated charities of the village the personification of kindness no jim it could not be but you do not intend to take it for granted do you bill youre surely going to investigate her thoroughly if i may offer a suggestion id keep the coroners verdict open for a while and and put her through a severe exami nation thornton thrummed his desk with a letter opener his face flushed look here jim he said shaking the instrument at dorgan with the man ner he might use in addressing a jury ive a little sense of human nature as well as you you have worked among people where that sort of thing exists it does not exist in this county it does not i tell you well thats the chivalrous way of looking at it ive got some sense of human na ture as i said thornton continued his eyes narrowing and i insist that i know an honest and decent woman when i see one i did not indicate it today but i have known helen lewis for a great many years we once went to school together down in the country before i met you that girl was whole some a romping opensouled sort of person that woman is wholesome and decent today but bill it is the wholesome wo man that often turns out to be the most unwholesome shes forced to it the lack of attention drives her to seek at tention havent i seen it proven scores of times i wasnt born yesterday there was a recalcitrant note in his voice yes thats the fine professional way of looking at it but its the brutal cold way too why dorgan id as soon cut off that little finger as to con sider such a thing seriously what do we know to indicate such an amour as you insinuate getting down to brass tacks what evidence have we got that such an affair ever existed none absolutely none they were never seen together and harley very very seldom was at the lewis home jacobsen told me privately he knew that neither had been farther away from georgetown than rockland within the year why man theres not a scintilla of fact to back you up dorgan laughed softly very well my dear sir thornton flung at him but perhaps you can ex plain the disappearance of the money on your hypothesis possibly the five thousand had an affinity oh i wont quarrel about it bill of course i cannot explain at this stage how the money disappeared but somebody who had a key to the bank and knew the safe combination must have got it thats almost a foregone conclusion yes but where did it go three persons had keys to the bankharley jacobsen and lewis i think you will agree with me that jacobsen may al most be eliminated from suspicion however i intend to have accountants go over the books and affairs of the bank generally just before you came in tonight i had the bank at winton on the phyie to see if i could find any clew to lewis taking the money there but there was none it was some real estate business that took him to win ton i learned and there was no money passed that brings us down to har ley if he stole the money what did he do with it it was not at the house the georgetown mystery where he roomed as you know our in vestigation proved if he took it would he hide it knowing that the theft of so large an amount would be discovered immediately and he mail ed nothing nor telegraphed there is the possibility that he had outside help jacobsen spoke of his having come from cleveland at least he thought so he might have engineered the haul and had a gang from cleveland to aid him well get in touch with the police there and in other cities and have them on the lookout there are several possi bilitiesplausibilities jim you might saybut nothing definite i think you will agree wth me that it is a very deep mystery to which the key is not visible so whats the answer jim the woman bill prosecutor thornton threw up his hands in disgust bah two bahs youre crazy theres nothing to proceed on man theres what the reporters call the third degree nothing doing nothing doing bill expostulated whenever i have to be come a dulldozer to accomplish my ends particularly with a woman like helen lewis why somebody else can be prosecutor then you dont intend to do it no i do not im afraid i cant be of any more help to you bill jim its said that whenever a man offers a wager to support his position he has nothing more worthy to offer but id stake my life on helen lewis fidelity and im not going to besmirch her name i admire your chivalry bill but not your professional acumen i think ill be going all right jim time will tell it usually does in such vital matters bulldog dorgan departed cursing under his breath such stupidity iii next morning jacobsen sent in to the prosecutor a letter he had found among mr lewis papers thornton called dorgan at the home of his par ents and asked if he would like to take a trip into the country dorgan ac cepted the invitation and they drove fifteen miles beyond george town into the hills bordering the ohio river the letter written in a scrawling and illiterate style and signed by george morris had been posted seven days be fore it was very short and to the point being in fact a threat that if mr lewis did not restore five thousand dollars which morris claimed he was entitled to he morris would take steps to get it back with the letter in hand thornton accompanied by dorgan climbed a rock strewn hillside to the morris house a place badly in need of repair it was patently not the home of a prosperous farmer george a doddering old man was amiable enough to his callers he had not heard mr lewis was dead but was frank to say he was glad of it he calmly admitted he had written to mr lewis explaining that some months be fore the bank had foreclosed without notice on an adjoining piece of land and sold it for five thousand dollars to a neighbor he went on to say that fol lowing that his wife had died and now he was alone on his almost worthless patch of twenty acres or so he said the foreclosure had brought on his wifes death and if mr lewis had been lenient a little longer he would have been able to pay out he got his just deserts lewis did the old man concluded in frenzied voice the ol skinflint how did you intend to recover from lewiswhat steps had you planned to the georgetown mystery take like you mentioned in your let ter thornton questioned well now i dont like to say for mebbe i will want to do somethin yit morris countered but i never had a mind to kill him where were you night before last up t th store can you prove it yes sir deed i can and he did thornton and dorgan learned from the proprietor that the old man had been there until nearly ten oclock others corroborated this and one man said he had ridden home with old george helped him put up his horse and had walked on to his awn home bum hunch dorgan told thorn ton he had nothing to do with it well see jim but on looking over the two bony animals morris had in his tumbledown barn the prosecutor decided that neith er was capable of making thirty miles in a night besides it seemed ridicu lous as dorgan told him to assume that old george doddering as he was had enough ingenuity to encompass such a robbery an unavailing search of the house and the barn for the money convinced thornton that george morris was guiltless the third day an inquest was held and the verdict left open the fourth day mr lewis and harley were buried after an analysis of the vital organs of both had been made and developed nothing both were placed in the same plot in the georgetown cemetery police of cleveland and other cities were unable to find anything to assist thornton a search among banking people at cleveland failed to throw any light on harleys past several times dorgan sought to convince thornton that mrs lewis should be grilled but each time he met with rebuff thorn ton said he would take her word that she knew nothing about how the two men came to their deaths finally after ten days of useless rummaging the prosecutor instructed the coroner to return a verdict of death from a broken neck cause unknown in the case of harley and from heart dis ease in the case of the banker he had been unable to develop a lead worthy of consideration the money was gone if harley and lewis had died from un lawful causes those causes probably would never be known jim dorgan returned to chicago but he did not forget the georgetown mystery he rarely ever forgot any thing and never wilfully cast a crim inal subject from his mind he almost took it as a personal affront that thorn ton had disregarded his opinion re lations had become a little strained be tween the prosecutor and himself to ward the iend of his visit and it rankled in him that such a mystery should go unsolved and that thornton should adopt what to him seemed a foolish atti tude it hurt his professional pride iv chicago was in the throes of a crime wave murders robberies and petty thieving were rampant the order went out one night for a roundup ev ery person of known criminal proclivi ties was to be brought in to make an accounting the finemeshed seine caught among others limping lizzie who had a string of aliases as long as a thorough breds pedigree lizzie known of old as a clever dip was dragged from a cozily furnished apartment in the twenties on the south side the de tectives who brought her in judged she must have been getting in some ex tremely profitable work recently and they told chief burke so why chief that womans got swell b mnov the georgetown mystery furniture and rugs and curtains galore in her apartment mercer reported limpin lizzie certainly has not been loafin now have you elizabeth he turned to the girl with mock se riousness elizabeth was indignant her re spectability was outraged i have not been doing anything of the sort she answered hotly and you know i have not you know you havent got a thing on me ive been bothering no one fopoh well for a long time the chief laughed so did the two detectives whered you get all those swell rags youre wearing burke demand ed why i got an inheritance about nine months ago she declared thats good mercer roared youre there lizzie who was he and how did you work it you nut the girl cried in sincere anger you nut let me go i havent done anything to be hauled in here for she was talking loudly in righteous indignation and not in the suave swteet way that had been hers when she had had dealings with the police on previous occasions f dorgan was attracted by her out burst and came and stood in the door way of burkes office he listened to her appeals whats the matter lizzie he finally interrupted your friends here are trying to get me to admit ive been picking pockets lately and its not so they wont be lieve me when i tell them that i inher ited some money recently i have a letter to prove it she drew herself up defiantly well wheresthe letter the chief wanted to know i have it all right its out at the flat take her out there dorgan and see if shes telling the truth i guess you will be able to tell use your discre tion i have another assignment for mercer and kelly dorgan and the girl walked out on the way to the elevated station jim no ticed that she did not limp as she had the last time he had seen her and got her out of an affair in which he believed she really had been falsely accused whats happened anyway he in quired an operation mr dorgan she said assuming an air of importance im somebody now i could afford an operation doctor took a bone from my foot she stopped and held back her skirt so that he might see the result whereas the ankle had been enlarged and awkward before it was now vir tually of regular proportions itll hurt your business wont it lizzie you wont be able to work on their sympathy any more jim spoke with an air of camaraderie which some times obtains between hunter and hunted lizzie did not answer at the flat she brought out the letter j and showed it to dorgan as she did so her eyes became misty the money was from my brother george harley she said throatily he died last summer dorgan looked at her quickly where he asked crisply down in ohio someyhere i guess here read it the letter dated october was from a cincinnati bank and addressed to elizabeth harley it merely stated that a client bank in ohio had request ed that a draft payable to her be for warded by registered mail the money being the estate that had been left by her brother george harley who had died suddenly she would be able it added to cash it at any bank the georgetown mystery dorgan read it and his eyes glowed lizzie you remember you told me last summer that if you could do me a favor you would yes well can i have this letter for a while if i agree to return it to you and let me get run in without any proof of what i tell the bulls the chief will take my word that youre on the square what do you want with it i cant tell you that but ill prom ise to return it you know that i usu ally keep my promises all right if you promise but i want it back sure youll get it by the way what is your real name lizzie thats itharley thats the truth jim dorgan that night requested and was granted three days leave without pay v jim dorgan was back in the office of prosecutor thornton at rockland he presented the letter he brought with him to the prosecutor who read it over slowly are you content to let the case rest now bill jim asked no i guess riot jim perhaps you had the right hunch after all i dont suppose that old jacobsen would hardly have sent that money without the knowledge of the owner of the bank who now happens to be mrs lewis well go out and see her at once the dorgan car drove up to the georgetown home of the widow the prosecutor and dorgan alighted and were met at the door by mrs lewis they were startled by her appearance a woman aged years in months her hair graying she hesitated a morrient then opened the door to them she asked them to be seated thornton went to his subject at once he produced the letter passed it to her and asked if she understood what it meant mrs lewis paled to her hair and seemed to be on the point of denial then her manner changed suddenly and she was at ease yes i know what it means mr thornton she said itit was sent at my instruction how did you get it thornton explained how dorgan had come into possession of it and recalled that dorgan had been present last sum mer will you tell us what the letter meanshow it all happened mrs lewis he added yes i will be glad to do you know will she said taking up his name of school days i am glad that you came today probably you will not believe it but i am i have thought very very seriously of seeing you about it and i would have in time you do not know how a terrible secret like i have harbored can burn its way into ones soul i have been miserable and yet i have not quite had the courage to make a clean breast of it so im glad youre here at last i can tell yes mrs lewisheleni can understand thornton assured her tell us everything and you will feel better i had that money sent to miss har ley she went on deliberately because her brother had told me she was a crip ple and he had expressed a hope that some time he might be able to supply her with funds for an operation he had talked to me about her andand i thought i should do it that money will was stolen from the bank dorgan glanced toward thornton victoriously the prosecutors eyes showed plainly that he disliked to be lieve it the georgetown mystery im going to tell you the whole truth will mrs lewis was saying im going to start at the beginning and bare my soul and if i am to blame for anything i am rot going to ask for mercy if i have done anything for which i should atone i want to atone i did not tell the whole truth last sum mer but there seemed to be no other way out you know will about my marriage and that mr lewis was so much older i didnt think i should marry him but my parents urged me to and ill be frank to say will there did not seem to be another prospect for me we were not happy it was impossible for us to be the difference in our ages was too great then mr harley came here to work in the bank from columbus it was mr lewis had inquired of a bank there fora competent man when his business got so heavy i did not know anything much about mr harley neither did mr lewis but he was competent likable and congenialand he was young theres no use of hiding any thing now i think it all must have had its beginning when mr lewis invited him to the house we became good friends you can see how it would be soi had been cooped up so long with out proper associates he was only here a few times once at dinner he told mr lewis and myself about his sister he was very careful in his at tentions to me at the house but when i would go to the bank igtsaw in his eyes what any woman could not fail to see i felt sort of guilty butbut it thrilled me too oh i know it was not right but i was so lonesome so lonesome will i was not in love with him i am sure or i would not have done what i did later but i suppose his admiration en thralled me perhaps you will under stand thati cant explain it more fully she paused and showed signs of giving away to her emotions thornton and dorgan gave her sym pathetic attention and she proceeded one day he said to me at the bank you are very unhappy helen and because it was true and because his voice and eyes were so tender i began to cry i was not used to tenderness i hurried from the bank the next day i had a note from him through the mail it simply said will you forgive me after that i stayed away from the bank and one evening a week later he called me on the phone did you get my note he asked yes i said what is the answer he wanted to know what could it be but yes i told him all right he said tonight that was all the tenseness of his voice made me uneasy the tonight worried me but i told my self i had misunderstood it for good night mr lewis had driven over to win ton to attend to some business or other he said he might not be back until the next day i suppose mr harley knew it i went to bed early at eleven oclock the doorbell rang i slipped into my dressing gown and went down to answer it it waswas him well he wanted to know why i was not ready as i had promised and kept saying over and over the train went at twelve and we would miss it if we did not hurry i was so amazed so terror stricken that i made no remonstrance when he came in and closed the door i told him i did not understand what he meant by such action when i finally gathered my senses arent you going with me helen he demanded the georgetown mystery are you mad i asked i guess so helen he said mad with love of you hurry helen for we are going away to happiness that is just the way he put it again she paused and her eyes fell to the floor she presented a sad pic ture as she struggled to repress her emotion i finally got the straight of it af ter the first note he had s sent me an other proposing that we go away to gether it did not come until the next dayhe had taken the precaution to mail it in another town he pleaded i should go anyway because of his love for me andand would not leave he tried to take me in his arms i ran up stairs to escape him and he started to follow then i heard a car in the drive and and i knew mr lewis had come home it was a terrible moment i stopped on the stairs and begged mr harley to go finally he seemed to comprehend the situation and turned to go down the stairs but it was too late the car stopped outside the garage and it seemed only a second before i heard mr lewis on the rear porch mr harley had taken only two or three steps when mr lewis opened the kitchen door he came in quickly wondering i suppose why there was a light in the hall maybe he heard us mr harley started to run for the front door a rug slipped under him and he fell striking his head on the floor his neck must have been broken that way i darted on upstairs i did not dare stop i hurried into my room and lay down then in a minute i heard a gasp from mr lewis and and a dull sound i waited for perhaps thirty minutes not know ing what to do at last i crept down stairs the hall light had been jostled out i stumbled over something i found the light and turned it on mr lewis body lay over mr harleys i sup pose mr lewis had died from the shock an act of providence the tears welled in her eyes thats about all of the story she sobbed except that after i had stared at them in dumb agony for what seemed an age i came to realize they must not be found here frantically i paced up and down the hall not know ing what to do then a heavensent idea came to me i carried mr lewis out and placed him in his car just as he was found next morning then i half carried half dragged mr harley to the com mon dodging in and out of the shad ows it was a moonlight night and it seemed to me a thousand pairs of eyes were watching from each window he was heavy but i did not seem to notice that my muscles were deadened with fear then i stole home to my misery like a hunted animal she lay back against the divan ut terly weary and almost limp from her recital but what of the money dorgan managed to ask thats another miserable part of it she faltered of course he took it to go away on i noticed it in his pock et it made such a bulge something told me it was not his and i felt i owed it to him to protect his name when it was partly my fault that he did such a wild thing so i took it i remembered what he had told me about his sis ter he had given me her address so that i might get in touch with her should anything happen to him so i sent it to her i went to cincinnati per sonally and told the bank there to send it on saying that it came from a bank in ohio that is all will what is to become of me am i damned forever the the georgetown mystery tears were flowing down her cheeks no helen no it has been cleared up to my satisfaction and the state will not prosecute thornton freely as sured her in fact there is nothing to prosecute on since it is a private bank and no one has lost anything but you and what a terrible story perhaps you did not do right in concealing it so long helen but i can understand and i want to extend my sympathy and we will go at once for i do not want to intrude longer upon your sor row he rose walked over and took her hand a silent clasp a homage to a sorrowing woman whom he had known as a romping schoolgirland he walked to the door jim dorgans face was a puzzle to see as he shook hands with helen lew is there was an admixture of victory and defeat outside when they were seated and the machine was movingoff bill turned to his friend he could not help gloating a little didnt i tell youjim didnt i tell you that helen lewis would not wittingly be a party to such a thing we both wnand we both lose dorgan the bulldog answered eva sively but pm satisfied shes a good woman bill a good woman told in glass by g s montanye the neighbors on christopher square called him old man johnson he had a little base ment shop where he dealt in sec ond hand automobile parts he lived in the rear of the store and the square knew him as an inventor it did not know what he invented but it was ac customed to seeing a light in the store at all hours if one looked down into the black areaway they could see the old man at work among his tools his ragged gray beard drooping over his bench one day christopher square hummed with news concerning old man johnson big harry westley the king of con men discussed the news with lefty blumfeld alias morrison tay lor over a table in the front room of the west side social club located at the end of the square westley was large florid and impressive crook dom respected his genius it was said that westley could cut central park up into building lots and sell them for cash he had served two jail terms but had lost none of his nerve or pom pous exterior lefty blumfeld alias morrison taylor was undersized he was built along the lines of a gorilla he had a low bulging forehead and beady black eyes his bull neck was short and thick his hands were covered with coarse black hair they were gnarled and pitted from laboratory work he made nitroglycerine for petermen and blasters when he was not out on a job himself he had done a stretch of six years in the state penitentiary and was as rapacious and merciless as a coiled cobra did you hear the news about old man johnson westley inquired lighting a fat cigar with a flourish blumfeld tossed off three fingers of underground rye whiskey he dried his lips on the back of his hand no what about him the big con man tilted back his chair and chuckled everyone is talking about old man johnson he sold an invention to some big company up the state hes been paid ten thousand dollars in ad vance royalties charlie hill saw the check and so its not air the old geezer has cleaned up ten grands i guess thats rotten blumfeld ran his finger around the inside rim of his whiskey glass whats the invention he asked after a pause westley shook his head and shrugged search me nobody seems to know charlie hill asked him but johnson said it was a secret it must be some thing good or he wouldnt have got such dough blumfeld nodded moodily yes it must be he said westley flicked the ash from the end of his cigar and chuckled again ten thousand dollars he ob served reflectively is a lot of dough ill have to wander up to moy lings after awhile and smoke a couple of pipes of scamish poppy makes me dream clever schemes i was full of hop the time i took that florida lawyer for his currency kick old man john told in glass son isnt used to sudden wealth ill dream out a way to separate him from his cush when i get it ill buy you the best dinner in town lefty like hell blumfeld grunted westley smiled and looked at his watch he stood up and pulled down his waistcoat he placed seventyfive cents on the table to pay for the liquor he had consumed and fingered his closely shaven chin well ive got to be moving be good to yourself and be leary of the rednecks ive just got about six min utes to grab a short he nodded affably and moved away through the front windows of the club blumfeld saw him stride briskly across the square the nitroglycerine expert sat stiffly still ten thousand dolars he hardly knew there was so much money in the world and it was in the possession of a doddering inventor who lived in a mean cellar blumfelds beady eyes glittered when he considered the magnitude of the sum he felt dazed for a long in terval he sat with expressionless face and staring eyes after a time he got up he took a few steps toward the door returned and picked up the sev entyfive cents big harry westley had laid on the table he shoved it into his pocket deciding he needed it more than the waiter slouching out of the club he de scended the front steps and stepped on to the cracked pavement of christo pher square the late september afternoon was dying in a conflagration of sunset fire the sky was brazen with raw scarlet amethyst and silver andpurple lights were winking in the waterfront rigging a block distant the river was boisterous with the voice of sirens and the shrill of whistles the wraith of evening shook out her black draperies that were pinned with stars blumfeld turned east he walked two blocks he came in sight of the building in the cellar of which old man johnson maintained his shop he saw the inventors ancient sign hang ing from its metal stanchion like a one legged acrobat drawing close to the areaway blumfeld leaned over and peered down somewhere in the shop below an oil lamp burned in its un certain radiance blumfeld observed the stooped figure of the proprietor turning to the iron stairway that led steeply down into the basement blumfeld drew his lips back over his teeth and smiled he descended the steps and opened the front door he entered and closed it after him the shop was warm and stuffy with the odor of paint and grease blumfeld hardly noticed it his quick gaze dart ed to the workbench over which old man johnson hung he saw the in ventor was old and feeble the eyes of the man were blue and faded his skin was wrinkled like yellow parch ment he wore a disreputable old pair of oilstained trousers a collarless flannel shirt that exposed his turkey neck and a pencilstuffed vest held to gether by one button you got a second hand drive shaft for a brown and blue taxi blumfeld said as the inventor looked up old man johnson shook his head no i havent he said in a thin husky voice blumfeld allowed his gaze to wander about the place got any gears or transmission parts the inventor shook his white head again no i dont think i have all the parts are piled up in the corner over there im going out of business so if you find anything you can use you can have it at your own price he indicated a heap of metal stacked a told in glass up in one comer blumfeld shuffled across to it he pawed idly over it while he did this he plumbed the room with his beady eyes he made a men tal photograph of the way the shop was arranged of a single window that opened on to an alley running past it and of a door that went into what was presumably the living quarters of the inventor when he had observed all that inter ested him blumfeld straightened up and turned his back on the heap of metal find anything old man johnson asked blumfeld shook his head no ill come around next week maybe youll have a shaft picked up by then the inventor smiled faintly i wont be here next week im selling out im going out of business im leaving for rochester on monday im an inventor and i only kept this little place here until i struck oil blumfeld allowed himself to look impressed is that right so you struck oil i guess that means you sold an inven tion you must have knocked out large kale if youre going to rochester the interest of his caller appeared to please the old man he wiped his hands on a piece of cotton waste and put some tobacco in the bowl of his black pipe it took me twenty years to perfect my invention he explained with a touch of pride many times i thought i had made it only to discover some hidden flaw people i told about it said it couldnt be done and thought i was crazy to even try it three months ago i knew i had triumphed i put the invention to every possible test and it made good i applied for a patent and sent my work to a big manufactur ing concern in rochester they tested it for two months and then agreed to purchase the right to manufacture it they sent me ten thousand dollars and a contract im going to rochester as i said to take charge of the making of them blumfeld receiving verification of big harrys statement felt satisfaction tingling keenly within him he had almost believed that it was opium that put the words in the mouth of the big con man so you got ten thousand dollars he murmured thats a lot of money you want to hold on to it tight i guess you know the square is a pretty tough place dont let no one bunk the jack away from you or stick you up for it old man johnson looked serious never fear i wont i have it hid den where no one can find it its safe blumfeld smiled thats the eye hang onto it im sorry you aint got what im after good luck to you when you get to rochester at the door blumfeld stopped seized by a sudden thought by the way he said what was it you invented the inventor picked up a file from the bench its a secret he replied slowly its a secret until its put on the mar ket ii at eleven oclock blumfeld emerged from the east side stuss house where he had run his purloined seventyfive cents up to six dollars a pleasant sense of success swam in his blood his good fortune was an omen that fickle luck smiled upon him on such a night as this he might conquer in any deed in which he figured or any en deavor he applied his hand to told in glass at the comer of the street he trav ersed he boarded a surface car he rode twelve blocks and transferred to a crosstown car the second car took him as far as harrigan avenue where he alighted he continued east tread ing a labyrinth of side streets that emptied like sewers along the water front where the rivers breath was damp foul and cold blumfeld turned south a few minutes later he en tered christopher square by its west termination he passed the social club where he had sat and talked with big harry the strains of jazz crept out through lighted windows evidently a dance was in progress he wondered if it was all right to stop off for a hooker of illicit whiskey he decided not to and quickened his step as if to outpace temptation when the ten thousand dollars of old man johnsons was his he could buy a hundred cases of hootch he could fill a tub full of rye and bathe in it if he so desired the pleasant stream of imagination he floated down emptied him into the bayou of broken dreams he shook himself as he sighted his destination the hanging sign of the inventor loomed before himthe black area way of the basement shop which was as dark as the inside of a pocket blumfeld made sure his movements were not being observed and squatted down he looked into the shop as far as he could but saw no trace of any light arising he surveyed the square music still seeped out from the club no loiterer shuffled through the shad ows he descended the areaway stairs the door he had opened earlier in the evening confronted him quick inspec tion told blumfeld it was locked and bolted on the inside in such a way as to make forcing it impossible he mut tered a curse and crept down the area way he climbed a fence and dropped down into an alley that fringed the building he came upon the single window of the shop and drew a breath of satisfaction when he found the top pane was lowered an inch or two it was the work of a minute to draw the lower sash up swing quietly across the sill and step down onto the floor of the store so much accomplished without mis hap blumfeld grew cautious old man johnson was an inventor it was likely he had rigged up some device that would make known the presence of an intruder blumfeld knew he would have to be wary or he would stumble into a snare he opened the blade of a large heavy knife and felt his way to the door that opened into the living rooms beyond twice he stubbed his foot on some bit of metal lying about he reached the door with out accident otherwise and felt about the frame at first he discovered noth ing then as he dug his nails into the plaster he found the presence of a number of fine silkcovered wires he cut them one at a time and dropped a hand to the knob of the door it opened at his touch with scarce a creak blumfeld passed into stark blackness perfumed with the reek of a kerosene lamp its odor took him carefully across the room he discovered the location of the lamp and felt its chim ney its warmth told him it had been extinguished only a short time blumfeld turned slowly he must learn if this room was the bedchamber of the inventor or not he longed to kindle a match but knew its glare would betray him if johnson was awake he began to step forward lay ing his hand against the furniture it encountered he touched a chair and a small table but they told him noth ing he had no way of knowing where told in glass he was until his knees suddenly came in contact with something cold and hard and investigation caused him to expel a breath of relief his exploring hands felt a mattress and a blanket while he considered the next move blumfeld stiffened cautiously the bed creaked with the weight of some one turning over in it after what seemed an eternity a thin husky voice came out of the staring murk i have a fully loaded revolver cov ering you i will blumfeld did not wait to hear the rest of it with a snarl he flung him self forward he crashed against a figure that fell back with a soft cry a cry that was abruptly shut off by the grip of his fingers something hard clattered to the floor with a dull metal lic ring wisps of beard scratched blumfelds face with his free hand he ripped a piece from the blanket wadded it together and stuffed it into the mans mouth forcing his jaws open and digging a knee into his stomach so that no scream might awake discordant echoes when he had neatly gagged his victim he ended weak struggles with a vicious blow and using other strips of the blanket bound johnsons wrists and ankles tightly together stepping away from the bed blum feld struck a match he turned up the wick pf the oil lamp and lighted it the room boasted two windows and both displayed drawn shades it was sparsely furnished as a bedroom containing a bureau with a mirror table chair and trunk blum feld dropped down on the top of the trunk he dug out the stub of a ciga rette from his pocket and after kin dling it looked casually at the trussed up man on the bed he grinned when the faded blue eyes met his bravely and steadily i came back blumfeld said i came back to get them ten thousand smackers you were bragging about if you come clean with me you wont get hurt if you try any funny stuff youll never go to rochester youll go to a place where money aint no use nod your head if you understand the inventor nodded blumfeld picked up the revolver from the floor and pocketed it are you ready to tell me where the money is at nod yes or nq the old man inclined his head blumfeld crossed to him and leaned over im going to slip the gag out of your peep if you open your trap to yell ill cave in your conk he removed the makeshift gag and the inventor licked his lips cmon spit out the dope blumr feld ordered impatiently i will tell you nothing the old man said huskily wrhat it took me twenty years to earn i will share with no one no matter what you do to me no information will pass my lips i will meet my fate unafraid and i will know that you cannot escape the consequences of your crime the work of my hand and the child of my brain will reach out even from the grave and overtake you with a snarl blumfeld jammed the gag back into the inventors mouth he pushed the old man savagely back among the pillows and struck him again with his fist for a few minutes he sat silent his face dark with thought at length he stood up slapped his thigh with a exclamation and walked to the lamp he opened the blade of his heavy knife and laid it across the mouth of the chimney look ing back at the cot with a wide grin maybe a little burning on the soles of your feet will make you loosen up ill torture you before i croak you and even if you dont tell me what i want to know ill find out ill told in glass turn these rooms upside down he lifted the knife from the chimney and saw that its blade had turned whitehot he wrapped his handker chief around the handle and with a sin gle move drew the sheets and blankets off the bed iii three days later as blumfeld slouched out of the east side lodging house where he roomed a man stepped across the pavement and laid a hand on his arm synchronously another man stepped out of the passing crowd and caught hold of his left arm moving it up and out before blumfeld could draw a breath something cold encircled each wrista sharp click sounded you are wanted lefty the first man said briefly charge of bumping off old man johnson the inventor down on christopher square last week blumfeld lifted his face his lips drawn back over his yellow teeth youre crazy with the heat he snarled i havent been on christo pher square in two weeks ive been away ive been in chi the second man smiled there is no use of lying lefty we have old man johnsons invention down at headquarters it showed us who croaked him and told us who to look for weve got the manyou are he blumfeld licked his lips what invention are you talking about his first captor exchanged a look with his companion something thats going to stand this country on its ear when it hears about it he answered the old man in vented a mirror he had one in the bureau in his bedroom its a mirror that retains the reflection of the last person who passes before it the halfasleep girl by william h kofoed i the street was squalid dirty on either side a row of rickety frame houses leaning like drunken sailors one upon the other warned idle trespassers of the character of the neighborhood the few people who traversed it now in the autumn twilight walked quickly and with many a furtive sidewise glance as though in some ancient land of gnomes and ogres where behind every wall lurked an unknown horror that is all but young fleming met calf knibbs it is doubtful that knibbs could achieve the furtive if his life de pended on it hie was one of those straightforward chaps who insist that black is black and even though a siz able check be the inducement refuse to call it gray of course in reality no check could possibly prove an induce ment to young knibbs as his private fortune was known to flirt with seven figures but the comparison is none the less illuminating on that account nor was he without a sense of hu mor or of balance humor enough to enjoy all phases of life balance enough to realize that not in money alone does one find happiness but his humor bordered on the ro mantic and adventurous almost indis creetly so he was given to prowling in littlefrequented quarters arid every now and again he would get himself in trouble which he enjoyed hugely moving along the sordid thorough fare his evercurious eyes taking in its details young knibbs came at length to a house more rickety if possible than the rest whose door was at that moment slowly opening in the shadow he glimpsed whitestockinged ankles and slippers below a dark skirt knibbs was passing as the girl de scended the steps her movements were so softly gliding as to be almost ethereal and visualizing her as emerg ing from a haze he recalled a famous picture of a wood nymph shrouded in twilight mist at first her face was in distinct then suddenly he caught it like a ray of light and stood transfixed by its strange charm and now he saw her quite unroman tically catch the heel of one slipper on the edge of a step and reach wildly for support this impulsive movement sent the other slipper flying through the air it described a graceful arc and landed on the sidewalk the girl sat down heavily fleming knibbs congratulated him self on this heavensent opportunity to acquaint himself with her as he stooped and retrieved the itinerant slipper he turned smiling pleasantly allow me he said and fitted it to her unshod foot thank you her voice was drowsy as though it were early morning and she had just arisen he looked at her sharply youre not hurt not at all she replied in the same monotone getting to her feet she was an extremely pretty girl knibbs noted again and wondered at finding her in this contrasting environment he fell in step beside her inquiring meanwhile if he might escort her to her destina tion the halfasleep girl if you wish she conceded she was obviously tired physically or mentally or both flemings inter est was intrigued and now they found themselves in a more populated section the street grew crooked situated in the tender loins heart it turned and twisted con vulsively a veritable aorta of floating human derelicts writhing toward the river and a cheap amusement park on its banks but the girl avoided the park turning in an opposite direction the crowd began to thin out at the last comer across from innumerable shadowy wharves and reveling in an unaccountable river stench stood a wabbly fruit stand illuminated by a sin gle flaring gas jet dirty flimsy wooden baskets containing all manner of fruits and vegetables tipped their rims partly toward the curb and partly toward the dark heavens while here and there a shadowy head of cabbage peeped out upon this dreary vista on a soap box by the stand and directly under the un certain light sat a mere boy thin of limb and vicious of feature hunched intently over a yiddish newspaper they passed this last outpost of the underworld flemings curiosity grow ing apace on the left stretched acres of slimy marshes and beyond only faintly discernible in the growing dark ness the river it was too much for young knibbs he stopped in his tracks what he began and then his mouth opened in surprise and astonish ment and he concluded the devil for a blunt automatic had been thrust against his ribs and the girl in the dark skirt and white slippers was talking to him in her soft sleepy drawl be still or i shall have to shoot you then deliberately she set about frisking him her slender fingers plucked his scarfpin his watch and at length found the inner pocket of his coat and his wallet she was talking again now then stand as you are she began backing away i am watching you if you move an inch the rest was left to be inferred the click of her high heels on the sidewalk grew less and less distinct until it be came inaudible whirling fleming knibbs dashed toward the corner no one was in sight the young jew as before was hunched over his paper a girl panted knibbs she came in this direction have you seen her i see no vun replied the boy sour ly then observing for the first time the wellgroomed man before him his trade instincts arose to the surface and he became suddenly ingratiating ex cept he emphasized rubbing his skinny hands in anticipation my cus tomers flemings wallet was gone but he still had some change one hand went readily to his pocket emerging with a bright halfdollar heres the price of a dozen apples my boy he said eat them yourself now which way did she go the youth pocketed his reward pointing meanwhile to one of the nu merous small streets opening on the waterfront before he could speak knibbs was off doing a hundred yards in eleven flat he came to a thoroughfare with car tracks the girl was nowhere in sight in the distance the vanishing lights of a trolley winked at him derisively gone he exclaimed in disgust then brightening but wasnt she a peach he caught the next car intending to return home when seated he men tally inventoried his losses there were several hundred dollars in the wallet the pin was worth five hundred and the halfasleep girl the watch another hundred all told she had netted close to a thousand dol lars not bad for a halfasleep girl he commented to himself the thought occurred to him that the whole matter should be reported at po lice headquarters but in the instance he had strange scruples which he him self could not explain he tried to console his conscience by emphasizing the fact that the loss meant nothing to him then he happily remembered his friend simeon dreer of the murder squad who was occasionally willing if qaught in the mood to aid his friends in working out their little problems he promptly left the car and took another one crosstown half an hour later he found himself in dreers apartment the little weaz ened man in huge green spectacles like twin railroad signals was talking on the telephone when knibbs entered very well i shall go there imme diately fleming heard him say and his disappointment was keen for he knew the old fellow was being called out on a departmental case simeon dreer replaced the receiver on its hook and came toward knibbs peering intently with his nearsighted eyes ah its young fleming knibbs he said at length in the tone of a discov erer hello knibbs hello sorry i cant entertain you im called out drop in tomorrow eh ive a couple of new records a serenade from les millions darlequin and dreer was a musical enthusiast with a pronounced leaning toward the clas sical ive been robbed announced fleming and i thought perhaps robbed held up no when not an hour ago this is interesting i should like to hear the details as i said im called out on a case supposed suicide which may be a murder but if you care to go along well talk about it on the way over good lets go they were on the street in a jiffy knibbs hailed a taxi and leaped in while wrinkled old simeon dreer confided his destination to the chauffeur shortly they were bowling along at a good speed with dreer sitting quietly listen ing to his guests story when it had been concluded the murder squad man chuckled by the weak light of the street lamps fleming saw his green glasses bobbing up and down very very interesting young knibbs he commented when his mirth had subsided i shall look into it at the first opportunity and on what street by the way did you meet this fair highwaywoman the moneyed youjng man slapped his knee sharply by jove im an unob servant idiot i cant tell you the name of that street i was too busy soaking up its atmosphere you would know it if you saw it from a million theres nothing like it in the western world i believe i know the one you mean in fact at that moment the taxi stopped jolt ingly dreer threw open the door and clam bered out in fact young knibbs he called over his shoulder if you will look around i think you will find that you are on it now ii knibbs emerged hurriedly the old fellow was right they were on the very street in which his adventures had originated they were facing the selfsame rickety frame the halfasleep girl dwelling from which the halfasleep girl had come not two hours before simeon dreer observed the fixity of his companions gaze and inferred the truth so this is her home eh he said softly wellnow we have com plications for here also this evening a suicide was committed fleming gripped the others arm con vulsively notnotthe girl he whispered calm yourself replied dreer it was a manan elderly man fleming sighed his relief then laughed at the absurdity of his interest in her im a romantic susceptible bredin thebone fool he told himself as he followed dreer up the steps in the flarrow lowceilinged entry illuminated by a single gas jet flaring weirdlythey found a policeman on guard a swede one hjalmar yensen with whom even knibbs was ac quainted good evening yensen said the murder squad man whats been go ing on here ay don know somebody kill him self ay gass you were sent from headquarters merely to see that no one left the house eh yeh ay ask skal ay pinch some body an dey say hal no leave dat to master dreer very good nodded the weazened little fellow his green spectacles bob bing eagerly for he was always eager when approaching a case that promised difficulties whos upstairs yust a cop a doctor and the residentsthe people of the house yeh ay forgot dem dreer waited for no more but clat tered up the uncarpeted stairs with fleming metcalf knibbs at his heels a light in the front room drew them they hurried past a bluecoat at the door and stood for a moment on the thresh old taking in the scene the body covered by a sheet lay near a small table in a corner of the room in addition to the table were only two other articles of furniture one a bedstead on which reposed the gaunt figure of a man of perhaps fifty the other a chair and seated on the chair her eyes partially closed was flemings halfasleep girl knibbs drew in his breath sharply the girl did not look up she was ap parently unaware of their entrance the physician approached i am doctor collier he said you are from headquarters i take it simeon bobbed his green glasses again peering up at the tall m d with his little nearsighted eyes dreers my name he remarked theres a suicide here i understand doctor what do you know of it merely this that the officer on the beat heard a cry and ran in here to find this man he indicated the white sheathed form on the floorwith a knife in his heart i was summoned pronounced the fellow dead and now your men are detaining me in spite of the fact that i have a practice waiting one more question about the man on the bed whats his affliction paralysis cant move about impossible only his neck and arms are free may i have your card certainly the physician extracted one from his vest pocket extending it under the old fellows nose thank you haggerty show the doctor out dreer swung onhis heel went to the bed and sat on its edge tell me he requested of the para lytic what happened here the invalid passed a hand over his deeply set black eyes as though to the halfasleep girl clear his vision then he removed it and waved it weakly toward the corner this man john ulrich he began is my cousin like my daughter and myself he has seen much misfortune he came in tonight brokenspirited and stood at the foot of my bed and told me he was going to end it all i tried to reason with him but he wouldnt listen on the table lay a knifeone john had brought with him from the east indies when he stoked on a british steamer he walked over and picked it up fright ened i cried out at the top of my lungs but that merely frenzied him and he drove the blade to its hilt in his breast you know the rest and your daughter she was here at the time werent you lola the girl nodded it was no more than a tired little inclination of her pretty head knibbs could not help pitying her the questions continued what is your name bastian de brunner how long have you lived here less than a month and previously australia mmm mumbled dreer then he arose quickly went to the corner and threw the sheet aside the body of john ulrich was fully six feet tall and solidly constructed his face though somewhat distorted re vealed plain rather commonplace fea tures under a shaggy beard his shirt was darkly stained where the knife had penetrated the weapon itself how ever had been removed and lay on the table it was from all the evidence a plain case of suicide motive poverty yet doubt might be readily cast on the mo tive for had not this girl lola re turned earlier in the evening with up ward of a thousand dollars in loot taken forcibly from fleming metcalf knibbs was it likely with this wealth in her possession that she would allow a member of the family to kill himself because of dire need no it wasnt likely still simeon dreer went to knibbs and whispered talk to her while i engage her father ask her if she remembers you hint about the robbery and watch her face fleming approached the girl took her hand and drew her to one of the small windows overlooking the street by the light of a corner arc lamp they could see directly below the halfrotted wooden steps on which she had slipped knibbs pressed her hand gently she looked at him do you remember me he murmured what her tone was as listless as before do you remember having met me before she gave a little negative shake of her sepiacrowned head and then trailing after a longdrawn nooo knibbs waxed a bit impatient this feminine jesse james was either con summately clever or genuinely half asleep her features hadnt yielded the slightest sign of recognition he de cided to be more explicit you know he said i was robbed this evening byof all personsa pretty young ladyrobbed of a watch and scarf pin and three hundred dollars in currency were you she sighed yes im sorry are you really yes then perhaps he lowered his voice still moreperhaps you can tell me where they are she smiled very much as a child smiles in its sleep bmnov the halfasleep girl how absurd she said i am not a clairvoyant fleming figuratively threw up his hands at the hopelessness of learning anything from her she was madden ing without further questioning he strode to the door the detective ob serving this met him in the hall well young knibbs he queried hopefully shes the image of original inno cenceor original singod knows which doesnt know a blasted thing about my holdup never met me and all that oh whats the use a phrase not in my vocabulary re plied dreer do you want me to ar rest her heavens no send a girlparticu larly as pretty a girl as sheto jail id rather lose a few thousand more than do that what do you want me to do get my trinkets back dreer became speculative she may have carried this thing out on her bwn initiative without the knowledge or consent of her parent in which instance its hardly likely she would bring the loot home with her he muttered shes been to a fence no doubt howpver ill have yensen search the house and report to me to morrow theres nothing we can do now except perhaps make undertaking arrangements this other affair is plainly suicide they filed down the stairway paus ing at its foot for another chat with hjalmar yensen my boy said simeon dreer to the big rawboned swede i know you are a careful conscientious officer i know you are thorough and i have a little job here that requires thoroughness more than anything else its only a sidelight on the suicide but it may suc ceed in recovering some stolen personal property and theres always a reward attached to that sort of thing you know now yensen i want you to search this shack from cellar to garret for a diamond scarf pin shaped in a question mark a gruen watch and an alligator wallet containing three hun dred dollars in bills and a motorcar license made out to fleming metcalf knibbs do your best to uncover these or anything else of interest inciden tally you might call in the matron from the twentysecond district station and have the girl searched preferably with out the knowledge of her father when you are quite through you and hag gerty may leave tell de brunner we hold his household blameless that the evidence of suicide is satisfactory to the department and he will not be intruded upon again though of course the final judgment is in the coroners hands meanwhile we shall summon an under taker goodbye and they went out iii knibbs was awakened about nine oclock the following morning by the ringing of the telephone bell he arose grumbling between yawns and wended his barefooted way to the instrument hello he said briefly that you young knibbs asked dreers voice at the other end flemings sleepiness vanished per haps the old fellow had some interest ing information about his halfasleep girl of whom he had dreamed the whole night through yes mr dreer he replied what is it a new development in our case no its about the suicide but i knew youd be interestedthought youd like to follow it up you know becausewell because the little girl is tied up in it and yes yesof course what have you found the halfasleep girl a meagre clue it may and may not be of importance dreer was always modest if you care to come over well examine its possibilities together but i thought the incident of the suicide was closed i thought the de partment was satisfied the department is never satisfied so long as a shadow of suspicion remains undispelled to be brutally frank young knibbs there is a possibility that lola de brunner murdered the man ul rich no yesa possibility i do not say it with assurance and i hope if only be cause of your interest in her that it proves untrue but it is there and can not be avoided as i said if you care to come over wait for me ill be over in a jiffy cried fleming he slammed the receiver on its hook and a moment later was getting into his clothes with reckless haste the girl lola had taken a peculiar hold on him though the unusual circumstances of their meeting not to mention the de pressing incidents which followed were certainly noton their face at least of a nature to awaken the finer in stincts these instincts were awakened nevertheless in fleming knibbs and coming to analyze it that beautiful sep tember morning he concluded that it was so because there was something real about this girl that rose above the most damning facts refuting them in brief anything bad she had done wasnt true heclung to this assertion because it was the only ground on which he could satisfactorily explain his attraction to her he knew he wouldnt be drawn to a girl essentially bad ergo folks had merely gotten the wrong angle on her acts and misunderstood them true he had a difficult mental battle maintaining this stand inevitable logic came forward again and again argu ing if a man approached you on the street thrust a gun in your face and re lieved you of your valuables he would be a thief wouldnt hea common high wayman if a giflno matter how prettydoes the same thing is she not a thief also that was a stumper knibbs had to find a way to answer no so that he would believe it and he did but how he did is beyond the compre hension of any save those who too are under the spell of some lovely young woman fleming knibbs sacrificed breakfast that morning in his eagerness to see dreer just fortyfive minutes elapsed between the ringing of his phone and the instant he walked unannounced into the detectives strangely cluttered library simeon dreer was seated with his ear close to the phonograph listening dreamily to the strains of les millions darlequin as his visitor entered he raised his hand without turning in a request for silence knibbs sat don and waited impa tiently for the music to cease when it did finally dreer mutter ing beautiful beautiful put the rec ord away with great care and deliber ation before joining his guest then fumbling in his pocket he brought forth an envelope this he said was found by my good friend yensen and earned him a fivedollar bill and this was all he found queried knibbs no sign of the watch or scarf pin none the girl asked him you see to help move her father to a back room which he did afterward he discov ered this missive under the pillow tact fully maintaining silence he brought it to me of your trinkets however young knibbs there was not a sign the halfasleep girl fleming looked at the envelope v it was addressed in a rangy scrawl to bastian de brunner and bore an aus tralian postmark dated six weeks ear lier within was a sheet of linen letter paper he drew it out and read dear bastian by the time this arrives you should besnugly fixed in your new quarters m have no difficulty picturing you there silent of course perhaps even broodingbut fust as active in thought as ever how is lola ask her for me if the transpacific trip succeeded in les sening the intensity of her hatred for our mutual friend john ulrich i am still with the old smith amp townsend outfit though ill admit the routine is getting to be drudgery some day i may clear out for the states myself in which event you may be sure ill look you up trusting your health is improving i remain your friend and admirer cassius wynn knibbs glanced at simeon dreer frowning dso you think because she entertained a dislike for the man ul rich that she killed him and that her father is protecting her with his suicide story a natural assumption isnt it fleming being reluctant to admit it remained silent young knibbs continued simeon at what hour did this girl hold you up about nine i should judge and how long do you think it would take her to return home from that spot provided she went directly by trolley no more than fifteen minutes then she could have been home at ninefifteen easily youve considered i suppose that the stabbing occurred at ninetwenty fleming avoided the detectives gaze he felt that by defending the girl he was putting himself in an awkward position yet in his heart he knew he would go on defending her to the end and the end what would it be finally seeking an argument on which to pin his dwindling hope he asked how can you be so sure of your time easily theres a small grocery store on the corner and in its window hangs a clock which officer haggerty is in the habit of consulting as he swings around his beat it was exactly ninetwenty by that clock when as he passed the window he heard de brun ners cry lola it would appear had been home five minutes knibbs winced then suddenly struck by an idea he leaped to his feet but if she returned directly home after leav ing me the stolen property must have been in her possession he cried and as it wasnt in her possession she couldnt have returned directly home and must have arrived after the deed was done that clears her of all sus picion he sat down in an exultant glow dreer lay back in his chair and laughed heartily his green glasses flashed in the morning sunlight pouring through the open window the profession lost a genius when you took to clipping coupons for a life work he chuckled my boy consider these facts all fences do not live miles away from their coworkers they may even live conveniently near in which event the girl could have dropped in without losing more than a minute or two besides it would be foolish for either of us to try to prove her ab sence at the time of the tragedy for in addition to her father averring her presence haggerty found her in the the halfasleep girl room when he entered my chief rea son for questioning you concerning the hour of the holdup was to establish a limited area in which her fence might be located for i believe she employed a fence he may really be more guilty than she and if we find him it may lead to a clearing of the whole mys tery i am beginning to sense a link between the robbery and the stabbing and im glad after all that you didnt allow me to arrest her last night now she can be watched you know young knibbs the musty old saying murder will out fleming was decidedly pale i think you do her an injustice he muttered thats justwhat im trying not to do if she isnt guilty of wrongdoing she deserves to be cleared in our sight and if she is he left the rest to be inferred and on the whole it carried a sinister meaning with the shadow of the dreaded chair looming in the background iv knibbs left his friend dreers apart ment in a depressed frame of mind he felt that if his halfasleep girl proved as black as circumstances had painted her he could no longer entertain faith in humankind also in this indigo mood he nursed a slight resentfulness toward dreer for casting additional suspicion upon her and reflecting deprecatingly upon his deductive ability he would show the old fellow this affair wasnt over yet the truth was still hidden from them thus steeped in his musings and not fully realizing what he was doing he signaled a pass ing taxi within he sat chewing the cud of his thoughts as the constricted city land scape flashed by twenty minutes passed at length he felt the machine stop and heard the chauffeurs voice here you are sir he looked up the taxi was stand ing before the little grocery store which dreer had described then fleming knibbs remembered that with some vague idea of accumulating additional facts he had ordered to be driven into lolas neighborhood he paid the man and stood idly watching him drive away he didnt quite know what to do where to begin uncertain as he was he started to walk around the block hoping a course would suggest itself he passed the shabby de brunner residence slowly there was crepe on the door and the worn green shades in the front room were drawn to a level with the slightly opened windows at the next corner he swung to the right shortly he came to an alley lined with drunken fences and battered slop cans on the impulse he entered it he knew he would find the de brunner backyard somewhere alonghere as to what he would do when he reached it he hadnt the faint est idea there were two stout women in faded gingham house dresses and aprons standing at a gate directly be hind de brunners as knibbs neared them he caught snatches of their con versation they were talking of the tragedy fleming took his nerve in hand pardon ladies he interrupted i understand there was a suicide in the neighborhood youre right there was responded the more garrulous of the pair appar ently glad for the opportunity to air what she knew in that house there right in front of you they just moved in the other day an now one of ems gone aready stabbed his self i heard the paralytic yell when he did it an then two men came run nin out the back gate somethins the halfasleep girl wrong i told meself an sure enough i was right they was goin for the doctor i guess an well welltoo bad commented the young man restraining his excite ment with difficulty as the last fact made itself known did they return quickly i dunno but theyre back now i saw em in the yard this mornin too bad repeated knibbs simu lating the idle sympathy of the curi osity seeker however such things are happening continually arent they and nodding and tipping his hat he moved on picking his way between cans until he again reached the end of the alley but he looked cautiously back within a few minutes and finding the women one retraced his steps at the de brunner gate he found luckily no bolts to hinder his progress and entered quickly all he wanted wis a surreptitious look at the two men who had projected themselves into the drama so that should the occasion arise he might identify them he walked softly to the kitchen window and peered within the room was empty then suddenly he felt his ankles seized and he fell and was jerked through a narrow window into the dark evilsmelling cellar and before his senses had regained their equi librium his arms were trussed behind him with a strip of clothesline he heard a coarse laugh well fella that time yuh got fresh once too often didnt yuh at this moment the cellar door opened and a voice muttered whats wrong down there belden why the racket caught a snooper jim retorted flemings assailant triumphantly no uhhuh bring him up knibbss arm was seized in a rough grasp and he was thrust through the darkness with the other man behind him prodding he marched up the stairs into the kitchen mow he could see the two men clearly his captor was a short stocky fellow with a bull neck pugnacious jaw and jclosecropped red hair a typical prize fighter the othera tall lean chapaffected a little mus tache above a pair of hard lips and a stock around his neck the lean one faced him whats the big idea he demanded come on nowtalk what business have you here this was another poser for knibbs he knew he had exceeded his rights by prowling around the place of course he was doing it for the girls sake but he couldnt tell them that what could he tell them it seems i struck the wrong place he began ha ha ha i guess it does seem that way now doesnt it pretty weak pretty weak youll have to do better than that what will you do if i dont try turn me over to the police not a chance that would be an easy way out for you wouldnt it he winked slyly no fella unless you can explain i imagine old de brunner will keep you here awhile he likes company and he has a way with him that may win a confession from you suppose you come with me and see him now with the lean man leading and red head bringing up in the rear they trailed upstairs to a back bedroom bastian de brunner the paralytic lay with several pillows propped under his head reading a newspaper he looked up as they entered we caught this fella said the tail the halfasleep girl one as though he had had a hand in it prowling in the yard with his deeply set dark eyes de brunner studied fleming knibbs you were here last night werent you he asked knibbs refused to answer though he knew the sick man was not de ceived what do you want de brunner continued still knibbs maintained his silence bring him here the command came in a hard inflexible tone from among the pillows the lean spokes man and his companion leaped to obey they half carried knibbs to a chair be side the bed fleming found himself looking squarely into de brunners eyes go said the paralytic to the two men lingering in the background they went knibbs felt the others eyes boring into him and he glared back defiantly no words were spoken it was a bat tle of minds de brunners pupils seemed to glow like coals and his whole attitude was of striving for domination it came to fleming at that dramatic moment as he fought back that bas tian de brunner possessed hypnotic power and a thrill of fear coursed through him he suppressed it quickly concentrating every force into his star ing eyes he must hold his own he must not allow himself to fall under the spell absolute silence prevailed in the room slowly knibbs became conscious of a numbness in the legs it grew upon him an inch at a time crawling like a snake past the knee and upward he became desperate frantic he tried to shout for help but no sound issued from his lips he tried to tear himself from the chair and dash from the room but his muscles were immovable re fusing to obey the mental impulse vaguely knibbs marveled at this it always had been his impression that hypnotic control of an unwilling sub ject was impossible obviously de brunner possessed an extraordinary power then a sudden calmness swept over him as he realized that fear would only undermine his resistance thus adding to the others strength though this was his first experience with hypnosis and he was accordingly handicapped by a natural awe of mysterious un known forceshe now coolly rallied all his faculties to defense and once again clearly met de brunners gaze and then the door opened and lola entered bearing a tray it was this interruption plus flem ings rally that spelled defeat for the paralytics initial stupendous attempt at controlling his captives mind with out a word he removed his gaze and sank deeper among the pillows send jim up he said in a normal voice lola set the tray on a bureau and going to the door called softly below shortly the tall thinlipped fellow sauntered in make this man secure in the next room ordered de brunner i want to see him later neednt gag him un less he gets noisy the chap called jim yanked knibbs to his feet and then they were in a small bare room furnished only with a cot silently jim pushed his helpless charge on the cot stretched him out at full length and made him fast to the frame with stout ropes ably knotted i guess thatll hold you awhile he grinned as he departed v knibbs lay there the balance of the morning and far into the afternoon occasional footsteps passed the door the halfasleep girl going to or coming from the back room then there was a prolonged silence and knibbs thought he detected snoring flemings position had now become not only irksome but decidedly uncom fortable he was stiff from lying so long in one position and his legs and arms ached where the ropes had chafed them for he had done considerable twisting and straining in spasmodic en deavors to free himself quiet having descended upon the mysterious house hold he determined to make one last great attempt toward this end gather ing all his reserve force in the effort he drew his arms together and his knees up the ropes held he increased the tension gradually and felt a thrill of exultation his right arm was loose his freedom remained but a matter of minutes fleming knibbs was casting off the last of his shackles when his anxious roving eye observed the door opening silently transfixed with horror he waited a figure slipped in and approached the coti it was lola knibbs breathed easier he arose and held her arms why are you here ri he whispered what do you want for a moment in his highly excited state he doubted her the next moment he was ashamed of himself ive come to help you she replied softly de brunner is asleep jim and belden have gone to hire an auto they intend removing you to a place where there will be less likelihood of the police finding you by your atti tude and appearance de brunner be lieves you a wealthy manabouttown who finds sport in traveling around with detectives and he has designs bn youjust what i do not know he may hold you for ransom or it may be that he intends gaining mental con trol of youas he has me heshes the devil incarnate she concluded ve hemently you must escape him butisnt heyour father thank god no i was once at least of a good belgian familythe family of langlois but i lost every one and everything i held dear early in the war distracted i fled to aus tralia where i obtained employment as secretary to the manager of the smith amp townsend circus it was before the full seriousness of the war had been realized and many men particularly the older ones had no thought of entering service de brunner was one of these he was a versatile performera dare devil who provided half a dozen acts but one day he took a chance too many and dropped from a trapeze injuring his spine it was then he fell back upon and developed a latent hypnotic power and i became his slave doing his bidding no matter what oh i hate it i hate it if j too could only escape but i cannot he controls my body and my soul and i am fearful of him deeply interested and excited by this personal narrative from the girl whose sweet face he had learned to adore knibbs forgot his surroundings forgot his desire to escape and the need of haste and probed for more when you are under the spell are you fully aware of what you are doing lola he used her name reverently yes but faintly as in a dream oh i knqw i robbed you i recall the de tailshazily but i could not tell you last nightwith de brunner there and the officers being unable to do so himself he intends using you to carry out his crim inal designs making you his unwilling automaton and hiding from the law behind your skirts isnt that it she shrank back as though struck then strangling a sob braced herself of course it is plain yet no mat ter how much i fear the consequences the halfasleep girl of my acts i fear him more ohi i wish i weredead please dont say that things will come out right they must tell me lola have youcommitted manyah crimes at his bidding she sighed with relief no yours was the first it seems the idea did not occur to him until he decided to come to america i think perhaps jim put it in his head jim and red belden were canvasmenrough as they come and when de brunners savings were exhausted i see but who was the other man this john ulrich whowho died last night he too was a student of hypnosis a complacent hypocrite i have always detested de brunner became ac quainted with him in melbourne an other circus man cassius wynn in troduced them it may be too that the idea of crime through hypnotic con trol originated in him or in wynn i cannot say but de brunner was mas ter of them all despite his infirmity and somehow he found in me his most pliant subject tell me one more thing lola did john ulrich commit suicide or was he murdered i do not know she said looking at him with frank eyes and he knew she spoke the truth but he was no less un easy for he believed he knew now what had transpired the night before i had just returned and in a sort of stupor was mounting the steps when someone screamed i went in and lay the loot on the bed jim and belden were standing staring down at ulrich de brunner said something in a sharp tone then jim took the loot and both of them went out quickly i saw no more of them until this morning knibbs welcomed the projection of other suspects on the scene it relieved him to think that if ulrich was knifed either of the excircus men might have had a hand in it but he had recurrent thrills of fear for it may have been that lolas remembrance of that wak ing dream was incorrectand that after all she had committed no no heaven forbid he took a short step toward her i think i hear someone at the front door he hissed lets get out of here no ill not go alone you must come too lola ill care for you ill no it is impossible you were right there is someone below hurry you oh if i only might but i cannot i feel those invisible ties and theyre too strongfor me go now please the closing of the vestibule door reached them distinctly there was need of haste knibbs cast one last pleading look at the girl saw the use lessness of petitioning her further and determining to return later with the police department at his back stooped and kissed her full upon the lips then he threw open the door and stepped into the hall he had delayed a bit too long he stepped squarely in the path of the two canvasmen vi and then knibbs had his hands full he met jimthe lean fellow affecting the chaplin mustachewith a crashing blow in the face that sent him reeling back against his companion and he followed this up launching himself like a tiger at the others throat he made the silk stock his target hoping inci dentally that the force of his attack would carry them both to the floor but unfortunately belden had braced him self against the balustrade which caused the whole tide of battle to turn the halfasleep girl jim met his leap squarely and shortly both were on him there was a crash a great tangle of flashing arms and legs on the floor the sound of blows and at intervals above it all the awakened paralytics voice calling to lola knibbs was putting up the fight of his life and the fact that glorified his efforts was that he was not fighting for himself alone it wasnt only that he defended himself against kidnapping or resisted beingtrussed again on that cot it was something bigger and finer substantially he was fighting for the woman he loved but it was a losing fight belden being a bredinthebone pug and lean jim having been thoroughly educated in toughnessan education incomplete without a working knowledge of the fistic artknibbs chances were on the short end already his nose was bleed ing and his chin gashed then they piled upon him as in a football game crushing out his breath and he felt his surroundings slipping away when the unexpected happened to fleming metcalf knibbs prone on the hall floor with the two excircus men belaboring him the events which transpired now appeared more than ever dreamlike the rickety front door was thrust inward and an ava lanche of rushing footsteps came to his ears the pressure on his throat and chest was suddenly relieved and as he moved his head weakly he saw simeon dreer of the murder squad looking down at him through his ridiculously large green spectacles while all around swarmed bluecoated and brassbut toned forms hooray cheered knibbs weakly staring back at dreer with a silly smile he felt that he ought to get up and welcome his rescuers but for the life of him he couldnt move a muscle at an order from dreer an officer got him under the arms and then he found himself standing on shaking un certain legs one hand on the balustrade post the other moving across his fore head slowly his faculties revived out of the little room came officer yensen holding lola tightly by the arm knibbs saw red release that lady he bellowed or tried to bellow for he was still too weak to achieve the real thing yensen looked uncertainly first at knibbs then at simeon dreer simeon smiled tolerantly do as the gentleman requests yensen he said it was done whereat those remain ing in the hall proceeded to the rear room where the discomfited ruffians and their leader were under guard a charming gathering commented dreer at what hour is tea served sir your sarcasm is anything but appropriate said the paralytic from among his pillows pretending righteous indignation though his face was livid with wrath by what right do you force your way into my homeat this very moment a house of death dreer maintained his nonchalance if it were not a house of death i should not be here he replied though it appears fortunate for mr knibbs that i happened along when i did how ever his rescue was incidental and sec ondary i have come after the mur derer of john ulrich the murderer of ulrich what do you mean my english is clear i believe im sure you understand me de brunner if not i shall be more harshly explicit theres an ambulance waiting outside to take you away theres a police pa trol too and i might add if i may be so indelicate that were you not bed ridden youd ride in the latter you charge me the halfasleep girl sure with the murder of john ulrich ridiculous de brunners eyes narrowed to pin points not altogether continued simeon calmly you wont deny i take it that you were once a circus performer a versatile person as clever on the trapeze as at knife throwing he paused impressively the paralytics face blanched i see youre on he snarled how you did it i dont know and dont care youre a clever devil yourself but neither you nor the commonwealth shall have the satisfaction of adminis teringmypunishment it was over in a trice they saw his hand move quickly convulsively under the sheet a spasm of pain crossed his face his head jerked up the mus cles of his neck and shoulders tensed for a moment great physical strain was apparent there then he relaxed and his head rolled to one side dreer leaped forward and threw back the covers evidence of bastian de brunners act was sickeningly ap parent a daggerthe very one ulr rich was reputed to have brought from indiawas plunged to the hilt in his side quickly removing it he drew the sheet up over the still form the state is satisfied he said but how began fleming met calf knibbs for the hundredth time they were in dreers cluttered apart ment lola langlois was seated in one of the spacious chairs with fleming draped over its arm gazing longingly down upon her he had looked up just long enough to put his question to dreer the little man tinkered with his green spectacles a moment before replying i hardly know whether to tell you or not he said the truth is i shall probably sacrifice my professional rep utation in your eyes by doing so for the whole thing was so absurdly sim ple you see young knibbs after you left this morning i made a second care ful examination of de brunners letter from cassius wynn and found the en velope not torn open but carefully cut that implied one thing didnt itthat de brunner opened his mail with a knife of course to do that he has had at times a knife in bed with him suggestive eh but not complete doctor colliers statement now re turned to me that although paralyzed de brunners arms were free fur ther illumination came when i learned upon inquiry that smith amp townsend was not the name of a mercantile house but of a traveling circus some show men in town supplied me with final de tails they remembered bastian de brunner and his knifethrowing act what more would the densest sleuth require immediately a picture of john ulrich disputing de brunners power suggested itself perhaps ul rich threatened to expose him to the police at any rate a lost temper and a hurtling knife terminated the incident in tragedy it was ulrichs death cry not a call for help from de brunner that brought the police and there you have it you young knibbs supplied equally as important information as i however in learning of this strange fellows criminal intentions dreer arose abruptly and went to the phonograph and shortly the strains of les millions darlequin filled the room sitting raptly by the instrument he drank in every note after a moment he appeared to have been struck by a thought unexpect edly he cut the record off in its prime and stealing a side glance at the youth and maid now busily engaged in whis pered conversation he left the room exactly twenty minutes later his apartment bell rang of which also the halfasleep girl fleming knibbs and lola were bliss fully unaware then dreers green spectacles poked their way through the door fleming had his halfasleep girl in his arms no longer half asleep however for her lips were pressed to his in passionate surrender the little man said later he never saw and never expected to see again so beautiful so colorful a pic ture he coughed come in said knibbs without looking up its hjalmar yensen below ex plained simeon he says red bel den and the man called jim confessed to making off with your personal prop erty and named the fence they had employed he has recovered every thing young knibbs and wants to see you cant replied fleming briefly giving the chair a hitch so that its back was now to the door im busy tell him to leave the ingersoll and scarf pin in your care as for the walletlet him keep it and its contents of course whew and dreer yes invite him to the wedding we can have him watch the gifts you know the telltale band of yellow by hamilton graigie chickenfoot darragh with a skinful of cheap italian red wine lurched stiffarmed against the basement grille the warped treads of the ancient staircase creaked under the pressure of a careful footfallthen at what he saw outlined in the red circle of the single gasjet darraghs loose lips sagged openstark elemental fear strangled the outcry in his throathis blunt fingernails met like talons hooked into the basement gate a moment he stood thus while above him like a face without a body there floated against a black pool of darkness the dreadful head like in its semblance to nothing animal or human save in the broad porcine snout for a moment it held against the red glimmer of the gas which in a debased aureole seemed to pale to a flat tone less shading of unholy fire then it passed like the brief smoke of a wind blown torch darragh knew nothing of hippogrifs of leprechauns he might have called it a gargoyle a djinn had he known them by their names nor was he familiar with anubis the dogfaced deity of the egyptiansbut the head which he had beheld was kin to none of these now spreadeagled against the grat ing he fell suddenly sick the fumes of the cheap liquor he had drunk mounting in a swift dizzying surge against hie brain stumbling reeling clawing des perately outward behind him the mem ory of the thing which he had seen he gained the street and after a headlong flight of several blocks a park bench but his last conscious impression ere he sank into the stupor which would last until well into thenext days noari was of a face which seemed to float headhigh at the height of a tall man like a face without a bodya face un speakable inhuman and yetrealin its terrifying semblance halfdog half pigwhole horror and with it too ere he sank like a stone into the sea green silence of oblivion there persisted in his nostrils a savor a stench an acrid faint tang as though the very air itself had been tainted by the passage of that nameless terror ii detective sergeant sjnsabaugh off duty at two a m went up the steps of the varick street tenement wherein he kept bachelor quarters no was a malodorous building in a neighbor hood grim and chancy enough of its kind on one side there loomed the squat bulk of a stable on the other the towering outline of a chemical plant sinsabaugh however was thinking that it was his last night as a bachelor and consequently his last night in no for tomorrow he would be mar ried his last night but tonight despite the joyance of his mood there was something in the airhe felt it as a heaviness a dead ness a breathless weighty hush like the tension before storm but the august evening was close and sultry and yet as he mounted the worn steps into his minds eye unbidden there came a face writhen snarling the telltale band of yellow bestial vengefulthe face of duster joe masterman gang leader and all round crook as he had last seen it on the day that masterman had gone up the river to begin his tenyear term for loft burglary it had been sinsabaughs testimony which had convicted the gangster and masterman had sworn to get him you damn doublecrossing dick mas terman had promised ill get youand itll take me just ten years and a day and then but others had threatened sinsa baughthere was nothing novel in it it was just a part of the days work the vicious hatred of an underworld for all that typified the lawan hereditary and accustomed hatred accepted and understood today however duster joe was out no doubt he was even now showing himself in the haunts he had aforetime favored gaspipe looies doubtless for one it may have been habit that caused the policeman to feel for his service pistol as he paused in the en trance of the hallway but as he reached behind him his groping fingers suddenly became rigida faint hissing breath sounded from his lips as he felt his arm caught and held abruptly from be hind sinsabaugh pivoted as a boxer ducks under his adversarys lead whirling sidewise to facethe empty street then he grinned foolishly clucked with his tongue and released his coatsleeve where it had caught in the ornamental ironwork of the banister but he hesitated on the threshold glancing upward where above the black well of the stairway there hung a faint pinpoint of gas sinsabaugh was not imaginative but it was his last night as a bachelor almost it seemed as if that touch upon his coatsleeve had been a warning a message a summons laid upon him by the urgence of invisible fingers nonsense but the murky air continued heavy lifelessthe unwinking eye of the gas light somehow sinister malevolent as has been said sinsabaugh was not imaginative but now like a swimmer breasting a tide of impenetrable and soundless flood he mounted with slow steps the narrow stair and about him as he went forward the darkness closed in like a wall sinister threatening above and beyond him that pinpoint of gas like an evil star now curiously bluish flat unreal as a flickering painted flame sinsabaugh loosened his pistol in its armholster searching the thickpiled shadows massed beyond the fell circle of that brooding beacon he drew his colt if masterman awaited him some where upon that stair or upon the land ing above he would be ready for him hugging the wall for the more silent footing there afforded the policeman one hand before him feeling along the plaster the other holding his gun went upward steadily in the whispering gloom eyes strained against the black ness ears attuned to the throb bing silence like the beating of a heart the gas offered no illumination be yond its flat nimbus of pale flame but it seemed to sinsabaugh that if he could see nothing there yet lingered in that atmosphere an aura a something felt yet unperceived something or some one had been before him on that stair way if he or it had passed like the passing of a candles breath in the mal odorous dark at the stairhead he crouched swung up his arm and the bright lance of his pocket flash clove the darkness in a dazzling arc to right and left but there was nothing he halted at the door of his cham bersshruggedinserted the key in the the telltale band of yellow lock the heavy soundproof door swung widerthen following his en trance slammed shut behind him with a muffled clang there came a blow at the base of his brain like the impact of a mighty hand he staggered stumbled fell prone into a struggling choking hell which took him by the throat a rising tide en gulfing him with an acrid and intoler able stench his gun barked once at the convulsive pressure of his finger but it was a dead man who fired the shot iii officer williamson passing on his beat through varick street halted a moment before no a puzzled look on his broad goodhumored counte nance for a brief instant head in air he sniffed upward like a pointerthen his face gray he reeled abruptly against an area gate his hand at his throat coughing like a man in a fit his sidepartner turning the corner as it chanced at the sight of williamson doubled over the areagate came on at a run unslinging his pistol whats up jack he called then he too halted in midcareer falling to a stifflegged walk as an acrid stench smote him in the face in a blinding overpowering flood with his last re maining glimmer of sense his fist crashed into the glass of a firebox then he slumped into oblivion after a moment cries echoed down the street followed by theclang and rattle of the patrol men came up at a run halted turned backthen out of the confusion there arose the cry of gas but it was not until the arrival of the rescue squad that some order was ob tained out of the chaos when follow ing the arrival of the police and fire companies the sufferers were treated with a vaporized solution of milk of magnesia and williamson and his partner removed to the nearest hospital but as for detective sergeant sinsa baughhe was beyond their ministra tions gunson sinsaboughs partner and friend was stubborn in his belief that it was not altogether an accident which had been responsible for the death of sinsabaugh it was an accident all rightbut it was planned i tell you chief he was insisting to inspector murchison his immediate superior if youre thinking of masterman dave youre all wrong boy replied old dan hes not in pn thishow could he be anyway you know what it wasth gastank exploded in thompsons warehouse next door and wellthats vall right chief but how do you account for the fact that it got into sinsabaughs rooms first whythat it smashed through the party wallit is only a few inches thick there you knowand sin sabaughs rooms were right up against it sure inspectorbut this is what i believe gunson leaned forward earnestly tapping his knee with a blunt forefinger i believe that someone masterman for a good guessmade that hole in the wall pushed the tank through and then smashed it open in sinsabaughs rooms just a little while before poor jim came hometo die he paused masterman knew all about tanks and gashe was an expertbe fore he turned yeggan oxyacetylene blowpipe would have done iteasy for him the inspector grunted thats all very well dave he made chlorine antidote the telltale band of yellow answer but theres one little thing youve overlookedtheres one flaw in your argument well suppose master man or whoever it was got into the warehousebreached the wallrolled in the tankand let out the gas with a blowpipe well and good then how do you account for the fact that the murdererif there was a murderer was not himself gassed you know what chlorine is davenoit was just an accidentthats all there is to it gunsons jaw set stubbornly i cant answer that inspector he said im not going to tryjust nowbut as sure asas duster joe masterman came out of stir when his time was up jim sinsabaugh was murderedand you cant make me believe anything else he rose his face grim with purpose youll give me a weekworking alone he questioned thats all ill aska weekno more by way of answer the grizzled inspec tor bowed his head sinsabaugh had been one of his best men he liked gunson go to it my boy he said heavily andgood luck gunson took his leave but there was one thing he had neglected to men tion to inspector murchison a small thing if you willbut a clue which had furnished him with an ideaa some thing he had observed at the house on varickstreet on the day of the explo sion as the firemen had issued from that house of death this he had kept to himself but time was precious a day might be too littleor too much iv chickenfoot

abrupt drunken stubbornness twuz dago red winei aint never seen things with dago red wine misterit was there i seen itit moved the telltale band of yellow right under th gasit moved sure wellgnightgnight he turned swayed lurched out into the night a grotesque shambling figure misshapen formless as the long wav ering shadow which fled ahead cast by the sputtering arc at the corner and behind him behind he did not see that other shadow quick stealthy furtive for all of its bulka shadow with pred atory eyes and a traplike mouth moving like a great grim cat in the dark ness the shadow was nearer now and a little wind pattering in the dust like the feet of an invisible army of the dead stole forward on the wings of the night whispering ending with a quick shriek and a sudden hush a storm was brew ing in the west like figures in a dream pursuer and pursued entered a broad belt of dark ness like a deep well of night the clumpclump of the derelicts heavy brogans echoed for a moment across the cobbles at the intersection of an alley beyond it the revealing radiance of a street lamp he saw itand that was all for while the brooding blackness held there came the snick of steela choked gur glea muffled cry like the quick squeak of a mouse in the wainscota thud silence chickenfoot darragh had passed on into the dark v gunson earlier in the evening had paused a moment in his search for mas terman before the window of a store which had caused him to suck in his breath in the sheer surprise of a discov ery which he was certain dovetailed with the other clue which he had turned up at no he had heard the story of darragh at secondhand and now as he stared through the dingy pane of the old curiosity shop a sudden inspira tion took him by the throat whywhyof coursethat was it it had to befor gunson was confi dent that he had seen darraghs ghost or at any rate his counterfeit presentment leering at him through the dirtencrusted pane but a hurried questioning of the proprietor a spanish jew with a fondness for gesticulation in inverse ratio to his almost unintelligible speech gave him pausebut only for a moment gunson however made a rather peculiar purchase which he be stowed carefully in an inner pocket masterman after all need not have entered that shop in the second place he was far too shrewd a malefactor for that but the suggestion remained fantastic incredible as he owned it to himself to be and gunson at the cor ner of the street had had it corrobo rated so to speak when a wizened non descript rose up almost at his elbow darragh chickenfoothes at gaspipeshe said t tell youse hed wait and gunson without more ado had sought the derelict and the saloon of gaspipe looie perhaps five minutes after the departure of the vagrant and bhis shadow looie knew nothingof course that was to be expected gunson could spare no time to tighten the thumbscrews of his inquisition it was going on for eleven he hurried that rumhound darragh been here lately looie he had asked for a moment as he faced the swart syracusan behind his stained and bat tered bar gunson was conscious of a movement at his back a ripple an eddy a swift sudden current of electric tension in the stained and spotted mirror he could see but little but at looies reply of nawtheesa bum he goeightnine oclock and a look which he fancied that he saw in the b mnov the telltale band of yellow sullen furtive eyes of the saloonkeeper gunson whirled on his heel in a light ning pivot they came at him in a headlong rush silent no gunsknives out lifepre serversan evil ring of dark faces and clutching hands something hissed in a thindrawn whine at the level of his cheekthe knife clanged quivering in the mahogany voices rose bestial snarling croak him croak th bull a slungshot at the end of a swart hairy arm drove over his shoul der gunson had been trained up from the streets the alleys to a habit of light ning decision was added the perfect co ordination of muscles steelhard and willowwithed now he multiplied him selfthe fighting flame of his norse forebears rising to a baresark fury at the thought that these were the paid hirelings doubtless of the man who he was now convinced had murdered sinsabaugh his fist behind it the weight of two hundred pounds of iron hard muscle crashed into a grinning face the face was blotted out hemmed in as he was there was no time for gunplayit was fist and elbow against knife and club in a ferocious freeforall of which the issue could not be long in doubt he went to one knee under the glanc ing impact of a sandbag heaved up ward shook his head as a pugilist ral lies his whirling witsand then muscle and mind and body hurled himself in one furious headlong dive into and through that vicious ring of steel the spank of a cleancut blow was followed by a groaning curse and for the first time the crash of an automatic and the dull tsung of splintered glass a redhot needle seared through his cheek as ducking under the out stretched arm of the last of his attack ers his swinging uppercut was followed by a grunt and a slumping fall then he was through the swinging doors and away they would not follow himof that he was reasonably certainbut never theless he went forward at a lunging run jerking his service pistol from its holster as he approached the black maw of the alley thenhe stumbledwent to his hands and kneesfumbled a moment iri the darkness produced his pocket flash and in the radius of that clear beam he saw staring up at him from the cobbles the dead face with its staring eyes and brief twisted grin of chickenfoot darragh masterman secure in the knowledge that his decoy had by this time accom plished his purpose he had had gun son trailed for the best part ofthe eve ning went swiftly to a room which he kept in a slightly more respectable neighborhood this he had used often enough in the pastgunson was aware of it of course now with that healthy fatigue which is the prerogative of thieves and murderers as well as of honest men masterman flung himself on the bed he was dogtired so much so that he had removed his coat and hat merely before he was breathing easily like a man whose conscience had never been burdened with anything heavier than a hearty dinner as a matter of fact he had bent over to unlace his shoes but in the very act sleep had overtaken him if he had done so this story might never have been writtenbut he did not and he had had them on since the night of sinsabaughs death just twentyfour hours previous it had required no very special keen ness on the part of gunson to deduce that masterman would do the very thing that he had doneseek his room the telltale band of yellow the detective knew the address and anyway the obvious had its importance he would try here first at any rate slipping in quietly by the side door the room was over a saloon on a quiet street gunson unseen mounted the narrow stairlistened a moment at a door on the second landingturned the knob noiselesslyunlocked the door by turning the key from the outside with a long thin wire made for this purpose and entered and somasterman awoke at a daz zle of light which struck him full in the eyes he blinked owlishlythen sat upright with a jerk his hand reaching for his gun and then falling at his side at the crisp voice of the detective ive got you covered masterman the yegg cursed stared a moment wildly then his pig eyes snapped evilly as gunsons other hand reaching up ward behind him turned up the light gunson putting away his flashlight bent a hard eye on his prisoner i want you masterman he said evenly you rotten killerstep lively nowyou hear but masterman his composure re turning after that first amazed glance which had assured him that gunson was unarmed spoke sneeringly con fident youve got nothing on me gunson he said his heavy face with its blue shaven jowls assuming a satiric mask you cant prove nothing i haveor rather you have re plied gunson cryptically and i can prove everything he was beginning shake a leg now when abruptly there came a startling reversal not for nothing had masterman abode aforetime in that haven of the dwellers by nightparis of the thou sand eyes and among other accom plishments of that grim underworld of the apache most ruthless of his kind had he acquired a more than average efficiency in the art of la savate now at gunsons crisp command he came suddenly into action his right foot shod with its pointed boot swung upward in a bonesmash ing kick almost too deadly swift for the eye to follow aimed at the detectives face the impact of that bruising kick would mean unconsciousness a broken jawor worse but if masterman was consummate in the attack in the lightning upthrust of that deadly lunge like the swift swing of a javelin gunson was not un prepared there is but one parry for that abrupt passade a single deft movement an estoppel as swift and cer tain as the delivery of the kick it self gunson moved his head a scant half inch to the right as a boxer evades the whiplash of a straight left his hand at the same instant curving in a short arc his fingers closed like iron about the yeggs anklethere came a quick heave an abrupt explosion of movement and masterman crashed downward to the floor he glared defiance and implacable hate merged however with a certain respect but still he rasped out be tween panting breaths youve got nothingon megun sonyou thinkyoure wise dont you youvegot iton yourself re peated gunson then he leaned over the fallen man his words slow bitter dripping with the still acid of a corro sive vengeance youre slick mastermanbutyou overlooked one thing one little thing youre in boup to your neck heels over head ill say he barked a short grim laugh i had the motive all i needed was a clueand i got it at no while i was watching the firemen coming out you croaked darragh because hed seenthis the telltale band of yellow with his free hand he jerked from his pocket the purchase he had made at spanish joes thrusting it before mas termana sinister exhibit indeedthe ghost of darraghs perfervid dreams a gas mask of the french type long snouted like a boar terrifying indeed as an accessory to silent halls dim night and alcoholic imaginations but that isnt all masterman con tinued the detective its not a circum stance to thisthing youve fastened on yourself he stooped his voice rising to a note of triumph youre in masterman ankle deep he cried bending swiftly and jerking the halflaced shoe from the foot of the murderer yellow he exulted and thats your brand you shillaber for as acid acts on litmus so chlo rine impregnates with its revealing color change the substances which it touches across and across where the blue sock of the murderer came above the protection of the shoe there shone the stigma of an ineffaceable guilt the in eradicable inescapable indelible proof even as gunson had seen it on the stockings of the firementhe revealed and allrevealing stain a broad band of staring yellow the murder at lost creek by robert e hewes i strange things take place in the north country msieu but i have known none more strange or ter rible than what happened that night in the lonely cabin on lost creek the night the wind wolves danced ah msieu even now i can see the way that man lay there the knife blade gleamingwhat of it was not buried in his heart and feel the cold fear that crept down my back ugh but i should not dare tell this story to even you msieu was i not very sure you could never find the place it was a bitter night msieu that i was caught in a storm up in the height ofland country even the oldest woodsman is fooled sometimes and the storm came up even quicker than i had expected catching me many miles from my cabin i thought i knew my trap line well but after dark when the snow devils build strange shapes out of the drifts then tear them down again like children knock over play houses to inake some thing else familiar landmarks look queer and unnatural i had no compass and the stars were smothered by the clouds that shook loose the snow that floated down swirling steady suffocating filling up trails and leavening valleys until the northland was one great white plain with no end and no beginning ah msieu for long hours i floundered helplessly in that night of terriblie white ness utterly bewildered the soft snow underfoot clinging ih the manner of new fallen flakes seemed to be tugging at my boots striving to pull me down and the hard sleet pellets that flew through the air in a straight line stung my eyes till i was almost blinded and cut my face till the blood came then the frost crept in and seamed my skin with great aching cracks it is a terrible thing to be lost in the north country in a storm such as raced in a mad dance that night the cold was a cruel searching thing that crept into ones bones and sucked at the mar row i stumbled along blindly hour after hour and always that terrible cold clawed at my vitals and always i could hear the wind devils howling like hun gry wolves eager for their prey my throat burned fromthirst and eachtime i thrust a handful of snow in my mouth it was dry like chalk dust and i blew it out still unmoistened k i knew i was far off my trap line wandering somewhere far into the lonely north but i was even farther than i thought many times i fell and each time it was longer before i got up as i lay in the snow a strange warmth would creep over me and i grew drowsy why not sleeps i thought after all what did it matter and i knew that soon i should fall and not rise again then with the sleep imps tugging at my eyelids until i felt i could no longer resist them i saw a light i tried to cry out for joy but my throat was so parched i could utter no sound i could see that the light was in a lit tle creek some trappers cabin i the murder at lost greek thought and stumbled toward it madly rubbing my eyes with my fists to keep them open twice the light vanished and each time tears came to my eyes while i sobbed likea child then each time a lull in the whirling world of whiteness showed it again i thought i should never reach it and was sobbing from despair when suddenly i saw a shadow loom before me and i fell against a door the next moment there was a sudden blaze of light that blinded me and a blast of warm air against my face i was conscious of falling forward on a hard floor and of a womans fright ened cry then all was black ii when i regained consciousness my first feeling was of pain whitehot sear ing pain that darted across my face like little streaks of fire i moved and my whole body responded with a great swell of torture i could not help but cry out from it and jj heard a quick stir at the other side of the room where i lay in a bunk i turned my eyes and saw a cabin typical of the trappers shacks scattered throughout the north country with a rifle over the fireplace where pine sticks blazed and great bunches of furs hang ing on the walls rich glossy pelts of marten and fox then the girl bent over me msieu she was beautiful she was young not more than twenty i thought and her skin waswhite like new milk shaded as by rich cream from wind and sun her lips i should have sworn were painted had not the cut of her belted dress and the way her black hair was piled loose on her head told me here was a girl who knew little of civilization she was a wild thing of the woods sweet and beautiful like the flowers the hand she laid on my head was soft and cool and msieu i swear it under that touch the pain left as snow melts before the breath of the chinook in the spring where am i i asked you are safe she half whispered the words and threw a nervous glance over her shoulder toward the door then she smiled but still i saw fear in her eyes she brought me hot broth then and scalding tea that loosened a little the grip of the frost devils in my body and set the blood flowing more freely but still i could not get up for my legs were swollen and aching with the rheumatism in them the cold of the north does not easily let go its grip that day i lay and watched the girl move about the cabin working cooking over thd small stove in one corner sew ing or turning drying pelts that hung on the walls but always she seemed lis tening and at each sound at the door she started nervously often she would press her face to the window glass striving to pierce the ter rible murky whiteness outside for the storm still tore on in its mad dance and made the day almost dark as night so that the lamp had to be kept burning and as i lay there watching the girl who every now and then threw a half fearful glance at nfe or staring at the smoked rafters of the roof i had a feel ing that here in this cabin i had stumbled on some mystery of the northwhich hides so much that is terrible and tragic the wind screeched mournfully over the chimney and i got to fancying that at times it laughed yes msieu actually laughed like some fiend that watches and waits for the enacting of tragedy to satisfy its bloodthirsty humor and wondered what it was out in that white storm that the girl feared the day wore on and again the great darkness stole over the north country and blotted out the dim light that filtered through the falling snow and with the night the girls nervousness and fears the murder at lost creek seemed to increase the frost in my body was so loosened now that i could turn and watch her better several times i tried to draw her into conversa tion then after awhile she came and sat by my bed msieu she said watching me with her great dark eyes howhow did you come here there was that same fear in her voice and something else i did not know whether hope or merely wonder then i told her how i had got caught in the storm and became lost stumbling upon the cabin by accident ah she sighed when i had fin ished you are the first msieu to find it yes she went on at my look of wonder there is but one person in the world besides myself who knows this cabin is here even i do not know the way out of this hidden countrylost creek i call it the door rattled then and her face wentsuddenly white as the floating flakes outside and she threw a quick look of fear over her shoulder she turned to me again with a little shiver of relief it was only the wind she faltered smiling feebly i raised myself on my elbow then and seized her hand that lay on my bunk like the hand of a child that seeks com pany in the dark listen mamfselle i cried tell me what is it you fear oh no no please monsieu i can not she drew away with fear alive in her eyes but i was persistent and womanlike in her heart she did want to confide in someone and thenrshe told me she was an orphan left when she was very small in the care of an uncle who had always been what people call queer she told how she had known him to sit for a whole day at a time silent and moody taking no note of what went on about him in the winters he trapped but he made no friends and in fact so much as was possible avoided con tact with other people she loved him for he was her only relative and cared for him tenderly and though there were other people who were inclined to be frightened of him he was like a child in her hands a great affection for her grew in his heart as the years went on and he came to be restless and uneasywhenever she was out of his sight as though he was afraid he should lose her they lived the two of them far up in the heightofland country a many days journey from any post but i have said she was beautiful msieu do you know there is about a beautiful woman something that draws men even from great distances like gold ah msieu nature can not long hide her two greatest treasures so it was that a lover came he was a trapper who stopped at the cabin one spring as he was on his way south with his winters catch of furs and there he saw the girlrher name ah msieu that i never knew after all names matter so little in this world those two loved each other from the first and therefore that summer the young trap per came often to the cabin the uncle saw all this and there awoke in his mind that latent fear that the only thing that had ever awakened a bit of affection in his heart was to be taken away fromhim he threatened the trapper but the young men of the north are brave the lover laughed at him then the devil that had been brooding in the uncle these years awoke and stirred to life the man became a maniac with but one idea in his dis torted mind that to keep the girl from being taken away from him in his young days the uncle had once trapped in a country far to the north the murder at lost greek where few men ever go ana in that sad and lonely country there was known to him a hidden creek where one might live for long years and never see so much as a wandering indian and it was that one night the girl was awakened from her sleep to find the mad uncle com manding her to rise and come with him he had a canoe packed with their be longings ready in the river near their cabin she looked but once into his eyes and saw there the devil light that told her it was useless to resist she knew he loved her in his savage selfish way and would not harm a hair of her head so long as she obeyed him but if she did not she knew he was mad when morning came they were far up the river and there were none behind who knew whence they had gone the girl had tried to leave some message in hope that her lover would find it and follow but the madman suspected she would try such a ruse and watched making it useless for three days they paddled up the river and the fourth day the uncle transferred all the duffle to the bank and sunk the canoe then for three more days they trav eled far up into the north twisting and turning in strange regions where the girl lost all sense of direction and knew she should never find her way out the fourth day they came to the little cabin on the hidden creek where the uncle had trapped one winter and where no man had been since he repaired the house and there they lived the girl desperately hoping that some day her lover who she knew was scouring the northland searching for her would find the place ah msieu she said to me and her dark eyes glowed with the light of faith some day he will come i know the madman too knew the lover would search until he found his sweet heart or died and always he watched the rims of the surrounding hills his hand caressing his gun and the devil light gleaming in his eyes and gradu ally there grew up in his heart a hatred of all mankind because one man had dared to covet the only thing he loved and now in his perverted mind he came to fancy all men were leagued to gether aiding the lover in his designs and in his sleep he would mutter ter rible threats that boded of evil to what ever man should set foot in the valley so that msieu was what the girl feared for the uncle was out running his trap line when the storm broke and now she fearedhe might return at any time and if he should come back and find me i tell you as i lay there in that cabin i cursed the frost demons that held me helpless sometimes as i listened to the terrible whine of the storm and felt the cabin shake in its grasp i thought that perhaps he should not return that the howling wind wolves would have their prey but then in my heart i knew it could not be so for evil in a man makes him hard to kill if he finds you here msieu sobbed the girl he will kill you i tried to quiet her fears but there were too many in my own heart for my words to be convincing that night i came to know fear with the girl i started at each sound at the door and terrible imaginings crept into my mind the girl sat by the fire and sobbed softly while i lay awake watch ing listening and always i could hear those wind devils laughing actually laughing they were waiting then after a long while i fell into a fitful sleep and had bad dreams it was with a start that i awoke sud denly conscious of a mans voice ah that voice was born of the wind devils that howled outside in mad glee deep and rolling it was savage like a mad dened bull mooses but rising above it the murder at lost creek highpitched and stabbing like a dagger i heard a womans frightened scream i opened my eyes and for an instant i saw the girl back to me struggling fiercely beside my bed and heard her crying desperately no no uncle you shall not harm him you shall not found us eh i heard the rumbling bellow of the bulllike voice think hes going to steal you for that damned young upstart eh ahh well see then he laughed laughed like the bloodthirsty wind devils outside suddenly cthe girl was flung aside and i saw a towering hulk of a man looming over me huge foreboding like a great pine tree towers over one in the dusk his face was close to mine and after these many years i can see that face even now and shudder as i did then it was a round evil face with a black beard that fell almost to the great chest and with long shaggy eyebrows but it was the eyes that were so terrible gleaming with the light of the devil they were the eyes of a madman he laughed again then and i felt his rank tobaccoladen breath on my fac so he cried you came at last eh but youshall not go see and as he raised his hand i caught the gleam of the knife then i forgot i was weak with rheu matism forgot the frost demons that held me down and with a mighty effort tried to rise the devils that still lurked in my bones growled and sank their claws afresh in my vitals i gave a cry and fainted even as i saw the reflection of the firelight running up and down the knife blade in glittering streaks but before i went i heard a strange thing heard it dimly as in a dream it was the girls voice highstrung and poignant and there was no fear in it but a gripping something that came from the heart she was crying out a name madly hysterically jean jean that msieu was all i heard iii when i again came to i was lying on the bunk as before and for a mo ment i thought i must have been dream ing then i saw the pine fire blazing and noticed the hearth was piled high with sticks in the manner of a fire stocked to last a long while and at the side of my bed a small table held food enough for several meals i also felt that my face had been freshly treated with grease and bandaged i moved cautiously and found that the frost devils had loosened their hold on me and i could use my muscles freely soon i knew i should be well as ever then i missed something it was the howling of the wind wolves outside and i knew the storm had finished its mad dance and blown its life away then with a start i thought of the girl and the madman and the glittering knife i called but no one answered yet i felt there was some presence be sides myself in that room i raised myself on my elbow and ah i shallnever forget what i saw or the cold fear that ran down my back like an icy finger as i looked he lay there on the floor in the center of the cabin the madman and his lips were parted showing his teeth in a hide ous snarl and his eyes ah msieu the devil had left them now they were cold and colorless like the ice on the frozen rivers but what fascinated me was the knife that gleamedwhat of it was not buried in his heart and the blood that was thickened in a little pool at his side i got one leg out of the bunk then the other and staggered to my feet for a long while i stared at the horrible thing lying there on the floor with the hideous the murder at lost greek snarl frozen on the lips then again i thought of the girl i stumbled to the door and threw it open for a moment i saw only the great snow field that stretched off to the horizon dazzling white in the sunlight then i saw some thing else msieuwhat i am going to tell you may sound strange but i swear by the saints it is true you may say that providence does not bring about such coincidences as to lead a heartbroken lover wandering over the northland to a hidden cabin on a stormy night just in time toah say what you will msieu i swear it is true that there streaking off across the white plain like twin threads i saw two trails a mans and a womans that spun away toward the south where they merged with the horizon haze in the distance there is little else to tell my strength came back quickly as it does to us who live outdoors and so soon as i was strong enough i dug a grave back of the cabin and there i buried the mad man with the hideous snarl frozen on his lips the second day i packed provisions and followed the two trails that spun away toward the south and so treach erous was the country that i had gone but a few miles until looking back i was sure i should not be able to again find the hidden creek were the trails obliterated lost creek the girl called it and it was well named nevertheless i carried with me the knife i had drawn from the madmans heart and which i had seen was not his own three days later i threw it through an airhole into the racing asthasbasca where the two trails i had followed ended on the clear ice of the windswept river then with my sense of direction restored i turned toward my own country that msieu is all i know of the mat ter the guerilla by clinton harcourt i his name was joe cragen his family were poor but respect able old man cragen was a lawabiding citizen and mother cragen a benevolent whitehaired wom an whose fondest recollections were of the county mayo environment played a large role in the drama of joe cragen his family lived on tenth avenue and before he was in long trousers he was running with a gang of pickpockets before he was nineteen cragen was shorty mccabes first lieutenant when a cop cut short the career of the mccabe with a half inch of lead leadership of the dreaded power house gang was cragens by right of inheritance it was then that he became a guerilla under his aggressive guidance the power house band flourished and grew opulent the strip of territory they commanded adjoined the waterfront of the hudson river and existed in a state of terror timid citizens shunned it with a shudder the policeman that patroled it walked in the center of the streets directing cautious glances at the housetops when gang fights were in progress the quarter huddled in cellars but battles were few the power house gang was seldom attacked so long as joe cragen kept to his own district all went well for a year he sat on the throne of the power house band and ruled with a mailed fist but there fell an evil day when in a bandit taxi he ventured into lower manhattan he had made plans to stickup the paying teller of an east side bank the plot worked easily but the nerve of the bank employee had not been considered in the pistol duel that resulted cragen feinted the teller out into the opent braved the mans fusillade shot him four times from the doorway leaped back into the pirate taxi and vanished the same night cragen crept through the meshes of farflung police nets arid rode the cushions to chicago leaving the power house gang to be broken up by the police ii on an august night four years after the bank stickup and the flight of cragen a lean grayhaired individual in a rusty blue serge suit cracked shoes and greasycap entered wolgers west street hotel crossed the ypcarpeted lobby floor and moved to the desk that abraham wolger presided over where he spoke briefly how much for a flop wolger pulled the glasses up on his curved nose rubbed a hairy ear and af ter plumbing his inquisitor with a long stare frowned thoughtfully a quarter for the night he replied slowly the stranger produced two dimes and a nickel wrote the name andrew hardy in a grimy register and was led off to one of the small cotadorned coops the hotel was honeycombed with wolger staring after him in the room he had rented for the night the man who called himself an drew hardy closed the door and sat down on the bed for a time he stared at the floor with narrowed eyes finally the guerilla he took an envelope from a pocket of his shabby jacket unfolded it and with painstaking care spilled out a quantity of something that resembled talcum powder he dropped it on the crease in his hand made by thumb and forefinger and sniffed it up his nose in the manner of one taking snuff replacing the envelope in his pocket the man flexed his arms and sighed con tentedly he reached in a hip pocket and lifted out a small blackjack with a thong about the neck of it for the wrist he examined it with obvious satisfac tion wet his finger and rubbed away some dark stains and small pieces of hair from its blunt leathercovered nose he dropped it back into his hip pocket and stared at the floor again several minutes later he closed the door of the cubicle and went down into the lobby making his way to wolgers desk where can i get a snifter of kick he inquired shortly as he spoke he made a peculiar sign with the thumb and little finger that was significant to the proprietor of the hotel versed in the mute language of crook dom downstairs wolger directed frankly searching the mans face with a puzzled expression first door to the left at the end of the hall the one he addressed nodded and slouched away he traversed a short hall opened a door and descended into a basement where illicit drinks were be ing served to furtive faced clients by a lantern jawed waiter who wore a filthy apron the man seated himself at an empty table and rummaged through his pockets until he found a few pieces of silver he laid them down on the table and waited until he attracted the attention of the waiter rye bill back me up a wash of it and never mind the water a half pint of fiery moonshine was set before him the man consumed a third of it pulled his greasy cap well over his eyes folded his arms and slouched back in his chair for ten minutes or more he sat stir less after a while he became aware of the sound of chair legs being drawn along the cement floor garments brushed him and presently the words of a whispered conversation drifted back to his ears theres nothing to it the voice of a man said tip regan looked it over and said its as safeas a church the old woman locks the store up and crawls into the feathers at ten bells a second voice containing a note of warning sounded soft pedaltheres a gin hound back of you andrew hardy as he called him self felt he was being intently scrutinized stewed to the scalp the first speak er said after a pause as i was saying tips got a freight as job in the pennsy yards and is pulling silk he passed the word to me it looks good whats the dope the other asked in guarded accents wheres the store at what time do we take a shot at it there came the clink of glasses and a cough its called the empire fish market the first speaker resumed its up on eleventh avenue corner of fortyninth street the old moll that runs it is a widow woman she knows a pollie and a couple of big restaurants have been taking all of her fish tip says shes got about two grands salted away in a drawer under the counter in the store the old girl is foxy and has an electric bell on the drawer she thinks that will keep it safe the man walked past the building turned and after a quick glance about entered the tenements hallwaypage the guerilla glasses clinked again for a minute or two sounds mighty good the second speaker muttered im with you when do we start up the man who called himseilf andrew hardy strained his ears not before one oclock the first voice answered heres the way we go in his words were drowned out by a gusty rumble of conversation from across the room almost at once a party of men entered the basement and took chairs noisily at the table to the left of the listener the selfstyled andrew hardy wait ed no longer he climbed to his feet and in imitation of one very drunk lurched to the door he threw it open with a maudlin backward glance that mentally photographed the faces of the two con spirators closed it and hurried up and out into west street where a young moon sailed low in a daylong heat haze a pulse of excitement began to beat within him the hour was not quite midnight and more than sixty minutes still remained before the two men of the basement would put their plans into effect he fumbled in his pockets until he found a fivecent piece turned east to the first avenue beyond and arrived in time to leap to the running board of a north bound surface car iii at the corner of fortyninth street the man alighted and turned toward the river the street he passed through was squalid with drab tenements marching cheek to cheek in dingy array the gut ters were filled with refuse awaiting the prowling garbage remover the iron fire escape landings were heaped with disordered bedding upon which heat wilted children tossed the street was tawdry and pallid with no single redeeming feature yet the man who passed along it darted eager glances to the right and left his atti tude was almost that of one returning to a beloved spot after a long absence on the corner of eleventh avenue he slowed his pace halted altogether and took stock of his surroundings the junction of street and avenue was de serted save for a nocturnal stationer closing his shop no brass buttons glint ed in the lamplightthe section was wrapped in the heavy stillness of an august midnight with footsteps that displayed no in certitude the man approached a fish store directly opposite from where he stood it was one of three shops in a red brick tenement a narrow lightless entrance and hallway separated the fish market from the other two shops the man walked past the building brows drawn together turned and after a quick glance about entered the tenements hall way some knowledge of the construction of stores seemed to be at his command to the left of the buildings narrow wooden stairway was a single doora door that opened into the back room or rooms of the fish market the man tested its china knob found it did not respond to his touch and lighted a match cupping it in the palm of his hands he held the light aloft per ceived the glass transom over the door smiled faintly and plunged his light out in the murk he fumbled for his fold ed envelope he dropped some more of its powder on his hand and inhaled it he listened for a minute before mounting a few steps of the stairway when he was opposite the transom he leaned over the rail of the stairway and pushed it in with the palms of both the guerilla hands to his infinite relief it swung in squeaking rustily he listened again and made his way down the steps he wound a dirty handkerchief about the china knob of the door removed his shoes placed his left foot on the knob and caught the ledge of the transom with sinuous agility he drew himself up and over the sill wriggling through the small space made by the open tran som and dropping with scarce a sound to the floor on the inner side of the door it was too dark to ascertain what his surroundings were so he stood motion less straining his ears suddenly so close that he recoiled he heard a sibi lant sigh and the creak of bed springs he drew his brows together again and fingered his lips it was impossible that he had erred in all probability this room was a chamber adjoining the fish store the bedroom of the old woman the two conspirators had spoken of he de cided there must be a door near at hand that opened into the store itself and de termined to locate it forthwith with the deep even breathing of the sleeper in his ears the man followed his sense of direction and groped a careful way forward with each step his blood warmed within him two grands in crook parlance meant two thousand dol lars it was a sum worth striving for with that amount of money in his pos session he could fulfill long cherished ambitions he could buy enough dope to lead him into a castle of dreams put the city he had entered so recently from him and journey to the coast the key to all wishes was before himin a hidden drawer under the counter in a fish store the outstretched hand of the man slid over another door they touched a knob and turned it the second door did not yield and was keyless he stood still for a minute thinking the woman who owned the shop was canny she evident ly understood the difficulty of breaking in from the outside and by locking the connecting door and secreting the key made doubly difficult the felons prog ress the man turned his head in the direc tion of the bed he must possess the key that opened the door or the expedi tion would be fruitless he drew the leather covered billy from his pocket and slipped the thong about his wrist he debated briefly whether it was ad visable to wake the sleeper and demand the key or to use the blackjack imme diately and search for it at his leisure his ruminations were abruptly terminat ed by a sharp inquiry that cut the gloom like a knife who is there the man stiffened his fingers wind ing about the neck of the blackjack the bed creaked again and two soft foot falls sounded one after the other he strove to pierce the curtain of blackness with his eyes but failed in some way the sleeper had become aware of his presertce he heard hurried rattling breathing that was an indication of fear his fingers about the blackjack grew still tighter the dull patter of feet moving pre ceded the rasp of a key being turned warily in the door that opened into the hall of the tenement even though frightened the woman was not losing her head she intended preparing an exit if escape became necessary and a vantage point from which she could both survey the bedchamber and raise a quick alarm if her suspicions proved to be correct a dozen rapid steps carried the man across the darkened expanse of room he brought hitjiself up short as he col lided with an unseen figure clutching a withered throat with his left hand and effectually preventing a scream from surging to lips opened to receive it at the same moment he thrust the weight the guerilla of his body forward in such fashion as to put himself next to the door and forced the woman away from it wheres the key to the other door he released the pressure of his hand on the throat sufficiently to permit a weak voice trembling with terror to croak a panted answer underthemattress savage elation brought the teeth of the man together with a grinding click he began to force the woman across the room laughing at the puny feeble blows she struck wildly at him he dug his fingers deeper into the thin throat an old lust to kill swimming in his blood he strove to see how far he might choke her before insensibility came laughing louder at the faint moans and series of agonized gasps that came just before the mad futile blows ceased and she stag gered in his clutch then wearying of the sport and mind ful that time was flying he used his blackjack twice flung his victim across the bed and delved under the mat tress iv the following morning abraham wolger at the desk in his west street hotel looked up from the third morn ing edition of his favorite paper and addressed a burly youth who was sweep ing out the uncarpeted lobby with a worn broom look it jake he said stabbing the newspaper with his stubby finger last night was a murder in a fish store up on eleventh avenue two thousand dollars was stole and the old woman what owned it got murdered aint it funny it says right here she was mrs cragen the mother of that guerilla what croaked that guy in a bank four years ago this monththe same guy i was telling you looked just like a man who registered here last night and never showed up again the youth with the broom fingered a twisted ear was there any pinches made he asked succinctly the proprietor of the hotel looked back at his paper yesthe cops grabbed the two guys as they were coming outa coupla friends of tip regan they were they didnt find the two grands on them the paper says but what difference does it make the chair for both of them sure honest jake guys like that who would croak a widow woman ought to get burned in the chair two bells by harry g hervey jr at two bells the boy determined to commit murder it was no swift decision on the night the libertine lifted anchor at melbourneand black mi chael flogged him with a rawhide lash the desire to slay had been impregnated in him a terrible sore whose putrify ing poison daily seeped into his blood and brain quite suddenly standing there in the shadow of the longboat he perceived the death of his soul black michael was responsible he had inoculated him with a dreadful serum of evil that wiped out the germs of his strength had proceeded while he was in this weakened condition to loot his being of all finer instincts for that black mi chael must die the avenger that was his role to night he would become the champion of his slain self and write in crimson the final chapter of a bitter story as he stood there on the deck sway ing with the drunken pitch of the two masted squarerigged vessel it all came back to himcame back for the millionth time with a burning sharp ness that made him visualize as though etched with steel upon his brain the lamplit australian waterfront the slinking shadows along the quay made him feel as if experiencing again the sickening emotions following the blow and the return to consciousness in the hold of the trading brig bound for eleven degrees south of the equator ill break you yet boyill grind you under my feet that was black michaels threat when he sought to resist the bigfisted rumloving skipper then followed the first flogging stripped and lashed to the beam the recollection of it was gall in his mouth after that life for him consisted chiefly of two things the lash and rum the whip to break his body the liquor to break his brain these were linked by labors so offensive so repellent that he welcomed the hours of drunken sleep when for a brief while his senses were drowned in oblivion in all this darkness there were two candles the friendly attitude of the first mate and the queer companionship of the brigs mascot kerachi a rajpu tana parrakeet before the vessel reached the white coral walls of papeite black michael demonstrated that he could keep a threat the boy was broken the slen der thread between strength and weak ness snapped like the string of a fine instrument struck by brutal hands and when the libertine cast moorings in the blue lagoon of the tahitian capi tal he was still aboard with a bruised body and a bruised mind knowing in his tortured heart that some day when the courage was given him he would kill the master of the brig from tahiti the ship passed through the coral traps of les isles dangereux sailed around the low archipelago into the phosphorescent waters of the mar quesas to hivaoa and there in atuona valley he received the gift of couragefrom the white lotus b mnov two bells three days agothe one time he had gone ashorehe had seen her clinging to the doorframe of a thatched bamboo dwelling old babaches kid a leper he heard someone say and she had smiled at him an hour after that when the long boat was putting away from the beach and the tawny maidens of hivaoa ran out waistdeep in the green bay to wave farewell she was there her gold hair falling like glinting fire about her pale spfaydashed face ia ora na i te atua with the marquesan girls she sang that farewellthis white lotus that he had found dying in the mulch of the south seas the sight of her was to him a light that pierced his poisoned vaporclung brain and because he had seen her this pallid leperchild he knew that the hour had arrived when the master of the libertine must pay the penalty for having murdered his soul yet what would she think if she knew but she woxild never know hiva oa dreaming its eternal dreams beneath the brooding thunders of temetiu had already slipped into the pastand in its dreams she lay a part of them he shuddered again yes he would kill black michael he was below in his bunk nowdrunk as usual with the skipper gone the first mate cardi gan would come into commandand then he crept across the wet deck and down the companionway a door in the rear of the lazarette which was just off the main cabin ad mitted him to a passage amidships be neath the deck leading forward to a space in the focastle where he and five others of the crew bunked in the bulkhead door he paused a sooty slushlamp swung from the blackened beam cast sluggish light upon six bunks arranged in double tiers along the bulkhead it was a foul place reeking of vile sea odors two of the bunks were occupied the lower tier of one supported the hulk ing body of a bulletheaded mulatto clad only in short breeches while above him lay the boatswain a creole from new orleans they were both asleep and breathing heavily thrusting the weapon under his belt he retraced his steps along the passage amidships and in the gloom of the main cabin groped toward black michaels quarters a terrible fear laid frigid fingers upon his heart as he reached the door for a full minute he stood transfixed to the spot his breath caught in his throat then he grasped the knob turned it and the door swung open within the closed portholea pale eye of dreadstared at him the air was closetainted with rum and human flesh he listened for the sound of breathing but only the mo notonous murmur of the bilge water and the creak of straining timbers could be heard he drew the knife from beneath his belt the leper child came to him then a blinding flash of spiritual pal lor the shining recoil of hisdead self that sprang through the darkness of his soul and smote him paralyzed for the moment but black michael must die he reached the bunk looked down upon the indistinct sprawling figure a wave of hysteria swept him swamping his cottrage he wanted to run to throw himself upon his mattress and weep out the sorrows that twisted his heart but a swing of the blade a sick ening sound and it was finished he never released his grip on the hilt two bells held it as though it were a member of his own body withdrew it and fell against the door for some time he lay with his shoul ders pressed to the panels at bay fac ing the specter of himself but when at length the fearparalysis released him he burst out of the door closed it raced through the main cabin and up the com panionway the air on deck seemed to lift from his brain the mantle of a loathsome vapor here in the tropic moisture of the night where the wind swelled amongst the waving spars his reason returned swept over him like a cold and shuddersome flood he glanced fore and aft the decks were deserted but for a lone figure on the poop deck the watchhe could recognize hima form planted as a piece of statuary upon the wheelgrat ing he slunk past the forward hatch and climbed the ladder to the forepoop a stinging spray flung over the bowsprit by a long gust of wind struck his face sharply it seemed to awaken him to the fact that he still gripped the knife and with a shudder of repulsion he let it fall to the deck planks for an in stant he stood above it looking as one fascinated upon the glinting thing then he touched it with his bare foot shivered and pushed it across the deck until it disappeared over the bow a sobbing breath was drawn from his throat he turned and fled down deckas one pursued by the horrors of the nethermost hell upon reaching his quarters he found the mulatto and the creole still asleep the slushlamp hung from the blackened beam swaying with the heave of the brig a chill started him to trembling and he knelt beside his bunk removing a flask from beneath the mattress as he lifted it to his lips a sound behind him made him pause with it in midair get below you dirty lubbers bahdsoodai he turned his head sharply neither the mulatto nor the creole had altered his positionbut perched upon the beam was a feathery green body his rigid muscles relaxed as he recognized kerachi his friend the rajputana par rakeet he raised the flask to his mouth the vile tahitian rum was like vitriol sear ing a path from his throat to the pit of his stomach it choked him but when he ceased coughing he took another gulpanother step lively lads adrush tam two bells mate two bells those words startled him that was just before he he shuddered swallowed quantities of the liquid fire drained the bottle and fell with his face buried in the reek of the mattress the flask slipped from his nerveless handstruck the floor with a distant thud o god he moaned hot tears burned his cheeks as he lay there sob bing in the awful abandonment of drunken grief all hands aft shrieked the parra keet then began to swear in hindus tani and mandarin that was the last thing he heard the grotesque profan ity of the little bird like a barque severed from its mooringlines his brain was carried downstream on the current of slumber his labored breathing had hardly joined that of the other occupants of the foul place when the big mulatto sat up cautiously a stealthy anticipatory smile spreading over his negroid fea tures he rose the movement bringing into visible play the thick heavycorded muscles beneath the bared brown skin stood an instant looking up at the two bells sleeping boatswain crept across to the boys bunk and slipped one hand under the mattress ii the sharp cutwater of the libertine broke the phosphorus into javelins of green brilliancy her yards slightly checked ran with easy motions beneath bellied topsail while the decktimbers creaked and groaned as the vessel wal lowed in the heavy sea to cardigan the first mate stand ing alone at the wheel firmly gripping the spokes at right angles these sounds blended into a fierce savage tune that vibrated responsive chords in his sea mans being since six bells he had been on watch listening to the lawless song of the sea and except on two occasions when the cabin boy emerged from the main com panion the decks had been deserted during this time at thought of the boy the first mate felt a tinge of sympathy poor chap only seventeen and shanghaied but after all life was a rather grim affair it had been none too kind to him he four bells jangled out a moment afterward he saw the big body of bjorasen the second mate emerge from the rear companion wheres the captain inquired cardigan as the norwegian a great hulk of sunburnt physical manhood reached his side and took the wheel a faint smile traced itself on the big blondes face below in his quarters i suppose sirwith a belly full of rum cardigan did not smile merely nod ded saying stearns will relieve you and moved down the ladder to the main companion upon reaching black michaels door he entered without knocking in the vague halflight supplied by the port hole he could make out the skippers huge body sprawled full length in the berth the odor of rum was heavy on the air captain he called gripping one shoulder and shaking it captain wake up hullo the latter exclamation was brought forth as his hand accidentally brushed the cheek of the recumbent man it was cold clammy he quickly felt the heart an oath left his tongue he fumbled in the pocket of his pea jacket and withdrew a box of matches igniting one he lit the slushlamp and in the better light examined the body dead he muttered to himself with a semiprofessional air two inci sionsone just below the heart the other above though cardigan was not yet thirty five there were times when he seemed at least forty this was such an occa sion about his lips was a grim tight ness a truculence that suggested inflex ible metal beneath the bronzed exterior struck in the dark ill wager he said to himself running his fingers through his grayshot hair whilst he continued his investigation dead about an hour or im and two distinctly different instruments one a straight blade the other curved at one time he had studied surgery in the days before the gray appeared in his hair he but that was an ancient story a sheaf torn out of his life and laid away in a crevice of his memory after the first surprise caused by the discovery he experienced a feel ing that bordered on satisfaction no love had ever existed between him and the master of the brig and after the boy was shanghaied at melbourne there was open antagonism a hostility that resulted in cardigans decision to leave the libertine at the end of the re turn voyage two bells so black michael was dead he mused murdered at this juncture his eyes involun tarily lowered were captured by a bright object on the floor he stooped picked it up and perceived that it was a small curved bladea murderous malay knife that bore ugly stains as he recognized it he felt a shock like nothing short of a volt of electricity for the weapon was his own a relic of the days before the gray appeared among his dark hairs there was a slim darkeyed malay girl down on the drowsy shores of the archipelago where the restless surf drums to the tune of lawless love and but that too was an ancient tale laid away in lavender with the other poignant recollections she had given him the knife this brown maid en as she lay dying in his arms and it was the only tangible remembrance of a still smouldering passion his face settled into sterner lines this was undoubtedly the blade with which the incision was made but how had it been obtained from his cabin and why was it used the most logical answer for both was treachery his first impulse was to wipe the soiled blade upon his handkerchief but he refrained for cardigan and dis cretion were synonymous bloodstains often proved incriminating no innocent though he was he de cided he dared leave no evidence where it might be discovered and used against him this weapon was sufficient proof that he had an enemy aboard he first considered throwing the knife into the sea but this proposed means of disposal he immediately dis missed he would sooner separate him self from an arm than the weapon he would hide it there were many places on the ship where so small an object would never be foundand the place that appealed to him as one less fre quented was the paintlocker after covering the body with a sheet he quitted the cabin locked the door and made his way to the paintlocker a moment later the malay knife lay hidden behind a pile of cans and car digan went up on deck an impalpable mist was drifting in from the dark waste of waters smooth ing out the sharp lines of the libertine and giving to her the look of a phan tom craft as she rode the steadily in creasing swell her lights burning haz ily like nebulabelted planets in the fog near the forward hatch cardigan encountered stearns the midshipman a sallow youth of twentyone or less go below and send the hands aft mr stearns the mate ordered every man jack of them then he moved to the poopdeck where bjorn sen stood as one petrified at the wheel bjornsen he began the captain has been murdered stabbed twice i have sent for the crew to notify them im in command now and i want your hearty support the norwegian nodded his stolid face unaltered five minutes later the crew was as sembled below the poop a nervous shuffling crowd looking up with un easy eyes at the first mate scum of the east and west they were washed together on the tides of the seven seas are they all here mr stearns inquired cardigan of the midshipman who was climbing to the poopdeck all but the cabin boy sir hes down in the focsle drunk as ill see him later interposed the first mate then he cupped his hands about his mouth to make himself heard about the wind and sea men ill be brief a crime has been committed aboard this brig just before six bells i was in the skippers quartersand two bells when i returned a few minutes ago i found him deadmurdered he paused to observe the effect of this announcement upon the men rows of sullen eyes looked up at himeyes in which there was mingled fear and questioning what a ghastly lot they looked huddled there in the mist thought cardigan one of youhe made a sweeping gesture with his bronzed handone of you killed him and ive called you here to ask if the guilty man is willing to confess and thus lighten his punish ment or in the event a confession isnt forthcoming if anyone knows anything that might be instrumental in locating the murderer after a long silence england charlie third mate a big gaunt cockney with a red face and red hands spoke up you said one o us wus th murderer sir but ow d we know you didnt croak im at this there was a murmur from the men encouraged the cockney contin ued youd be th one to benefit by is snuffin itan hi arsks ow d we know you didnt send jim orf cardigan met his gaze coolly and smiled youre justified in saying that he admitted but i was at the wheel from six bells to four bellsand if any man aboard understands post mortem conditions he can examine the body and see that the skipper has been dead just about an hour but you could ave lashed th wheel persisted english charlie cardigans jaw shot forward at an ugly angle are you trying to accuse me charlie he demanded there came no reply and he went on more than ever im determined to leave noth ing undone to find the man who killed the captainand as a first step every one shall submit to a search for evi dencenow im in command here and i intend to assert my authority sykes you and stearns help me mean while no one will leave the deck as cardigan started to descend the ladder he heard a savage oath and pausing fastened his eyes upon the men did someone speak he rapped ladd a seaman answeredjim hickey here said hed be damned if he was searched thats a lie sir broke in the bul letheaded mulatto the great muscles in his arms standing out like whip cords cardigan moved down and confront ed the mulatto did you say that the boatswain a creole stepped for ward eet ees so msieur i poleon moncrief hear heem wat ees more he cast a malicious glance at the mulatto who stood with clinched fists glaring at himi know wy zat nigger he not want to be search i was een my bunk trying to go to sleep wen ze cabanne boy he come below an drink a dam lot of rum an wen ze boy he fall asleep zat nigger he sink i not wake an get up an go to ze bunk of ze cabanne boy an a blasphemous oath left the mulat tos thick lips he made a move to spring at the creole but cardigan placed himself between them he steal ze cabanne boys pay i saw heem take eet from under ze mattress an zat wy he not want to be search msieurbecause he know you fin too much money on heem cardigan turned upon the huge brownskinned figure is that the truth hickey arent you willing to be searched the mulatto glared at poleon mon crief spitting out a stream of vile oaths its a lie sir a damned stinkin lie made up by that with a quick stealthy movement the creole leaped around cardigan and two bells flung himself at the mulattos throat together they went to the deck rolling upon the moist timbers as cardigan stooped to separate them the mulatto freed himself by a sudden wrench and gained his feet dashing along the deck toward the forward companion the first mate started in pursuit but halted as his eyes fell upon a belaying pin that lay upon the deck not many feet away hastily arming himself with this formidable missile he sent it spinning through the air after the flee ing figure it caught the negro in the back of the skull knocked him flat up on the deck planks cardigan followed by several of the crew reached his side hes out for some time reported the first mate bending over him two of you lads carry him below and lock him up but wait he ran one hand into the rear pocket of the mulattos trousers producing a black leather wallet opening it he withdrew a wad of bills which he swiftly counted and returned to the wallet he smiled grimly all right men below with him iii in the very midst of a dream the boy was shot into consciousness for a moment he could not remember where he was he seemed to be caught in the teeth of a monster that shook him horribly mercilessly halfremember ed objects separated themselves from the chaos and he heard a distant voice pronouncing his name yet for some inexplicable reason he was unable to reply gradually he extracted himself from the teeth of the monster gradually ob jects settled into their regular places above him was a familiar face as he recognized it sleep dropped from him as though severed by a blade get up he heard cardigan say while he shook him vigorously the boy lurched tohis feet as he brushed one hand across his lips he in haled his breath an odor that sickened him invisible hands seemed to jerk aside a drowsy fabric revealing in their biting sharpness the incidents before his drunken sleep his soul shrank dwindled with fear black michaels body had been found and the mate had come to accuse him but how did he find out the only incriminating evidence the knife had been thrown into the sea i thought you promised me never to do this again reproved cardigan but well discuss that later come with me the boy was dreadfully afraid the blood pounded in his temples beat so loudly that it seemed to boom out his guilt god how could he meet car digans honest gazeknowing in his heart that he had wielded the knife that finished black michael in some mannerhe knew not how rhe forced himself to follow the mate along the passage amidships and when they reached the cabin his fear in creased to a panic as he perceived that cardigan was making directly for black michaels quarters he stood with a rapidly pounding heart behind the mate while he inserted a key in the lock and turned it within the slushlamp turned low threw quivering shadows upon the walls the air was warm and unpleas antly heavy with the smell of stale rum and there in the bunk it lay covered with a sheetthe thing cardigan closed the door and turned the lamp higher mercy of god thought the boy was he going to draw aside that sheet and boy commenced the man halting two bells beside the bunk i brought you here to show you this and he turned back the sheet something worse than horror reach ed up and clutched at the boys throat he half closed his eyes dared not shut them entirely for the thing fasci nated him the captain has been murdered cardigan continued a few minutes ago i happened on the forepoop i dropped a wallet and it fell overside but fortunately caught in the project ing space under the bowsprit and when i picked it up i found this with it he withdrew an object from the pocket of his peajacket a cry leaped to the boys lipsdied there before him sharp and ugly in the flickering glow of the slushlamp was the knife with which he killed black michael now come here commanded the mate he obeyed the cabin reeling dizzily about him what use was there of try ing to hide the truth now cardigan knew and look was the sharp injunction and he looked at the thing on the bunk as he saw the exposed chest a shriek of sheer terror was wrung from his throat no no he cried i didnt stab him twicei didnt only once in the dark and then i ran he shuddered o god what have i said with a broken sob he sank to his knees burying his face in his hands an instant later fingers closed over his shoulders and lifted him to his feet fingers that were not rough but firm and determined you said what i wanted to hear announced cardigan look at me boy there now im go ing to question you and i want the truth the truthbefore the god that you just called on when did you stab black michael a little after two bells sir why because he had mistreated you how did you do it i and there followed a stumbling detached account of his movements from the time he left the deck until he surrendered to sleep in his bunk in the focastle its fortunate for you that i found the knife remarked cardigan when he had finished for it has your initials upon the hilt i saw you come on deck twice while i was at the wheel one time you went near the bowsprit but not until after i found the knife did i attach any importance to it he paused re suming after a moment its quite evident that two people stabbed the captainyou and an unknown person but who stabbed him first who is the real murderer these are skeins that must be untangled all i require of you is a close mouth and an open eye thenthen youre not going to lock me in the brig you are free only remember my instructionsand regard them the boy stared at him he was dazed stunned instead of a blow he had received kindness kindness new and loftier emotions stirred within him he tried to speak to utter words that would convey his gratitude to the mate he could only stand and stare mutely nor was that dumb look mirroring his deepest and most profound emotions unobserved by cardigan it came to him as an illuminating signalflash from the boys soul now run along he said not un kindly opening the door in silence the boy passed out as he moved through the cabin which was faintly lit by a hanging lamp his brain groped in a labyrinth two bells some one else had sought to end black michael who was the owner of ihis other hand that had driven a blade into the skippers breast and which of the two had accomplished his purpose he or the unknown person in his agony he prayed that it was the other for though a short while ago the white lotus had seemed a lamp that lighted the way to this ghastly ac tion he now saw with the cold clear ness of returned sanity that with blood upon his soul he was severed from even spiritual companionship with this pal lid leperchild who had impressed her sdlf so deeply upon his memory but how cduld he ever find out it all seemed very hopeless as he neared the focastle he saw a vertical stifip of yellow light cleaving the dark passage from the bulkhead door voices within were murmuring in hushed conversation he was almost in the opening when a sentence flung against his ears with the sting of a whip cemented him to the spot i only struck once i tell you onceyet there are two wounds those words spoken in a voice that was lowered to a tone just above a whisper yet strangely familiar brought forth his breath in a gasp he crept nearer the source of light peered within the slushlamp was turned low cast ing flickering shadows as it swung with the motion of the brig five of the bunks were vacant the sixth near an other bulkheaddoor opposite the boy was occoupied moncrief the creole sat on the edge of the bunk a cigarette between his thin moist lips and at his side face arid shoulders hidden by the boatswains slender body was another man that bunk was used by the chinese cook the boy knew yet the one who lay there was not the oriental they were talking again by gar eet ees ghastly msieur commented moncrief yesa ghastly failure spat out the other poleona note of in tensity came into the voicei see but one thing to do now by four in the morning we shpuld be near the coral reefstheyre just a mile off course wajo the polynesian will be at the wheel we can overpower him sacre dam msieur broke in the boatswain do zatzat why not to reach tahiti means investigation by the authorities if the brig goes down she carries all evidence with her we can escape in the long boat islands are numerous along here but msieur ze knife of ze firs mate zat you lef in ze god knows what became of it when he found the body he must have hidden the damned thirigand if i knew where but no im afraid to try it now the second wound is what has scared me off its a sign to warn us then he swore a volley of oaths so vile that they burned the boys ears with the captain killed went on the voice after a moment and the first mate disposed of by the incrimi nating evidence we could have easily bought the crew over to us with me in command we could have gone straight to melbourne for the cargo of rum mcallister would have paid well when we delivered it to him at hivaoa for when his cursed natives have plenty of rum they do more workand since the french government has restricted the oh well whats the use to talk of it you got the best of the deal i had the dirty work of killing the swine it was too big an undertaking for two men to try but msieur two bells no poleon the only thing to do now is save ourselves a pregnant dread was spreading through the boys body a sensation of abysmal emptiness the coral reefs the polynesian then they intended to now he could learn who stabbed black michael first but did he want to know yes the truth was far bet ter than horrible uncertainty yet he dared not enter the focastle alone he must go and bring cardigan as he turned to creep away a sud den plunge of the vessel sent him flat upon the deck of the passage with a sound that seemed loud enough to be heard from stem to stern he was almost on his feet when a lean figure appeared in the bulkhead door instantly he recognized mon crief he made a dive toward the laz arette but the boatswain was too quick for him he flung his lithe body upon him and bore him to the floor the boy opened his lips to cry out and the creoles fist descended upon his mouth the pain stung him to action with a desperate wrench he freed him self and fell against the bulkhead but before he could move a second figure was momentarily silhouetted upon the light in the oblong aperturea figure that hurled itself upon him pinning him to the wall again he tried to screamagain a fist bruised his lips horribly he felt blood dripping from his chin no dont he cried his mouth throbbing with pain something crashed down upon his skull and as he fell plunging into what seemed a depth less abyss a picture was photographed upon his brainthat of a dark sinister figure silhouetted upon the glow in the bulkhead door then the world reeled a drunken universe iv a knock on the door of his quar ters brought cardigan out of a light sleep sitting up on the edge of his bunk he called come in the opening of the door admitted a wavering blade of light and in the frame outlined upon the pale illumina tion from the main cabin was a form its stearns sir announced the man im sorry to wake you up but i have something queer to report cardigan rose wait a second till i make a light then a moment later when the slushlamp cast its ill light upon his nearlyclad form he added all right stearns what is it the midshipmans sallow face seemed paler than ever he shifted un easily from one foot to the other ive seen something that i dont quite understand sir he began i had just been relieved by wajo and was going toward the focastle when i happened to glance athwart the brig i saw what looked like two shadows then i realized they werent shadows but mentwo of them moving along the port deck they disappeared be hind the aftercabin as soon as i saw them but i got the impression that they were carrying somethingoror some one a minute later i could have sworn i heard a cry it scared me a little sir after all thats happened on this brig so i hurried down in the focsle i didnt know what to do and after about an hour i deeided to tell you and you did right commended cardiganfor while the midshipman was telling his story something insid ious had taken root in his brain an alarming possibility that caused him no little apprehension im going on deck he announced removing his peajacket and cap from two bells a peg on the wall return to your quarters and say nothing to the men of what youve seen he followed stearns into the poorly lighted main cabin and as the midship man reached the top of the companion way gripping the brass rail to keep from being hurled back by the danger ous roll of the vessel the mate moved through the lazarette midway in the dark passage leading into the focastle he collided with some thing that sprang away from him and swore lurid oaths whos that demanded cardigan hinglish charlie oo th blurry ells that the first mate is the cabin boy in the focsle no sir hi aynt seen im this evenin well help me look for him you start at the bow and ill go aft together they passed through the main cabin and at the top of the com panionway staggered out upon the deck gripping the wet lee rail here they separated a blanket of fog had been dropped from the dark sky and the peakgutters snarled and roared as the heavy sea dashed inboard was sucked back again to the surface clinging to the drenched rail the mate moved aft near the longboat amidships a human form darted sud denly around the corner of the after cabin and ran into him cardigan was thrown roughly against the rail and as he gained his balance the figure head down lurched past him toward the main companion whos that he bellowed hollow ing his hands for answer the figure plunged on gained the companion vanished cardigan swore savagely moving across the slippery timbers he reached the companionway and descended be low in the main cabin the door of the lazarette gaped at him with quick strides he made his way toward the focastle the passage was not dark this time for during the in terval that he was on deck a light had been made in the crews quarters and it sent a pale trembling shaft through the bulkhead door in the entrance to the focastle car digan halted an exclamation on his lipsfor he stood face to face with english charlie how the devil did you get here he demanded suspiciously the cockney indicated the entrance opposite the bulkhead door through which opening the bottom of a flight of stairs was visible i came down the steps sir i just stopped a minute to make a light ere i thought i sent you to find the cabin boy you did sirbut hi aynt found im yet cardigan whirled about and at that moment a voice behind him shrieked two bells matetwo bells the sound brought him around again and thecockney grinning pointed to a feathery green body perched on the up per tier of one of the bunks cardigan swore as he made his way alone to the main cabin damn him who was this fellow who had slunk past him on deck in the lazarette door he paused to consult his watch ten minutes to four from the timepiece his eyes rose to the compass in the deckbeam over head he could distinguish the tiny figures on the white disc good god sprang from his lips who was on watch wajoand the fool was headed off the course toward where the coral traps lav he took a step to cross the main cab in and at that very instantso exact is the timetable of fatea sudden two bells titanic shock hurled him flat upon his back the fall partially stunned him and as he lay there trying to marshal his scattered faculties the bow of the vessel seemed to leap up rolling him against the cabin bulkhead following that loose objects tumbled down glass shattered after a moment of struggle cardi gan succeeded in getting to his feet finding himself in darkness he real ized that the lamp had been broken a splotch of misty light showed him the companionway and slipping and stumbling across the slanting floor he groped his way to the foot of the stairs where his outstretched hands found the brass rail he ascended on deck charging billows broke in white foam over the gunwale sweeping angrily against the cabins and masthead it seemed a deathless period to car digan before he reached the break of the poop here he gripped the ladder and looked over his shoulder at the wreckage the bow was thrust up into the throat of the fog the stern so deeply sunk that the mainchains dipped while a list to the port permitted the sea free entrance through a tear in the bulwarks she had evidently struck with tremen dous force the forward mast was down and the deck below the forepoop in splinters where broken spars had crashed through he grasped the situation instantly realizing the urgency of keeping a cool head the bows were jammed between the rocks and at any moment the wounded ship might slide back off the reefs his teeth snapped shut and he climbed the ladder as he stood up right on the poopdeck peering into the mist that masked the remote end of the vessel a vague shape slid across the timbels at him instantly he saw that it was a man and tried to steady him self for the encounter that he knew was unavoidable instead of the jar that he expected a smashing blow was delivered full in his face and with mingled surprise and pain he realized that it was an attack rather than a collision the moment he hit the deck he was up again send ing his fist into a yielding paunch the figure went down without a cry doubled in a knot for a moment cardigan stood above his antagonist waiting for him to rise then believing him rendered breathless by the blow he bent over to ascertain the identity he had no sooner aban doned his guard than he regretted it for the knotted form straightened out and sprang at himbut not too swiftly for him to see the swarthy face of pol eon moncrief so youre the traitor aboard bel lowed cardigan you killed once more they came together this time they clinched went to the slant ing deck rolling over and over until they struck the rail where the force of the impact separated them leaping to his feet cardigan stood ready and when the boatswain rose a wellaimed blow between the eyes sent him reeling against the gunwale he crumpled up the first mate bent swiftly and gripped him about the waist lifted him and hurled him claw ing and kicking overboard as the body of moncrief was swal lowed by the fog cardigan staggered back against the wheel his heel en countered an object and looking down he saw the polynesian wajo stretched out beside the wheel grating he dropped on his knees to examine the body and at this juncture someone scrambled over the break of the poop looming tall and sinister in the mist mr cardigan the voice be longed to stearns the whole bows two bells smashedclear to the main hatch who in the name of he stopped as a roll of the vessel sent him sliding across the wet deck grip yourself man cried cardi gan rising and moving to his side remember youre midshipman on this brig lets make for the long boat the mate led the way from the poop to the longboat where a group of men smears of dark animation in the fog were struggling at the davits english charlies voice rose above the clamor as he sang out orders did you find the cabinboy char lie asked cardigan reaching the cockney who stood with a dripping tar paulin thrown over his shoulders no siran hi looked from bow to stern poor beggar thought cardigan his fears were confirmed the two figures stearns had seen in the mist loomed as sinister elements in the fate of the cabinboy the cry seemed conclusive evidence that evil had befallen him he gripped himself and ordered charlie send two men below to fetch provisions and blanketsand have them step lively as two of the crew disappeared in the fog headed for the companion english charlie drew himself into the lif eboat everything in shape queried car digan aye aye sir oars mast canvas and water is the rudder shipped properly here come the provisions in with them men get the lines clear and the boat ready to swing one of you tail on the falls lower slowlyslowly or youll swamp her stand by lads now ease offease off leaning over the slanting rail cardi gan saw the dark shape of the boat plunge downward saw it strike the sea and ride free of the hull borne on a white surge how small how helpless it looked down there in the mist thought cardigan are all hands there he called as the last man shot down the line all but the men forard sir an swered a voice from the misty smudge below they didnt have a chance when she struck cardigan preparing to swing down the line felt a peculiar reluctance to abandon the brig suppose after all the cabinboy was somewhere a thought sped like steel through his brain the malay knife he was leaving that behind queer that one should suddenly remember a fragment of sentiment amid such chaos lay her nose close in lads he or dered over the rail im going to have a look below if im not back in four minutes dont wait he made his way to the companion climbing down the almost inverted stairs into the main cabin where the water reached his waist trusting more to his sense of direc tion than his outstretched hands he groped his way aft beneath the decks to the paintlocker in the misty ghost light that spilled through the nearly de molished deck above he found the nail riven iron door and drew back the bolt with a shriek of hinges it swung out spitting a large object in the waist deep flood cardigan swore aloud as he perceived it to be a human body bent over lifted it cursed again it was the cabinboybound and gagged in the halflight he could see the mutely imploring eyesdark pools of pain with haste he secured the malay knife and severed the bonds afterward removing the gag from the bruised swollen mouth god sir burst out the two bells boy they knocked me in the head poleon moncrief and another i couldnt see his face but he said tell me later cut in cardigan we havent time now the ships sink ing v can you walk ill help you the mate halfdragged the boy along the passage and into the main cabin here he set him on his feet and thrust him toward the vague gray light in the companionway as the boy began the ascent cling ing to the rail he heard a crash behind him a ripping and splintering of broken timbers and looking back he saw something long and dark the shape of a spar plunge from aloft and smite cardigan on the head with a splash the first mate sank beneath the ugly water in the cabin the boy shrieked for an instant he stood motionless paralyzed then stumbling down the stairs he groped in the flood for the body almost instant ly he was rewarded with trembling fingers he sought the heart it was beating he laughed hysterically and began to drag the limp form after him midway up the companionstairs he was brought to a standstill by a sound below a half croak and half shriek on deck you lubbers sahib hai he understood kerachi the parra keet was down there in that black hole but he could not go back until he had carried cardigan to safety a form suddenly blotted out the square of foggy gray light that defined the companion following that eng lish charlies voice called mr cardi gan here answered the boy for gods sake take him he was hit by a spar ive got to go backafter the parrakeet as he turned to descend the cockney gripped his shoulder come back yeh blarsted little fool youll be drowned but the boy broke away and plunged down into the cabin a hush that seemed intensified rather than ruptured by the dull ominous pounding of the waves against the sod den hull brooded in the bowels of the vesselas if the very timbers of the stricken brig were smitten dumb with dreadful expectancy it corrupted the boy with terror this hush but he forced himself to stagger through the water into the flooded passage amidships ahead the bulkhead door hiccoughed yellow light it gave warmth to his chilled soul and in another instant he reached the en trance to the focastle the slushlamp lay against the beam spluttering feebly with every heave of the vessel the foul hole was halfin undated and a great wound in the port bulwarks bled a steady stream of sea water kerachi called the boy search ing in the flood for the little bird as if answering him the parrakeet perched upon the top of the furthest bunk croaked chota hazri sahibs then a thing occurred that drew the boys heart into his throat a human hand rose suddenly from behind an overturned table that floated near the second bulkhead door clawed at the air sank help pleaded a faint voice a spar pinned me here in the passage door im killed unless the blood in the boys veins seemed for the moment sucked up the voice pain had weakened it to scarce ly above a whisper but he recognized it this voice that he would remember until death wiped free his brain im coming he answered suffused with fright and joy here answered the boy for gods sake take him he was hit by a sparpage two bells as he moved forward a sudden lurch of the brig sent the lamp crashing against the bulkhead he stumbled clutched at something tangible clung with a sense of aching despair he re alized that he was denied the sight of darkness had hardly shut its jaws upon the foul hole when the parrakeet shrieked two bells mate two bells an instant of frightful silence came on the heels of the birds speech then god how did you know shrilled the voice that was when i stabbed him as i pulled the knife out two bells struck the boy felt a sudden quiver of the planks beneath his feet heard a rip ping sound forward and a sud den convulsion of the water flung him backward terrified he regained his balance and groped until he found and pulled himself through the bulkhead door how he made the main cabin he never knew after a period of breath less struggle bruised and hurt almost strangled by the deepening flood he reached the foot of the now inverted companionstairs and began to climb he was almost at the top when a great wave hurled through the com panion above descended upon him and bore him gasping and choking into the liquid blackness below the world swung around in giddy chaos he experienced a terrible plunging sensation torrents of delir ious water passed over him pitiless night swirled its black currents about his struggling body buoying himself upward battling against the legions of water he strove to attain the surface his thrashing arms struck something hard at the contact his body went rigid with horror the ceiling of the cabin trapped a fierce exultation possessed him the glory of struggle he tried to fight but the liquid death crushed him he screamedwas choked he knew the torture of suffocation a seemingly end less period of terror and pain such as he had never known even when the lash of black michael curled about his bare skin and a vivid blinding flash of the concentrated events of many years leaped like hundredhued lightnings athwart his drowning eyes in the midst of this glow sur rounded by tiny reeling stars he saw the white lotus burning with the fire of palest moonsa figure that faded became as destroyed moonlight a vanishing glory that perished the very instant that it flashed to light his way la ora na i te atua dark sluicegates closed upon him v ere she goes mateyslook that was the first thing that cardi gan heard a sentence that clove the fabric of unconsciousness and left him lying pained to the soul in what seemed a vast misty cavern he felt intermittent sprays upon his face and tried to struggle to a sitting position but an intense burning in his skull made him fall back he opened his lips charlie where are you an instant afterward a huge face seeming wraithlike in the fog materi alized in the dusky vacancy above him shes just gone down sir the third mate said in a husky voice gawd it was orful with the little fool aboard you mean yerss e dragged you up the com panionway and hi elped lower you into the longboat wed ardly got away sir when she went back orf the rocks straight down he paused then shall hi call the roll sir two bells cardigan shuddered involuntarily yes he saw english charlie rise his head was lost in the mist watkins began the britisher here sykes ladd cheng su olsen huldricksson hickey the nigger was locked in the brig put in a voice from the rear stearns went on the cockney moncrief he went overboard this from cardigan in a halfwhisper then bjornsen but bjornsen did not answer nor could anyone account for the big nor wegian cardigan went to his grave wonder ing who had struck black michael first poleon moncrief or the boy and perhaps the spirit of bjornsen knowing this and possessing a grim sense of humor chuckled but do dead men laugh bmnov he flung open the door and beau nash his eyes wide and staring came inpage the mystery of the marseilles express by j c kofoed i the card they found in his pocket read eugene bertal ingineur dchimique cours belsunce marseilles he was lying in a first class compart ment of the parismarseilles express his throat cut from ear to ear the only other occupants of the carriage were a blind man and a gentle old lady of eighty who was hysterical from shock ii the rue cannabiere is at once the broadway and the boulevard des italiens of marseilles and it is more cosmopoli tan than pither between the big stores the glittering cafes restaurants and theaters that flank its width walk yellow men from china brown from india black men from bermuda or the sou dan arabs portuguese italians and yankees turban and fez are as com mon on the cannabiere as silk stockings and painted lips william f bailey special agent for the department of justice sat in a cor ner of the restaurant haxo absorbed in a magnificent omelette and a cup of chocolate the warm june sun sprayed through the windows lacing floor and furniture with thongs of gold from the window he could see the vieux port with its bristle of masts his unopened copy of the matin was propped against a cruet on the center of the table bailey had been in france a year seeking beau nash who was wanted in the united states on a dozen charges nash was of the highest type of crim inal but a man who had made enemies gratuitously he kicked out of his path men who had enabled him to make a suc cess of his nefarious calling but even with information from a number of these bailey had been unable to trace the old fox railroad cartwright had failed to get the beau in his day failed with a great incentive to urge him on and so had a dozen others the agent thought of the words f eddie lenoir when that disconsolate forger was last arrested it aint no use eddie had said things have got so with the wireless an cables an international police that there aint nowhere in the world a man can go where a redfaced irishman with a badge wont tap him on the shoulder an say hello eddie the old man wants to see you only one birds got you dicks stopped an thats beau nash bill recalled with a grin of disgust his answer oh well get him all right its only a matter of time he hadiiad a year and from all indi cations was no closer to his quarry than when he started well if denise girard whom he loved married him bailey could hardly call his european trip a failure even though it might seem so in the eyes of his superiors the mystery of the marseilles express the chatter of two men drinking wine at a nearby table annoyed him one was tall and gaunt the other stoop shouldered slack chinned pinched bailey subconsciously had heard the entire conversation apparently the big man was berating the other rather too harshly for that gentlemans taste he wound up with a gust name of a dog but you are a fine one to call yourself a railway man not all the way did i see youlazy lizard the little man sprang up with a snarl at the edge of his lips then he glanced around hesitated and after a moment slouched out bill yawned and picked up his paper in a flash his bored air dropped from him and he stiffened with amazement it was not the headlines telling of the death of monsieur bertal but the fact that the dead chemists photograph was that of beau nash it required just two minutes for the agent to pay his bill and leave the res taurant haxo the prefecture of police was only a short distance away but fifty frenchmen shrugged their shoulders and exclaimed anent the mad hurry of americans as bailey dashed by the prefect greeted him politely of a certainty the body was in the mortu ary and if monsieur bailey desired to view it there could be no possible objec tion it also happened that the two oc cupants of the compartment at the time of the murder were in the prefecture and it would be possible to speak with them it was hoped that the distin guished american secret agent might aid them in this ease bailey followed a glum gendarme down a corridor to the room where the unfortunate flotsam of the city so often paid their final visits there was some thing on one of the slabsa rigid some thing covered with a white cloth the agent turned down one corner of the sheet and then replaced it his search was ended the lean face and drooping mustache the graying yellow hairit was beau nash beyond a doubt you recognize him monsieur asked the prefect who had followed bailey into the mortuary the american told him it is not surprising to me there is a chemical engineer named bertal who resides in marseilles but we learned that he is at home having returned from paris last night and now monsieur if you will come with me to the office we will speak with madame berthier who was in the compartment at the time of this mans death madame berthier a delicate little lady of eighty told bailey in a frightened voice all she knew of the affair no one in their senses could have suspected her but the frightful experience had shaken her to the soul we had passed lyons monsieur she explained it was late nearly two in the morning i was dozing monsieur bertal was asleep in the corner directly opposite me the blind man monsieur robert was beside him the door of the compartment had been locked after we left lyons there was a young woman wearing a heavy veil in the next compartment when we left paris the police found no one else in the car but us when they investigated she stopped and covered her face with her quivering hands bailey patted the old ladys shoulder reassuringly and after a moment she continued i dont know what time it was when i woke up the lights cast only a dim blue haze over the compartment i was a little dazed at first i rubbed my eyes and sawsaw monsieur bertal he was sitting up very straight his head tilted back against the cushion his eyes star ing at the ceiling then i saw the slash across his throat and the bblood soak ing his shirt and vest i screamedand the mystery of the marseilles express screamed monsieur robert woke up and asked me what was the matter but i fainted a peculiar case said the prefect we have absolutely no clue if mon sieur would help bailey nodded ill be glad to it is necessary for me to cable the chief at once but i will return and do all i can though i hope we can catch the mur derer of beau nash he has certainly done the world no harm in ridding it of that gentleman once more on the rue cannabiere the american paused he would prob ably be ordered home very shortly and in the short time left him he would have to persuade denise to marry him and accompany him to america though he had known the girl for almost a year he knew little or nothing of her family and antecedents she was very beautiful apparently had sufficient money for all her needs was well edu cated and well bred also she found it necessary to make trips to paris every two weeks that completed denise gi rards dossier so far as william bailey was concerned it was sufficient that he loved her he walked as far as the cours saint louis there he swung aboard a tram car and after fifteen minutes ride dropped off opposite the marble gran deur of the palais longchamp denises apartment was very near pondering there in the june sunshine as to the best course he should pursue bill bailey received the greatest shock of his eventful life denise came down the steps of her house arm in arm with beau nash the drooping mustache the graying yellow hair was that of the corpse who lay on the slab in the mortuary of the prefecture of police and who could doubt from the stately and dangerous walk from his eyesso icecold so fire hotfrom his deadly air of a bravo of fortune that nash was very sure of himself apparently the pair did not see him they walked down the street talking earnestly bailey shook off his numbed surprise and followed them a question kept hammering in his brain what was denise doing with the beau what pos sible connection could his little sweet heart have with the most notorious criminal in europe ill bailey could have arrested nash then and there but the human instinct to find out what denise was doing with this man overrode his first impulse to take the fellow into custody they were in no hurry made no effort at concealment and bailey sheltered by the flowing stream of pedestrians kept within easy reach of them at length they turned into the place moreau it was market day and even though late in the afternoon the square was crowded sabots clattered on the cobblestones hogs squealed ducks squawked redfaced peasant women shouted prices for their fish and fowl and vegetables here wandered a steel helmeted poilu or a brown tommy there a pigeonchested gendarme flecks of color in the dull mass as bailey started to cross the square three men stepped in his path they were parisians of montmartre or the outer boulevards the cut of their clothes a swagger from the hips and an unhealthy color proved that they stopped him effectively without appa rently attempting such a thing hello american whined one we desire only the small courtesy of a match im in a hurry bailey snapped thrusting the spokesman to one side get out of the way every bit of color fled from the the mystery of the marseilles express apaches face his lips tightened into a white gash and there was such malig nant hatred in his eyes that baileys hand involuntarily reached toward his hip if ever murder was written in a human expression it was there in the frenchmans then the agent laughed reached over and grasped the fellows wrist and twisted it until he howled with pain the others being cowards at heart surged back bailey hurried across the square but in the moment the parisians had engaged his attention nash and denise had disappeared bailey was not a man to cry over spilt milk but he was thoroughly dis gusted at the turn affairs had taken much as he wanted to allow nash fur ther liberty so that he could discover the relationship between him and denise it had become imperative to get the man under lock and key he telephoned to captain goulet the prefect it was baileys plan to have a dragnet thrown around the city in the event of nashs attempting to slip out and also to have the place moreau quar ter thoroughly searched at once yes came captain goulets voice over the wire this is bailey oh monsieur bailey i have the most just a moment captain you re member that i identified the man who was murdered on the marseilles express as beau nash shortly after leaving your office i saw nash on the street but he gave me the slip youyou saw nash on the street asked the captain thickly oh mon dieu this matter is getting beyond our mortal bonds what do you mean the body of the man you identified as nash has disappeared from the table in the mortuary bailey sucked in his breath in a gasp of surprise disappeared of a certainty and i saw nash in the street five minutes afterward i wonder did youdid you notice his throat monsieur he wore a muffler said bailey im patiently wrapped in two or three folds around his neck then it was him wailed the prefect i fear nothing human monsieur but this has gotten beyond our realm the man who lay on this table was as dead as pontius pilateto that ill swear yet he disappears from my mortuary and you meet him on the street what can one do against a cadaver monsieur nonsense have all the stations and wharves watched and send a dozen men down here to search the neighborhood dead or alive were going to get beau nash and i think that he will be able to tell us a few things to clear up the mystery of the marseilles express will you do as i ask at once monsieur bailey thoughtfully hung up the re ceiver and walked again into the place moreau the shadows had lengthened the hucksters in the square were packing up their stands and wares in ten minutes more the place would be deserted and then the police would come down like the historic assyrian wolvesprobably with as small success looking up from his musings bailey saw denise step out of a taverne on the farther side of the square she looked around cautiously then having recon noitered the ground to her evident satis faction she went back into the house bailey ran across the street shifting his revolver from his hip pocket to the side one of his coat the entrance from which denise had looked did not lead through the cafe but directly up a flight of stairs to the second floor its door was unlocked the mystery of the marseilles express and the agent pushed it open and went in no one there with his hand on the butt of his wea pon bailey went up under his cautious step the ratty old stairway squeaked like an unoiled hinge the place was dark as a well and rank with the thousand odors of a cheap restaurant some where above lay the key to the most puz zling mystery that bailey had ever inves tigated at the head of the second flight a gas jet burned blue in the foul air within the arc of its sickly radiance the portal of a room swung slightly ajar he tip toed forward and urged the door open an inch or more every muscle in his body was tensed for the possible strug gle peering into the room he caught the darker hulk of a bed in the gloom from the arrangement of the bedclothing it looked as though someone were sprawled on it but strain his ears as he might bailey could not hear that per son breathing moving with the greatest caution the agent slipped through the door a gas light turned very low was burning his pistol clutched in his right hand bailey stretched out his left and turned on the gas full blast there on the bed its head slewed around until the throatgash yawned like some horrid mouth lay the body of the man who had been killed on the mar seilles express iv bailey went cold to the tips of his fingers at the horror of it he was used to ghastly scenes but nonehad ever affected him as did the lonely fig ure on the disordered bed if it wasnt nash who was it and why had he been brought from his slab in the mortuary to this place the agent stepped toward the bed and then a strong hand reached over his shoulder and tore away the pistol an other was clapped over his mouth so quickly was the attack made that before bailey could shout or struggle he was on his back his own handcuffs on his wrists and a gag between his teeth the apache who had accosted him in the square grinned down at him ah vieux cochon he snorted you are the trapped and not the trapper now of course you understand that we are going to kill you but first by order of monsieur nash i am to explain some things to you he thought it a shame that you should die without first touch ing the edges of this mystery look he walked to the bed and baileys sidelong glance followed him this mans name is not unfamiliar to you monsieur said the apache it is john sheppard known as a cousin to monsieur the beau the resemblance between the two is strong but you will grant that the makeup is yet the work of a masterhand the nose see it has been filled out with paraffin the hair and mustache are dyed this bluish scar at the angle of the jaw has been made with an electric needle of course bailey knew of johnny sheppard who had been almost a no torious in his sphere as the beau was in his it was more than probable that sheppard had consented to this disguise to throw the police off his cousins track it accounted anyway for the widely varying reports of nashs whereabouts that had come to the agents ears the apache continued monsieur nash intended dispatching you of course who is the chief thorn in his side he was afraid however that a more complete examination be made of sheppard with the consequent working back of your death to him we were in structed to get the body it was ab surdly simple we drew the gendarmes the mystery of the marseilles express to the front of the prefecture by a false alarm the mortuary faces on an alley where we had a covered wagon you see it was so easy that even you might have done it bailey lay very still hoping that the frenchman in his streak of garrulous boasting might say still more but the fellow had apparently fulfilled his in structions he drew his revolver and looked curiously down at the agent they say americans know how to die he observed casually we will see bill stiffened but he kept his eyes fixed on the others yellow orbs it was hard to die there with so much of life before him but the least he could do was to keep up a bold front they want ed to see him wince and he did not in tend giving them that satisfaction the thug lifted his weapon and his comrades crowded up their rat faces glistening baileys fingers tightened and his lips drew down in a hard line as he tensed himself for the shock a revolver exploded another fol lowed two of the parisians fell their leader plunged for the open and a huge grayhaired gendarme deliberately shot him in the back the apache spun around and rocketed down the steps to lie an unkempt heap at the bottom when bailey was liberated he dashed downstairs and propped the dying man on his knee there was much that the fellow could tell him if he would nom dun nom the apache groaned im going to think that a rotten gendarme should get me at last who killed sheppard bailey de manded he paid us five hundred francs zut five hundred fraiics and i havent spent a damned sou who killed sheppard the parisian rolled his pale eyes up ward parbleau ill tell why not i got five hundred francs to finish you and i havent spent a centime he sat up suddenly be watchful of ber tal he gasped they are going to kill him then his head sagged back and he died very quietly in baileys arms they are going to kill bertal the dead mans warning rang in baileys ears what had the man bertal whose card had been found in the corpses pocket to do with this affair just where did he fit into the distorted mosaic the agent had known that the presence of bertals card in sheppards pocket could hardly have been due to chance but he had had no time to in vestigate any of the little clues he had caught out of the tangled skein now his time would be further occupied in preventing some one from exterminat ing the unhappy monsieur bertal bailey rose from his knees to find the gray mustached gendarme regarding him quizzically i have under arrest said sergeant meaux a woman named denise gi rard we found her on the third floor baileys voice was normal when he asked on what charge are you hold ing her she has confessed to the murder of the man who was found on the paris marseilles express nonsense said bailey violently perhaps not monsieur she is quite positive in expressing herself and after all it would not be the first wom an who resorted to murder it was a wise man who first said cherchez la femme bailey stood silent eyes on the ground it was absurd to believe that his sweet girl had committed so shock ing a crime she had confessed bah what the devil was a confession many an innocent person had confessed before this but ugly doubt reared its head why was she so apparently friendly with beau nash why bailey believed it would be better not the mystery of the marseilles express to see denise just then he wanted time to get a clearer vision of the affair to make a few investigations so in com pany with a gendarme he hurried into the street and caught a tramcar in the direction of the cours belsunce a fog had settled down in earnest wiping out the tops of the buildings and making the street lights mere gray smudges iri the darkness he found monsieur bertals house with difficulty posted his gendarme outside and rang the bell the bertal apartment was on the ground floor as the neat brass plate un der the window testified monsieur him self opened the door a crack and looked rather suspiciously at his visitor then he bowed and said come in monsieur bailey bailey had not the faintest idea of how eugene bertal knew him but he kept his wonder hidden and he and the gendarme walked in old bertal might just have stepped from a painting with his high collar white shirt front and neck cloth with its pleats and counterpleats he made bailey think of english inns with roar ing fireplaces and guests thumping in from the lumbering coachesof fat tur keys egg nogg toddy and the rest in appearance he was a man after dickens own heartnot the pursy french chemi cal engineer he was supposed to be the room itself furthered that impression there was a huge fourposter bed with chintz curtains there was an an cient mahogany bureau quaint brass candelabra fine old engravings on the walls rows of leather bound books there were also big helpless looking wadded chairs the host waved his guest toward one of them bailey sat down you know me ap parently monsieur or else you are an extraordinarily good guesser if that is the case possibly you can guess why i am here a bleak look came into the old mans face he nodded bailey heard the creak of cautious footsteps in the next room he knew that old bertal lived alone and that in all probability the newcomer was the messenger of death it was pitch dark beyond the por tieres but bill seemed to sense a black er shape flattened against the opposite wall without an instants hesitation he flung himself muscular hands out stretched at the intruder while he shouted to monsieur bertal to turn on the light he crashed against an athletic body and received a vicious blow in the face they clenched and in the struggle tore a handkerchief from his opponents face but it was too dark for recognition ber tal was taking an exasperatingly long time in reaching the electric switch then someone struck bailey from be hind he reeled back loosening his hold the intruder tore himself free flung open the door and clattered out through the hallway bertal turned on the lights there was no one in the room save these two in the street the gendarme raised an enormous pother as he ran after the fellow but bailey did not aid him he simply stood and looked at bertal an explanation would not be out of place he said coldly i risked my neck for you and then you try to break it that is my affair said bertal sul lenly and now we will get the prin cipal business of your visit over and done with i know why youa detec tiveare here and i confess freely i killed john sheppard on the parismar seilles express he opened a drawer in the table and took out a knife with a clotted blade this is what i did it with he said when the gendarme returned pant ing and with nothing to show for his the mystery of the marseilles express chase bailey left him in charge of the apartment and took bertal to the pre fecture of police he had not commented on denises confession he said noth ing concerning this one captain goulet smiled grimly when the american explained that bertal had shouldered responsibility for the mur der he shook his finger reprovingly as though the old chemical engineer were a bad bad boy it is strange very strange monsieur bailey he said and as you yankees say brisk business eh first mademoi selle girard confesses then monsieur bertal and just five minutes ago mon sieur robert the blind man sent for us and said that he alone was responsible for sheppards death now who is really telling the truth v take monsieur bertal to a cell the prefect directed a gendarme i would like to know monsieur bailey just where we stand in this matter the department of justice man grunted so would i as s holmes used to say it is a capital mistake to theorize before we have all the data i am going out to get that data did you instruct the chef de gare to hold the murder car for my investigation and also keep the entire train crew so i can interview them yes all right now well have the three confessors come out here one at a time and tell us in detail just how they com mitted the crime after that ill ex amine the car and the crew and if that doesnt get us some real infor mation ill go back to kindergarten goulet nodded his approbation bring in mademoiselle girard he directed bailey promptly effaced himself from the scene by retiring behind a conve nient screen where he could see and hear without being observed himself denise came in presently her beauti ful face white and tear stained there were blue circles beneath her eyes and her slender shoulders drooped baileys heart went out to her in a warm surge of love and pity she was so young and so much in need of help now mademoiselle girard said the prefect in a normal conversational tone i want you to give me a straightfor ward description of what happened on the parismarseilles express last night ii told you once it is necessary that it be repeated he tapped his teeth with a pen holder and looked at her quite calmly before we started from paris she said hurriedly sheppard whom i knew spoke to me insultingly after we passed lyons i thought i heard an exclamation of pain from the next com partment i rose and went into the cor ridor the door to the compartment was open sheppard seized me and drew me in ii knew what sort of a man he was and having a knife in my girdle i pulled it out and struck blindly he fell back on the seat and i ran into my own compartment how is it that madame berthier and monsieur robert heard nothing of this there were no words passedlittle noise they were both sleeping you assume full responsibility for this mans death ii do she whispered that is all said goulet motioning the gendarme to take her away bring in monsieur robert he added he has nothing to do with ittruly truly he hasnt the girl cried desper ately over her shoulder when the blind man was led in the prefect addressed the same questions to him i had every reason to hate that man the mystery of the marseilles express answered robert it is not necessary to explain motivesmy confession ob viates that sheppard felt safe with me because i am blind i could tell by his breathing when he was asleep when i was sure of it i felt for his throatoh so cautiouslyand then used my knife what were your relative positions asked bailey coming from behind the screen he was sitting next the window i beside him bailey nodded gravely after the blind man was taken away bertal was brought back again he was visibly nervous we want a detailed explanation from you bailey explained it will be brief long ago i had for reasons that need no explanation determined on the death of john shep pard he deseryed it if ever a man did but it was out of the question for me to kill him openly i knew that he intended leaving paris when he did i knew exactly how the train ran the track it used its schedule how it al ways came to a brief stop in the freight yards beyond lyons i learned what compartment sheppard would occupy then i hid myself in a freight car be side the track used by the express fortune was kind to mekinder than i expected the train halted i looked and there directly opposite me i saw sheppard asleep i leaned across rest ing my arm on the side of the express and drove my knife into his throat then i walked back to lyons and two hours later caught another train to marseilles when bertal had been escorted back to his cell captain goulet looked quiz zically at bailey the further we go the more tangled we get he observed mon dieu what a fright i had when the body dis appeared from the mortuary i thought surely we had a ghost to deal with but these are most palpably human folks and each of their confessions are logi cal when taken alone together he shrrugged his shoulders well straighten them out bailey reassured him im off now and i wont be back until ive laid my hands on something definite it was not until nine oclock next morning that bill returned but he was as fresh and clear eyed as though he had been sleeping all night captain goulet greeted him hopefully ive made some progress the agent admitted in answer to the prefects question in fact most of the mys tery has disappeared if you will have the three prisoners brought in again i think we can get the other phases cleared up bill flashed denise a look that brought the color to her cheeks and a faint smile in answer to his the three of you he said have confessed to the murder of john shep pard there are some angles to this case that i dont know but i know that none of you had a hand in sheppards death in the first place mademoiselle girard had absolutely nothing to do with it she was on the train but she left it at dijon i wired her descrip tion to the police at every stop the ex press made and found that she regis tered at dijon under the name of ma dame claire st pol isnt that true denise yyes she admitted now as to monsieur robert his story was plausible i carefully ex amined the spot where sheppard had been sitting there was a slash in the cushion and spots of blood but the nature of the cut which was deep on the side toward robert and edged thin ly toward the window indicated that it had been made by someone outside the train there were also drops of blood on the steps which conclusively proved the mystery of the marseilles express that point so of the three confession aires it seemed most likely that mon sieur bertal was the guilty party the chemist nodded dully as a matter of fact bailey con tinued he had no more to do with sheppards death than the other two he declared that he had committed the crime while the marseilles express halted in the freight yard beyond lyons as a matter of fact the train did not stop there was a clear track and the express maintained a speed of thirty miles an hour through the yards hence it was impossible for bertal to have done as he claimed besides monsieur bertal did not leave his hotel in lyons until after the express had passed i learned from his housekeep er the hotel he usually stayed at in that city and found that he was aroused at five oclock in the morning had break fast and left at six that i think eliminates him then who in the name of heaven burst out the puzzled goulet killed john sheppard that will come out presently said bailey just now i have a surprise for you he flung open the door and beau nash his eyes wide and staring not a fleck of color in his face came in theres no use stalling he panted she didnt kill him i iwhy i killed johnny sheppard myself bill bailey laughed that confession is the finest thing you ever did beauthe only clean honest thing in your whole black rec ord but it wont wash you didnt kill johnny sheppard any more than i did myself vi the beaus thin lips twitched like a snarling dogs damn you he shout ed i tell you i did youre not go ing to railroad her to the guillotine of course not soothed bailey im not in the habit of railroading people i know you fairly well nash and i thought that telegram would do the trickyou see folks i sent a wire signed by one of the beaus apache friends telling him that his sweetheart mazie lee had been arrested for this murder and that she would be rail roaded as a matter of fact miss lee is already on her way to england nash grated his teeth you devil it wont do any good to indulge in personalities i know who the mur derer is and ill produce him very shortly before i do i want to clear up all the threads i suppose everyone knows that the beau is a member of a most respected family in sussex eng land he organized the london bank gang and later operated extensively in the united states sheppard his cousin was also a member of that gang now i want you denise to tell me why you helped him and why you confessed to sheppards murder the girl looked at nash paled and then said bravely i was afraid that my father had killed him as he had often threatened to do and i wanted to protect him your father said bailey question ingly denise made a gesture toward mon sieur robert the blind man nash and sheppard had my father in their power i aided them whenever they demanded it to save him they treated me brutally at times but i nev er dared resent it when sheppard was killed i believed that father did it the thought was natural for he was on his way to marseilles with nashs cousin and it could have been done while sheppard slept but father be lieved that i had slipped in and killed the fellow so he confessed to save me the mystery of the marseilles express bailey pressed her cold fingers reas suringly it was very noblevery selfsacrificing of you both but why did you assume the blame monsieur bertal i said the chemist his ascetic lips tightening was once a member of the london bank gang i am an eng lishman though i have lived so long in france that i have almost forgotten the fact nash with sheppards conniv ance did me a great wrongnever mind what i pretended to have for gotten and aided him while he was in marseilles but i had not forgotten the old scars were still open through him i came to know denise and love her as a father i writhed impotently at his treatment of her which to a girl of her spirit was intolerable when sheppard was killed i had reasons to believe that she had done it though there were others just as eager when i learned of her arrest i decided to sacrifice myself for her i am old and of little usewhile she well it doesnt matter sheppard i suppose had infended carrying nothing on his person that would identify him if anything hap pened but he overlooked one of my cards it was probably due to that that nash believed i had killed his cousin and in revenge sent his apaches to erase me from the scheme of things i apolo gize for striking you bailey but i wanted them to succeed for i am very tired of life have you anything to say nash asked the agent everything theyve said is true beau growled but id like to know who killed johnnydamn his mur derer the man who killed sheppard thought he was you nash looked at bailey with narrow ing eyes who was it youve got me just as you caught eddie lenoir and the rest of the old gang but im satisfied so long as mazie is safe if those apaches of mine had been just a bit quicker they would have killed you and my plan would have worked out perfectly but they didnt now the least you can do is to tell me who killed johnny sheppard bill touched a bell on the prefects desk two burly gendarmes came in with a stoopshouldered slackchinned man of middle age between themthe man who had annoyed bailey with his chatter in the restaurant haxo the day before harry garstairs by god cried nash taking an involuntary step back ward the murderer of john sheppard beau said bailey quietly and the man whose wife and fortune you stole iiwhy i thought he was dead howhow did you find him bai ley ill admit that it was as much a matter of good luck as judgment the agent admitted every indication pointed to sheppard having been mur dered in mistake for nash in his day the beau made many enemies but the man who had most cause to hate him was harry garstairs the case is no torious even yet in the criminal circles of london but garstairs had disap peareddropped out of sight entirely he was reported to have died in ant werp years ago sheppard had been killed by someone on the trainsomeone in his particular car i eliminated the three passengers mademoiselle girard madame ber thier and monsieur robert that should leave only a member of the train crew i examined the roof of the car by the scratches of hobnailed shoes it was apparent that someone had laid there then swung down to the steps i the mystery of the marseilles express knew that in his earlier days carstairs had been a railroader on the midland and sussex then like a flash i re called a conversation i had heard in the restaurant haxo yesterday afternoon a railway man berating an inferior for having kept out of sight all the way from paris to marseilles so i lined up the crew and picked out the man who had been in the res taurant he denied any knowledge of the crime of course when i called him carstairs and outlined what i be lieved to have happened he broke down and confessed that he actually committed the crime in the words of the song thats all there is there isnt any more he took denises hand except for one thing will you come to america with me she bowed her splendid head yes she whispered ill go any where in the worldwith you the best new mystery books by captain frank cunningham in this
