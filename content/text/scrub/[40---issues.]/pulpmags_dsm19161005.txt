detective story magazine cts twiceamonth cts vol october no the yellow claw sax rohmer chapter i the lady of the civet furs henry leroux wrote busily on the light of the table lamp softened and enriched by its mosaic shade gave an appearance of added opulence to the already handsome appointments of the room the little table clock ticked merrily from half past eleven to a quarter to twelve into the cozy bookish atmosphere of the novelists study penetrated the muffled chime of big ben it chimed the threequarters but with his mind centered upon his work leroux wrote on ceaselessly an odd figure of a man was this popular novelist with patchy and un tidy hair which lessened the otherwise striking contour of his brow a neglected and unpicturesque figure in a baggy neutralcolored dressing gown a figure more fitted to a garret than to this spacious luxurious workroom with the soft light playing upon rank after rank of rare and costly editions deepening the tones in the persian car pet making red morocco more red purifying the vellum and regilding the gold of the choice bindings caressing ia ds detective story magazine lovingly the busts and statuettes sur mounting the bookshelves and twin kling upon the scantily covered crown of henry leroux the doorbell rang leroux heedless of external mat ters pursued his work but the door bell rang again and continued to ring soames soames leroux raised his voice irascibly continuing to write the while where the devil are you cant you hear the doorbell soames did not reveal himself and to the ringing of the bell was added the unmistakable rattling of a letter box soames leroux put down his pen and stood up darn it hes out i have no memory he retied the girdle of his dressing gown which had become unfastened and opened the study door opposite across the entrance lobby was the outer door and in the light from the lobby lamp he perceived two laughing eyes peering in under the upraised flap of the letter box the ringing ceased are you very angry with me for in terrupting you cried a girls voice my dear miss cumberly said le roux without irritation on the con traryâerâi am delighted to see youâ or rather to hear you there is no body at home you know i do know replied the girl firmly and i know something else also fa ther assures me that you simply starve yourself when mrs leroux is away so i have brought down an omelet omelet muttered leroux ad vancing toward the door you haveâ erâbrought an omelet i understand âyes you have brought an omelet erâthat is very good of you he hesitated when about to open the outer door raising his hands to his disheveled hair and unshaven chin the flap of the letter box dropped and the girl outside could be heard stifling her laughter you must think meâerâvery rude began leroux i meanânot to open the door but i quite understand concluded the voice of the unseen one you are a most untidy object and i shall tell mira directly she returns that she has no right to leave you alone like this now i am going to hurry back up stairs so you may appear safely dont let the omelet get cold good night no certainly i shall not cried le roux so good of youâiâerâdo like omelet good night calmly he returned to his writing table where in the pursuit of the elu sive character whose exploits he was chronicling and who had brought him fame and wealth he forgot in the same moment helen cumberly and the omelet the table clock ticked merrily on scratchâscratchâsplutter â scratchâ went henry lerouxs pen for this up todate littăšrateur essayist by inclina tion creator of martin zeda crim inal scientist by popular clamor was yet oldfashioned enough and sufficient of an enthusiast to pen his work while lesser men dictated so amid that classic company smil ing or frowning upon him from the oaken shelves where petronius arbiter exquisite rubbed shoulders with bal zac plebeian where omar khayyăąm leaned confidentially toward philostra tus where mark twain standing squarely beside thomas carlyle glared across the room at george meredith henry leroux pursued the amazing career of martin zeda it wanted but five minutes to the hour of midnight when again the door bell clamored in the silence leroux wrote steadily on the bell continued to ring and furthermore the ringer could be heard beating upon the outer door soames cried leroux irritably soames why the deuce dont you go to the door the yellow claw leroux stood up dashing his pen upon the table i shall have to sack that man he cried he takes too many libertiesâ stopping out until this hour of the night he pulled open the study door crossed the hallway and opened the door beyond in out of the darknessâfor the stair lights had been extinguishedâstag gered a woman a woman whose pale face exhibited despite the ravages of sorrow or illness signs of quite unusual beauty her eyes were wide opened and terrorstricken the pupils con tracted almost to vanishing point she wore a magnificent cloak of civet fur wrapped tightly about her and as le roux opened the door she tottered past him into the lobby glancing back over her shoulder with his upraised hands plunged pathetically into the mop of his hair leroux turned and stared at the in truder she groped as if a darkness had descended clutched at the sides of the study doorway and then unstead ily enteredâand sank down upon the big chesterfield in utter exhaustion leroux rubbing his chin perplex edly walked in after her he scarcely had his foot upon the study carpet ere the woman started up tremulously and shot out from the enveloping furs a bare arm and a pointing quivering finger close the door she cried hoarsely close the door he has followed me the disturbed novelist as a man in a dream turned retraced his steps and closed the outer door of the flat then rubbing his chin more vigorously than ever and only desisting from this ex ercise to fumble in his disheveled hair he walked back into the study whose athenean calm had thus mysteriously been violated two minutes to midnight the most respectable flat in respectable west minster a lonely and very abstracted novelistâand a palefaced beautiful woman enveloped in costly furs sitting staring with fearful eyes straight be fore her this was such a scene as his sense of the proprieties and of the prob abilities could never have permitted henry leroux to create his visitor kept moistening her dry lips and swallowing emotionally standing at a discreet distance from her madam began leroux nervously she waved her hand enjoining him to silence and at the same time inti mating that she would explain herself directly speech became possible while she sought to recover her composure leroux gradually forcing himself out of the dreamlike state studied her with a sort of anxious curiosity it now became apparent to him that his visitor was no more than twenty five or twentysix years of age but ill ness or trouble or both together had seared and marred her beauty amid the auburn masses of her hair gleamed streaks not of gray but of purest white the low brow was faintly wrinkled and the bigâunnaturally big âeyes were purple shaded while two heavy lines traced their way from the corner of the nostrils to the corner of the mouthâof the drooping mouth with the bloodless lips her pallor became more strange and interesting the longer he studied it for underlying the skin was a yellow tinge which he found inexplicable but which he linked in his mind with the con tracted pupils of her eyes seeking vainly for a common cause he had a hazy impression that his visitor beneath her furs was most in adequately clothed and seeking con firmation of this his gaze strayed downward to where one little slippered foot peeped out from the civet furs detective story magazine leroux suppressed a gasp he had caught a glimpse of a bare ankle he crossed to his writing table and seated himself glancing sideways at this living mystery suddenly she be gan in a voice tremulous and scarcely audible mr leroux at a greatâat a very great personal risk i have come to night what i have to ask of youâto entreat of youâwill will two bare arms emerged from the fur and she began clutching at her throat and bosom as though chokingâ dying leroux leaped up and would have run to her but forcing a ghastly smile she waved him away again it is all right she muttered swal lowing noisily but frightful spasms of pain con vulsed her contorting her pale face some brandy cried leroux anxiously if you please whispered the vis itor she dropped her arms and fell back upon the chesterfield insensible chapter ii midnight and mr king leroux clutched at the corner of the writing table to steady him self and stood there looking at the deathly face under the most favor able circumstances he was no man of action although in common with the rest of his kind he prided himself upon the possession of that presence of mind which he lacked it was a situation which could not have alarmed martin zeda but it alarmed immeasurably nay struck inert with horror martin zedas creator then in upon lerouxs mental tur moil a sensible idea intruded itself doctor cumberly he muttered i hope to heaven he is in without touching the recumbent form upon the chesterfield without seeking to learn without daring to learn if she lived or had died leroux the tempo of his life changed to a breathless gallop rushed out of the study across the entrance hall and throwing wide the flat door leaped up the stair to the flat aboveâthat of his old friend doctor cumberly the patter of the slippered feet grew faint upon the stair then as leroux reached the landing above became in audible altogether in lerouxs study the table clock ticked merrily on seeming to hasten its ticking as the hand crept around closer and closer to midnight the mosaic shade of the lamp mingled reds and blues and greens upon the white ceiling above and poured golden light upon the pages of manuscript strewn about be neath it this was a typical work room of a literary man having the ear of the publicâtypical in every respect save for the furclad figure outstretched upon the settee and now the peeping light indis creetly penetrated to the hem of a silken garment revealed by some disarrange ment of the civet fur to the eye of an experienced observer had such an ob server been present in henry lerouxs study this billow of silk and lace be hind the sheltering fur must have pro claimed itself the edge of a night robe just as the ankle beneath had pro claimed itself to henry lerouxs shocked susceptibilities to be innocent of stocking thirty seconds were wanted to com plete the cycle of the day when one of the listless hands thrown across the back of the chesterfield opened and closed spasmodically the fur at the bosom of the midnight visitor began rapidly to rise and fall then with a choking cry the woman struggled upright her hair hastily dressed burst free of its bindings and the yellow claw poured in gleaming cascade down about her shoulders clutching with one hand at her cloak in order to keep it wrapped about her and holding the other blindly before her she rose and with that same odd groping movement began to approach the writing table the pupils of her eyes were mere pin points now she shuddered convulsively and her skin was dewed with perspiration her breath came in agonized gasps heavensâi am dying and i cannotâtell him she breathed feverishly weakly she took up a pen and upon a quarto page already half filled with lerouxs small neat il legible writing began to scrawl a mes sage bending down one hand upon the table and with her whole body shaking some three or four wavering lines she had written when intimatelyâfor the flat of henry leroux in palace mansions lay within sight of the clock faceâbig ben began to chime mid night the writer started back and dropped a great blot of ink upon the paper then realizing the cause of the disturb ance forced herself to continue her task the chime being completed one boomed the clock two three four the light in the entrance hall went out five boomed big ben six seven a hand of old ivory hue a long yellow clawish hand with part of a sinewy forearm crept in from the black lobby through the study doorway and touched the electric switch eight the study was plunged in darkness uttering a sobâa cry of agony and horror that came from her very soulâ the woman stood upright and turned to face toward the door clutching the sheet of paper in one rigid hand through the leaded panes of the win dow above the writing table swept a silvern beam of moonlight it poured searchingly upon the furclad figure swaying by the table cutting through the darkness of the room like some huge scimitar to end in a pallid pool about the womans shadow on the cen ter of the persian carpet coincident with her sobbing cryâ nine boomed big ben ten two handsâwith outstretched crooked clutching fingersâleaped from the darkness into the light of the moon beam heavens oh heavens came a frenzied rasping shriekâmr king straight at the bare throat leaped the yellow hands a gurgling cry roseâfell âand died away gently noiselessly the lady of the civet fur sank upon the carpet by the table as she fell a dim black figure bent over her the tearing of paper told of the note being snatched from her frozen grip but never for a mo ment did the face or the form of her assailant encroach upon the moonbeam batlike this second and terrible vis itant avoided the light the deed had occupied so brief a time that but one note of the great bell had accompanied it twelve rang out the final stroke from the clock tower a low eerie whistle minor rising in three irregular notes and falling in weird unusual cadence to silence again came from somewhere outside the room then darknessâstillnessâwith the moon a witness of one more ghastly crime presently confused and intermingled voices from above proclaimed the re turn of leroux with the doctor they were talking in an excited key the voice of leroux especially sounding almost hysterical they created such detective story magazine a disturbance that they attracted the at tention of mr john exel m p oc cupant of the flat below who at that very moment had returned from the house and was about to insert the key in the lock of his door he looked up the stairway but all being in darkness was unable to detect anything there fore he called out is that you leroux is anything the matter matter exel cried leroux theres the deuce of a business for mercys sake come up his curiosity greatly excited mr exel mounted the stairs entering the lobby of lerouxs flat immediately be hind the owner and doctor cumberlyâ who like leroux was arrayed in a dressing gown for he had been in bed when summoned by his friend you are all in the dark here mut tered doctor cumberly fumbling for the switch some one has turned the light out whispered leroux nervously i left it on doctor cumberly pressed the switch turning up the lobby light as exel en tered from the landing then leroux entering the study first of the three switched on the light there also one glance he threw about the room then started back like a man physically strickep cumberly he gasped cum berly and he pointed to the furry heap by the writing table you said she lay on the chester field muttered cumberly i left her there doctor cumberly crossed the room and dropped upon his knees he turned the white face toward the light gently parted the civet fur and pressed his ear to the silken covering of the breast he started slightly and looked into the glazing eyes replacing the fur which he had dis arranged the physician stood up and fixed a keen gaze upon the face of henry leroux the latter swallowed noisily moistening his parched lips is she he muttered is she heavens mercy leroux whis pered mr exel what does this mean the woman is dead said doctor cumberly in common with all medical men doctor cumberly was a physiognomist he was a great physician and a propor tionately great physiognomist there fore when he looked into henry lerouxs eyes he saw there and recog nized horror and consternation with no further evidence than that furnished by his own powers of perception he knew that the mystery of this womans death was as inexplicable to henry le roux as it was inexplicable to himself he was a masterful man with the gray eyes of a diplomat and he knew leroux as did few men he laid both hands upon the novelists shoulders brace up old chap he said you will want all your wits about you i left her began leroux hesitat inglyâi left we know all about where you left her leroux interrupted cumberly but what we want to get at is this what occurred between the time you left her and the time of our return exel who had walked across to the table and with a horrorstricken face was gingerly examining the vic tim now exclaimed why leroux she isâshe is undressed leroux clutched at his disheveled hair with both hands my dear exel he cried my dear good man why do you use that tone you say she is undressed as though i were responsible for the poor souls condition on the contrary leroux retorted exel standing very upright and star the yellow claw ing through his monocle on the con trary you misconstrue me i did not intend to implyâto insinuate my dear exel broke in doctor cumberly leroux is perfectly well aware that you intended nothing un kindly but the poor chap quite natu rally is distraught at the moment you must understand that man i understand and i am sorry said exel casting a sidelong glance at the body of course it is a delicate sub ject no doubt leroux can ex plain damn your explanation shrieked leroux hysterically i cannot ex plain if i could explain i leroux said cumberly placing his arm paternally about the shaking man you are such a nervous subject do make an effort old fellow pull your self together exel does not know the circumstances i am curious to learn them said the m p icily leroux was about to launch some angry retort but cumberly forced him into the chesterfield and crossing to a bureau poured out a stiff peg of brandy from a decanter which stood there le roux sank upon the chesterfield rub bing his fingers up and down his palms with a curious nervous movement and glancing at the dead woman and at exel alternately in a mechanical reg ular fashion pathetic to behold mr exel tapping his boot with the head of his inverted cane was staring fixedly at the doctor here you are leroux said cum berly drink this up and let us arrange our facts in decent order before we start to phone for the police concluded exel his gaze upon the last speaker leroux drank the brandy at a gulp and put down the glass upon a little persian coffee table with a hand which he had somehow contrived to steady you are keen on the official form exel he said with a wry smile please accept my apology for my re centâerâoutburst but picture this thing happening in your place i cannot declared exel bluntly you lack imagination said cum berly take a whisky and soda and help me to search the flat search the flat the physician raised a forefinger forensically since you exel if not actually in the building must certainly have been within sight of the street entrance at the moment of the crime and since le roux and i descended the stair and met you on the landing it is reasonable to suppose that the assassin can only be in one placeâhere here cried exel and leroux to gether did you see any one leave the lower hall as you entered no one emphatically there was no one there then i am right good heavens whispered exel glancing about him with a new and keen apprehensiveness take your drink concluded cum berly and join me in my search thanks replied exel nervously proffering a cigar case but i wont drink as you wish said the doctor who thus in his masterful way acted the host and i wont smoke but do you light up later muttered exel later let us search first leroux stood up cumberly forced him back stay where you are leroux it is elementary strategy to operate from a fixed base this study shall be the base ready exel exel nodded and the search com menced leroux sat rigidly upon the settee his hands resting upon his knees watching and listening save for the missing page missing page detective story magazine squarely in the middle of the room fixed his eyes upon the still form lying in the shadow of the writing table you will have been called in doc tor he said faking the proffered tum bler at the time of the crime exactly replied cumberly mr leroux ran up to my flat and sum moned me to see the woman what time would that be big ben had just struck the final stroke of twelve when i came out onto the landing mr leroux would be waiting there for you he stood in my entrance lobby while i slipped on my dressing gown and we came down together i was entering from the street in terrupted exel as they were descend ing from above you can enter from the street sir in a moment said dunbar holding up his hand one witness at a time if you please exel shrugged his shoulders and turned slightly leaning his elbow upon the mantelpiece and flicking off the ash from his cigar i take it you were in bed ques tioned dunbar turning again to the doctor i had been in bed about a quarter of an hour when i was aroused by the ringing of the doorbell this ringing struck me as so urgent that i ran out in my pajamas and found there mr leroux in a very disturbed state what did he say give his own words as nearly as you remember them leroux who had been standing sank slowly back into the armchair with his eyes upon doctor cumberly as the lat ter replied he said cumberly cumberly for heavens sake come down at once there is a strange woman in my flat ap parently in a dying condition what did you do i ran into my bedroom and slipped on my dressing gown leaving mr le roux in the entrance hall then with the clock chiming the last stroke of midnight we came out together and i closed my door behind me there was no light on the stair but our conversa tionâmr leroux was speaking in a very highpitched voice what was he saying he was explaining to me how some woman unknown to him had inter rupted his work a few minutes before by ringing his doorbell inspector dunbar held up his hand i wont ask you to repeat what he said doctor mr leroux presently can give me his own words we had descended to this floor then resumed cumberly when mr exel entering below called up to us asking if anything was the matter le roux replied matter exel theres the deuce of a business for mercys sake come up well mr exel thereupon joined us at the door of this flat was it open yes mr leroux had rushed up to me leaving the door open behind him the light was out both in the lobby and in the study a fact iipon which i com mented at the time it was all the more curious as mr leroux had left both lights on did he say so he did the circumstances sur prised him to a marked degree we came in and i turned up the light in the lobby then leroux entering the study turned up the light there too i entered next followed by mr exelâ and we saw the body lying where you see it now who saw it first mr leroux he drew my attention to it saying that he had left her lying on the chesterfield and not upon the floor the yellow claw you examined her i did she was dead but still warm she exhibited signs of recent illness and of being addicted to some drug habit probably morphine this be yond doubt contributed to her death but the direct cause was asphyxiation she had been strangled heavens groaned leroux drop ping his face into his hands you found marks on her throat the marks were very slight no great pressure was required in her weak condition you did not move the body certainly not a more complete ex amination must be made of course but i extracted a piece of torn paper from her clenched right hand inspector dunbar lowered his tufted brows im not glad to know you did that he said it should have been left it was done on the spur of the mo ment but without altering the position of the hand or arm the paper lies upon the table yonder inspector dunbar took a long drink thus far he had made no attempt to examine the victim pulling out a bulging note case from the inside pocket of his blue serge coat he un screwed a fountain pen carefully tested the nib upon his thumb nail and made three or four brief entries then stretching out one long arm he laid the wallet and the pen beside his glass upon the top of a bookcase without other wise changing his position and glanc ing aside at exel said now mr exel what help can you give us i have little to add to doctor cum berlys account answered exel off handedly the whole thing seemed to meâ what it seemed interrupted dun bar does not interest scotland yard mr exel and wont interest the jury leroux glanced up for a moment then set his teeth hard so that his jaw muscles stood out prominently under the pallid skin what do you want to know then asked exel i will be wanting to know said dunbar where you were coming from tonight from the house of commons you came direct i left sir brian malpas at the cor ner of victoria street at four minutes to twelve by big ben and walked straight home actually entering here from the street as the clock was chim ing the last stroke of midnight then you would have walked up the street from an easterly direction certainly did you meet any one or anything a taxicab emptyâfor the hood was loweredâpassed me as i turned the corner there was no other vehicle in the street and no person you dont know from which door the cab came as i turned the corner replied exel i heard the man starting his en gine although when i actually saw the cab it was in motion but judging by the sound to which i refer the cab had been stationary if not at the door of palace mansions certainly at that of the next blockâst andrews man sions did you hear or see anything else i saw nothing whatever but just as i approached the street door i heard a peculiar whistle apparently proceed ing from the gardens in the center of the square i attached no importance to it at the time what kind of whistle i have forgotten the actual notes but the effect was very odd in some way in what way an impression of this sort is not en tirely reliable inspector but it struck me as oriental detective story magazine ah said dunbar and reached out the long arm for his notebook can i be of any further assistance said exel glancing at his watch you had entered the hallway and were about to enter your own flat when the voices of doctor cumberly and mr leroux attracted your attention i actually had the key in my hand replied exel did you actually have the key in the lock let me think mused exel and he took out a bunch of keys and dangled them reflectively before his eyes no i was fumbling for the right key when i heard the voices above me but were you facing your door no averred exel perceiving the drift of the inspectors inquiries i was facing the stairway the whole time and although it was in darkness there is a street lamp immediately outside on the pavement and i can swear positively that no one descended that there was no one in the hall nor on the stair ex cept mr leroux and doctor cum berly ah said dunbar again and made further entries in his book i need not trouble you further sir good night exel despite his earlier attitude of boredom now ignored this official dis missal and tossing the stump of his cigar into the grate lighted a cigarette and with both hands thrust deep in his pockets stood leaning back against the mantelpiece the detective turned to leroux have a brandy and soda sug gested doctor cumberly his eyes turned upon the pathetic face of the novelist but leroux shook his head wearily go ahead inspector he said i am anxious to tell you all i know heaven knows i am anxious to tell you a sound was heard of a key being in serted in the lock of a door four pairs of curious eyes were turned toward the entrance lobby when the door opened and a sleek man of medium height clean shaven but with his hair cut low upon the cheek bones so as to give the impression of short side whiskers entered in a manner at once furtive and servile he wore a black overcoat and a bowler hat reclosing the door he turned perceived the group in the study and fell back as though some one had struck him a fierce blow abject terror was written upon his features and for a moment the idea of flight appeared to suggest itself urgently to him but finally he took a step for ward toward the study whos thissnapped dunbar with out removing his leonine eyes from the newcomer it is soames came the weary voice of leroux butler yes wheres he been i dont know he remained out without my permission he did eh inspector dunbar thrust forth a long finger at the shrinking form in the door way mr soames he said you will be going to your own room and waiting there until i ring for you yes sir said soames holding his hat in both hands and speaking huskily yes sir certainly sir he crossed the lobby and disap peared there is no other way out is there inquired the detective glancing at doc tor cumberly there is no other way was the re ply but surely you dont suspect i would suspect the archbishop of westminster snapped dunbar if he came in like that now sirâhe turned to lerouxâyou were alone here tonight the yellow claw quite alone inspector the truth is i fear that my servants take liberties in the absence of my wife in the absence of your wife where is your wife she is in paris is she a frenchwoman no oh no but my wife is a painter you understand andâerâi met her in parisâer must you insist upon theseâdomestic particulars inspector if mr exel is anxious to turn in replied the inspector after his no doubt exhausting duties at the house and if doctor cumberly i have no secrets from cumberly interjected leroux the doctor has known me almost from boyhood butâ erâturning to the politicianâdont you know exelâno offense no of fense my dear leroux responded exel hastily i am the offender permit me to wish you all good night he crossed the study and at the door paused and turned rely upon me leroux he said to help in any way within my power he crossed the lobby opened the outer door and departed now mr leroux resumed dun bar about this matter of your wifes absence chapter iv a window opened while henry leroux collected his thoughts doctor cumberly glanced across at the writing table where lay the fragment of paper which had been clutched in the dead womans hand then turned his head again to ward the inspector staring at him curi ously since dunbar had not yet at tempted even a glance at the strange message he wondered what had prompted the present line of inquiry my wife began leroux shared a studio in paris at the time that i met her with an american ladyâa very tal ented portrait painterâerâa miss denise ryland you may know her name but of course you dont no well my wife is herself quite clever with her brush in fact she has ex hibited more than once at the paris salon we agreed atâerâthe time of ourâof ourâengagement that she should be free to visit her old artistic friends in paris at any time you un derstand there was to be no let or hindrance is this really necessary inspector pray go on mr leroux well you understand it was a give andtake arrangement because i am afraid that i myself demand certainâ sacrifices from my wifeâandâerâi did not feel entitled toâinter fere you see inspector interrupted doctor cumberly they are a bo hemian pair and bohemians inevitably bore one another at times this little arrangement was intended as a safety valve whenever ennui attacked mrs leroux she was at liberty to depart for a week to her own friends in paris leaving leroux to the bachelors ex istence which is really his proper state to go unshaven and unshorn to dine upon bread and cheese and onions to work until all hours of the morning and generally to enjoy himself does she usually stay long in quired dunbar not more than a week as a rule answered leroux you must excuse me continued the detective if i seem to pry into in timate matters but on these occasions how does mrs leroux get on for money i have opened a credit for her ex plained the novelist wearily at the credit lyonnais in paris dunbar scribbled busily in his note book detective story magazine does she take her maid with her he jerked suddenly she has no maid at the moment replied leroux she has been with out one for twelve months or more now when did you last hear from her three days ago did you answer the letter yes my answer was among the mail which soames took to the post to night you said though if i remember rightly that he was out without per mission leroux ran his fingers through his hair i meant that he should only have been absent five minutes or so while he remained out for more than an hour inspector dunbar nodded compre hendingly tapping his teeth with the head of the fountain pen and the other servants there are only two a cook and a maid i released them for the evening âglad to get rid of themâwanted to work they are late they take liberties because i am easygoing i see said dunbar so that you were quite alone this evening whenâ he nodded in the direction of the writ ing tableâyour visitor came quite alone was her arrival the first interrup tion noâerânot exactly miss cum berly my daughter explained doctor cumberly knowing that mr leroux at these times was very neglectful in regard to meals prepared him an ome let and brought it down in a chafing dish how long did she remain asked the inspector of leroux iâerâdid not exactly open the door we chatted throughâerâ through the letter box and she left the omelet outside on the landing what time would that be it was a quarter to twelve declared cumberly i had been supping with some friends and returned to find helen my daughter engaged in prepar ing the omelet i congratulated her upon the happy thought knowing that leroux was probably starving himself i see the omelet though seems to be upset here on the floor said the inspector cumberly briefly explained how it came to be there leroux punctuating his friends story with affirmative nods then the door of the flat was open all the time cried dunbar yes replied cumberly but while exel and i searched the other roomsâ and our search was exhaustiveâmr leroux remained here in the study and in full view of the lobbyâas you see for yourself no living thing said leroux monotonously left this flat from the time that the three of us exel cum berly and i entered up to the time that miss cumberly came and with the doctor went out again hm said the inspector making notes it appears so certainly i will ask you then for your own ac count mr leroux of the arrival of the woman in the civet furs pay special attentionâhe pointed with his foun tain penâto the time at which the various incidents occurred leroux growing calmer as he pro ceeded with the strange story complied with the inspectors request he had practically completed his account when the doorbell rang its the servants said doctor cum berly soames will open the door but soames did not appear the ringing being repeated i told him to remain in his room the yellow claw said dunbar until i rang for him i remember i will open the door said cum berly and tell the servants to stay in the kitchen snapped dunbar doctor cumberly opened the door admitting the cook and housemaid there has been an unfortunate ac cident he said but not to your mas ter you need not be afraid but be good enough to remain in the kitchen for the present peeping in furtively as they passed the two women crossed the lobby and went to their own quarters mr soames next muttered dun bar and glancing at cumberly as he returned from the lobby will you ring for him he requested doctor cumberly nodded and pressed a bell beside the mantelpiece an interval followed in which the in spector made notes and cumberly stood looking at leroux who was beating his palms upon his knees and staring un seeingly before him cumberly rang again and in re sponse to the second ring the house maid appeared at the door i rang for soames said doctor cumberly he is not in sir answered the girl inspector dunbar started as though he had been bitten what he cried not in no sir said the girl with wide open frightened eyes dunbar turned to cumberly you said there was no other way out there is no other way to my knowl edge wheres his room cumberly led the way to a room at the end of a short corridor and in spector dunbar entering and turning up the light glanced about the little apartment it was a very neat serv ants bedroom with comfortable quite simple furniture but the chest of drawers had been hastily ransacked and the contents of a trunkâor some of its contentsâlay strewn about the floor he has packed his grip came le rouxs voice from the doorway its gone the window was wide open dunbar sprang forward and leaned out over the ledge looking to right and left above and below a sort of square courtyard was be neath and for the convenience of tradesmen a hand lift was constructed outside the kitchens of the three flats comprising the house i e mr exels ground floor henry lerouxs second floor and doctor cumberlys top it worked in a skeleton shaft which passed close to the left of soames window for an active man this was a good enough ladder and the inspector with drew his head shrugging his square shoulders irritably my fault entirely he muttered biting his wiry mustache i should have come and seen for myself if there was another way out leroux in a new flutter of excite ment now craned from the window it might be possible to climb down the shaft he cried after a brief sur vey but not if one were carrying a heavy grip such as that which he has taken hm said dunbar you are a writing gentleman i understand and yet it does not occur to you that he could have lowered the bag on a cord if he wanted to avoid the noise of drop ping it yesâerâof course muttered le roux but reallyâbut reallyâoh good heavens i am bewildered what in heavens name does it all mean it means trouble replied dunbar grimly bad trouble they returned to the study and in spector dunbar for the first time since detective story magazine his arrival walked across and exam ined the fragmentary message raising his eyebrows when he discovered that it was written upon the same paper as lerouxs manuscripts he glanced too at the pen lying on a page of martin zeda near the lamp and at the inky splash which told how hastily the pen had been dropped thenâhis brows drawn togetherâhe stooped to the body of the murdered woman partially raising the fur cloak he suppressed a gasp of astonishment why she only wears a silk night dress and a pair of suede slippers he glanced back over his shoulder i had noted that said cumberly the whole business is utterly extraor dinary extraordinary is no word for it growled the inspector pursuing his ex amination marks of pressure at the throatâyes and generally unhealthy appearance due to the drug habit interjected doctor cumberly what drug i should not like to say out of hand possible morphine no jewelry continued the detec tive musingly wedding ringânot a new one finger nails well cared for but recently neglected hair dyed to hide gray patches dye wanted renew ing shoes french night robe silk good lace probably french also faint perfumeâdont know what it is âapparently proceeding from civet fur furs magnificent very costly he slightly moved the table lamp in order to direct its light upon the white face the bloodless lips were parted and the detective bent closely peering at the teeth thus revealed her teeth are oddly discolored doctor he said taking out a magni fying glass and examining them closely they had been recently scaled too so that she was not in the habit of neglecting them doctor cumberly nodded the drug habit again he said guardedly a proper examination will establish the full facts the inspector added brief notes to those already made ere he rose from beside the body then you are absolutely certain he said deliberately facing leroux that you had never set eyes on this woman prior to her coming here tonight i can swear it said leroux good replied the detective and closed his notebook with a snap usual formalities will have to be gone through but i dont think i need trou ble you gentlemen any further to night chapter v doctors differ doctor cumberly walked slowly upstairs to his own flat a picture etched indelibly upon his mind of henry leroux with a face of despair sitting below in his dining room and listening to the ominous sounds proceeding from the study where the police were now busily en gaged in the lobby he met his daugh ter helen who was waiting for him in a state of nervous suspense father she began while rebuke died upon the doctors lips tell me quickly what has happened perceiving that an explanation was unavoidable doctor cumberly outlined the story of the nights gruesome hap penings while big ben began to chime the hour of one helen eagereyed and with her charming face rather pale hung upon every word of the narrative and now concluded her father you must go to bed i insist but father cried the girl there is something she hesitated uneasily well helen go on said the doctor i am afraid you will refuse the yellow claw at least give me the opportunity wellâin the glimpse the half glimpse which i had of her i seemed doctor cumberly rested his hands upon his daughters shoulders charac teristically looking into the troubled gray eyes you dont mean he began i thought i recognized her whis pered the girl good heavens can it be possible i have been trying ever since to recall where we had met but without result it might mean so much doctor cumberly regarded her fix edly it might mean so much toâmr le roux but i suppose you will say it is impossible it is impossible said doctor cum berly firmly dismiss the idea helen but father pleaded the girl plac ing her hands over his own consider what is at stake i am anxious that you should not be come involved in this morbid business but you surely know me better than to expect me to faint or become hys terical or anything silly like that i was certainly shocked when i came down tonight becauseâwell it was all so frightfully unexpected doctor cumberly shook his head helen put her arms about his neck and raised her eyes to his you have no right to refuse she said softly dont you see that doctor cumberly frowned then you are right helen he agreed i should know your pluck well enough but if inspector dunbar is gone the police may refuse to admit us then let us hurry cried helen i am afraid they will take away side by side they descended to henry lerouxs flat ringing the bell which an hour earlier the lady of the civet furs had rung a sergeant in uniform opened the door is detective inspector dunbar here inquired the physician yes sir say that doctor cumberly wishes to speak to him andâas the man was about to departârequest him not to arouse mr leroux almost immediately the inspector ap peared a look of surprise upon his face which increased on perceiving the girl beside her father this is my daughter inspector ex plained cumberly she is a contributor to the planet and to various magazines and in this journalistic capacity meets many people in many walks of life she thinks she may be of use to you in pre paring your case dunbar bowed rather awkwardly glad to meet you miss cumberly came the inevitable formula entirely at your service i had an idea inspector said the girl laying her hand confidentially upon dunbars arm that i recognized when i entered mr lerouxs study tonight âdunbar noddedâthat i recognized âtheâthe victim good said the inspector rubbing his palms briskly together his tawny eyes sparkled and you would wish to see her again before we take her away very plucky of you miss cum berly but then you are a doctors daughter they entered and the inspector closed the door behind them dont arouse poor leroux whis pered cumberly to the detective i left him on a couch in the dining room he is still there replied dunbar poor chap it is he met helens glance and broke off shortly in the study two uniformed con stables and an officer in plain clothes were apparently engaged in making an a ds detective story magazine inventoryâor such was the impression conveyed the clock ticked merrily on its ticking a desecration where all else was hushed in deference to the grim visitor the body of the mur dered woman had been laid upon the chesterfield and a little dark bearded man was conducting an elaborate ex amination when seeing the trio enter he hastily threw the coat of civet fur over the body and stood up facing the intruders its all right doctor said the in spector and we shant detain you a moment he glanced over his shoul der mr hilton m r c s he said indicating the dark manâdoc tor cumberly and miss cumberly the divisional surgeon bowed to helen and eagerly grasped the hand of the celebrated physician i am fortunate in being able to ask your opinion he began doctor cumberly nodded shortly and with upraised hand cut him short i shall willingly give you any as sistance in my power he said but my daughter has voluntarily committed herself to a rather painful ordeal and i am anxious to get it over he stooped and raised the fur from the ghastly face helen her hand resting upon her fa thers shoulder ventured one rapid glance and then looked away shud dering slightly doctor cumberly re placed the coat and gazed anxiously at his daughter but helen with ad mirable courage having closed her eyes for a moment reopened them and smiled at her fathers anxiety she was pale but perfectly composed well miss cumberly inquired the inspector eagerly while all in the room watched this slim girl in her charming dishabille this dainty figure so utterly out of place in that scene of morbid crime she raised her gray eyes to the de tective i still believe that i have seen the face somewhere before but i shall have to reflect a whileâi meet so many folks you know in a casual wayâbe fore i can commit myself to any state ment in the leonine eyes looking into hers gleamed the light of admiration and approval the canny scotsman ad mired this girl for her beauty as a matter of course for her courage be cause courage was a quality standing high in his estimation but above all for her admirable discretion very proper miss cumberly he said very proper and wise on your part i dont wish to hurry you in any way butâhe hesitated glancing at the man in plain clothes who had now re sumed a careful perusal of a newspa perâbut her name doesnt happen to be vernon vernon cried the girl her eyes lighting up at sound of the name mrs vernon it is it is she was pointed out to me at the last arts ball âwhere she appeared in a most mon strous chinese costume chinese inquired dunbar produc ing the bulky notebook yes oh poor poor soul you know nothing further about her miss cumberly nothing inspector she was merely pointed out to me as one of the strangest figures in the hall her hus band i understand is an art expert who is he was said dunbar closing the book sharply he died this afternoon and a paragraph announcing his death appears in the newspaper which we found in the victims fur coat but how it was the only paragraph on the half page folded outward which was in any sense personal i am greatly in debted to you miss cumberly every hour wasted on a case like this means the yellow claw a fresh plait in the rope around the neck of the wrong man helen cumberly grew slowly quite pallid good night she said and bowing to the detective and to the surgeon she prepared to depart mr hilton touched doctor cumber lys arm as he too was about to retire may i hope he whispered that you will return and give me the benefit of your opinion in making out my re port doctor cumberly glanced at his daughter and seeing her to be per fectly composed for the moment i have formed no opinion mr hilton he said quietly not having had an op portunity to conduct a proper exam ination hilton bent and whispered confi dentially in the others ear she was drugged the innuendo underlying the words struck doctor cumberly forcibly and he started back with his brows drawn together in a frown do you mean that she was addicted to the use of drugs he asked sharply or that the drugging took place to night the drugging did take place to night whispered the other an in jection was made in the left shoulder with a hypodermic syringe the mark is quite fresh doctor cumberly glared at his fel low practitioner angrily are there no other marks of injec tion he asked on the left forearm yes obviously selfadministered oh i dont deny the habit but my point is this the in jection in the shoulder was not self administered come helen said cumberly tak ing his daughters arm for she had drawn near during the colloquy you must get to bed his face was very stern when he turned again to mr hilton i shall return in a few minutes he said and escorted his daughter from the room chapter vi at scotland yard matters of vital importance to some people whom already we have met and to others whom thus far we have not met were transacted in a lofty and rather bleaklooking room at scotland yard between the hours of nine and ten a m that is later in the morning of the fateful day whose ad vent we have heard acclaimed from the tower of westminster the room which was lighted by a large french window opening upon a balcony commanded an excellent view of the thames embankment the floor was polished to a degree of bright ness almost painful the distempered walls save for a severe and solitary etching of a former commissioner were nude in all their unloveliness a heavy deal tableâupon which rested a blotting pad a pewter inkpot several newspapers and two pensâtogether with three deal chairs built rather as monuments of durability than as exam ples of art constituted the only furni ture if we except an electric lamp with a green glass shade above the table this was the room of detective in spector dunbar and detective in spector dunbar at the hour of our en trance will be found seated in the chair placed behind the table his elbows rest ing upon the blotting pad at ten minutes past nine exactly the door opened and a thickset florid man buttoned up in a fawncolored raincoat and wearing a bowler hat of obsolete build entered he possessed a black mustache a breezy bustling manner and humorous blue eyes furthermore when he took off his hat he revealed the possession of a head of very bristly detective story magazine upstanding black hair this was de tective sergeant sowerbyand the same who was engaged in examining a news paper in the study of henry leroux when doctor cumberly and his daugh ter had paid their second visit to that scene of an unhappy souls dismissal well said dunbar glancing up at his subordinate inquiringly i have done all the cab depots re ported sergeant sowerby and a good many of the private owners but so far the man seen by mr exel has not turned up the word will be passed round now though said dunbar and we shall probably have him here during the day i hope so said the other good humoredly seating himself upon one of the two chairs ranged beside the wall if he doesnt show up well jerked dunbar if he doesnt it will look very black against le roux dunbar drummed upon the blotting pad with the lingers of his left hand it beats anything of the kind that has ever come my way he confessed you get pretty cautious at weighing people up in this business but i cer tainly dont thinkâmind you i go no furtherâbut i certainly dont think mr henry leroux would willingly kill a fly yet there is circumstantial evidence enough to hang him sergeant sowerby nodded gazing speculatively at the floor i wonder he said slowly why the girlâmiss cumberlyâhesitated about telling us the womans name i am not wondering about that at all replied dunbar bluntly she must meet thousands in the same way the wonder to me is that she remem bered at all i am open to bet half a crown that you couldnt remember the name of every woman you happened to have pointed out to you at an arts ball maybe not agreed sowerby shes a smart girl ill allow i see you have last nights papers there i have replied dunbar and im wondering if theres any connection well continued the inspector it looks on the face of it as though the news of her husbands death had some thing to do with mrs vernons pres ence at lerouxs flat its not a natural thing for a woman on the evening of her husbands death to rush straight away to another mans place its strange we couldnt find her clothes its not strange at all youre sim ply obsessed with the idea that this was a love intrigue think man the most abandoned woman wouldnt run to keep an appointment with a lover at a time like that and remember she had the news in her pocket she came to that flat dressedâor undressedâjust as we found her im sure of it and a point like that sometimes means the differ ence between hanging and acquittal sergeant sowerby digested these words composing his jovial counte nance in an expression of unnatural profundity then the point to my mind he said is the one raised by mr hilton by gum didnt doctor cumberly tell him off doctor cumberly replied dunbar is entitled to his opinion that the in jection in the womans shoulder was at least eight hours old while mr hilton is equally entitled to maintain that it was less than one hour old neither of them can hope to prove his case if either of them could it might make a difference to the evidenceâbut im not sure what time is your appointment ten oclock replied dunbar i am meeting mr debnamâthe late mr vernons solicitor there is something in it damme i am sure of it the yellow claw something in what the fact that mr vernon died yes terday evening and that his wife was murdered at midnight what have you told the press as little as possible but you will see that the early editions will all be screaming for the arrest of soames i shouldnt wonder he would be a useful man to have but hes probably out of london now i think not hes more likely to wait for instructions from his prin cipal his principal certainly you dont think soames did the murder do you no but hes obviously an ac cessory im not so sure even of that then why did he bolt because he had a guilty conscience yes agreed sowerby it does turn out that way sometimes at any rate stringer is after him but hes got next to nothing to go upon has any reply been received from mrs leroux in paris no answered dunbar frowning thoughtfully her husbands wire would reach her first thing this morn ing i am expecting to hear of a reply at any moment theyre a funny couple altogether said sowerby i cant imagine myself standing for mrs sowerby spending her weekends in paris asking for trouble i call it it does seem a daft arrangement agreed dunbar but then as you say theyre a funny couple i never saw such a bundle of nerves in all my life leroux sowerby nodded i suppose he said its the artistic temperament if mrs leroux has got it too i dont wonder that they get fed up with one anothers company thats about the secret of it and now i shall be glad sowerby if you will be after that taxi man again re port at one oclock i shall be here by the way said sowerby with his hand on the doorknob who the blazes is mr king inspector dunbar looked up mr king he replied slowly is the solution of the mystery chapter vii the man in the limousine the house of the late horace ver non was a modern villa of pros perous appearance but on this sunny september morning a palpable atmos phere of gloom seemed to overlie it this made itself perceptible even to the toughened and unimpressionable nerves of inspector dunbar as he mounted the five steps leading up to the door glancing meanwhile at the lowered blinds at the windows he wondered if failing these evidences and his own private knowledge of the facts he should have recognized that the hand of tragedy had placed its mark upon this house but when the door was opened by a whitefaced servant he told him self that he should for a veritable mi asma of death seemed to come out to meet him to envelop him within proceeded a subdued activ ity somber figures moved upon the staircase and inspector dunbar hav ing presented his card presently found himself in a wellappointed library at the table whereon were spread a number of documents sat a lean clean shaven sallowfaced man wearing goldrimmed pincenez a man whose demeanor of businesslike gloom was most admirably adapted to that place and occasion this was mr debnam the solicitor he gravely waved the detective to an armchair adjusted his pincenez and coughed introductorily your communication inspector he detective story magazine beganâhe had the kind of voice which seems to be buried in sawdust pack ingâwas brought to me this morn ing and has disturbed me immeasur ably unspeakably you have been to view the body sir one of my clerks who knew mrs vernon has just returned to this house to report that he has identified her i should have preferred you to have gone yourself sir began dun bar taking out his notebook my state of health inspector said the solicitor renders it undesirable that i should submit myself to an or deal so unnecessaryâso wholly un necessary very good muttered dunbar making an entry in his book your clerk then whom i can see in a mo ment identifies the murdered woman as mrs vernon what was her chris tian name irisâiris mary vernon inspector dunbar made a note of the fact and now he said you will have read the copy of that portion of my re port which i submitted to you this morningâacting upon information supplied by miss helen cumberly yes yes inspector i have read it âbut by the way i do not know miss cumberly miss cumberly explained the de tective is the daughter of doctor cumberly a harley street physician she lives with her father in the flat above that of mr leroux she saw the body by accidentâand recognized it as that of a lady who had been named to her at the last arts ball ah said debnam yesâi seeâ at the arts ball inspector this is a mysterious and a very ghastly case it is indeed sir agreed dunbar can you throw any light upon the presence of mrs vernon at mr le rouxs flat on the very night of her husbands death i canâand i cannot answered the solicitor leaning back in the chair and again adjusting his pincenez in the manner of a man having important mat tersâand gloomy very gloomy mat tersâto communicate good said the inspector and pre pared to listen you see continued debnam the late mrs vernon was not actually re siding with her husband at the date of his death indeed ostensiblyâthe solicitor shook a lean forefinger at his visă visâ ostensibly inspector she was visiting her sister in scotland inspector dunbar sat up very straight his brows drawn down over the tawny eyes these visits were of frequent oc currence and usually of about a weeks duration mr vernon my late client a manâill not deny itâof inconstant affectionsâyou understand me in spectorâdid not greatly concern him self with his wifes movements she belonged to a smart bohemian set and âto use a popular figure of speechâ burned the candle at both ends late dances night clubs bridge parties and other feverish pursuits possibly taken up as a result of theâshall i say coolingâof her husbands affec tions there was another woman in the case i fear so inspector in fact i am sure of it but to return to mrs ver non my client provided her with am ple funds and i myself have ex pressed to him astonishment respecting her expenditures in scotland i under stand that her sister was in compara tively poor circumstances and i went so far as to point out to mr vernon that one hundred pounds wasâshall i say an excessiveâoutlay upon a the yellow claw weeks sojourn in auchterander perth a hundred pounds one hundred pounds was it queried by mr vernon not at all was mr vernon personally ac quainted with this sister in perth he was not inspector mrs ver non at the time of her marriage did not enjoy that social status to which my late client elevated her for many years she held no open communication with any member of her family but lat terly as i have explained she acquired the habit of recuperatingârecuperat ing from the effects of her febrile pleas uresâat this obscure place in scotland and mr vernon his interest in her movements having considerablyâshall i say abatedâoffered no objection even suffered it gladly counting the cost but little against freedom suggested dunbar scrib bling in his notebook rather crudely expressed perhaps said the solicitor peering over the top of his glasses but you have the idea i come now to my clients awakening four days ago he learned the truth he learned that he was being deceived deceived mrs vernon thoroughly exhausted with irregular living announced that she was about to resort once more to the healing breezes of the heatherland mr debnam was thoroughly warming to his discourse and thoroughly enjoy ing his own dusty phrases interrupting you for a moment said the inspector at what intervals did these visits take place at remarkably regular intervals in spector something like six times a year for how long had mrs vernon made a custom of these visits roughly for two years thank you will you go on sir she requested mr vernon then on the last occasionto give her a check for eighty pounds and this he did un questioningly on thursday the sec ond of september she left for scot land did she take her maid her maid always received a holiday on these occasions mrs vernon wired her respecting the date of her return did any one actually see her off no not that i am aware of in spector to put the whole thing quite bluntly mr debnam said dunbar fixing his tawny eyes upon the solicitor mr vernon was thoroughly glad to get rid of her for a week mr debnam shifted uneasily in his chair the truculent directness of the detective was unpleasing to his tortuous mind however i fear you have hit upon the truth he confessed and i must admit that we have no legal evidence of her leav ing for scotland on this or on any other occasion letters were received from perth and letters sent to auch terander from london were answered but the truth the painful truth came to light unexpectedly dramatically on monday last four days ago exactly three days before the death of my client mr debnam wagged his finger at the inspector again i maintain he said that this painful discovery which i am about to men tion precipitated my clients end al though it is a fact that there wasâ hereditary heart trouble but i admit that his neglect of his wifeâto give it no harsher nameâcontributed to the catastrophe he paused to give dramatic point to the revelation walking homeward at a lafe hour on monday evening from a flat in vic toria streetâthe flat ofâshall i em detective story magazine ploy the term a particular friendâ mr vernon was horrifiedâhorrified beyond measure to perceive in a large and wellappointed carâa limousineâ his wife the inside lights of the car were on then no but the light from a street lamp shone directly into the car a tem porary block in the traffic compelled the driver of the car whom my client de scribed to me as an asiaticâto pull up for a moment there within a few yards of her husband mrs vernon re clined in the carâor rather in the arms of a male companion what positively mr debnam was se dately enjoying himself positively my dear inspector in the arms of a man of extremely dark complexion mr vernon was unable to perceive more than this for the man had his back to ward him but the light shone fully upon the face of mrs vernon who ap peared pale and exhausted she wore a conspicuous motor coat of civet fur and it was this which first attracted mr vernons attention the blow was a very severe one to a man in my clients state of health and although i cannot claim that his own conscience was clear this open violation of the marriage vows outraged the husband âoutraged him in fact he was so perturbed that he stood there shaking quivering unable to speak or act and the car drove away before he had re covered sufficient presence of mind to note the number in which direction did the car pro ceed toward victoria station any other particulars not regarding the car its driver or its occupants but early on the follow ing morning mr vernon very much shaken called upon me and instructed me to dispatch an agent to perth im mediately my agents report reached me at practically the same time as the news of my clients death and his report was his report inspector telegraphic of course was this that no sister of mrs vernon resided at the address that the place was a cottage occupied by a cer tain mrs fry and her husband that the husband was of no occupation and had no visible means of supportâhe ticked off the points on the long fore fingerâthat the frys lived better than any of their neighbors andâmost im portant of allâthat mrs frys maiden name which my agent discovered by recourse to the parish register of mar riagesâwas ann fairchild what of that ann fairchild was a former maid of mrs vernon in short it amounts to this then mrs vernon during these various ab sences never went to scotland at all it was a conspiracy exactlyâexactly inspector i wired instructing my agent to extort from the woman fry the address to which she forwarded letters received by her for mrs vernon the ladys death news of which will now have reached him will no doubt be a lever enabling my representative to obtain the desired information when do you expect to hear from him at any moment failing a full con fession by the frys you will of course know how to act inspector damme cried dunbar can your man be relied upon to watch them they mustnt slip away shall i in struct perth to arrest the couple i wired my agent this morning in spector to communicate with the local police respecting the frys inspector dunbar tapped his small widely separated teeth with the end of his fountain pen i have had one priceless witness slip the yellow claw through my fingers he muttered ill hand in my resignation if the frys go to whom do you refer inspector dunbar rose it is a point with which i need not trouble you sir he said it was not included in the extract of report sent to you this is going to be the biggest case of my professional career or my name is not robert dunbar closing his notebook he thrust it into his pocket and replaced his fountain pen in the little leather wallet of course said the solicitor rising in turn and adjusting the troublesome pincenez there was some intrigue with leroux so much is evident you will be thinking that eh my dear inspectorâmr debnam the wily was seeking informationâ my dear inspector lerouxs own wife was absent in parisâquite a safe dis tance and mrs vernonânow proven to be a woman conducting a love in trigueâis found dead under most com promising circumstancesâmost com promising circumstancesâin his flat his servants even are got safely out of the way for the evening quite so said dunbar shortly quite so mr debnam he opened the door might i see the late mrs vernons maid she is at her home as i told you mrs vernon habitually released her for the period of these absences the notebook reappeared the young womans address you can get it from the house keeper is there anything else you wish to know nothing beyond that thank you three minutes later inspector dun bar had written in his book clarice goodstone care of mrs herne no a robert street hampstead road n w he departed from the house whereat death the gleaner had twice knocked with his scythe chapter viii cabman two returning to scotland yard in spector dunbar walked straight up to his own room there he found sow erby very redfaced and humid and a taximan who sat stolidly surveying the embankment from the window hello cried dunbar hes turned up then no he hasnt replied sowerby with a mild irritation but we know where to find him and he ought to lose his license the taximan turned hurriedly he wore a muffler so tightly packed be tween his neck and the collar of his uni form jacket that it appeared materially to impair his respiration his face pos sessed a bluish tinge suggestive of as phyxia and his watery eyes protruded remarkably his breathing was noisily audible no chuck it mister he exclaimed im only tellin you cause it aint my line to play tricks on the police youll find my name in the books downstairs moren any other driver in london i reckon ive brought enough umbrellas cameras walkin sticks hopera cloaks watches and sichlike in ere to set up a blarsted pawnbrokers thats all right my lad said dun bar holding up his hand to silence the voluble speaker theres going to be no license losing you did not hear that you were wanted before the watery eyes of the cabman pro truded painfully he respired like a horse me guvnor he exclaimed gor blime i aint the bloke i was drivin back from takin the honorable erbert arding omeâsame as i does almost every night when the ouse is asittin âwhen i see old tom brian drawin away from the

returning the book to his superior and adjusting the peculiar bowler firmly upon his head he set out dunbar glanced through some papers âapparently reportsâwhich lay upon the table penciled comments upon two of them and then consulting his note book once more in order to refresh his memory started off for forth street brixton forth street brixton is a depressing thoroughfare it contains small cheap flats and a number of frowzylooking houses which give one the impression of having run to seed a hostelry of sad aspect occupies a commanding position midway along the street but inspires the traveler not with cheer but with lugubrious reflections upon the horrors of inebriety the odors unpleasantly mingled of fried bacon and paraffin oil are wafted to the wayfarer from the porches of these family residences no proved to be such a villa and inspector dunbar contemplated it from a distance thoughtfully as he stood by the door of the public house gazing across the street a tiredlooking woman lean and anxiouseyed a poor driedup bean pod of a woman ap peared from the door of no car rying a basket she walked along in the direction of the neighboring high road and dunbar casually followed her for some ten minutes he studied her activities noting that she went from shop to shop until her basket was laden with provisions of all sorts when she entered a wineandspirit merchants the detective entered close behind her for the place was also a post office while he purchased a penny stamp and fumbled in his pocket for an imaginary letter he observed with interest that the woman had purchased and was loading into the hospitable basket a bot tle of whisky a bottle of rum and a bottle of gin he left the shop ahead of her sure now of his ground always provided that the woman proved to be mrs detective story magazine brian dunbar walked along forth street slowly enough to enable the woman to overtake him at the door of no he glanced up at the num ber questioningly and turned in the gate as she was about to enter he raised his hat have i the pleasure of addressing mrs brian momentarily a hard look came into the tired eyes but dunbars gentleness of manner and voice together with the kindly expression upon his face turned the scales favorably i am mrs brian she said yes did you want to see me on a matter of some importance may i come in she nodded and led the way into the house the door was not closed in a living room whereon was writ ten a pathetic historyâa history of decline from easy circumstances and re spectability to poverty and utter disre gard of appearancesâshe confronted him setting down her basket on a table from which the remains of a fish breakfast were not yet removed is your husband in inquired dun bar with a subtle change of manner hes lying down the hard look was creeping again into the womans eyes will you please awake him and tell him that i have called in regard to his license he thrust a card into her hand detective

and im glad they acquitted ida twonot of a kind by ladd plumley when jenifer melvin cobbs clerk discharged himself the time was twothirty when jenifers bloody shirt was removed and a doctor administered a heart stimulant the time was fourten in this hour and forty minutes if cobb learned nothing there is no hope that he will ever learn anything weve got em coming like crows to cornfields in may cobb merrily gloated big mail saturday but i cant let you off this afternoon the clerks face showed that he was not as enthusiastic as his employer concerning the mail he braved a mut tered remonstrance whats that snapped cobb what do i pay you for the clerk who had been about to leave the private office turned and pre sented to his employer an angry face ive decided mr cobb he said that ill be looking for another job it isnt altogether the long hours and no sat urday afternoons ill put it hard from the shoulderâi dont like the business suffering moses exclaimed cobb if you dont like your job you can dig out of course but you havent the right to spout anything against the business whats in your mind speak up chuck your grouch dont stand there with your mouth open like a calf choking on an apple chuck itâand if you want get out its easy to dig up clerks therere plenty of strap hangers waiting to drop into your seat these lots youre selling grumbled the clerk theres a fellow whos from the eastâlong islandâhes put me wise about that landâthe last is the worstâthe clearwater addition the fellow chucked it that there isnt any real land there all bogs he says youd have to scoop cellars with a spoon he says thatll do jerked in cobb do the advertisements state that theyre not swampy those lots are just as theyre represented theres no comeback the clearwater addition is inside of a circle that takes thirty miles around the center of the biggest city on the globe who says those lots arent the biggest bargain you can find between old new york and the pacific coast i do snapped back the clerk his jaw suddenly seeming to grow a square ness that before had not been notice able and it isnt only the clearwater additionâits everything i get out see nobody ever said i was a softy and i aint but selling acre boglands in scraps where there aint nothing but a country road miles and miles away and selling to women who think theyre let into a sixteencarat proposition i aint a softy but its got its hooks into me and heres where i get out detective story magazine the young man behind the mahogany desk flicked specks of imaginary dust from the sleeve of his perfectly dust less coat then he leaned back in his chair and while he tapped the fin gers of one hand on the polished wood before him he scowled as he critically examined the fingers of his other hand a hand which showed nails that evi dently had more care lavished upon them than had even been lavished on the rest of his person ill phone dunham and youll get your pay said cobb but of course its understood that everything that youve learned here as my clerk is strictly confidentialâstrictly confiden tial sure replied the other and with out hesitation nobody hands me a pay envelope for missionary stunts youll give me a letter too must have a letter it isnt easy to yank in an other job if you do regard the matters of this office as strictly confidential best kind of a letter promised cobb i said i would and i mean it i dont believe in slinging mud at the last boss that aint my way leave your house address and ill send the letter not for little willie boyânot in this office replied the clerk cobb tapped his fingers on the desk again you wont take any chances with me he said while his lip curled downward displaying teeth which had the same care as his hands seen too much to take chances re plied the other seen a great deal too much send in the stenographerâill dic tate a letter nowâsign it before five ill do more than the letter ill tell dunham to give you three weeks pay my affairs are strictly confidential savvy sure again replied the clerk its a go but i wouldnt have said any thing even if you hadnt offered me the extra with this concession for what his code of business ethics would have pre vented him from doing anyhow the clerk opened the door and passed out leaving his employer to his pile of cor respondence like salts in hot water that sort of tootsie baby slush exclaimed cobb as he began to sort out his letters never told any one this was a bread line or a salvation army shop if youve got a hunch for the good old stuff and have the brains to pull it youd be a fool if you didnt pull it and i pay good money to my adver tising men for saying everything they can say thats good about my deals then my bait is gone over by the slick est legal talent i can get its up to the fishes to find out whats queer cobb had just dictated the letter he had promised the clerk when a visitor was admitted into the private office al though his instructions were to admit no visitors she for due to the peculiarities of his trade cobb dealt mostly with those feminine was one of the women who have schoolteacher so plainly written on their faces and persons that it is as if their occupation were carried before them inscribed on a banner past middle age she was as easy a prey for her hopes for an invest ment of cent per cent on her meager savings as a starving rat is a prey for a poisoned piece of meat she timor ously enteredâthe office and man were bluffingly imposingâand took an un easy seat beside the shining mahogany desk she hardly dared raise her eyes to the frowning face at her side it was really awfully hard work to get in here she said falteringly seemed as if theyd never never let me but the men outside wouldnt talk about my lotâand im sorry to trouble you mr cobbâbut its soâso very important twoânot of a kind cobb had picked up a letter from the heap and seemed to be studying it at tentively he had learned that visitors could be put where he wanted to put them by pushing in hard the idea that their affairs were of no importance he rattled the sheet and scowled over the top of it before again blanketing his face come to the point he snapped i was led to believe by one of your agents whats that flared in cobb i was led to believe that in a years time or five or ten put in cobb sharply anyhow the woman continued the agent and the circular told how the great american property owners had begun by buying land i took my savings from the bankâyears of sav ingsâand bought a lot the clear water extensionâits on the map over there andânowâwellâwe need the moneyâwe need it terribly ive got to get money somewhere now clicked in cobbs brisk voice as he lowered the letter before blanketing his face once more hit the pike whats all this anyway my motherâi support her per sisted the schoolteacher while she nervously twisted into a knot the gloves in her lap and untwisted them again my mother she has the most fright ful dread of public hospitals she says she will never go to oneânever she says that will you please cut it short came again the sharp and intimidating voice as the letter was crisply rattled and lowered to the desk where cobb jotted on the margin a penciled memorandum what was it you were saying he asked oh yes the clearwater addi tion my advice is to hold on to that lot dont let it get away from youâ dont i say let it get away but ive got to have money for my mothers operation the doctors say it is the one chance to save her life and they say that in her weak con dition and feeling as she does about hospitals it might kill her to make her go to one theres nobody i can borrow from andâwellâi thought that under the circumstances you would take the lot backâsay with four per cent interest on the price thats what the savings bank paid me cobb made a vicious jab at his mem orandum then he glanced at the woman the glance was what you might expect from a hawk that had just indulged in a bit of the flesh of a sparrow which had fallen into its claws so thats what you want he said we sell real estateâour concern never buys itânot subdivided but my mother implored the schoolteacher subduing with difficulty the tears notwithstanding the training of many years in a soulracking occu pation it was as if cobb had suddenly be come deaf he smiled at his pencil showing the teeth which although so white suggested the teeth of a steel trap i had agents try to sell said the woman getting control of her voice and again continuing they couldnt and i must have money couldnt you manage to give me half of what i paid if the lot is so valuable you would lose nothing by taking it back for half see here gritted out cobb jerk ing himself to his feet so suddenly that the woman was startled into greater timidity im busy given you fif teen minutes of valuable time we wont buy back your lotâthats final pardon me for not showing you to the doorâits saturday and ive got a big deal keep the lotâhang on to itâ dont let it get away he picked up his memorandum and glared at it oh detective story magazine âgood afternoon remember my ad viceâdont for any excuse sell that lot with a final and incoherent plea the schoolteacher made a faltering exit and somebody closed the door which led into the private office as cobb turned to his letters he blurted out an grily hang it all why cant i get clerks who will do a real chuckout push ins take more time than the snaring of ten suckers somewhere i must dig up a castiron toe swinger cobbs was a sudden success he was yet a young man not married nor indeed likely to marry for him mar riage offered nothing in exchange for the pretended devotion to a plurality of women except the expected devotion to only one he had a notabsorbing in terest in fancy womankind of the bur lesque variety beyond that he believed a man was a fool to go like most american business men cobb could look back to a time and that quite recently when he knew what it was to think several times before he spent a half dollar he had lifted him self into his smeary niche by his sole efforts aside from a taste in lavishness in apparel and such other tastes as go with a liking of the fancy variety of women a rough sketch of the fellow has been daubed it should be added however that the inspiration for this brief sketch was supremely selfish let us call cobb a kind of human jackal for years he had prowled successfully in scenting out carcasses too unsavory for other jackals and he never hesi tated to make a full meal when he could find it only carcasses is hardly the correct word he had been preying on living things but like the carcasses in the respect that they were unable to fight away the prowler and like the carcasses in that the eating was too rank for many who would have said of themselves that they were not squeamish concerning their food at threethirty behind his mahogany desk cobb got a surprise a big sur prise and one which almost any man jackal or not would find most unpleas ant most of us who are blessed enough to have fathers would be glad to have them turn up even if not ex pected not so cobb we cannot blame him for the successfulâex cuse the wordâbogland seller felt that he was deeply disgraced by his parental forbear he should not have felt that way certainly the jackal should not feel disgraced if a maneating tiger happened to be his parent if that thing were possible hardjaw cobb as his pals called him was a kind of man eating tiger incidentally the man tiger had quite recently served out a sentence in the place where all jackals ought to find themselves and this father whom the son had not even written to in some ten years and whom the son would have walked around the blocks of a whole city so as not to meet face to face had actually sent into the private office a slip of paper with his name written upon it and was said by the boy who brought in the slip to be waiting outside for an interview jenifer hated his father but he hated him not because of any record of fin ger prints which police headquarters might hold but because he feared him it was nothing to jenifer that for the years of his boyhood the father had braved all the dangers of his dread profession to obtain the means to sup port his boy in comfort just as it was nothing to jenifer that the father had provided for his sons education leav ing the boy with a woman said to be a cousin and seeing him on rare occa sions only from the moment that jenifer knew of the maneatings he continued it is true to accept support and education but from that moment the fear had seized him that the elder twoânot of a kind cobb would some time make public his relationship to his son he never had indeed for seven years the time of his last sentence he had not even writ ten to the younger cobb the last thing that the son expected and the greatest evil which he had dreaded was a visit from his father hes a customer said jenifer eying suspiciously the boy who had brought in the message happens to have my name suppose ill have to see him show him in when face to face the difference be tween father and son would have made an absorbing study for a student of heredity of course the clothing was vastly different proving tastes which were as opposed as possible the elder cobbs overshort coat and too tight trousers of some solid gray material were glean and neat as was his stout flannel shirt but this might have been the holiday attire of a longshoreman or ironworker and the blunt bull dog chin and square cheeks with low cheek bones had bequeathed to the son only a hint of their shape ironness and brutism the visitor did not take the seat which the son offered suppose we come right down to brass tacks said jenifer i didnt think youd honor me with a visit came right west did you fromâ yesânew york youre on growled cobb senior there were some moments of silence while the keen eyes of the visi tor seemed to take in everything from his sons immaculate tweed clothing and the heavy gold band around the fore finger of one white hand to the ma hogany of the rooms furnishings at length jenifer ventured maybe the time has come when you expect me to pay back a part of cut that handout stuff grunted the other pay back nothing im here on biz cold biz the son had lifted himself to his feet behind the broad desk he rested the white hands on the polished surface i dont get your meaning really as you must know there can be no busi ness between us if it is a matter of money which you feel you ought to haveâto reimburse you the other raised a muscular red hand his face was filled with such anger that jenifers words ended ab ruptly its a story grunted cobb senior sternly get me a story its gods truth back in the marshes of long islandâyou know emâyou were there as a boy nobody knows em better back there in the tangle is a lot you git wet to your knees wading to the stakes ive been there the nearest road is miles and miles away it isnt good for nothing its good just to raise taxes it aint good for raising nothing but taxesâchickweed wouldnt grow on it if you chucked in a ten ner with it you couldnt unload it on a local land man thats the shape of the deal youve been setting your smut fly paper to catch your flies with thats the deal as has pushed you that and that and that and all these the blunt red forefinger had pointed in turn to the tweed coat the spangled necktie and the trousers of the man behind the desk before the finger swept a circle which was intended to include the whole periphery of the sons life say broke in cobb junior doesnt it make you feel a little funny to come here and go on the way youve been spoutingâwhen the other savagely interrupted his growl you mean when ive just served out a term in the penâthats what you mean huh how did i git the last you know chanced it at a safe with the dynamite and a barker in my clothes if five bulls hadnt cornered me id have made a a ds detective story magazine clean getaway but got it through both shoulders in a prison hospital for three month thats a mans game âa mans game get me yours huh like lifting the neargold brace let of a girl baby whats been left in your lap by its mother but i aint here to chuck that little piece that aint what brought me im here on biz if it isnt money what is it asked the son he added and suppose we lock that door over there somebody might come in we might be inter rupted the others face wrinkled into a smile that was so like a threat of the most sinister kind that the son involuntarily drew himself back what do you think youre up against he asked pulling the key of the door from his pocket and slipping it back again when you was waiting for me to close the door i locked it didnt take a chance i didnt as to why im here its the flimsy but not the sort you think as i chucked it its a storyâa story of a pal and his skirt only she aint exactly a skirtâshes straightâ shes on the level ill cut it short here i gits out first and the pal sends me with a love message to the girl shes been slaving and slaving and slavingâin a box factory eight yearâfrom the time she was seventeen good wagesâbecause shes one of em they speeds up and then speeds up again so as to rush the others big wagesâfor a girl shes been skimping herselfâskimpingâskimping when he gits out shes going to have a nice little flat all furnished by her lone some thats one bug the other bug is that shell keep him straight theres her savings and the pretty flat oh shes dafty all right then in a paper she sees one of your eyegrab bing lies she takes her little pileâall her skimpings and she buys the lot what i seen and where you couldnt find bottom with a power oil drill thats the storyâthat is isnt it nice how does it feel when you sees one of your flies all stuck up and trying to make a getaway from your smut fly paper how does it feel i ask how now now soothed the son hold ing up his hand as if to ward off the contempt and even fury that had been condensed into the questions maybe in a way you and i might be said to be in the same boatâbut my deal is legal âyour push in your jaw bolts blurted the father as youre the skunk you couldnt be expected to see the diff there is a diff a diff as big as between a cellmate and the head wardenâbigger âas wide as twenty oceans and ive got it under my skin that i lifted good money to feed and give schooling to a skunk say i had hopesâhopes but chuck that part what im here for is to make you take out your check book from that swell desk and write a check for the straight skirt the ad vertisement ive seen itâthe girls got it it says that there might be a onetoten shotâthats itâa onetoten shot says it so slick that youve got three ways and the roof besides for a clean getawayâbut it says it un derstand it says it youll take a pen in that nice white hand and write a check that way itll be a bookmakers swinginâten for one heres her name and what she paid into your smut shell game he pulled out a bit of paper from his pocket and stepping to the desk laid it before the son not on your life said jenifer sur prised by the suggestion he chanced the sneer a holdup by your dear paternal relative dont go in this shop not on your necktie pin the ironhard face of the other hard ened even more with a growl that was amazingly like the tiger he has been compared to he leaped forward twoânot of a kind he seized the younger man by the throat just above the collar and with experienced fingers pushed in the windpipe so that only a low gurgle told what the blackening face and starting eyeballs indicated forcing the younger man to the floor cobb pulled out a great blue cotton handkerchief from his pocket with the right hand while the other continued to grip savagely the already congested throat the hand kerchief was wound tightly above the sons mouth and securely knotted be hind his head then cobb pulled his man to the chair behind the desk and pushed him into it your check book he grunted pull out your check book dont thrash around or ill break your bones like rotten sticks the son hesitated some of the nerve of the elder must have been passed down into his blood but the savagery of the face near his own would have subdued most men he pulled out a drawer and lifted his check book before him a check to the skirt for ten times her gate money into the shell gameâthe even hundred above snarled cobb the check was scrawled and cobb senior took it in his red hands three times he read it aloud as if gloating over it and then placed it in his pocket theres no danger youll chance a trick he said if you do ill make a comeback so you wont stop pay ment but i aint through once be fore i caught you playing a skunkâyou werent more than six i took it out of your hide just as you got it then youll git your medicine now see they may hear it outside but the walls and doors are thick cobb senior slipped to the coat rack which held in its ring a sheaf of um brellas and canes he strode back with jenifers heavy walking stick in his hand before the other could have expected the attack cobb seized him by the col lar with a grip so powerful that the collar was torn from the front button and left the ends projecting upward around the knotted handkerchief with the strength of an athlete of fiftyfive and muscles of seven years hardening at severe prison toil he began wielding the heavy stick blow after blow until as he continued the tweed coat from the shoulders to the hips of the shiver ing man raised itself into ridges sug gesting that the cloth was thus corru gated by the flesh below with the fury of the blows the cane was gradually broken into slivers the pieces scattering themselves about the floor below the men the red face of the castigator turned to purple and as it did the face of the other grew distorted and livid mingled perspira tion and tears rolling over the shrunken cheeks with a growl that was more beast like than the growls which had been vented while the blows were falling the safe cracker threw the form of his son into the chair where it humped itself inertly the head dropping forward be tween the gripped and quivering hands im going now said cobb be fore heaven i give it that ill never glimpse you again swing your cats paws outside any chuckout you want say a bughouse did you up thatll go you wont give yourself away as the son of a crook that wouldnt stand for your skunk doingsâthats sure and take it from a feller who was pushed the handout of being your dad a professional cracksman has got more guts than to lift leathers from a box factory skirt and a clean getaway handy he stepped to the door and un locked it the boss in there has got to have a doctor he said to the girl stenog rapher as he passed through the outer office and into the corridor black stars subterfuge by john mack stone johnston mcculley chapter i sudden illness smirks sarcastic grins ingratiat ing smilesâthese things had roger verbeck endured through out the afternoon until it seemed to him that his countenance burned con tinually because of humiliation until his face had set with sternness and he greeted friends and mere acquaintances alike with a cold and distant nod the black star had done thisâthat master criminal who had held the city at his mercy for six months or more who committed crimes notable for their originality and daring it was five days now since the black stars robbery of the diamond vault of jones amp co a robbery in which he had made roger verbeck his man muggs and detective riley objects of ridicule in those five days the black star had made no open move and the three men who had sworn to capture him waited for the next blow hoping that when it fell they would at least find some minor clew to follow some halfhidden trail that would lead them to the quarry verbeck had spent the afternoon in the business section purchasing sup plies for he had decided to live in the old verbeck house with muggs and detective riley while his campaign against the black star was being waged even those who admired him because of his determination to match wits with the master criminal smiled knowingly when he passed they had read the black stars letters to the newspapers in which he had told how he had hid den in verbecks own house while the police looked for him throughout the city and now at seven oclock in the eve ning roger verbeck sat at a table in a corner of a fashionable restaurant his back to the room and tried to enjoy his dinner detective riley had gone to police headquarters for a visit muggs was purchasing more supplies and was to get his own dinner and meet verbeck with the roadster an hour later enjoyment of the meal seemed an impossibility verbeck knew those in the restaurant who recognized him were grinning behind his back he knew the public was watching the duel between himself and the black star ready to ridicule verbeck if he lost and as eager to applaud him if he won and sent the master rogue to prison the police worked in vain to corral the master crook and his band long ago the public had begun to regard the police department as worthless in this particular affair moreover the feud between roger verbeck the young mil lionaire and the black star acknowl edged clever criminal was more spec tacular and so verbeck found him self in a corner to save himself from humiliation he must continue his cam black stars subterfuge paign with the help of only muggs and detective riley until the black star passed through prison doors to begin a long sentence the smirks and grins that verbeck had faced this day served only to double his determination to conquer the black star it was a game of wits and strat egy for the black star abhorred vi olence none knew better than roger verbeck that he had been outgeneraled in the last affair but failure had in creased his caution and cunning in their next clash he felt sure the black star would find that the mettle of his foe was better now verbeck sipped his demitasse and in a panel mirror before him ob served the approach of the waiter with a finger bowl he glanced at his watch âwithin fifteen minutes muggs would be before the restaurant with the roadster they would pick up riley at headquarters and hurry to the old ver beck house to begin their vigil for they slept in the daytime for the greater part and remained alert at night ready to answer an alarm if the black star committed another crime eager to get on the scene as soon as possible and try to pick up the trail it was known that the black star had reorganized his band and established a new headquarters since roger verbeck and muggs had almost destroyed his establishment and from this new headquarters roger verbeck doubted not the master crook would conduct a campaign of crime that would terrorize the city if the new headquarters could be located pardon me sir are you ill even as the waiter spoke verbeck realized that his thoughts were becom ing confused his hands were trembling and beads of perspiration were stand ing on his forehead his stomach re volted he reached for the glass of water near him and it was necessary for the waiter to guide it to his lips i guessâi he stammered try to stand sir there is a small retiring room directly to your right if you wish to go there sir the waiter aided him to stand even as he spoke he guided verbecks fal tering steps toward the little retiring room half a dozen diners had noted the occurrence the head waiter hur ried across the room mr verbeck had been taken ill sud denly the waiter said in a low voice almost instantly the manager was among them why it is mr verbeck he gasped suddenly ill you say george get a physician immediately verbeck was sitting on the divan in the corner of the room scarcely able to keep from toppling over he felt him self growing weaker his eyes closed and he was unable to open them again his head fell back the manager bent forward and stretched him on the couch two men appeared in the doorway and the manager and head waiter whirled to face them pardon me the first said but i noticed what happened and thought i might be of some service i am a phy sicianâhere is my card look at this man then the man ager directed he became suddenly ill while eating the professionallooking man al ready was bending over roger ver beck his companion stood to one side why it is mr roger verbeck the physician exclaimed i know him well but did not recognize him in the restaurantâhis back was toward us anything serious asked the wor ried manager he is subject to these attacksâa pe culiar stomach trouble the physician explained i have treated him many times undoubtedly he ate something a bit too rich noâit is not serious detective story magazine but we must get him home have one of your men call a taxicab and let it go into the alley we can get him through the hallway and kitchen and into the cab i presume you do not wish to have the other diners disturbed the manager of the restaurant did notâthat was what was worrying him he sent a waiter to call the cab he watched while the physician mixed a drop of medicine in water and poured the mixture down verbecks throat the manager did not think it peculiar in that moment of excitement that the physician carried a vial of medicine in his waistcoat pocket well take care of him sir the doctor went on this is a friend of mine who was dining with me do not be alarmedâi assure you mr verbeck will be himself again within an hour it really is an advertisement for your place rather than otherwiseâit shows your food is rich the physician chuckled and smiled quite like a professional man taking charge of a situation and trying to put every one at ease the manager felt grateful he walked ahead as the phy sician and his friend carried roger ver beck through the narrow rear hallway and through the kitchen to the back door he watched as they put him in the cab drive to mr verbecks residence as quickly as possible he heard the phy sician order the chauffeur you know where it isâthe old verbeck mansion good well satisfied the manager went back to the dining room glad that it had not been any fault of his food that had made roger verbeck ill glad also that few of the regular diners had noticed the incident the cab started through the alley turned into the first street and hurried toward a boulevard close by easy the physician said to his companion chuckling as he looked at the unconscious verbeck the cab sped along the boulevard the verbeck mansion was to the north the taxi dashed south chapter ii unexpected sleep muggs would not have recognized a pterodactyl had he met one face to face in the street also he was woe fully deficient in theories regarding the fourth dimension he had however taken a postgraduate course in the university of hard knocks where he had specialized in human nature and hence he knew many things his better educated brethren did not muggs knew for instanre that there are smiles and smiles that they may be read as easily as print and that if read correctly they tell a mans intentionsâ or a womansâas openly as spoken words so now when the stranger smiled at him again muggs analyzed the smile quickly and efficiently and noted the one important thingâthat the stranger smiled with his lips but not with his eyes the eyes were small and gray and appeared to glitter venomously either the glitter of those eyes or the smile on the lips expressed a false hood and muggs decided it was the smile that lied muggs was aware also that the stranger had been regarding him in tently for ten minutes at least he had felt the others eyes upon him there had been a time in muggs career when he had been sensitive enough to feel immdiately the near presence of a hostile force an accomplishment that often had saved him from prison though now he walked the straight and narrow path as valet chauffeur and comrade in arms to roger verbeck he retained a great deal of his old sensi tiveness black stars subterfuge verbeck had told him to eat before rejoining him and so muggs had en tered this little restaurant on a side street and ordered a modest meal he had no more than seated himself when he became aware that he was under surveillance being a man of broad experience and at present engaged with verbeck and detective riley in matching wits with a clever crook and his followers muggs used caution he did not turn his head quickly to ascertain the identity of the person whose eyes he felt he sipped his coffee and conveyed a generous bite of pie to his mouth sat back and wiped his lips and without seeming to look up he searched with his eyes a panel mirror directly before him in which was reflected the interior of the little restaurant it was almost the same minute that roger verbeck in the more fashion able restaurant looked in a mirror and observed the approach of his waiter with the finger bowl muggs spotted his man he of the glittering eyes sat at a table near the door and pretended to be eating berries and cake he was regarding the back of muggs head intentlyâand smiling the lying smile theres one hombre ive never seen before to the best of my knowledge and belief muggs told himself yet he seems to be mighty interested in me a man would think he was layin to hand me a jolt the way he acts its up to me to hand out the jolt first muggs picked up his check and reached for his hat as he turned to walk the length of the restaurant he saw that the other man had risen also and was hurrying toward the cashiers cage realizing that the stranger was eager to get outside either to accost or trail him muggs did some smiling of his own now and a wise man could have read many things in that smile the most important being to hurry from the vicinity of mr muggs as speedily as possible muggs paid his check and fumbled over the toothpicks giving the other man ample time to establish himself outside to his satisfaction then he threw back his shoulders shot out his lower jaw belligerently and headed for the door the stranger with the glittering eyes was standing at the curb a short distance away just at the rear of a taxi cab and looking up and down the street as if awaiting an automobile muggs walked straight toward him pardon me but are you an artist muggs demanded in a peculiar tone i am not why do you ask sir they faced each other squarely the stranger was well aware now that muggs knew of the recent espionage and was about to demand an explana tion and muggs knew he was aware of it you aint lookin for a model of a perfect male human head muggs asked now i am not sir i thought maybe you was stranger the way you bored them eyes of yours into my head back there in the restau rant i not only suspicioned you was lookin for a model but that youd found your man iâi beg your pardon the other simulated astonishment yeh do i infer from that stranger that you aint found your man if for any particular reason you was lookin for me im here with my pedigree my names muggs ive got one peculiarity and that is that when i find a stranger regardin me too close i always want to plant a fist tween his eyes aint that funny really i and just now muggs went on im engaged in a simple endeavor on the side as my boss would say that makes me nervous when a man gets detective story magazine pesty around me im that nervous right now i could choke a man iâerâi fail to see the other stammered and he started to walk slowly along the curb muggs following it aint polite to stare at the back of a mans head and grin sickly like at the same time muggs continued there wasnt anybody near me in there and so you was lookin at me i want to know why now suppose you give me your pedigree so well know just where we stand they were opposite the taxicab now and the chauffeur sprang from his seat and opened the door as if in anticipation of a fare it appeared to muggs that the other man would be only too glad to jump into that taxi and hurry away without explaining and muggs did not wish that while the war against the black star and his band was in prog ress explanations of any peculiar cir cumstance were necessary so now muggs stepped before the open door of the cab himself blocking the way and faced the man who had smiled im waitin for an answer muggs declared the stranger bent forward in the gathering dusk and raised a forefinger as if to begin a protest of this conduct on muggs part the chauffeur stood with his hand on the door waiting it seems to me the stranger began and in that second muggs realized that he had walked right into a trap the chauffeur grasped him by the throat and kicked his feet from beneath him the stranger he faced lunged forward suddenly and threw muggs off his balance muggs was hurled to the interior of the cab neatly and only one person on the street had witnessed the occurrence like a flash muggs had his feet un der him again and was crouched against the seat ready to spring through the door and throttle the first of his foes he met it flashed through his mind that he should blame himself much for being caught off guard and then be fore he scarcely realized what was hap pening before he could make a move the man who had watched him in the restaurant had entered the cab and closed the door and the vehicle was moving away from the curb easy easy my man the stranger warned the cab passed beneath the arc light at the corner just then and muggs saw steel glitter in the others hand it was not the nature of muggs however to allow himself to be captured in this manner without making some effort to disconcert his captors moreover he guessed this man and the chauffeur might belong to the black stars band this might be part of a prearranged plan to injure roger verbeck in some way and all that was necessary to arouse muggs ire and fighting blood was to threaten disaster to verbeck the man he adored who had saved him from the waters of the seine five years before and made him a man it took muggs less than half a sec ond to get his breath and decide that the proper thing to do would be to spring upon the other man and make an effort to overcome him taking the chance of receiving a bullet in his vitals muggs sprang like a lion and silently in midair he met something new the other had raised what muggs had supposed was an automatic pistol fitted with a silencer now he pulled the trigger no hot lead seared muggs no bullet tore its way through his body but from the muzzle of the weapon flashed a cloud of pungent vapor and muggs gasping his surprise drew the vapor deep into his lungs the stranger caught muggs in his arms and lowered him gently to the black stars subterfuge floor of the taxi it seemed to muggs that he realized fully what was going on but was unable to do anything about it he noticed the other man take a handkerchief from his pocket and hold it to his nostrils and above the handkerchief the eyes glittered venomously as before muggs saw all this as they passed under another arc light and then dreamless sleep descended upon him chapter iii the new headquarters muggs regained his cunning the in stant he regained consciousness he realized he was stretched on a couch and that his hands and feet were bound he made no effort to struggle and he did not even open his eyes for fully a minute he lay motionless almost without breathing his ears strained to catch every sound once coming from a distance he heard the clanging bell of a trolley car the rattling of vehicles on a busy paved street the moaning of the wind that had been blowing a gale at the time of his abduction the lowpitched voices of men in the room discussing his caseâ the things he expected to hearâwere not discernible still he did not open his eyes hoping that if anybody was in the room they would speak sooner or later and give him some clew to his predicament he was breathing deeply and regularly now his brain had cleared and he knew the effect of the vapor he had inhaled had worn away and then why play possum mr muggs you have been conscious and your brain has been active for the better part of five minutes and i know it the voice was low deep strikingâ the words coming in a peculiar staccato muggs remembered that the black star possessed a voice like that he opened his eyes that is better why pretend opening his eyes was all muggs did save gasp for he did not have to move his body to observe the scene it was spread before him he was on a couch in a corner of a large room the apartment was lav ishingly furnished mahogany table and chairs tapestries art rugs were there to delight the eye at one end of the table stood a tall figure enveloped in a flowing black robe with a hood that covered the head the face was hidden by a black mask through which two eyes glittered on the front of the hood in flaming jet was a big star the black star muggs gasped scarcely knowing why he spoke at all since it seemed so useless you have guessed correctly muggs the black star said chuckling once again you see the black star in his headquarters his workshop be fore you visited me like a thief in the night accompanied by roger verbeck the man you style your boss this time i have had you brought here the black star folded his arms and looked at the man on the couch as if speculating what to do with him muggs remained silent waiting his brain busy with a thousand thoughts he knew now that it was a member of the black stars band who had watched him in the restaurant and that the chauffeur had been another and why had he been abducted and carried to the master criminals headquarters did the black star think he could hold muggs as hostage and force roger ver beck to cease his campaign to put the master rogue behind the bars really mr muggs i had hoped for something better from you the black star was saying when i gave orders for you to be abducted and carried here i laughed to myselfâi believed the men detective story magazine who received those orders would have their hands full it appears however that the task was as easy as picking up a child yeh muggs snarled i knew you see that you would be in the business district today since roger verbeck was purchasing supplies âstocking up the old verbeck house well to be comfortable with you and detective riley while conducting his campaign to capture me and you can bet hell get you yet muggs loyally exclaimed do you really think so muggs however i have you now well whats it to beâgoin to shoot me or what my dear muggs i abhor violence i am not a thug wit strategy the game of brainsâthose are the things my purpose in bringing you here was not ulterior talk united states and get it off your chest quick muggs said such language i cannot for the life of me understand why a refined gentleman like roger verbeck endures your companionship by having you carried here i believed i was doing mr verbeck a favor yeh he matched his wit against mine and almost destroyed my organization once i escaped the silly police how ever and formed my organization anew also obtained a new headquarters has it not been the desire of yourself mr verbeck and detective rileyâthe trio sworn to capture meâto discover the whereabouts of this new headquar ters wellâhere it is muggs i can see the headquarters all right and please observe the heavy cur tain on that side of the room it cov ers an open doorway muggs i am going to lift that curtain now and give you a shock yes muggs i feel sure it will be quite a shock the black star walked slowly across the room to the curtain turned and looked at muggs again then swiftly threw the curtain back with an ex clamation muggs struggled to get to his feet in the doorway sitting bound in a chair his hands fastened before him âwas roger verbeck a handkerchief gagged him youâyou got the boss muggs cried you oh yes it proved as easy to cap ture roger verbeck as it did to get you muggs so do not feel too much grieved that you were taken by my men i merely wanted to make sure of the capture of one of you to show you the new headquarters but my men were so successful they caught two of you match wits with the black star and his band you poor fools youâyou muggs sputtered in sudden wrath at seeing his beloved master in such an extremity rage gathered within him and he twisted at wrists and ankles in a futile effort to get free the black star stepped for ward and pushed against muggs breast and muggs was toppled over on the couch take it easy muggs the black star advised i have no intention of harming mr verbeck nor yourself i merely intend keeping both of you here for a short time letting you witness anything that may transpire and then youll be allowed to go understand muggs growled and looked at the floor verbeck felt suddenly elated it would be like the black star to take such a chance he could crow about it afterwardâwrite letters to the papers and say he had abducted roger ver beck and muggs and revealed the new headquarters to them yet could not be located and captured and it was pos sible verbeck thought that he might observe or hear something that would give him a clew to the location of the place he doubted not that when he black stars subterfuge and muggs were sent away again they would go unconscious as they had come this headquarters is a great im provement over the old one the black star said i really ought to thank you mr verbeck for driving me out of the other allow me mr verbeck to remove the gag he went forward and removed it and unlashed verbeck from the chair then he helped him hop across the room and caused him to sit down beside muggs that is much better he said i may mention that it will do you no good to shriek or screech or howl for assistance the place we are in ah a bell had tinkled muggs strug gled and managed to sit up on the couch beside verbeck both of them remembered about that other head quarters there bells had tinkled and members of the black stars band of criminals had entered to make reports or receive orders gowns and masksâ and conversations carried out on black boards yesâthere were the black boards a friend is coming gentlemen the black star said i request that you remain on the couch and keep silent you cannot tell what may happen if you try to leave the couch the black star chuckled and disap peared through a small door again a bell tinkled another door on the op posite side of the room opened and there entered another man clad in black robe and mask save that no star of jet flamed on the hood of the robe he started forward in surprise when he observed muggs seated upon the couch beside verbeck but checked himself and did not speak neither did verbeck speak for he was busy spec ulating as to the newcomers height and weight watching every movement he made trying to fasten upon something that would enable him to recognize the man if they met again elsewhere muggs however refused to remain silent good evening he said the boss is out just now anything i can do for you got a few diamonds or any thing like that youve pinched today the smaller door opened and the black star entered the room he went immediately to one of the little black boards on the wall picked up a piece of chalk and wrote quickly muggs silence as i instructed orâ then he turned and exhibited to muggs a weapon verbeck supposed it to be an ordinary revolver but muggs who had passed through an experience that evening guessed that it held no bul lets but the pungent vapor that had caused his downfall in the taxicab muggs became silent he did not wish to be put to sleep while roger verbeck was there and might soon need help the black star motioned his man to the second blackboard no the man wrote countersign the black star de manded on his board georgia report the other turned his back and wrote rapidly and at length muggs and ver beck bent forward on the couch and peered across the room was it pos sible verbeck wondered that the black star was going to allow them to read the blackboard conversation and then let them go back to the verbeck house with whatever information they had ac quired the message was done the man stepped back verbeck and muggs read what he had written as the black star read it our man goes on duty tonight burglar alarms have been fixed at two in the morning policeman on beat always stops in restaurant for coffee as detective story magazine was reported before should he not disturbance will be raised at end of block to decoy him away at proper time the black star motioned for him to erase then wrote himself what about the gold gold received today at noon moved in quickly and secretly hun dred thousand in usual sacks intend keeping it here about week then ship ping it on part at time when verbeck read that he had dif ficulty in adhering to his determination to betray no astonishment was it possible the master criminal and his band contemplated the theft of a hun dred thousand dollars in gold coin and they were discussing it here be fore him and muggs as if they had been discussing the state of the weather arrangements for moving per fected the black star wrote now everything in readinecs cannot fail the other answered with the chalk two closed autos six of us to handle coin garbage wagon will block one end of alley we will guard other end verbeck was getting the details swiftly now and an exchange of glances with muggs showed that the latter also was letting every word writ ten on the blackboard beat into his brain and making a special effort to remember they were going to move a fortune in gold in two closed autos one end of the alley would be blocked and the other guarded of all the nerve good the black star was writing now let it be tonight at the time agreed why verbeck even knew the time two oclock in the morning when the policeman on the beat would either be drinking coffee in a restaurant else at tracted by a fake fight all verbeck had to do now if al lowed to go or if he escaped in time was to get word to detective riley and to police headquarters have the chief ascertain what bank or trust company had a hundred thousand in gold re ceived that day place police around the building frustrate the black stars plan and possibly capture the master crook or some of his band moreover there was a chance but the black star was writing again observe men on couch one near est you is verbeckâother his man muggs keep your eyes peeled for them in public o k the other wrote the black star nodded and waved his hand in a gesture of dismissal the other bowed and backed through the door a minute of silence then the tinkling of the bell ah he has gone the black star spoke you see mr verbeck i have the same arrangement as before i never see the faces of these men of mine and they never get a glance at me we do not hear each others voices i gather information plan the work di vide profits they are faithful men who work together at my bidding but they could not testify against me nor i against them in case of capture you see yeh muggs cried how about the eight we caught before they saw your face all right my dear muggs they were bailed out were they not and they have left the country supplied with ample funds you may be sure the men working with me now are those who were not caught and did not see my faceâand some new ones my partner procured you mean to stand there and tell us verbeck said that you are going to steal a hundred thousand in gold coin tonight at precisely two oclock in the morning mr verbeck the black stars subterfuge you cant get away with it muggs exclaimed no did i not get away with a choice collection of diamonds from the vault of jones amp co while you and verbeck and detective riley looked on yeh well youll go too far one of these days well get you and well get you good and when we doâgood night youll get more than life meaning death muggs when the time comes my man ill know how to die even if i have to descend to sui cide the black star turned and paced the length of the room verbeck leaned back against the cushions on the couch and wondered what the black star intended doing next he was willing to let muggs do the talking while he strained his ears for some sound and his eyes for some sight that would reveal to him the location of the building in which they found them selves he knew the black star never would let him and muggs leave the place while conscious not having knowledge of the vapor gun verbeck found himself wondering just how his unconsciousness was to be brought about regarding his own capture he guessed simply that one of the black stars gang was employed in the restaurant undoubtedly some opiate had been in his coffee it might have been placed there by a kitchen em ploye or by the waiter he imagined the restâthat members of the black stars band had pretended to help him home and had taken him to the master crooks headquarters instead well muggs exclaimed i sup pose youre goin to keep us tied up here like a couple of bundles of rags until you pull off this stunt tonight eh thatll be nice my dear muggs i merely wanted you and mr verbeck to see my new headquarters presently i am going to have you taken from here and dropped on some corner near the verbeck house i amâreally i got a picture of you doin that after us seein all this only of course my dear muggs i could not allow you to get a full view of your surroundings you gentlemen have seen the inside of this room and that is allâand this room might be in the basement of a factory or the top floor of a hotel for all you know and when you leave it must be as you ar rivedâunconscious understand neither verbeck nor muggs replied to that it was what verbeck had ex pected they would see the interior of this room but not the exterior of the building they would regain con sciousness again near home and how could they find the spot again why this room might be in any one of ten thousand buildings in the city the bell tinkled again a short wait and a gowned and masked man entered no he wrote on the black board countersign jackson good you are on time the black star wrote you will take these men and drop them within a block or two of the verbeck place they must leave this room as they entered itâun conscious o k the other wrote he turned from the blackboard the black star his eyes glittering malevolently through his mask took a step forward muggs struggled to his feet before verbeck could make a move you squirt that stuff at me again he threatened the black star chuckled as if greatly amused the other mans hand came into view and it held the vapor gun he stepped swiftly toward the detective story magazine crouching defiant muggs as verbeck struggled to stand you dare squirt that muggs started to threaten again slowly the weapon in the hand of the gowned and masked man was raisedâ up and up until the muzzle covered muggs heart then suddenly the man who menaced muggs whirled and faced the black star and the weapon he held was turned against the master crook hands upâyou he cried and tore the mask from his face verbeck and muggs gave cries of relief and joy here was no member of the black stars organization detective riley stood before them chapter iv what riley did his visit to police headquarters that afternoon had proved highly un pleasant for detective riley it was his first appearance there since the chief had assigned him to live with roger verbeck and aid him in getting a clew to the black stars whereabouts since he had joined forces with ver beck riley had come in for sarcastic sentences in the black stars letters to the newspapers and his comrades at headquarters were not slow to torment him when he appeared that afternoon riley had intended remaining at headquarters until verbeck picked him up in the roadster about eight oclock his tormentors drove him away at five he walked slowly up the avenue got something to eat at his favorite chop house and then continued his prom enade he knew where verbeck would dine and intended to be in front of the cafe waiting beside the roadster with muggs when verbeck emerged acquaintances stopped him fre quently to discuss the black star and his latest exploit it was almost seven oclock when riley swung into a side street to hurry toward the cafe and at the curb in the distance he saw ver becks big roadster muggs then must be in the near vicinity he knew he quickened his stride and then he saw muggsâsaw him standing before the open door of a taxicab evidently in argument with a tall individual who bent forward and shook a forefinger under muggs nose and then detective riley scarcely could be lieve his eyes experience had taught him however to act first and analyze things afterward just as he saw muggs hurled backward into the taxi cab riley sprinted forward he was still some fifty feet away when the chauffeur of the cab sent his machine dashing down the street detective riley did not shout a com mand to stop nor draw a weapon and fire into the air he was too wise for that it was evident to him that muggs was being abducted the fact that there was no commotion in the cab that a door was not thrown open and either muggs or his abductor hurled to the pavement convinced riley that muggs had met with foul play the in stant his abductor had followed him into the cab who would annoy muggs assault him abduct him no body riley decided except persons allied with the black star where were they taking muggs that riley determined to discover there was verbecks roadster at the curbâone of the most powerful cars in the cityâand detective riley had operated it before now he ran for ward and sprang into the seat and an instant later was making his way down the boulevard one eye on the street before him and the other on the taxi cab in the distance a traffic officer recognizing him and noting the look on the detectives face hurried him across a busy cross street black stars subterfuge and riley sped on he had gained considerably on the taxicab ahead he did not try to gain more but kept his distance riley was aware that mem bers of the black stars band were familiar with the appearance of ver becks roadster and did not care to follow the taxicab close enough to make its chauffeur suspicious the sixth sense that all good police officers pos sess told riley to trail that other car to discover where muggs was being taken and why after a time the taxi left the broad boulevard went into a side street and turned toward the manufacturing dis trict here there was less traffic and riley dropped behind knowing he could speed up and overhaul the other car if it turned aside over rough streets paved with cob blestones through muddy alleys the cab led the way riley was using great caution now never sounding his horn dropping behind as long as he could see the tail light on the car speeding up whenever it made a turning now they were down near the river where the street lights were placed far apart a district teeming with life and industry in the daytime but almost deserted after nightfall here were the citys smaller manufacturing plants where old factories and abandoned buildings scattered among the ones where machinery hummed during the day the taxi made another turning and again riley raced the roadster forward to the corner the powerful engine making scarcely a sound as he ap proached the corner he slowed down when he reached it he saw that the taxicab had stopped at the curb half a block away riley drove the roadster across the street sprang out and hurried back to the corner there was scarcely any light on this block yet enough for him to make out that two men were carry ing a third between them from the taxi and through a gate in a factory fence the semidarkness was kind to riley he slipped from shadow to shadow came to the fence and hurried along it careful to make no noise at the gate he stopped to peer around the post the two men were carrying muggs through a little door in the side of an abandoned factory building riley waited until they had disap peared then hurried across the in closure reaching the corner of the building just in time to escape being seen by the chauffeur as he emerged the chauffeur hurried out to the car and riley let him go to attack the man might mean that he would fail to subdue him that an alarm would be given and all chance to investigate this affair further be lost riley slipped in through the door and found himself in a narrow dark hallway he heard no sound he fol lowed the hall for some distance until he came to a flight of steps down these he hurried and into another hall he came to a door beneath which light showed to the right of the door was another flight of steps that led upward and there was an open door at the top riley listened for some time and heard no conversation he hurried up the steps and through the door to find himself in a dusty room half filled with rusty machinery light came through the floor riley knelt on the dusty boards and peered through a tiny crack he gasped at what he saw muggs was stretched on a couch in a corner before a blackboard stood the black star before another blackboard was the gowned and masked figure of muggs abductor the black star was writing understand return in hour and half with taxi to take this man and the other away again they must be put to sleep first of course the other man nodded and backed detective story magazine through a door detective riley made no effort to descend the steps and catch him in the lower hall before his eyes was the black star the big quarryâ and the other man was to return in an hour and a half neither did riley hurry below and make an effort to capture the master criminal in his lair he determined to watch developments he did not know what a few minutes might bring forth important clews that would lead to the capture of members of the black stars band might be forthcoming and it appeared that there was no danger at present of muggs being made the vic tim of violence since the abductor was to return and remove him also the black star had spoken of another man with his eyes glued to the crack in the floor riley waited breathlessly an interested spectator of what transpired the black star spent some minutes walking back and forth across the room now and then chuckling as he looked at the unconscious muggs then he spokeâand muggs showed that he had regained consciousness from then until the black star raised the curtain and showed roger verbeck gagged and lashed to a chair detective riley lost not a word or movement of the master crook but the sight of verbeck held a helpless prisoner almost made riley lose cau tion he was on his feet instantly ready to slip down the stairs cover the black star with a weapon release ver beck and muggs and take the master rogue prisoner but caution returned to him in time to check such a course to make a move like that might be to meet with disaster riley did not know whether other members of the band were near ready to answer an alarm from the black star he did not know what would confront him if he threw open the door and faced the black star for the black star had proved he had un usual methods of protection and a slip a mistake a failure might result in the capture of the master criminal being further delayed riley decided to watch longer that there was no need for immediate action since verbeck and muggs did not appear to be in peril he stooped over the crack again and there he remained he heard the bell ring and saw a gownedandmasked figure enter and give number and coun tersign and then detective riley for got even roger verbeck and his predic ament momentarily as he read the blackboard conversation and realized what the black star and his band in tended doing that night riley had an added need for caution now he had to rescue verbeck and muggs prevent the theft of the gold capture the black star and some of his band if possible he could slip away and go for helpâbut while he was gone verbeck and muggs might be moved and riley would not know where they had been taken or the master criminal might leave his head quarters and the police find an empty nest when they arrived also detective riley who had known verbecks father and adored the son decided he would rather win the victory with only verbeck and muggs to help he wanted to see verbeck victorious in his feud with the master criminal and the black star was a man of strategy who would not be cap tured through violence two or three men meeting him at his own game would have a better chance for victory there was another angle tooâa noisy attack on the black stars head quarters would warn the members of his band and allow them to escape by working a clever plan of campaign it was possible to arrest some of the mas ter crooks accomplices riley had the plan he remembered how roger verbeck on a former oc casion had donned the black stars black stars subterfuge robe and mask and played master rogue for a day riley decided now that the best plan would be to get into that lower room and make the black star prisoner then roger verbeck could play rogue again and as the members reported for orders they could be captured one at a time riley knew he courted disaster if he stepped into that room and faced the black star in the guise of a police of ficer he did not doubt that the black star even facing a loaded pistol might use some trick and turn the scales in his favor had he not once before touched a button with his toe and sent roger verbeck to the bottom of a pit twelve feet deep if i could get into a gown and mask and get right beside him without him suspecting me riley mused gown and mask he doubted not were to be found some place in the lower hall but once inside the room riley would have to give number and countersign to throw the black star off his guard for an instantâthe in stant necessary to do the work properly that was what bothered rileyâthe number and countersign then he remembered the man who was to return and take verbeck and muggs away riley got up from the floor crept down the stairs and hid among the shadows in the lower hall near the outside door he did not have to wait long a shadowy form slipped through the gate and took up a position a few paces out side the door crouching just inside riley waited the other was waiting too looking at his watch now and then and grumbling and then down the street came a taxicab it stopped at the curb the chauf feur glanced up and down the street and then darted through the gate and hurried toward the door the other man stepped forward to meet him youre five minutes late he said want me to catch particular fits from the big boss got here as soon as i could im no âcountersign trenton im no âcountersign jackson good whats the game weve got this roger verbeck and his valet inside im to put em to sleep and were to take em near ver becks house and drop em there stand near the door and be ready to help ill get into the robe and mask and have em out here in a jiffy the chauffeur turned his back and glanced at his cab the other man whirled around and started for the door riley had the information he desired now he knew this mans number and countersign and how to use them the man who had entered the hall way went to a small box against the wall and took from it robe and mask as he raised the robe to don it de tective riley struck swiftly and with precisionâa sharp blow from a black jack in the approved place just behind the left ear the black stars man went down without a groan riley gagged him with a handker chief and bound his hands and feet with some old straps he had carried for that purpose from the room above working swiftly he put on gown and mask rolled the unconscious man to one side and fumbled around the box until he found a push button he pressed the button a bell tinkled in the distance almost immediately there was an answering tinkle and riley hurried through the hallway and opened the door of the illuminated room his glance rested first on the glit tering eyes of the black star then upon verbeck and muggs whether the black star was aware of the deception or not riley did not know but he was forced to turn his back and write his number on the blackboard the coun a ds detective story magazine tersign followed and the black stars orders and then riley advanced upon the defiant muggs waited until he was in the proper position and whirled to level his weapon at the black star and to tear off his mask he heard the gasps of relief and joy from verbeck and muggs but did not glance toward them again rileys eyes were blazing into those of the master criminal and he was watching for the black star to make a move chapter v black star takes a trick silence for a moment and then riley spoke in a tense voice and swiftly careful move hand or foot and ill fire im not taking any chances with you mr black star a chuckle came from behind the mask and the peculiar staccato voice of the master criminal answered him detective riley as i live very clever of youâvery and threatening of course violenceâalways violence instead of wit and strategy keep those hands up riley com manded dont move an inch id as soon shoot you as not but i guess well take you down to the station in stead and youll not escape this time either do you really think you have me the black star asked you expect to take me from my own headquarters to a filthy jail never mind the talk muggs can you hobble over here beside me so i can untie your hands and watch this chap at the same time then you can release verbeck and well play the rest of the evenings game in our own fashion the black star laughed aloud as muggs stood up and started to hop like a toad to the detectives side rileys glance did not waver he held the auto matic steady and his eyes never left the black stars mask muggs stopped beside him riley put down his left hand and fumbled until he found muggs wrists and then still watching the master crook he be gan working at the knots you are a very courageous man mr riley the black star said you cannot guess what may happen in a situation like this perhaps the floor will fall from under you as it did with mr verbeck once and let you down into a pit you may turn to find half a dozen of my good friends at your back ready to seize youâ dont worry about me turning im keeping my eyes on you riley snarled try something new something newâsomething clever the black star said his tone sarcastic let me think i might extinguish the light so we could fight it out in the darkâbut still that is not new youll notice the room is illuminated by only one lamp which stands on the table beside me im not looking at lampsâim watching you riley replied the knots were proving difficult to untie with one hand but riley kept working at them without looking down if he could get muggs hands free muggs could untie his feet and release verbeck they could bind and gag the black star verbeck could don his robe and mask and they could capture one by one such of the band as came to re port or receive orders those are excellent knots the black star observed at some future time ill be glad to teach you how to tie them dont you think this comedy has gone quite far enough if this is your idea of a comedy youll be liable to change your mind be fore long riley said i am interested to know how you got inside and how you knew what black stars subterfuge number and countersign to write some of my men must have been careless youll find one of them in the hall with a broken head riley exclaimed indeed always violent if you would learn to use wit and strategy instead ofâ the broken sentence a quick move a shot darkness the black star had taken the chance on the word he had sprung to one side toward the table rileys bullet went within six inches of his head there was a crash as the lamp was dashed to the floor twice more flame streaked the darkness and bullets crashed into the wall verbeck help less struggled to get to his feet muggs mouthed imprecations because his hands were still bound black silence thenânot even a mans breathing to be heard riley had re treated silently to the door and stood there straining his ears to catch some slight sound that would tell him where the master criminal was crouching he did not dare fire at random again he did not know but what muggs had moved and might receive the bullet in tended for the black star he was afraid verbeck had left the couch a slight hissing soundâa body crash ing to the floor riley holding his breath wondered what it meant was it verbeckâmuggs had the black star descended to the violence he scoffed and used a knife in the dark verbeck on the couch wondered too his nerves were on edge waiting for the shot he expected with every heart beat he heard the hissing again âthe sound of another falling body then a moment of silence again the strain was almost unbearable verbeck felt like shrieking like calling to riley and muggsâthough he knew neither would answer and betray his position a chuckleâa deep satisfied laugh on the opposite side of the room a match flickered and in its flame ver beck beheld the black mask the flam ing jet star on the hood above it quite melodramatic mr verbeck eh the black star said i was forced to take quite a chance that time âdetective riley might have sent a bullet or two into my body however luck was with me again the match flame died out the black star struck another and carried it across the room he picked up the lamp put it back on the table only the chimney broken he said well have poor light but it will serve he chuckled again as he touched the flaming match to the wick the fitful uncertain light filled the room ver beck gave a cry of horror muggs was stretched on the floor near the table riley lay on his face near the door do not be alarmed for your friends the master criminal said they have not been assassinated mr verbeck but merely put to sleep for a short time unless you desire to share their condition remain where you are on the couch until i give you permis sion to leave he hurried across to riley and took off the robe he picked up the mask from the floor where riley had tossed it he hurried out through the door verbeck started to get up but fell back on the couch again he did not know of the vapor gun and it was a mystery to him what had happened to muggs and riley he didnt want to be rendered unconscious himself for there was work to be done if he was al lowed to go or could escape he wondered how riley had trailed them and entered the room and what would happen now that the detective knew the location of the black stars headquarters would the master crim inal change his mind and hold all three of them prisoners would it be im possible to prevent the theft of gold planned for two oclock in the morning detective story magazine the door opened and the black star came into the room again detective riley strikes hard he observed however my man is con scious again now and will be with us in a few minutes the pity of it is that hell be useless after this as i have seen his face i must provide for him and send him away for i cannot break one of our rules ah wellâit is all in the game and the game isnt ended yet ver beck said angry because i was forced to put your friends asleep eh the black star chuckled that puzzles you per haps merely a vapor gun mr ver beckâthough the vapor itself is some what of a secret see he took the vapor gun from beneath his robe waved it at verbeck then re turned it the door openedâthere en tered a robed and masked man who staggered as he walked you brought the straps good the black star said well just make detective riley secure first easy now dont be rough simply because he knocked you on the headâits all in the game in a moment riley was bound and rolled to a corner of the room then the black star held a handkerchief be neath muggs nostrils and almost im mediately muggs sighed and opened his eyes thats better help me get him to the couch the master criminal ordered his man they carried muggs across the room and put him down beside verbeck the black star took out his watch and glanced at it um ninethirty he said but for the sudden and unexpected appear ance of riley youd be home by this time mr verbeck with this man of yours you must blame detective riley for the delay ah mr muggs feeling better now youâyou muggs stammered no violent language i pray at tend me closely now gentlemen i promised to send you home and ill keep my promise you must go as you came of courseâunconscious you then will be unable to say where this room is located with detective riley it is different he evidently trailed somebody to this placeâhe knows its exact location i cannot allow him to go free naturally after that i must keep him prisoner for a time it may be necessary for me to change my head quarters again quite a nuisance if riley is harmed verbeck began tut tut i repeat i abhor vi olence but let us not waste more time he turned to the man beside him you understand he asked the cab is waiting i believe take these two men to within a block or so of mr verbecks residence and drop them there you must use the vapor gun of course without replying the man riley had struck stepped forward drawing the weapon from beneath his robe muggs shrank from him a touch of the trig ger and roger verbeck beheld the cloud of vapor heard muggs futile cry of protest and saw his comrade in arms topple over on the couch as if shot through the heart very neat the black star said carry him out and then return for the other muggs was lifted and carried to the door the black star helped take him into the hallway verbeck heard a third man called in low tones and the master criminal returned you see mr verbeck it is useless to match wits with me he said a short time ago you thought you had me eh and nowâ the game isnt ended yet verbeck interrupted i believe you said that once before black stars subterfuge i care not how long the game endures if i take all the tricks ah here is our friend again it is your turn now mr verbeck the man with the vapor gun stepped swiftly across the room chapter vi the blazed trail verbecks feet were lashed to gether and his hands tied but roger verbeck refused to despair in the face of even such obstacles as those he waited until the masked and robed figure with the vapor gun was within six feet of him until the gun was thrown up as if to be discharged and then holding his breath and half closing his eyes verbeck sprang through the air it was unexpected and he crashed against the enemy with such force as to hurl him to the floor verbeck re gained his balance and sprang nimbly to one side as the black star growl ing his anger started forward with his lashed wrists held at arms length before him verbeck hopped like a toad across the room and brought up against the wall beside the nearest blackboard his brain was working as well as his muscles through verbecks mind flashed the thought that his abduction and that of muggs their visit to the black stars headquarters their knowl edge of the crime planned for that night would be of no value unless he could tell afterward where the headquarters was located if he inhaled that pungent vapor he would be able to tell nothing except the appearance of the rooms interior he backed away as the black star and the other man approached him again with more caution this time they sprang toward him together and verbeck whirled and presented his back he threw an elbow back sharply as he felt one of them grasp him by the shoulder and some one grunted in sud den pain as the elbow struck into the pit of his stomach both men had their hands on him now trying to bend him backward with the intention verbeck felt sure of dis charging a cloud of vapor into his face and rendering him unconscious then he would be carried to the taxicab like a bag of meal and after a time de posited with muggs near home there to regain consciousness and remember that the black star held detective riley prisoner and that he did not know where he struggled as well as he could with his feet and wrists bound he grasped the end of the blackboard and bent his head trying to avoid the cloud of vapor he knew was coming his hands went into the chalk boxâme chanically he grasped half a dozen pieces of crayon and crushed them in his palm a sudden wrench and they bore him backward working roughly and with out speaking verbeck saw the vapor gun presented at his face and caught his breath the trigger was pressed vapor filled the air about him verbeck held his breath he stag gered backward the black star still clinging to him foot by foot pretend ing to grow weaker he stumbled from the wall and the vapor cloud fighting himself to keep from taking a breath at the same time he turned actorâ his eyes fluttered he grew limp did everything to give the men who gasped him the idea that the vapor had done its work it seemed that his lungs would burst red streaks flashed be fore his eyes and thenâcarefully slowlyâhe let air into his nostrils hop ing that the danger was over that fixed him the black star broke a rule and detective story magazine spoke in the presence of one of his men but in a low voice not like his own they let verbeck slip down to the floor he continued his acting but his eyes did not close entirely he was breath ing regularly now yet carefully and not deeply and through his halfclosed eyes he watched the vapor gun fear ing it would be turned against him again that he would be caught off guard and inhale the sleepproducing gas the black star clapped his hands and hurried to the blackboard ver beck heard the squeak of the crayon as he wrote but could not see what was being written without turning his head and he did not dare do that the man who had used the vapor gun bent and took the bonds from ver becks wrists and ankles he caught verbeck under the arms from behind and lifted him gently and carried him toward the door he threw the door open they were in the dark narrow hall way now and the door was closed be hind them verbecks captor was dragging him along and verbeck con tinued to pretend unconsciousness al lowing his dead weight to rest upon the other mans shoulder they made a turn and there another man waited got him he whispered yesâhe put up a scrap wait un til i get this gown and mask off the chauffeur held verbeck while the other removed the regalia then they took him along the narrow cor ridor toward the door verbeck did not know what instant they would discover he was conscious and use the vapor gun again to better advantage he remembered the chalk he still held in one fist a few chalk marks might serve as a trail and point the way to the black stars den he moved his fingers until he held one of the sticks of crayon in position for writing he managed to lurch against the wallâand left a long white mark they made another turn went up a short flight of steps verbeck made more marks a door was opened and the cold night air struck them out side verbeck saw a littered factory yard with a gate in the distance and a taxicab waiting before it at the curb verbeck continued his acting as they half carried him across the yard to the gate and there they propped him against the wall for a moment while the chauffeur glanced up and down the street and started the engine and when they carried him forward again verbeck had left on the gatepost and the wall beside it a series of crosses marked with chalk they reached the cab verbeck man aged to break off a small piece of crayon and grind it beneath one heel leaving a white blotch on the dirty walk they tossed him insideâand he lurched across the unconscious muggs and fell against the opposite door the window was open and verbeck managed to fall on the seat in such fashion that the hand holding the chalk was extended a few inches out of the window the chauffeur sprang to his seat the other man entered the cab and closed the door the vehicle started away now verbecks every sense was alert though he continued to pretend uncon sciousness born and reared in this city as he was yet he did not recognize the locality from what he saw through the window of the cab he could guess what part of the city it was in but that was all and there was going to be no time to waste if the black stars headquarters was to be raided in time to prevent the gold theft it was essential that verbeck he able to lead police to the scene as speedily as possible there would be no time to search fif teen or twenty blocks for some certain black stars subterfuge abandoned factory building when pos sibly there were a score of such build ings within that area and a search would warn the black star there could be but one way to successâa di rect and unexpected descent upon the master crooks den verbeck noticed that the pavement was roughâcobblestones evidently he could see little of the buildings he was passing because of the dark at the first corner he noticed an empty onestory store with boarded windows beside it was a billboard flaunting a glaring soap advertisement these things verbeck remembered he counted the blocks until the taxi made the first turn and there beneath the arclight on the corner he dropped a piece of chalk to the street he was trying to remember the trail also to mark it and at the same time his brain was active in quite another direction he wondered whether he should attempt to overpower this man sitting beside him and the chauffeur and make an effort to turn these two of the black stars band over to the police that done he could call for help and lead the way back to the master criminals headquar ters possibly capture him at work and rescue riley but the chances of failure were too great the percentage was against ver beck suppose he tried it and failed then the vapor gun would come forth again he would be rendered uncon scious in truth and left near home with muggs and not having marked the trail would be unable to lead a squad of police to the black stars place it was best verbeck decided to continue his acting and try to remember the trail whenever the taxi turned a corner verbeck dropped more chalk he also was trying to remember the number of blocks between the turns and he was gaining some sense of location now on and on the taxi dashed until it reached the retail district verbeck identified a corner he was not forced to remember anything more nowâhe could begin the back trail there again he considered whether to at tack the man beside him but he de cided against it again if he did and failed the black star would be warned that he had not been unconscious and escape if he allowed himself to be put out near home with muggs he could hurry to the house inform the police and begin the effort to frustrate the black stars plans and capture him and some of his band the taxi sped along a boulevard made another turn and lurched toward the curb they were within three blocks of the verbeck place now and here giant maple trees lined the street casting great shadows it was an ideal place to drop unconscious men without being observed the taxicab stopped verbeck heard the man beside him laugh lightly to himself and then why hadnt he anticipated it he might have guessed the black stars man would use the vapor gun again be fore putting him out of the cab with muggs for fear they might awake too soon and create a disturbance before the taxi got away why hadnt he been on guard ready to hold his breath again and act as before his senses whirled dimly he re membered the chalk trailâthe corner from which he was to startâthat the possible capture of the black star and the immediate rescue of riley depended on his memoryâand there was some thing about a hundred thousand in goldâ his head fell forwardâhe seemed to hear a voice in the distanceâand then the dreamless sleep came to him as it had come to muggs detective story magazine chapter vii at bay nearer and nearer louder and more insistent came the voice boss boss wake up boss aw boss cant you wake up verbeck recognized the voice as that of muggs but it seemed he was in darkness and then rapidly things cleared his head whirled again but this time consciousness was returning to him instead of leaving try to sit up boss thats the stuff now muggs had an arm around his shoulders and was urging him to bend forward verbeck sighed and opened his eyes he was in the darkness on the ground between sidewalk and curb whyâwhatâ he gasped memory returned to him with a rush he struggled to get to his feet and muggs aided him and they staggered toward the walk the black stars headquartersâriley held prisonerâthe chalk trailâthe vapor gun verbeck remembered all and was roused to ac tion one moment muggsâim dizzy he complained just let us stand here a minute or so then well get busy when i came to you were dead to the world boss aint it the deuce where do you suppose them headquar ters are eh and how are we goin to get riley out things arent as bad as they seem muggs i know a thing or two did they shoot that stuff at you as soon as they put me to sleep they did muggs but it didnt take effect whwhats that boss i fought them muggsâheld my breath i pretended to be unconscious and they carried me to the taxi they didnt put me to sleep until just before we were taken out of the cab i got caught off guard then boss youâyouâ exactly muggs ive an idea where the black star has his headquar ters come alongâim all right now weve got to hurry to the house side by side they hurried down the street went around the corner and so came to the old verbeck place once inside the gate they ran at top speed to the front door unlocked it hurried inside muggs snapped on the lights roger verbeck rushed to the telephone and called police headquarters and asked for the chief hello chief he said this is roger verbeck he was fighting to keep the note of excitement from his voice for verbeck knew the chief well communicate ex citement to the chief and he would want to call out the reserves make a noise alarm every crook in the cityâ and so accomplish nothing listen well chief he said now and please do not interruptâand do exactly as i say ive been to the black stars headquarters waitâwait keep quiet chief and listen well get along better if we take things coolly yesâive been inside the headquarters he had me knocked out at a restaurant and took me there he had muggs ab ducted and taken there his intention was to let us see the place and then send us away unconscious and give us the laugh because we couldnt find the place again butâbutâ wait verbeck commanded while we were there he even let us see orders given his men theyve planned a big trick for tonight they are going to steal a hundred thousand in gold coin at two oclock in the morn ing it is a shipment that arrived at noon today understand get the wheels in motion down there and find out what bank or trust company re ceived that shipment and have their place well guarded black stars subterfuge yesâyes iâ wait now listen carefully while we were there detective riley showed upâi dont know how he got there we had things going our way for a time but the black star turned the ta bles on us as usual hes got riley there nowâa prisoner wait confound you and listen im home muggs and i were dumped here uncon scious get your fastest machineâi dont know where my roadster isâand come out here with two of your best men get here as soon as you can only two men chiefâif you bring any more well raise a racket and lose out entirely no questionsâhurry verbeck hung up the receiver before the chief could reply that he knew was the way to get quick action out of the head of the citys police depart ment but how are we goin to find that place boss muggs demanded verbeck held up a hand for silence he was pacing back and forth across the room his brow wrinkled head bent cracking his fingers nervously twoâ fiveâthreeâeightâ were those numbers correct had verbeck re turned to consciousness with the right numbers photographed on his brain twoâfiveâthreeâeightâand then the corner he knew and had identified hed have to reverse the numbers of course from the comer eight blocks to where the taxicab had made the turn then three blocks to the next turnâ but which direction ah the chalk would tell if it could be found in a few words he explained to muggs what he had done and that the chances for success were slim the small pieces of crayon might be gone they might have to retrace their steps a score of times and every minute was precious it was after ten oclock now theyd have to find the black stars headquarters within a short time to catch him there undoubtedly mem bers of the band would report at a late hour to get final instructions regarding the theft of the gold if only several of them could be capturedâif riley could be released before harm befell him but thered be no time to waste down the street came the shrieking of a siren now curse the chief for a fool verbeck cried twothirds of the city will know were on the trail before weve gone two blocks it is our game for the black star to think we have no idea where his headquarters can be found that we were dead to the world when we left to be brought here muggs swung the door open as the police machine stopped before the gate and the chief and two of his men charged up the walk toward the veranda verbeck met them at the top of the steps listen he commanded lets have no noise the slightest alarm may spoil our plans ill tell you what ive done he spoke rapidly clearly he told what had transpired in the black stars den about riley how he had remained conscious and left the chalk trail he kept murmuring the numbers he had to remember until muggs handed him a pencil then he wrote the numbers on his cuff no siren he ordered drive to the national building corner first thats where we take up the trail ive got men busy telephoning the chief reported as the machine darted down the boulevard if theres a bank or trust company got that gold ship ment therell be a crowd of police in their building within half an hour and if we get the black star and some of his men muggs and i have spotted two of his men verbeck said muggs can identify the one who abducted him and the chauffeur and i got a good look at the one who rode in the cab with detective story magazine us though i couldnt identify the chauf feur very well but you can lay a wager right now chief that those men will receive a roll of bills each and be sent out of town at once the black star you understand knows we have seen them their usefulness for him is at an end heres your corner the chauffeur cried verbeck stood up in the machine and looked around him then glanced at his cuff to be sure he was making no mis take drive south eight blocks he or dered then stop the machine sped away the destination was reached verbeck sprang out and looked around at the pavement he gave a glad cry and ran toward one curb there in the street was a white blotch where the heavy wheel of some vehicle had run over and crushed a piece of chalk you see he cried a moment now he looked at his cuff again three blocks this timeâbut in what direction i do not know i didnt have a chance to see very well remember all i know is that the taxi made an other turn three blocks from this cor ner they went toward the west first and on the third corner searched without success for the bit of chalk there was a small searchlight on the car and with it they swept the pavement for a hundred feet in every direction they found no trace of chalk they went to the next corner think ing verbeck might have made a mis take counting the number of blocks and again they searched without reward back to the first corner they hurried and this time went to the east be fore they had searched the third corner there less than a minute verbeck found what they sought the chalk had not been crushed here but here it was close to the curb verbeck consulted his cuff again five blocks he said it must be five blocks north or south we know the place we want to find is in the manufacturing district somewhere so the best guess is south again the machine dashed down the street once more they descended and searched the pavement muggs the chief the two detectives from head quarters joined in the search the chauffeur operated the searchlight and flooded the street with brilliance there was no sign of chalk down another blockâmaybe you made a mistake the chief said they hurried to the next corner it was nearly eleven oclock unless the chalk could be found they would have no direct trail to follow and a sys tematic search of the manufacturing district would take hours and put the black star on guard five minutes search convinced them there was no chalk on this corner they got into the machine and turned back to the last corner where they had found the chalk im sure i counted five blocks ver beck said perhaps it is in the other direction ive got it one of the detectives cried see that private alley you counted that its the fourth corner instead of the fifth they stopped on the fourth corner there was a blotch of white on the pavementâthe police machine itself had made it by crushing the chalk as it passed now what the chief demanded two blocks said verbeck and thats all i could remember when i re gained consciousness two blocks to another piece of chalk and after that a considerable run without a turn well have to go blind until i see something that recalls the locality two blocks they journeyed at top speed two blocks to the eastâand black stars subterfuge there they found the bit of crayon in the middle of the street once more verbeck stood up in the car and looked down the intersecting thoroughfares try that he said and pointed to the south again drive slowly the machine went on block after block they passed while verbeck searched the side of the street trying to spot some building he remembered and then he saw a onestory empty building with boarded windows stop he ordered to the curb i remember this were within two blocks of the place well leave the machine here and go ahead on foot only the chauffeur remained behind verbeck led the way with muggs at his side and behind came the chief and the two headquarters detectives they passed the first corner and then ver beck began walking slower watching the curb line glancing at the gateway of every factory fence there he whispered he pointed to the curb to the chalk smeared on the walk there where he had ground it with his heel as they were putting him into the taxicab this is the place he said and led the way to the gate there were the crosses he had marked they were at the end of the trail the building was small and stood in the middle of the lot with the fence entirely around it it did not com municate with another building and was easily surrounded theres the door they use verbeck said through a hall down half a flight of steps to another hall in the basement a few steps along that and you come to the door of the room that holds the black star what do you consider the best plan the chief asked it is bright moonlightâwe can see every square foot of the yard sup pose your two men keep near the fence and watch the sides of the building you too chief ill take muggs and enter well go prepared for trouble and try to spring a surprise well get into that room some way and therell be action as soon as we do youll just have to guess from anything you hear whether itll be best to remain outside on guard or enter the building to help but rileyâ the chief began i suppose he is in there unless he has been taken away by some of the black stars men if he is there we must rescue him of course so he can aid us better let me send in a callâ no verbeck interrupted we can do that laler if it proves necessary a surprise swift action by just a few of us may turn the trick a bunch of reserves would alarm the gang if we do not do that we may be able to pick up several of them if they come to re port or receive orders all right the chief replied you go on in with muggs and well watch the outside and be ready to make a rush if you need help youre armed of course im notâi forgot neither is muggs the black star relieved us of our automatics and failed to return them the chief stepped to the curb and signalled the distant chauffeur and the headquarters automobile came to them swiftly the chauffeur handed his automatic to verbeck and muggs re ceived a revolver that was in the ma chine the chief and chauffeur were to hold the gate a detective slipped along the fence in each direction keeping to the shadows trying to get to a post where two sides of the building could be watched verbeck spoke softly to muggs and they stepped out into the bright moonlight and started walking swiftly across the yard toward the little door verbeck had but one fearâthat the detective story magazine black star his plans for the nights crime completed had left the head quarters and gone to whatever place he called home there would be nothing to do then except watch the empty nest but if the black star and some of his men were in the building a flash of flame came from one of the windows a bullet whistled past verbeck and muggs and struck the fence near the gate another flash of flameâanother bullet get out of that moonlight they heard the chief shriek on another side of the building there was a shot from a window and one of the detectives replied to it verbeck and muggs dashed back to the fence and got in the shadows more shots flashed from windows the black star evidently was in his head quarters with some of his men at bay forgetting his abhorrence of violent methods giving battle in an effort to escape the police he had scorned chapter viii the voice of desperation the chief crept slowly along the fence until he stood beside ver beck and muggs theyre on to us he exclaimed they must have had somebody watch ing afraid riley had given the tip before he was caught i suppose now weve got to smoke em out shots came at intervals from some of the windows and now and then one of the detectives fired in return the chief spoke a few rapid words to the chauffeur and in an instant the ma chine was tearing down the street the siren shrieking told him to send in an alarm the chief explained no use trying to handle this thing by ourselves ver beck well have a sweet time getting in thereâbut weve got em thank heaven its an easy place to surround and if they try to come out well get every last one of them this will be the end of the black star but im afraid for riley if hes still in there these smooth crooks are always the worst when they get cornered they forget theyre human i wouldnt put it past the black star to do for old riley if he finds hes up against a los ing game more shots from the windowsâthen a lull it was somewhat of a ticklish situation here were five men guard ing the four sides of the building and it was impossible to say how many were inside if the master criminal and his men made a rush some of them might escape crouching nervously in the shadows of the fence the five waited straining their ears to hear sounds that would tell of the coming of a police machine minutes passed and there came no rush of determined and desperate men from the building verbeck remem bered the black stars clevernessâbe gan wondering whether there was some sort of underground passage through which he could lead his men to safety again a fusillade of shots and he knew they still were in the building did the fusillade herald a rush for freedom gripping their weapons those near the fence waited but the rush did not come and then from far down the street came the shrieks of a siren rapidly drawing nearer the chief gave a sigh of relief he left verbeck and muggs and hurried through the gate and to the curb the machine turned the nearest corner and dashed up to him and half a dozen police sprang out another siren in the distanceâan other machine the chief had reen forcements of some fifteen men now he explained the situation rapidly sent his men to surround the building black stars subterfuge when those inside fired again they drew a volley in reply give it to em hot for a while the chief passed the word we wont try any rushes yetâcant be losing men get too much criticismâand it isnt necessary make it so hot they cant stay near the windows give it to em from all four sides of the factory building volleys were poured at win dows and doors and from the windows came answering shots now in twos and threes now with such rapidity that it seemed at least a score of men were on the defensive there how many crooks has he got with him do you suppose the chief asked that is what puzzles me verbeck admitted according to his usual methods there never are more than two or three men besides himself at the headquarters at any one time well it looks to me like theres a couple of dozen in there now perhaps verbeck offered we caught them just at the right time to nab quite a number according to what was written on the blackboards six men were to steal the gold and they may be there for final orders there may have been other crimes contem plated for tonight too or it is pos sible there is a grand gathering of the band for a distribution of money from other thefts i have ceased to be sur prised at anything unusual connected with the black star well weve got him now the chief said it will be the same old story of police besieging desperate men barricaded in a building theyll hold us off just so long and then well get in and ill bet we find him a suicide when we do he made the remark tonight that when the time came he would know how to die even if he had to descend to suicide there you are those smooth crooks always do thatâcant stand the thought of prison well well end his work anyway well get himâeither dead or alive there came another lull in the bat tle and then another volley from the windows from one side of the build ing came a shriek of pain bartons hit the word traveled along the line to the chief hes got it badâthrough the breast the chief sent orders to have the man removed and hurried to a hospital thats the thing im afraid of he confided to verbeck i want to get the black star but i dont want to lose men and those fiends in the factory if they think theyre cornered will shoot to kill another shriek of pain from the side of the building the chief muttered a curse as he slipped away following the fence going to see what man of his had been wounded now how long they goin to keep this up boss muggs whispered to verbeck they are cornered muggs and you know what that means i suppose theyll keep it up until the black star is dead and the others decide to sur render and take their medicine rather than to die im sorry about this i had hoped the three of us would get the black star alone without gun play why dont they go in and get em muggs demanded with a tinge of dis gust in his tone it could be done but we might lose men verbeck said they cant leave the building without facing police guns âand were sure to get them in time the chief intends to batter at them wear them down then make a rush when they realize they are losing the fight theyd fight twice as desperately now at the beginning of the battle as they will later when their nerves are on edge and the truth of the situation dawns on them detective story magazine then were just goin to stand off and fight long distance muggs said if wed get in the building wed end it quicker i realize that muggs but between the shadows of this fence and the near est door is a patch of bright moonlight fifty feet wide why take chances in that bright moonlight when by playing a waiting game we win without such grave chances eh wellâyou see bossâriley is in there iâi realize that too muggs and riley is a good scout i had a little runin with him once when i thought he believed i wasnt square but im strong for him now i understand muggs and he had a nerve cornin in the headquarters like he did in that mask and robeâand he did it to help us out ill bet as much as to get the black star you want to make a rush for it and get in the factory is that it muggs well id take a chance boss to help riley this game belongs to the three of us anywayâthe police are just backin us up you might say the chief slipped back to them through the shadows i got a little of that conversation he said it would be foolish to make such an attempt now wed just have more men in there in trouble why ive known riley for yearsâknew him before i ever got in the department id be the first man to go across that patch of moonlight if i thought it would help well muggs said wed walk into trouble we can tell theres from a dozen to a score of men in there and theyre desperate ready to die with their boots on like the oldtime bandits did suppose two or three of us did get across that moon light and get in the building we might whip the dozen or score and again we might not and if i order a rush now im going to lose men i dont want to do that well just batter away at them for a time first ive sent for searchlights searchlights verbeck gasped i can connect with a power wire at the corner of the alley well flood every window with light so not a man will dare get in one of them to shoot and then when the proper time comes well rush and get into the building ive sent for more men too more men verbeck asked exactlyâmore men two of my men are down now and one of them is liable to die nothing in this town is as important right now as getting the black star no matter whether we ar rest him or kill him trying to weve got him corneredâwe know that hes got some of his gang with him and the police department drops everything else until we finish this all the re serves are coming every policeman in the city now on duty is getting or ders to report here as soon as possible when he pulls a box im stripping the town of police to throw a police army around this block itll never be said we had him surrounded and that he got away heres where we finish the black star if news of this is scattered around town verbeck began it is scattered around town already the call for the reserves scattered it therell be extra editions of the papers on the street in another quarter hour or ill miss a guess and then well have a mob down hereâseveral thousand fools who want to see the scrap and wont have any more sense than to try to see it at close range i want men to handle the fool mob as well as surround the block there came another lull in the firing no flashes of flame showed at the win dows on the outside the police re filled weapons and waited half expect black stars subterfuge ing a delayed rush ready to close in and balk an attempt at escape an instant of comparative silenceâ and in that instant a voiceâdeep strik ing staccatoâthat seemed to come from the interior of the factory but could be heard plainly no quarter it cried were cor nered die game get as many as you can theyll never get me alive a confused murmur came as if in answer good the voice cried thats the boys make every shot count after them another fusillade of shots from the windows and answering volleys from the police verbeck bent close to the chief so that the latter could hear him above the din that was the black star he said you were rightâhell die with his boots on and hell get as many of us as he can before he dies chapter ix muggs goes to try the rattling of pistol shots con tinued from every direction po lice officers hurried toward the block and reported either to the chief or one of the captains lines were stretched two blocks away on every side and be hind the ropes gathered scores of auto mobiles that had carried hundreds of morbidly curious persons to the scene of battle throughout the city had flashed the news that the black star and his band of criminals had been surrounded by the police in an abandoned factory building and that a siege was in prog ress rumors told of the death of roger verbeck in a duel with the mas ter criminal others that the black star had escaped and only some of his men were surrounded still others that a dozen policemen had been wounded and some slain held in check by the ropes and the police guard the throng ever increas ing passed these rumors around and invented new ones on the spur of the moment police arriving from su burban districts had to fight their way through the jam to get to the battle line the sheriff hearing of the siege journeyed to the spot with his deputies to offer his aid to the police a frantic mayor unable to get into communica tion with the head of his police de partment debated whether to visit the scene of conflict or wire the governor of the state for the use of militia the first hysteria passed as it always does the throngs behind the ropes settled down to a steady wait plying police officers for late information the sheriff and his deputies mingled with the citys officers on the firing line the mayor remembered that only a few criminals were in that building and that it would be a reflection on his ad ministration to ask the governor for help the searchlights arrived and were connected floods of light bathed the factory building but they did not stop the volleys of bullets officers poured leaden hail through those windows un til it looked as if no man could approach one near enough to fire out yet from the factorys interior came answering shots a perspiring chief crept close to roger verbeck again please come with me mr verbeck âyou and your man he said the mayor wants to speak to you verbeck and muggs hugging the wall and so keeping in the darkness followed the chief to the gate and dashed through it the mayor stood against the wall outside half a dozen other officials with him we ask your advice mr verbeck detective story magazine he said you believe the black star is in that building i heard his voice urging his men verbeck replied and how many men do you believe he has with him frankly i have no idea sir i am insisting that the chief have his men rush the building mr ver beck he tells me it would be a foolish thing to do at this juncture i am of the opinion that few if any policemen would be wounded making the dash to the doors kindly remember verbeck said that getting inside the doors is not all of it once inside therell be a hand tohand fight i know the black star mr mayor he is a tricky individual he had traps in his other headquarters and he may have in this are we to do this sort of thing for ever then i believe the chief is taking the right method verbeck replied he is flooding the place with light now if they continue the fight they must ap pear at the windows to fire and sooner or later some of them will be wounded a few wounded men a few hours of this continual warfare and the men inside that building will lose heart i understand detective riley an old and tried officer is held prisoner in the building the last i knew of him he was verbeck said um it seems peculiar to me that you and your man could not have over come this black star when you were in the room with him and riley had him covered i understand he defeated the three of you he did verbeck admitted muggs and i were bound hand and foot the black star took a chance and smashed the only lamp in the room in the darkness he overcame riley and muggs with a vapor gun he uses the rest was simple since i was helpless say muggs shoved his way for ward and confronted the citys chief executive have you got the nerve to stand here and bawl out my boss be cause we got the worst of it why hes got more nerve than you and all your police together heâ muggs verbeck shouted well it makes me mad why are we mixed up in this thing anyway because the police cant handle the job âthats why and now the mayor tries to bawl us outâ my good manâ the mayor be gan he was an aristocratic mayor dont you good man me want to rush in there do you peel your coat mr mayor get a gun and come on ill lead the way if youll follow rileys my friendâill lead the way well verbeck smothered a grin the chief turned away quickly to hide the twinkle in his eyes iâerâwell just drop the subject the mayor said perhaps the chief knows best a volley of shots came from the building volleys from the police an swered it some shootin muggs exclaimed and it takes just one of them bullets âjust oneâto do considerable damage to a man want to rush in mayor thatll do muggs verbeck com manded the mayor is all rightâhe just didnt quite understand well if he thinks we havent got nerve enough to go inâ you might tell him wed have been in there before this except that the chief is command in officer and said to stay out there is no question of your cour age muggs nor of yours mr verbeck the mayor said quickly let us drop the subject and await developments the firing ceased for an instant from the factory came a chorus of such black stars subterfuge shrieks as a man undergoing torture might make ifâif thats rileyâ muggs said he whirled suddenly upon ver beck let me go boss he implored if i can get in all right ill take a chance afterward if thats riley no muggs aw boss just turn off the search light from that door it wont take me a second to run across illâill take a chance i might do something where a gang of police couldnt iâi might be able to pick em off perhaps that would be a good idea the mayor said verbeck whirled upon the citys ex ecutive and the mayor involuntarily took a step backward he realized he had said the wrong thing and he didnt care to antagonize roger ver beck for verbeck had political in fluence muggs life is worth as much as that of any man verbeck said hes not getting paid to do such a thing and your police are i refused to say i thought the police ought to go in you might do as much for my friend iâi didnt think the mayor stam mered the shooting was continuous now despite the glare of the searchlights on the windows shots came from the fac tory verbeck found himself wonder ing why they did not shoot at the searchlights perhaps they had and had proved poor marksmen he thought certainly they were not hitting many policemen for none had been wounded except the two early in the fray yet the police of course fought from the shadows more officers struggled through the crowd and reached the firing line word reached the chief from the cen tral station that all men had been sent to him except a dozen or so who re mained there and at the precinct sta tions to receive telephone messages and issue alarms in case of an emergency the cordon around the factory was as strong as the chief could make it with out swearing in special officers and he had enough menâit would be im possible for any of the black stars band to escape it was unusual this stripping the city of defenders by gathering them all at one spot but both the chief and the mayor felt the situation justified it for months the black star and his men had terrorized the city every attempt to capture them had failed banks had been raided jewels stolen citizens were demanding protection and now that he had the black star in his head quarters it was policy to make it im possible for him to escape boss muggs implored itd be a cinch and rileys in there if you go muggs i go with you no boss just let me take the chance i aint worth much anyway boss ive had my fling and youâ youre goin to get marriedâand all that you stay here boss and let me go just have em turn off that search light a minuteâ no muggs but old rileyâ i know muggs but we must wait ive always done as you wanted me to boss cant i have my own way this once let me go no verbeck answered again it would be foolish muggs youd only get into trouble yourselfâand youd not be able to help riley perhaps iâi could try another fusillade of shots more shrieks from the factory it seemed to muggs that those shrieks sounded like riley in the past ten days he had learned to think a great deal of riley and he hated the black star to think of the black star torturing riley kill ing himâ a cry from the mayor caused the a ds detective story magazine chief and verbeck to whirl around muggs revolver in hand had run out into the path of light muggs verbeck shrieked but muggs did not seem to hear he turned around threw up his revolver and fired the lens of the searchlight was shatteredâthe path of bright light that illumined the door died away a shadowy form darted in zigzag fashion toward the factory muggs had gone to try chapter x in the doorway roger verbeck millionaire and clubman wealthy son of a wealthy father realized in that moment what true brotherhood means his relations with muggs flashed through his mind muggs derelict of destiny crook off spring of scumâverbeck had picked him up in paris one night when muggs weary of existence was about to throw himself into the seine muggs was at the points those who tread the paths of crime often reachâdisgusted with what he had made of his life seeing no hope of living differently ready to die rather than continue verbeck saved him muggs became an honest man they had been com rades sinceâa peculiar comradeship that caused comment because of the difference between them now verbeck remembered the ad ventures through which they had passed why muggs had even saved his life once and now muggs had gone into that factory facing almost certain deathâgone to the rescue of a man he did not know two weeks be fore simply because he admired that man should not roger verbeck then stand by muggs whom he had known for five years with whom he had stood shoulder to shoulder in many battles verbeck forgot his wealth his station in life even his fiancăše and the happi ness in store for him he remembered only muggsâmuggs who often had fought for him who now was facing danger perhaps death without ver beck by his side acting on the impulse that had come to him verbeck started forward oh no you dont it was the chief who spoke who grasped verbeck around the waist and called to two officers near for help we cant allow it mr verbeck he said im sorry muggs went in cer tainly we cannot allow you to throw your life away then send in your men muggs has gone because riley one of your de tectives is in there soonâbut not just yet the chief said we must batter them more first he signed to the two officers to watch verbeck and then hurried away to have another searchlight turned on the door way in place of the one muggs had smashed verbeck raging walked back and forth along the fence and muggs meantime was crouch ing just inside the door recovering breath after his dash muggs was the fighter the killer now his lower jaw was shot forward again his lips set tightly over his teeth his eyes nar rowed he buttoned his coat tightly across his breast and pulled his cap down low over his eyes gripping the revolver holding it in front of him ready for in stant use he began to creep slowly along the hallway when muggs had passed through that hallway before he had been un conscious hence he knew nothing con cerning it and he did not dare strike a match he was not sure his dash for the door had been unobserved he made his way forward slowly through the blackness his left hand continually feeling the wall he reached the short flight of steps black stars subterfuge and felt his way down them stopping now and then to listen from outside came the rattle of revolver tire from the rooms above him came the answer ing shots muggs realized he was in the basement of the building and he wanted to get to the first floor he came presently to the other hall to the stairs and went up one step at a time ready for instant battle trying to hear the voices of the black stars men but it was the voice of the black star himself that he heard at them it shrieked no quar ter die like men muggs could not locate the voice in the din he was not sure from which room it came he crept on along the hallway until he reached an open door there he hesitated a moment then holding his weapon ready he peered into the room the searchlight did not penetrate here and the only illumination was re flected from the wall outside the one window not a person was in the room at them die like men no quar ter muggs decided the voice of the black star came from another room down the hall again he went forward always alert expecting every instant that one of the master criminals men would run into the hall and discover him he came to another door and found it closed he stopped to listen yesâshots were being fired from that room and a searchlight flooded it too for the strong light came from beneath the door to open that door meant to face bullets perhaps and muggs did not want to do that unnecessarily until be had found riley or the black star he heard the black stars voice again âand it seemed to come from the base ment he went on along the hall and turned to the right before him a streak of bright light swept the floor the door of the next room was open crouching at the turn in the hall muggs listened and watched he knew shots were being fired from that room too and bullets were being poured into it by the police some of them came through the door and crashed into the wall he heard the black stars voice again and turned back it would avail little muggs knew to clash with some of the master crooks men a single shot might strike him down and his effort would have been in vain he wondered where riley was being kept he wondered where the black star could be found he didnt want to go out without either trying to help riley or getting the black star if riley had met with foul play back along the hall he went listening for sounds that would tell him how to meet the black star or his men to best advantage he came to another flight of steps and went down them the master criminals voice came to him again and muggs could distinguish from which direction now once more in the lower hall he turned to the left and crept along the wall the voice was louder more distinct die game no quarter thats the boys muggs hurried on in the distance he saw a faint streak of light when he got nearer he saw that it came from the side of a door here was a time for extreme caution and muggs used it he stopped again to listen the rat tling of revolver shots continued and the voice of the black star rose above the din muggs crept forward to the door the black star was in that room a sudden entranceâand muggs might get him covered and at the first move he would shoot hed be quicker than riley had been hed be watching for detective story magazine treachery even if they got him hed get the black star first now he was beside the door the crack at the side through which the light came was wide enough to give a man a glance at the rooms interior muggs put an eye to the crack he recognized the room instantlyâ for it was the headquarters room he saw detective riley bound and gagged stretched on the couch in the corner tossing from side to side the lamp without a chimney was smoking on the table casting its uncertain light but it gave light enough for muggs to see around the room and as he looked he gasped in astonishment outside by the gate roger verbeck was raging at the chief and the mayor once more a searchlight bathed the doorway in brilliance the volleys of shots continued and answering shots came from the factory throngs of people were behind the police ropes two blocks away rumors were flying again âtwenty policemen had been killed the criminals were breaking out the police were going to take the place by assault the chief was holding a conference with some of his captains and plans for the assault were made the search lights would go out for an instant when a whistle was blown a score of officers would rush for the doors while the others volleyed bullets at the build ings windows the halls would be seized and the black stars men driven from room to room until they surren dered or gave intimation that they would die fighting verbeck automatic in hand braced himself for the race across to the door he intended to be one of the first inside the building the chief could not hold him back when the police rushed the orders were passed around the searchlight operators were warned there came another lull in the fighting and the chief started to raise his whistle to his lips to give the signal but a cry from one of the captains stopped him look look in the door a stick had appeared thereâa stick to the end of which was attached a white handkerchiefâa flag of truce orders to cease firing sped down the lines of police the white handker chief was waved frantically gradu ally the firing died out not a shot came from the factory the man in the doorway evidently wanted to be sure his appearance would not be greeted with a volley he con tinued to wave the handkerchief from the end of the stick not even his hand showing well the chief bellowed what do you want another moments wait and thenâ detective riley appeared in the open door as the cheers of the police greeted his appearance muggs suddenly stood beside him its all right boss he called to ver beck come on in chapter xi on the blackboard riley and muggs blocked the door way better keep every one out except a choice few riley said to the chief in a low voice you come and mr ver beckâpossibly one of the captainsâ thatll be enough something in the tone of his voice caused the chief to look at him with quick suspicion and caused roger ver beck to glance with apprehension at muggs but neither riley nor muggs gave them a sign as to what they were to expect the chief however took the hint he selected one captain to go along and ordered another to guard the door way and keep every one out of the black stars subterfuge building for the present the mayor had not been courageous enough to leave the gate flashing his electric torch riley led the way down the hall and steps and to the door of the headquarters room the others crowding after him ver beck got a chance to whisper to muggs what is it just another little trick butâ wait bossâyoull have to see it the door of the headquarters room was closed but riley threw it open and they stepped inside the chief and his captain gasped when they saw the rich furnishings but they were not new to verbeck and his glance wan dered elsewhere everything seemed the same as when he had been there be fore except there was a phonograph with a gigantic horn on the mahogany table the black starâhis menâ the chief implored none here riley answered nonsense they couldnt have escaped unless theres a tunnel of some sortâ there is no tunnel neither the black star nor any of his men has been in this building since you arrived butâ the bewildered chief gasped whyânonsense havent they been shooting at us havent we heard him screeching to his crooks riley pointed to the phonograph that is what you heard he said but the shooting let me tell it in my own way chief and well get at it quicker after i was put out by that blamed vapor gun âwhich the black star kindly ex plained to me afterwardâi came back to life to find that verbeck and muggs had been taken away i supposed naturally that they had been doped first and would be unable to find the place again since i did know the whereabouts of this place i supposed the black star intended to keep me where id not do him any harm the first thing he did was to assure me id not meet with violenceâand that ver beck soon would be back but wait chief i want you to get this straight after that the black star went ahead to explain a few things gave me the laugh took off his robe and mask put on his coat and hat and bade me adieu as cheerfully as you please that was within ten minutes after muggs and verbeck had been taken awayâand ive been the only man in this building since until muggs stumbled in here a few minutes ago nonsense the shootingâ the chief persisted oh there is an explanation of all that by the way what time is it three oclock answered the cap tain after glancing at his watch then hes done it done what the chief cried got away with a hundred thousand in gold coin he said he was going to didnt he but the shootingâ the chief could think of nothing else look at the two blackboards riley said youll find your explanation there read the one to your right first they whirled to read verbeck with sinking heart was reading it already and this was the message the black star had left to roger verbeck and any others it may concern if you are reading this it prob ably means that all my plans have been suc cessful as they are generally i have scant time and must be brief first this is not really my new headquar ters but one fitted up for this special occa sion i arranged to have verbeck or muggs abducted and carried here accidentally both were captured but that made no dif ference i allowed them to overhear certain plans knowing that afterward they would help carry them out detective story magazine detective rileys arrival was unexpected and threatened disaster but happily i gained the upper hand i will leave him here and trust he meets with no harm mr verbeck your struggle to keep from inhaling the vapor was amusing since there was no sleepproducing vapor in the gun used on you it was a harmless gas instead it was intended that you were to think you were outwitting me by remaining conscious i knew you would strive to make sure of the location of this building the same plan would have been worked with muggs had he been captured alone it was very clever of you to take the chalk and i doubt not you marked everything along your way you have departed now feigning unconsciousness and i must hurry away just a few words then to tell you what will happen now read the other blackboard riley said oh it is interesting all rightâthe crook they turned to the second black board and read you mr verbeckâand id wager my life on itâwill send an alarm to police head quarters as soon as you reach home and re gain consciousness for my man will use the real vapor gun on you before you separate âto give me time to get away you will find your way here again as soon as possible to rescue riley and catch me when you arrive youll be fired upon a disturbance will be created and police reserves sent for the firing from this building will be heavy the chief eager to catch me will call for more men youll start a siege youll batter this old build ing with bullets youll receive bullets in return youll hear my voice urging my men to die game presently youll rush inâand find this and while the town is attracted by this dis turbance and the business district left prac tically unprotected ill get my hundred thou sand in gold ill not make the attempt of course unless you do start a siege the writing ended for the black board was filled with it but the shooting the chief ex claimed again here is the rest of itâwritten on a sheet of paper riley said the black star left it on the table read this he handed it to the chief who read it aloud the phonograph is simpleâit has an elec tric connection and holds a special record made from my voice as to the volleys of shotsâand i trust no one is injured for if so it will be an acci dentâthat is simple too examine the building and fastened in the windows youll find automatics you never saw any exactly like them before they are an invention of a good friend of mine youll notice the cartridges are fed from a belt containing a hundred rounds of ammunition since there are fifteen guns that will make some shoot ing youll notice too that the guns are operated by electricity youll find wires and if you trace them they will lead you to a cheap lodging house three blocks away do not blame the lodginghouse people for they are innocent one of my men sitting in a room there has a good view of the factory he touches a button and a gun is fired he plays a keyboard and you get a volley another button starts or stops the phonograph and you hear me shriek encouragement to my men quite simple is it not i have been to some trouble and expense fitting up this fake headquarters but i am sure my profit will be great please be kind to the furniture i am leaving behind and tell yourselves again you cannot cope with the black star and now go out and explain to the news paper men what became of the band of des perate crooks you besieged in the factory it ought to make interesting reading muggs gave a snort of disgust and turned away from the table roger verbecks eyes met those of detective riley and each read determination in the others countenance the black star had evaded them again but the end was not yet and ive got to tell the newspaper men the chief exclaimed that gold âi wonder if he got itâand from where his answer came immediately a sergeant of detectives hurried to them from the hall chief he cried word just came from headquarters theres been a consulate robbed got a fortune in gold yesterday at noon to buy war stuff black stars subterfuge thought they were keeping it quiet i suppose the black star knew about it though his men robbed the vault and left the watchman on the floor bound and gagged with a black star pasted on his forehead its a hun dred thousand in gold coin consuls frantic yes said the chief wearily it seems the black star knew about it johnston mcculleyâjohn mack stone being the nom de plume under which the first two of this series of novelettes were writtenâis writing another novelette dealing with the black star and the efforts of roger verbeck to capture him you can look forward to soon having the pleasure of reading this storyâand mr mcculley says that it is his best black star story so far a new bunko game meyer clayman a blacksmith of no harrison street kansas city missouri was introduced by harry naster a butcher of no east eighteenth street to mr grossman meyer meet my friend sammie grossman hes a good boy and can make you rich grossman explained he had disposed of all his jewelry stock in st louis except nine pounds of pure gold melted into small coinshaped pieces he was willing to sell the gold for one hundred dollars a pound he said half its value because he had been called out of town hurriedly on a long trip and was afraid to take it with him clayman desired to see the gold grossman opened a shoe box he had under his arm the box was lined with cotton on which were many brightyellow disks id buy them myself if i had the money volunteered naster maybe i could get the money then clayman decided he would buy the gold now you take these samples to a jeweler and see what he says said gross man producing several disks like those in the box clayman went to a jeweler who said the samples were pure gold worth a pound clayman returned stopping at the bank to get nine hundred dollars in gold money and counted it out in grossmans palm grossman took back the samples that night clayman carried the treasure home with him i guess ill buy a motor car with the nine hundred dollars i made he said to his brother misgivings overtook clayman the next day he put the box under his arm and went hatless to his jeweler friend the jeweler began his examination then looked up with a start these are brass he said the excited clayman soon learned he had paid nine hundred dollars for a shoe box filled with the sort of brass checks used to set an electric piano to churn ing they had been gilded over naster was remorseful and volunteered to search for grossman he had known grossman three years he said and always he was a nice young man a rustic rival by sergeant ryan nick carter had just con cluded a most exciting adven ture in a manner highly satis factory to himself it had been a contest of skill against pluck and suc cess had never been sure until the very last moment by a thousand artful turns and twists of his adversary had the great detec tive been forced to do his level best but he had conquered and the victim of his prowess lay on the grass at his feet i had come up in time to witness the conclusion of the struggle the scene was a deep hole in the prettiest trout stream in monroe county pennsyl vania the time was five oclock of a may morning nick held up the sparkling prey for my admiration then suddenly he dropped the brook trout and faced about looking across the pool i followed the direction of his glance but saw nothing worthy of special at tention nor could i hear any sound but those that told of nature waking in the forest that fellow is in a great hurry said nick what fellow i asked thats a question i cant answer rejoined nick with a smile but i can make out that hes a tall man familiar with the woods has been running a long way and will hit the stream about opposite us if he keeps on as hes go ing half a minute later i was able to dis tinguish the faint sound of crackling twigs but it seemed incredible that even nicks ear could catch the separate footfalls showing the length of the stride and the labored breathing of the runner that he was a woodsman was evident to me as to nick from the lightness of his tread among the under brush and from the rapidity of his advance presently he appeared upon the other side of the pool he was a tall young man seemingly a native of those parts but certainly not a farmer he had a rather handsome and remarkably intel ligent countenance and despite his brown skin and rough attire there was a hint of the scholar about him it was evident from his expression as he looked across at us that he had come to seek us but he seemed in no hurry to announce his errand i noted that he paid little attention to me but stared at nick pointblank good morning mr carter he said at last i was considerably surprised by this recognition though my friend was known as mr carter to farmer mar vin at whose house we had spent the previous night and to a few others thereabouts i sized you up from descriptions that i got from one or two people con tinued the young man theres only one carter from new york who can shoulder marvins flatboat as if she was a birch canoe and walk off with her a rustic rival the feat to which he alluded had been performed on the afternoon be fore when we had fished in waverly pond i was not aware that anybody but myself had seen it your facts are scanty rejoined nick pleasantly but your conclusion is accurate what can i do for you the boots on the other leg re torted the young man im going to do something for you very kind of you im sure said nick what is it im going to put you on to one of the prettiest murder mysteries that ever you tackled said the young man with enthusiasm it happened last night but it wasnt discovered till this morn ing i was right there at the time and i knew what to do i said to all of em including dep uty sheriff wilson who got there al most as soon as i did dont disturb anything save it for nick carter and i made em do it too what was it that they saved asked nick there was his coat all covered with blood and the horse and wagon in the yard and the broken board over the hiding place where he kept his money andâ where who kept his money de manded nick the young man paused shame faced like a boy who had done some thing very foolish when he has tried to be especially smart he covered his embarrassment with a laugh guess im a bit rattled he said besides ive had a hard run and my breaths not as yet got back into my body ill be all right in a jiffy you come across the brookâtheres a fallen tree for a bridge just below hereâand by the time you get over ill be ready to talk nick said nothing but he started at once for the broken tree i followed him and we crossed the brook the young man was waiting for us i had already sized him up he was or fancied himself to be an ama teur detective with great talent for criminal investigation he had prob ably studied the subject as it is pre sented in fiction this crime which he had so imperfectly disclosed to us was doubtless his first opportunity for the display of his abilities and he intended to prove his merit under the eyes of the great master of detection it struck me that he was acting wisely a man of less sense would have tried to keep nick carter out of the case as long as possible in order to secure for himself the honor of de tecting the criminal the young man had fully recovered his selfcommand when we joined him after crossing the brook my name is walter fairman he said ive been teaching the school at waverly falls everybody round here knows me now for this crime i was coming along the highroad toward marvins about threequarters of an hour ago in tending to fish this stream just as i got opposite sam bennetts houseâ which is about a third of a mile the other side of marvinsâi heard a woman scream she seemed to be in bennetts stable which is built alongside his barn the barns back of the house and the stable stands out at right angles with both so that when you walk into the yard the stable faces you and the house is on the left as i came up i had noticed ben netts horse and wagon in the yard the horse was facing the stable doors which were closed it looked as if ben nett had just driven in and i wondered where he had been so early in the morn ing when i heard the scream i ran into the yard just as i did so mrs ben detective story magazine nett threw open the big doors of the stable she seemed to be a good deal stirred up about something says i whats the matter mrs bennett she looked at me sort o queer as if she didnt know what to say finally she told me that shed been robbed of course i asked her all about it she took me into the stable and showed me a hole in the floor in a corner two or three planks had been pried up and there were fresh splinters of wood showing that it had been done very re cently also the amount of breaking and splintering proved that it had been done in a hurry an ax lay on the floor near by under one of the planksâa short piece evidently cut to fit across two beams that were only about two feet apartâwas a sort of box made strongly and fastened to the beams on each side thats where sam kept his money said mrs bennett and its gone certainly there was no money in the box then i asked her if he threw it in there loose and she said no he had a small sheetiron box to hold it that had been taken away wheres mr bennett i asked hes gone away she said i dont expect him back today i thought that her manner was queer but it was a good deal stranger when she began to urge me not to say anything about what i had seen sam wouldnt like it she said besides we can catch the thief easier if we keep quiet just then who should walk in but john wilson the deputy sheriff he happened to be passing byâgoing fish ing just as i wasâand he saw the horse and wagon in the yard it seems that the horse had started while i was in the stable and had come near turn ing the wagon over wilson had run in to keep him from doing it then he had naturally looked into the stable to see who was there he heard what mrs bennett said about catching a thief and that being in his line he asked what had been stolen mrs bennett started to lie to him but she thought better of it and told him the truth while she was doing it i was tak ing a look around and what do you think i found why i found sam bennetts coat all covered with blood lying on the stable floor i didnt pick it up i just stooped down and exam ined it to make sure that the stains were really blood at the same time i saw other red marks on the floor near the coat then i managed to get wilson aside for a moment and i told him that there was something worse than robbery in the case he took a look at the coat and motioned to me to say nothing to mrs bennett youll get cold here says he to her intending to get her out of the way so that we could talk run into the house and put a shawl on she was dressed very thinly and it was rather chilly i had noticed that she was shivering when wilson told her to go in and get a shawl she went right away then he asked me what i knew about the matter and i told him bennetts been murdered said he probably he came out here early to hitch up the horse and went to his money box some tramp that had been sleeping in the barn saw him and killed him for the money well find his body hidden in the barn that theory wont work said i to him these bloodstains are several hours old besides that why did ben nett hitch up his horse with his head toward the stable doors no sir this crime was committed last evening a rustic rival bennett had just got back from some where all this time i was doing some thinking why had mrs bennett told me her husband had gone off to stay a day or two when she knew that the horse and wagon were in the yard what had she been doing in the stable how did she account for the horse being there without any driver it wasnt reasonable to suppose that she had been out anywhere in the wagon dressed as she was in short said nick you believed mrs bennett guilty of the crime no sir replied fairman with something like a chuckle id been keeping my eyes open and id seen one or two things in the first place the thief had ripped up several planks be fore hed found the right one mrs bennett knew where it was in the second place she never could have ripped up those planks it re quired a mans strength now heres the problem and i think its worthy of your genius mr carter mrs bennett lied to me she tried to keep the affair a secret her man ner was calculated to excite suspicion in anybody her story about her hus bands absence shows that she knew something had happened to him yet she didnt do the deed she screamed when she found that it had been done how do you reconcile these facts let me have a few more facts first said nick what happened after she left you and wilson several other men came by and wilson called them in they were most of them strangers who had come up here to fish wilson explained the case to them and a search of the stable was begun i didnt wait for it i didnt have the time to waste he looked knowingly at nick as he said these words i could not fathom his meaning but nick seemed to under stand i told wilson about your being here fairman continued i made him promise not to disturb things to hunt for the body but not to move it in case he found it till you arrived of course he wont find it why not i asked because it isnt there he replied with a wink at nick i was nettled to be treated in this way by a yokel yet i could not deny that he was a shrewd fellow i see your point said nick you think that the murder was committed somewhere else and that the bloody coat was put there just as a blind precisely cried fairman why should the murderer take pains to hide the body and leave the coat in plain sight theres something in that said the detective did you have any further conversation with mrs bennett no she hadnt got back from the house when i left i hurried away be cause i hoped to catch you before you left marvins that was the substance of fairmans story as it was told to us as we hurried toward the bennett house half a dozen men were talking ex citedly in the road before the house as we came up wilson was one of them others could be seen in the yard before the stable door well wilson did you find the body asked fairman as we came up no is that mr carter all eyes were turned upon the great detective thats the man said fairman with the air of one who is exhibiting a trophy im glad to see you sir said wil son walking up to nick this is a very strange affair from what this gentleman has told detective story magazine me i should judge that it is replied the detective where is mrs bennett thats the strangest part of it ex claimed wilson she has disap peared youre a smart man i dont think said fairman why did you let her get away i never thought of her going pro tested wilson its natural enough sneered fair man circumstances are against her now look here rejoined wilson warmly i dont set up to be a detec tive but i hope ive got common sense heres a woman who has lived in this community all her life and is known to be a good christian and a loving wife dont you try to tell me that she killed her husband i know her too well to believe you she had nothing to do with it then why has she run away i dont believe she has run away then whats become of her wilson threw up his hands with a gesture of utter bewilderment have you searched the house and barn asked nick weve searched everywhere re sponded wilson with something like a groan we cant find a trace of her or of sam bennetts body if youll allow me said nick ill take a look around the premises meanwhile permit me to suggest if theres any place where mrs bennett would be likely to go that you send there thats what i was about to do wilson replied these five men are going around to all the houses near here has she any relatives in the neigh borhood no she has a brother living about three miles down the road who occupied this house besides mr and mrs bennett nobody is here now they have lived alone since their daughter jennie was married about three months ago nick fairman and i walked toward the stable wilson and the other men went upon their several errands we were assured by a man named hamlin who was on guard in the stable that nothing had been disturbed ham lin was a sort of unofficial deputy of wilsons nick made a rapid general survey of the place glanced into the barn which was reached by a door from the stable and then turned his attention to the bloodstains there were some small irregular splashes on the floor and then a line of drops leading direct to the spot where the coat lay it was a muchworn garment spread flat upon the floor with the lining up ward the stains were all on the lin ing and close together they repre sented a considerable quantity of blood as nick rose from beside the coat i saw a peculiar smile upon his face heres something that will interest you he said to fairman between his thumb and finger he held half a dozen short gray hairs that fits my theory exactly cried fairman bennetts head has rested on that coat his hair was gray and he wore it about that length he must have been killed by a blow on the head and then this coat was wrapped around the fatal wound to prevent the blood from staining something else my belief is that the body was car ried in that wagon from the place where the crime was committed to the place where the murderer has concealed the corpse then probably the horse was turned loose and wandered here there is evidence in support of that last view said nick i suppose your sharp eyes noted the wagon tracks in the street and in the yard a rustic rival you bet i noticed them right away replied fairman with an em phatic nod the tracks show that the wagon must have grazed one of the gateposts and that the horse had strayed about the yard before coming to a halt i can swear that there was nobody in the wagon when it came into this yard as to the crime having been com mitted elsewhere said nick what do you say to this he pointed to a broken bottle on the floor it had been a large and heavy bottle the bottom of it and a few fragments lay near those bloodstains which were farthest from the coat the neck of the bottle was some distance away in a corner nick picked up the bottom of the bottle and showed a faint stain of blood upon a ragged edge of the glass fairman was staggered it looks as if he had been knocked down with that bottle he admitted perhaps i was wrong in that case the body was certainly carried away in the wagon you noticed that a piece had been torn out of the lining of the coat yes but that might have been done long ago i do not think so said nick and he proceeded to tear out another piece the first had been a strip about two inches wide and a foot long nick put into his pocket that which he had torn off the murderer probably used that to wipe his hands on commented fair man nick made no reply he was scan ning the stable floor closely at last he walked toward a small and rough door which opened from the rear of the stable here are more bloodstains he said we approached just as nick opened the door there were stains upon the threshold though they were very faint scarcely perceptible in fact the prin cipal one was nearly round and some what smaller than a watch lets see what we can find in this direction said nick leading the way into a little garden behind the stable here are a mans tracks exclaimed fairman theyre not bennetts theyre too small he had enormous feet youll find several mens tracks if you look closely remarked nick the searching party seems to have been out here there was a path leading toward a field the ground was very soft and footprints could be easily traced there was one line of them that was plainly visible it led along the path i made out that he who had made those footprints had been running rapidly considering the ease with which they could be seen i was surprised to ob serve the extreme caution with which nick proceeded after he had gone about fifty yards however he went on with more confi dence we passed into the field which was partly overgrown with grass and partly bare crossing this we came to a fringe of trees here nick made quite an ex tended search he went down to the bank of a brook which flowed beyond the trees and i followed him but i saw no tracks there then we returned and presently nick found what he was seeking it was a box made of tinned iron there had been a padlock on it but it had been wrenched away the box was empty youve tracked the thief said fair man in envious admiration thats bennetts cash box beyond a doubt nick said nothing he began to walk rapidly back toward the stable when he reached the little door he paused for a moment and naturally fairman and i came to a halt the schoolmaster turned about and set his detective story magazine back against the stable then he sprang away uttering a loud cry and point ing to the field i looked and saw a woman running just as my eye lighted upon her she dodged behind some bushes on the edge of the garden its mrs bennett cried fairman shes coming back dont let her know that you saw her said nick and he drew us into the stable we watched cautiously from a win dow the woman approached the house shielding herself from observa tion as well as she could no one saw her but us she passed on the other side of the barn we walked hurriedly through the stable crossed the yard and entered the kitchen of the house just as she came in by a door on the opposite side the room was an l and occupied the full width of it good morning mrs bennett said nick where have you been well thats cool she rejoined if its any of your business ive been down to the barn looking out for the cows you dont seem to take much inter est in this robbery why should i well never see the money again its gone and theres the end of it some of those pesky tramps have stolen it i should think the law might do something to protect us from those critters where is your husband i dunno hes gone off somewhere hell be back in a day or two who hitched up your horse this morning the tramp i reckon he probably intended to steal him but was fright ened away i heard the horse in the yard and went out to take care of him mrs bennett said fairman break ing in why do you act in this way a crime has been committed and you seem disposed to shield the criminal dont you know that we have reason to believe that your husband has met with foul play you mean hes been murdered she cried fairman bowed his head i dont believe it she exclaimed and then falling into a chair she buried her face in her hands while her frame shook as with sobs at first i pitied her but on closer inspection i decided that she was only pretending to cry the womans heartlessness shocked me that she was an accomplice in the crime was to me a matter of certainty her clumsy efforts to account for her husbands absence and her absurd as sumption of the manner of an innocent person ignorant of the facts would have excited my pity if the enormity of her crime had not made them abhor rent i tried to question her but she would not speak nothing could induce her to move from that chair or to take her hands from her face nick paid no attention to the woman im going over to the railroad sta tion said he to me i want to send telegrams to the surrounding towns giving a description of the criminal with directions for his arrest a description i cried how can you give that i can furnish one that is infallible said nick with a smile there was something in his foot prints nick shook his head i never saw any that were more commonplace then im all at sea fairmans face took on a strange ex pression made up of surprise disap pointment and a dozen other emotions he followed nick to the door you have learned about martin a rustic rival heywood he said in a low anxious voice never heard of him said nick who is he this womans brother and the prin cipal in this crime beyond a doubt dont try to deceive me you are on his track i may be said nick but upon my word i didnt know it didnt know it no what makes you think hes the man hes bennetts only enemy there was a lawsuit everybody around here knows that bennetts testimony would have cost heywood ninetenths of all hes worth he had testified once against his brotherinlaw and hey wood threatened to kill him then the case went against heywood but on appeal a new trial was ordered the case was to be called tomorrow wilson had the summons for ben nett in his pocket he wasnt going fishing he was coming here to serve it rather early in the morning said nick yes wilson was afraid bennett would evade it as a matter of fact he was afraid for his life if he testi fied and you think that heywood killed him to suppress his testimony yes is there any other explanation of this womans conduct she knows her brother did the deed shes trying to shield him thats a promising theory said nick suppose you go to heywoods house and try to work it up while i go and send my telegrams telegrams do you think hey wood has run away i dont know anything about it fairman was puzzled but not more than i was you seem to be guessing said the schoolmaster at last you discover evidence accidentally ive heard a good deal about your luck and now i believe it ill tell you one piece of evidence that youve turned up theres a way to heywoods house along that brook where you found the box what do you think of that its quite interesting said nick i suppose mrs bennett ran away to see her brother of course very natural nick nodded an adieu to fairman and walked away in the direction of the railroad station i followed him as we went down the road we saw fairman going the other way probably toward heywoods there was nobody to watch mrs bennett unless the men who loitered about the stable yard could see her through the windows nick sent his telegrams and we spent the forenoon waiting around the station for replies none had come at twelve oclock we decided to go to farmer marvins for dinner crossed the railroad tracks and struck into the road when sud denly nick went down upon his knees and closely examined the ground i had no doubt that he had recog nized a footprint but none was visible to me nick was surely on the trail he followed it back to the railroad then up the path beside the tracks until at last he stopped beside some freight cars that were stalled there after several efforts he opened the door of one of them as he did so i noticed a faint mark of blood on the wood just under the door the light that struck into the car shone full into the face of a frowzy tramp who sat on a sackful of mer chandise and stared stupidly at us his hand rested upon the head of the most miserable dog that ever i saw the animal was a mongrel of a thou sand low breeds at once it had suf detective story magazine fered in its wanderings even more than its master i observed with pity that the creature was lean with hunger and that one of its feet had been badly hurt and was bandaged it offered a feeble resistanceâthe best of which the faithful brute was capableâwhen nick sprang into the car and laid his hand on the mans shoul der you are under arrest was all the detective said the tramp swore a round oath but he made no resistance he took the wretched dog in his arms and tenderly carried it out of the car once upon the ground the dog ran well enough with three legs there was a rude hotel opposite the station nick put the tramp and the dog into a room there set the landlord to guard them and called to me to fol low we have the criminal now he said its time to look for the body of the victim and for the money said i the tramp had none when you searched him we shall find that too rejoined nick as we walked along i plied him with questions about the proof against the man whom he had arrested all i could get out of him was the somewhat irrele vant remark that he had a right to make an arrest for wilson had au thorized him to act as a deputy we came at last to a very nice house nearly two miles beyond the station to my surprise we found fairman at the gate what does heywood say asked nick so that was heywoods house i had not known it before he wont talk replied fairman but his manner is conclusive that man is guilty heywood appeared at this moment this is all foolishness about sam bennett being murdered he said and as for my having anything to do with it thats worse yet ive got nothing agin bennett since when have you been recon ciled demanded nick the man bit his lip but did not answer now mr heywood said nick look right down in the dirt at your feet and you will see the track of mr bennetts wagon made last evening he came over to see you and in my opinion hes here yet im going to search your house heywood groaned youve got the authority have you nick nodded of course it was a bluff heywood turned toward the house sam he yelled come out here theres no use of staying in there any longer presently the elongated form of samuel bennett appeared at the door well i swear ejaculated fair man good day mr bennett said nick i was told that you were murdered but i didnt believe it im not yet sure whether youve been robbed no i hant lost nothin growled bennett i took all my money outn that hidin place last evening id seen a tramp critter hanging round my barn and i was afeared he was in the barn when you hitched up your horse last night said nick he watched you through a knot hole in the door between the barn and the stable i saw the prints of his muddy boots on the floor he had to stand on tiptoe to see through the hole and he supported himself by partly gripping a dusty beam over the door he saw you when you went to your bank but he didnt know that you took your money out after you were gone a rustic rival he ripped up the floor and stole the empty box meanwhile his dog stepped on a piece of an old bottle and cut his foot then he limped over to your coat and lay down on it while he nursed his wound the bloodstains led to the theory that you had been murdered our friend mr fairman was impolite enough to say that some of the dogs hair looked very much like yours after a study of the case i sent some telegrams requesting the police of neighboring towns to arrest a tramp with a threelegged dog i subsequently arrested him myself i also recovered your box by following the trail of three legs out of fourâfor i knew of course that the dog was so badly hurt that he would hold up one of his feet your wifes disappearance this morning and her subsequent demeanor could be explained only on the theory that she had come over here to see you and had found you all right there fore i came to seek you here i sup pose she persuaded you not to testify against her brother and that you in tended to hide at his house to avoid service of the summons am i right yes blast you said bennett and the horse queried nick did he run away yes confound him i had just hitched him up this morning intending to take him back before it was light when he bolted i went after him but lost the track and when i at last got in sight of the house there were a lot of people around and i didnt dare to go in nick turned to fairman im obliged to you for a pleasant and novel experience he said will you join us on our fishing trip this afternoon no growled fairman im going home to kick myself loses his false teeth while in jail the whole cheyenne wyoming police force moved by compassion and urged on by apprehension that the owner will starve to death in the meanwhile is searching for a set of false teeth the property of w kennedy of johnsons colorado who is reported to be living on bread and milk while the search is in progress the teeth were lost by kennedy while he was in the city jail following an incursion into wet cheyenne from dry colorado and kennedy complains that he hasnt the price of a new set he relates his woe in the following letter to chief of police embery chief doubtless you remember me and doubtless you dont but im the guy what lost a pair of false teeth while i was in your bull pen i didnt know that i had lost them until i got home and started on steak and potatoes now i wont be able to eat until i get them or part with ten dollars which i havent got yours in pain w kennedy johnsons colo chief embery has had the jail searched and has instructed the police to search all other inmates of the jail at the time kennedy was a prisoner there that they may be able to locate the teeth but no trace of them has been found a ds the captive soul by h ellis davis i had arrived the day before for some late fishing but as the weather was raw and gusty i re mained inside my little oneroom lodge and sorted tackle i had built this camp several years before and two or three times each year i came here to fish or hunt ducks it was two miles up the winding bayou from the mississippi sound and stood on a little eminence surrounded by scrub oak with the somber swamp stretching away at its back it was perhaps a dreary lonesome spot but to me a busy practicing physician of new orleans the days spent here alone relaxing my mind exercising my body were welcomed periods of rest on this trip i had promised myself i would do something i had wanted to do for a long timeâvisit an old savant a doctor hetzel who lived across the sound on gull island from the mouth of my bayou his big white house which except for one servant he oc cupied alone could be plainly seen on the western extremity of the island a mere strip of sand running for miles along the outer edge of the sound living the life of a recluse hetzel was hard to approach but i had read several of his books with interest and had a desire to meet their author those on vivisection especially were written with a boldness and finish far beyond anything by his contemporaries showing throughout where a fixed end was to be reached the ruthless fanati cism of the true teuton wealthy seclusive a mysterious family of scientists the hetzels had lived on gull island since beyond the memory of the oldest natives and this old man was the last of his line tradi tion had it that out of the east had come a great ship with the first of them and the material for the big stone house and back into the east it had gone never to return as the dusky twilight began to creep into the room and i bent lower and lower over my work suddenly without hail or knock the door opened and a man enteredâa man stooped white locked wrinkled trying to show no surprise at his sudden appearance as i was seated on the floor i pushed a chair toward him with my foot and invited him to sit down listlessly he sank into the chair and sat there in the half light regarding me with an expressionless stare his lips forming words and moving without sound as is often the case with very old people at last he spoke and i was surprised to find his voice clear and strong with scarcely a quaver doctor tyson who i am makes no difference but what i am about to re late if i can force myself into the tell ing will shock the entire civilized world rising nervously from his chair he several times paced the length of the room then but i cannot shake from my mind the doubt cannot remain decided whether or not i should tell you and let the world take its action in the matter the captive soul i am going mad yes i fully re alize now that my reason is leaving me the doubt the horrible doubt in flicts a greater strain than the mind of any man can withstand i cannot de cide whether i should divulge what i know and tell the world where to find the proof of my statement or remain silent but when i am wholly de mented when i am confined to a room with a keeper then my uncontrolled babblings will disclose my secret but who would consider the wild raging of a madman then another uncertainty is mad ness itself the uncertainty as to whether i should have killed himâthat sorcerer who by the black art of sci ence can hold forever captive the souls of men and women the man had now worked himself into a frenzy and the palsied hand clawed again and again at the white locks straggling over the shrunken leathery brow becoming somewhat alarmed i said sharply here old man calm yourself come sit down and tell me what you wish me to know he turned on me fiercely old man and how old do you think i am taken aback i did not answer and he continued i am not thirty years old a man under thirty yet my hair is as white as yours will be at eighty my body has shrunk to a mere shadow of its former bulk sleep has almost deserted me for when my tortured soul would rest i no sooner begin to sink into a happy unconsciousness than i start up with the shriek why did i not kill him or in the grip of a nervous clammy sweat gasp in horror sup pose i had already i catch myself at times mut tering my thoughts aloud and when i meet people they turn as i pass to watch me with suspicion it is not long not long before i will be a driveling senile idiotâno a shrieking maniac yet i linger within the sound of the laplap of the waves that seem to beat upon my soul for from them there ever comes a voice that holds me getting to my feet i took him firmly by the arm and pushed him back into the chair calm yourself i told him if you like it neednt go any further but you must tell me what is on your mind thats troubling you so much i might be able to help you suddenly he half leaped from his chair leaning forward toward me his bony clenched fist thrust almost into my face yes i will tell you by the heav ens i will tell you and may the re sponsibility rest where it belongs he got to his feet and advanced to ward me thrusting his face forward so that i fell back i could have killed him he hissed my hands were about his throatâand he slipped from my clutch his long fingers worked convulsively but i could have killed him almost in desperation i took him by his two hands and again made him sit down then standing in front of him still holding his hands i said to him look here if you expect to tell me your story begin at the beginning i know that some horrible thing has hap pened to you but get behind it tell me about yourself before it occurred have you always lived here if not where did you come from what did you do for a living now sit there for a minute and think it over calmly be fore you begin for a long time he was silent looking vacantly in front of him while i again took my place on the floor and resumed my interrupted work then looking forlornly down at himself he began it is hard to realize that instead of detective story magazine this bunch of ragged nerves i was once a strong man pausing he remained silent so long that i laid aside my tackle and sitting with arms clasped about my knees prompted him what was your occupation i was a lawyer practicing in mo bile the junior member of a firm of three because i had been doing a good deal of extra work and was pretty well run down the senior member persuaded me to take a weeks rest and come down here on the sound to the little village of cody with the hope of re gaining my appetite as i have always had an aversion to any large body of water i tried to beg off but he was obstinate one afternoon shortly after i had arrived while floundering about in the shallow water ankledeep in the slimy ooze that covers the bottom trying to persuade myself that i was enjoying a swim a clumsy old scow filled with a crowd of laughing boys and girls swung slowly out from the nearby wharf come and join us called a young man i had met at the hotel we are going to pole out to deep water where we can have some sureenough swim ming and diving scrambling aboard i was intro duced to the party but it was with a sinking sensation that i noticed the water growing deeper and deeper the long poles with which we were pro pelled becoming more and more sub merged as we moved slowly out then one of the girls vivian white rose from where she was crouched on the bottom and made her way to the bow as she stood there poised for a dive she seemed to me like some goddess of the waves a rub ber bathing hat above a beautiful smil ing face covered her head her body was slender and graceful the wind whipped her short skirt about strong shapely limbs for an instant her arms were raised high above her head then deep deep into the black water she plunged and i shuddered as it closed above her but in an instant she reappeared and swimming to the side of the boat where i sat held out her hand to me i helped her aboard for another dive and from then on i thought of noth ing but her devoting myself entirely to her service i did not enter the water that afternoon from that time i became her ad mirer her follower her ardent suitor she was a good sailor and often took me with her in her crazy little cat boat but the haunting fear of the water still clung to me and many times i begged her to give up sailing she just laughed however and my misgiv ings seemed only to amuse her it was now time for me to return to my work but i arranged for another month for i passionately loved this sailor girl from an upstate town and at last one moonlight night on the beach i held her in my arms and made her acknowledge that she also loved the next morning i met her as usual but soon she sailed away alone in her little boat straight out across the sound leaving me disconsolate on the end of the wharf to follow the white sail with my eyes until it became a tiny speck and then disappeared al together seeming to mingle with the rippling oily water after moping about for an hour or two i began to notice black clouds rolling and banking in the southern sky and landsman though i was i knew that one of those sudden fierce squalls was gathering and i was filled with terror frantically i tried to find a boat man who would go with me to meet vivian in case her own little boat should come to harm but each in turn a captive soul shook his head drenched by the spray madly i raced up and down the beach across which the wind had now begun whipping in fierce gusts vainly scan ning the horizon for a sight of her re turning sail all that met my straining gaze was the water now broken into choppy waves and a distant haze that was the long low outline of gull island lying on the outer edge of the sound with a tiny white spot at its western end the home of the old scientist hetzel that night a fishing smack beating her way in before the gale towed be hind her vivians little overturned boat which had been picked up near that dangerous pass between gull and pinto islands where the incoming and out going tides surge through like a mill race here as you know many lives have been lost and the victims bodies never recovered presumably having been swept out into the gulf at dawn the wind having gone down i persuaded a boatman to take me in his gasoline launch to look for vivian as she was such a strong swimmer i was in hopes that she might have swum to one of the islands when we rounded the western end of gull island and entered the pass the wind and waves hurled against our bow while the outgoing tide surged around us in a torrent suddenly with a wheezy grunt the engine died and our launch tossed around by a big wave against its bow lay in the trough of the sea a crest broke over us half filling the boat with water and it seemed about to sink with a yell to me to follow the boat man kicked off his shoes and swam di agonally across to a point on the east ern end of pinto but the old terror of the water which had been crowded out of my mind during our search now returned to grip me crouching in the bottom i screamed in an uncontrolled frenzy while the boat knocked about by wind and tide rolled and spun and crest after crest broke over me then there was a crash a dizzy up heaval and i was flung through the air to the sand the boat rolling completely over me crushing my body under it how long i lay there i do not know but it must have been hours for when at last i staggered dizzily to my feet it was growing dark casting my eyes about for some possible refuge i for the first time noticed hetzels house a great white pile without a light show ing set back among dwarf pine and scrub oak stumbling up the beach to ward the house i became aware that my wavering course was crossing and recrossing footsteps in the sand that led in the same direction i stopped to examine them then dropped to my hands and knees to get a better look for the sand left firm and hard by the late rain held a good im pression and showed the maker of the footsteps to have been a boy or woman wearing canvas bathing shoes such as i knew vivian to have worn rising again to my feet i began following the tracks back in the direction from which they had come they led down to the beach turned up it for a hundred yards then abruptly turning again they led straight down into the water as if the one walking there had come up out of the sea for a while i stood looking out over the dark water trying to grasp the full significance of what i had discov ered for if vivian had swum ashore she would have waded out of the shal low water and turned in the direction of the only shelter that presented itself hetzels house running back to where i had first discovered the footprints i began to follow them only soon to lose them among the grass and shrubbery but so obviously were they leading to the house that i did not pause and as i detective story magazine neared the front entrance increased my pace again to a run with no surrounding grounds the house was built on the sands of this bleak little island and was occupied only by hetzel and the old man who attended his wants giving no thought to the mystery with which superstition enshrouded the place i raced up the steps and rapped loudly on the front door but my knock was answered only by hollow echoes within and i re peated it several times each time harder and more insistent baffled i caught the knob and gave the door a vigorous shake it was securely locked going to one of the oldfashioned blinds in front of a window reaching to the floor i tried to insert my hand between the slats and unfasten the latch not being able to do this i de liberately kicked loose two of the little pieces for i was obsessed with the idea that vivian was in the house and to find it closed against me only made me the more determined to enter with the shutter open i quickly raised the window and passed into the room here all was in darkness and as the matches in my pocket wrere soaked and useless i began groping about for the mantelshelf with the hope of finding some there at last tread ing on the hearth beneath i found the shelf and my searching fingers soon encountered a candlestick about which lay several matches with the candle held high the little blaze flickering above my head i in spected the room which was evidently the library as row upon row of sci entific works lined the walls going to a door that stood open at one end and peering out into what seemed to be the hall i looked intently to the right then to the left unable to fathom the heavy darkness beyond the feeble rays of my candle i stepped gingerly forth to the left toward the front of the house something sprawled on the floor and in dread i shrank back until i could no longer see its outline and stood panting with nervousness then calming myself and deciding that the object could be nothing more than a rug i resolutely advanced to inspect it at closer range it was a manâstiff cold dead he lay on his back and seemed to have died in the grip of some anguishing physical struggle for his eyes pro truded and his tongue stuck out be tween the bluish lips his shirt had been torn open at the collar and stoop ing lower i could see that his stringy throat had been pierced by what i at first took to be some sharp instrument there were two small holes on each side from which a little blood had oozed and dried on the chalky skin then it dawned on me that the wounds must have been inflicted by some ani mal the mans throat had evidently been gripped in powerful jaws that had strangled him to death with an apprehensive glance about me i turned from that thing on the floor and went back into the library where i remembered to have seen on a flat desk a daggerlike paper knife of brass which might prove handy as a weapon for horrorstruck though i was though i longed to flee from the accursed place i still felt that vivian had come here and knew now that i must find her that thing in the hall was all that remained of the old butler where was his master where was vivian taking in my left hand the candle and a box of matches i had found on the desk firmly grasping the weapon in my right i again entered the hall this time turning toward the rear of the house the darkness was filled with terrors each instant it seemed that some weird monster of the gloomy house would spring upon me from the obscurity ahead once a chair di rectly in my path took a sinister shape the captive soul and appeared to be rearing at me i turned and fled stopping only when the light went out and i could no longer see to run but i relit the candle and again turned to my search for i had now reached that desperate stage where an animal even a cowardly animal when absolutely cornered will fight till the last breath leaves its body following the hall to its lower end i found another running to the right as i turned down this i suddenly stopped my blood freezing in my veins in the darkness ahead glowing in the candlelight shone a pair of eyes then with a rumbling snarl a great object came hurtling toward me calling on heaven to help me i waited the knife raised above my head the creature struck me heavily in the chest hurling me backward to the floor and the candle flew wildly leav ing me in utter darkness but even as i fell with all my might i struck landed solidly and the knife was wrenched downward and out of my hand for a while i lay where i had fallen half stunned instinctively covering my throat with my hands expecting each moment to feel the hot breath on my face the horrible fangs biting into my flesh then i became aware of a scuf fling sound a few heavy deepdrawn breaths a gurgling rattling cough and all was still at last on hands and knees i be gan groping for the matches which had been flung out of my hand with the candle once i touched something hairy and warm and shrank back my hands held before me to ward off an attack when my search was re warded i struck a light dreading what it might show me on the floor weltering in its blood the knife still sticking in its throat lay an enormous dog a powerful savage murderous brute drawing out the bloody knife i proceeded down the hall to the other end where i found a heavy door standing ajar my light fell through the opening on a small land ing with a flight of steps to the left descending into the darkness as i shoved the door farther open to pass through it resisted an unseen hand seemed to be there pushing against me determined to fight my way if necessary i threw forward my weight shoving the door wide and as i did so kicked a soft object from un der my feet down the steps i found that a strong spring was what had been shoving against me and as i released it the door slammed to with the click of a latch evidently having been kept from shutting by the thing over which i had stumbled trying the door to make sure that i could open it again when necessary i descended the steps which led down about ten feet and stooped to examine whatever it was over which i had stum bled it was an old oilskin hatâvivi ans this was the first positive evi dence i had found that she had been here and i do not know whether my feeling was one of relief or of horror i now found myself in an under ground passage paved with cement and my footsteps echoed noisily as i pushed on into the blackness of the gloomy way then right at me before i noticed it i saw something that made me start back with such violence that my candle flickered ominously a bare human foot sole turned toward me toes widely spread was what my bulging eyes saw and the leg to this footâthat was all pressed against the wall i was cir cling the ghastly fragment keeping as far from it as possible abruptly how ever i turned and bent above it could it beâ was itâ but i drove the horrible thought from my mind and hurried on down the passage at length i reached a door at what seemed to be its end this was un locked and i pushed it open to find my detective story magazine self in an enormous laboratory great containers filled with chemicals lined the shelves and stood on tables many curiouslooking machines for making tests sat about a brilliant flood of arti ficial light made the room as bright as day for a moment i paused amazed at the strange scene in such an outof theway place then cautiously si lently i began to cross the room although this was very large on account of the stands and tables hold ing apparatus with here and there a small revolving bookcase i could see only a few feet in any direction it looked like the accumulation of ages then i came on a cleared space and what seemed to be a workbench or operating table more likely for a num ber of surgical instruments lay scat tered about as i looked around me my eyes suddenly encountered a sight that petrified me where i stood still even in the grip of that awful shock i tried to calm myself tried to reason that it was some wonderful work of art on which i looked some master i argued had wrought this marvel ously lifelike appearance so far beyond anything i would have imagined could be fashioned by the hand of man held by a pedestal four or five feet high supported by a slender neck of wonderful beauty and symmetry which rose from a base of ivory was a head the face delicately tinted was perfect in contour slightly oval but with a pro portionate distance between chin and brow the lips were a scarlet bow full sensuous appealing the nose was perfect long lashes resting on the cheeks of delicate pink hid eyes whose slumbrous depths could only be imag ined the hair dark soft lustrous abundant arranged at the back of the head with little tendrils falling over the ears formed a fit setting for the radiant beauty of the face it was the head of vivian white slowly almost imperceptibly the dark lashes lifted disclosing eyes of limpid night eyes from which a soul looked out speaking to me in accents of comfort and peace as i groveled there on the floor a smile sweet tender solicitous appealing passed over the face and was gone the eyes slowly closed as if unable to resist the desire to sleep to some extent the look the mes sage from those beautiful eyes calmed me kneeling there speechless numb my brain in a whirl totally unable to comprehend what i saw i yet began to realize in a way what had happened âthe operating table the surgical in struments at a slight sound i turned to find hetzel at my elbow he showed no surprise and even greeted me with a smile smiling and bowing and rub bing his hands together there before me i recognized him for what he was and into my halfcrazed brain came the impulsive desire to kill i know that i snarled like an angry dog and as i had dropped my knife for lack of a better weapon i caught up a heavy stone crock which was on a table beside me and in another moment would have knocked out his brains where he stood with a gesture however he stopped me hold on young man he said without showing the slightest trace of alarm i have something to tell you sit down taking his seat on a stool he mo tioned me to a chair the cool indiffer ence of the man making it impossible for me to carry out my sanguinary pur pose or there might have been a half formed idea there was something for him to sayâsomething he could say or he might have thrown some spell over me at any rate i sat down and after a slight pause he began you have just made a discovery that fills you with horrorâthe more so because you cannot comprehend its sig the captive soul nificance i will explain to you what has happened to miss white the name of elie metchnikoff is perhaps familiar to you for he is the greatest man in his field todayâex cept myself to prove out a certain line of theories my grandfather began work in this laboratory more than a hundred years ago he left the work to be finished by my father who after years of labor passed it still uncom pleted on to me so that more than a century of incessant toil and study has been the work necessary to produce re sults that i have reached where metchnikoff is today i ar rived twenty years ago metchnikoff has said that under certain conditions man can live forever he is right but âhe has never yet found those condi tions he is on the right track his theories are all sound however his greatest opponent is man himself metchnikoff has found that life is made difficult in the animal body and finally ended by certain protoplasmic cells and the place where these bac teria get in their best work is in the in testinal tract the obvious remedy therefore is to introduce something that will destroy this deathproducing enemy and with the discovery of the microbe glycobacterium the problem appeared solved so it isâif this mi crobe can be kept alive in sufficient quantities but to do this it must be fed the right food and to feed it you must first feed the man in whose intes tine it is living that is the task that can never be accomplished for unfortunately man is so constituted that he is a slave to his appetites what man do you think unless he was put in a cage and fed like a beast would maintain a life long diet of the required kind i have solved the problem in the only logical way he went to the stand that supported vivians head it has been demonstrated that when the animal stops breathing the tissues of the body do not always die but that provided with the proper me dium they can be kept indefinitely alive this baseâindicating that from which the neck aroseâis filled with a liquid that will feed the tissues of the head forever with all the food necessary for healthy reproduction she is the fifth person to whom i have given everlast ing life and i find that rid of the en cumbrance of a body the brain is clearer and more capable of concen trated thought after i have made my discoveries known to the world it will be only a question of time when people will live to a certain age under normal conditions then have the body re moved and the real being consisting of or closely allied to the brain will con tinue to live and the great work of the world will be carried on by these clear brained thinkers miss white will remain in a state of coma for perhaps a week come i will show you the other people i have with me yes i actually sat and listened to that fiend that archvivisectionist as he expounded his hellish theories indeed such was my state of mind that at his invitation i arose and followed him into an adjoining room there we found the heads of four men and women each mounted on its pedestal to my further astonishment if that is the word to express the mental shock i had sustained they were con versing in low wellmodulated voices as i entered an old graybeard looked at me sadly and said in a firm clear voice as though speaking to the others another who will be denied the peace of death strange but the significance of his remark did not strike me and still in a kind of daze i followed hetzel back into the laboratory the scientist who was in advance said detective story magazine this way i wish to show you something more he turned from sight around a great bookcase and i was just about to follow when something and it seemed the voice of vivian told me look above you following the voice or impulse from her whatever it was i looked up and was able to spring back just in time to prevent being completely enveloped in a great blanket ten feet square that came fluttering down from overhead as it was a corner struck me in the face and i staggered drunkenly my head reeling from a sickening stupe fying odor that came from its folds then in a flash it dawned on me what had just happened hetzel in tended to add me to his list of subjects the spell was broken with a spring i caught the old viper by the throat intending to throttle the life out of him but with the agility of a cat he twisted out of my grasp not to be checked in my intent to kill him in mad fury i caught up from a table a heavy piece of copper pipe and swung it aloft to crush his skull intending then to take my poor little captive soul and escape from that place of living death but with that same gestureâthe power of which i cannot explainâthat had arrested my hand before the old man stopped me kill me he said and vivian white will also perish the last in gredient is to be added to her food on the third day should this be left out within a weeks time the flesh would be gin to shrivel and dry until nothing would be left but a grinning skull and she would remain conscious as her brain would be the last to go before i perfected this last element of food i lost just seventeen subjects he laughed satanically as he said this and the weird light of fanaticism shone in his eyes as my hands fell nerveless to my sides he continued the material for my laboratory has been furnished from among those counted as lost in the treacherous pass who were but washed ashore and sought refuge in my houseâand found it ha ha ha with the diabolical laughter of that fiend ringing in my ears the pipe slipped from my limp fingers and help less i turned once more to that beau tiful face again the lashes were slowly lift ing and for an instant the soft eyes rested tenderly wistfully on me when they were again closed as though in sleep i was seized with a feeling of utter despair then something seemed to snap in my brain a great fear over came me with horror that was a frenzy of terror gripping my heart i turned and fledâfled shrieking from the place it had now grown quite dark in the room so that objects were discernible only in outline by the reflection from the windows after a pause my vis itor suddenly leaned forward his face thrust close to mine the soul of her whom i love is there now a captive in that chamber of hor rors tell me man of science what i should have done advise me what to do ah he said as i remained silent you have no answer for me i should have not expected it the uncertainty must remain and it is making of me a madman a madman a madman his voice died out in a shrill wail i rose and lit a lamp the light reveal ing him slouched back in his chair his haggard face more drawn than ever his eyes staring vacantly in front of him how did you escape from the island i asked at last i do not remember anything more a searching party found me the next day down on the beach beside the boat the captive soul i was unconscious at the time and knew nothing for a week i was severely bruised about the head and body where the boat had crushed me injuries un heeded in my excitement suddenly as abruptly as he had come he rose from his chair crossed the room and disappeared through the door into the dripping night by two oclock the gale had risen to a hurricane and stout as was my cabin it trembled in the grip of the wind now and then above the roar of the tempest i could hear the crash of some great pine in the flat woods to the north of me that september storm along the gulf coast was the event from which people in that region reckon time it was noon the next day before i ventured out on the flooded bayou in a canoe that i had fortunately carried indoors making my way over to cody i was astonished at the havoc that had been done by wind and water the story i had heard the night be fore had gripped me with a strong fascination that i could not shake off i tried to put my strange visitor down as unbalanced as some poor unfor tunate under a delusion but some how there was such a ring of the gen uine in what he had told me something in his description of the scientist so like what i imagined hetzel to be that i felt in spite of my desire to discredit the whole thing the mans statement warranted an investigation i tried to find some one in cody from whom i could make inquiries but all were in dire distress and confusion with scant heed for anything but their own troubles many houses had been wrecked several lives had been lost and everybody was more or less un comfortable and miserable at last i came on a little group at the waters edge gazing off across the sound and taking turns at peering through a pair of glasses what is it i asked hetzels place is gone replied one of them that whole end of the island is washed away here take a look finger prints again prove value two brothers twins as alike in appearance as two peas in a pod have been discovered in the rogues gallery records to be serving separate sentences of five years for burglaries committed in los angeles when the pictures of the brothers reached adolph juhl head of the police identification bureau in san francisco california it was thought at first that the prison records were in error that through some slip two records had been sent out for the same man juhl immediately wired to the officials at san quentin and folsom asking for the finger prints of mesak kartangen which is the name claimed by both men and it was only when the prints were examined under the glass that it was found that there were two separate and distinct mesak kartangens the men have prison records in various parts of the country and both are graduates of reformatories one was convicted march and the other march th of this year they are twentytwo years old snarled identities by douglas grey chapter xl flint outlines his campaign in a moment doctor lord and the nurse were back at the patients side i must ask you gentlemen to go the physician said crisply this has been too much for him as it is and any further excitement might cause serious complications if nothing worse there was nothing for it but to with draw and to hope that the effect of the interview would not be as serious as the doctor suggested fortunately the detective instinct had been strong in cray notwithstand ing his condition and he had covered the ground pretty thoroughlyâsurpris ingly so in view of the few words he had spoken his statement about the suit case and his description of the car might prove particularly valuable flint took pains to interview simp son his wife and the servant before leaving the house and then paid a visit to the garage he smiled as he noted the subterfuge of the underground gasoline tank quite clever on the surface he re marked but simpson seems to be a queer mixture he impresses you at one time with his cleverness at another with stupidity i dont see anything stupid about this griswold objected it strikes me as very ingenious it permitted him to dig up the ground to his hearts con tent without arousing suspicion true conceded the detective the ordinary person would have seen noth ing strange about it but doesnt the presence of a gasoline tank under ground or any other kind strike you as a little peculiar when a man owns an electric the millionaire looked very sheepish im afraid i must plead guilty to stupidity as well he confessed that didnt occur to me and i doubt if it ever would the two detectives made a thorough examination of the little garage the ground about it and the pile of lumber as well as the road at the rear they found some finger prints and photographed them carefully after bringing out other details by artificial means they were inclined to believe that some of them belonged to gordon and if so their discovery would prove valuable beyond that however they learned little well we had better part company here judson flint told his assistant im going to let you pick up the trail of the electric car and follow it if you can see if you can locate the machine probably it has been abandoned long before this for it would have to be re charged before it could go very far doubtless green eye remembered that and deserted it before such attention was necessary still if you can find where he dispensed with it you can get a clew to his subsequent movements especially as he was burdened with a couple of very heavy suit cases consider me on the job was jud snarled identities sons ready reply ill start work right away and keep going as long as the going is good how about you though what are you going to tackle i shall return home at once flint replied and go through the safe i must find out which records are miss ing and when i have learned that i ought to be able to catch the rascal sooner or later you mean that hell be sure to visit some of the people interested or write to them and that you can nab him in that way his assistant asked thats the idea if green eye hasnt learned of our returnâand i sin cerely hope he hasntâhe wont lose much time in getting to work at the blackmailing business and you may be sure hell choose some of the most tempting of the local people for his first victims judson held up his hand i get you he said thats just what will happen unless hes scared off and hell work quickly for fear you may return earlier than you had ex pected and get wind of the whole thing alongside of that my job seems pretty punk but you are the general your job is a necessary one and we may need all the dope on green eyes movements that we can get flint told him very shortly afterward they sep arated judson remaining behind while flint and the millionaire reentered the car and started back to the city very little was said on the latters journey to be sure griswold seemed willing enough to keep the conversa tional ball rolling but he soon found that flint was of a different mind he was glad therefore when the detec tives house was reached and flint stepped out of the machine after in structing the chauffeur to take griswold wherever he wished to go you think you can catch him then the millionaire asked in parting flint gave him a strange look if i fail in this ill shut up shop the detective replied it was said rather lightly but gris wold was a shrewd student of charac ter and knew that the famous nemesis of criminals was in deadly earnest chapter xli waiting for a nibble thorndyke flint hardly knew what to do about the members of his household they had not yet been informed of the way in which they had been taken in and it was difficult to de cide whether they should be or not after some reflection however the de tective decided to say nothing about it for the present they accepted his presence as a mat ter of course just as they had done in the case of the impostor and if he told them the truth they would be plunged into a state bordering on panic moreover if gordon should take a notion to return to the house after such a revelation it would be almost impossible for the butler housekeeper and the rest to be their natural selves in his presence if they betrayed their knowledge they might scare him off just when flint wished him to be most at his ease flint entered his study and after walking up and down for a few min utes seated himself in his desk chair there was a tenseness about his look and every movement he made he was like a perfectly trained athlete crouched for a start of some recordbreaking dash the famous detective was well ac quainted with danger and to risk his life was an easy matter of everyday occurrence he took up the most seri ous and dangerous cases without a thought of the possible consequences to himself here however was some thing different detective story magazine this came nearer home perhaps than anything else had ever done for through him the honor and peace of mind of numbers of personsâconspic uous targets all of themâwere threat ened too late the detective recognized that his reputation was not enough to pro tect his house and his private safe from violence and that he had no right to keep such records there they should all be in a safedeposit vault the reports of his ordinary cases might continue to be kept in his steel filing cabinets where they were avail able for ready reference and those con cerning persons of wealth and position âmen and women who were tempting prey and whose secrets if revealed in the newspapers would cause a wide spread sensationâmust be better pro tected in future that however would not help the present situation which flint was now forced to face he actually shrank from going over the disarranged papers which green eye had left behind but after a little delay he forced himself to open the safe empty the remaining pigeonholes et cetera and dump their contents on the desk that done he sat himself down and went to work fortunately there was a compara tively small number of papers of that description in the safe therefore it did not take very long to go through them and check off those which remainedâ for the methodical detective had a list of all of them in this way by a process of elimina tion flint quickly learned the ones which had been stolen and his ex pression grew grimmer than ever as he realized the shrewdness of gordons choice most of the missing papers concerned idividuals or families in and around newv york which seemed to imply that a quick cleanup was contemplated some few though involved persons farther away and these appeared to have been selected because they had of fered particularly tempting bait to the blackmailer it needed only the brief entries in the index to bring back to flints mind all of the important details of each case and he ground his teeth as he pictured the scoundrel gloating over those same details and cleverly scheming to de mand the top price for their sup pression what a haul he murmured aloud all those papers and seventyfive or eighty thousand in gold to boot if its really ernest gordon with whom we have to dealâand im morally cer tain it isâhe must be drunk with joy for he has made blackmailing an art and he could not ask anything bigger or more promising of that sort in his calmer moments though he must re alize that he wont have the chance to hold up many of these people doesnt he know that the first man he approaches will in all probability come running to me to demand an ex planation if nothing more and hasnt it occurred to him that i would receive an urgent summons home under such circumstances well if it has hell see all the more reason for striking while the iron is hot he had put the papers away tem porarily intending to find a safer place for them at the earliest opportunity when the butler entered the study with a telegram it proved to be from the warden at clinton prison and was a long oneâsent collect of course it contained certain new and sig nificant though minor details concern ing the supposed death of green eye gordon and the escape of the yegg from buffalo which served to confirm flints suspicions but the most striking thing about the message was the tone of it it appeared from the latter that snarled identities snarled identities the warden had been doubtful or was doubtful now concerning the identity of the man who had been burned he did not say so of course but flint could read doubt between the lines obviously the identification had been a very careless one or else the prison authorities had deliberately winked at the misleading statements which had found their way into the newspapers very likely they took it for granted at first that the partially burned body was that of gordon and afterward pre ferred to hush the thing up rather than let it be known that there was any rea son to believe that the redoubtable green eye had escaped well that settles it i think for all practical purposes the detective told himself crays identification was a very hasty one made under very unfa vorable circumstances but when its taken in connection with this trans parent telegram and especially in con nection with the nature daring and adroitness of the crime itself it seems safe enough to conclude that ernest gordon is the man i must look forâ and find which would be the best course though to warn those who might be expected to be approached by the crim inal or to wait until they came to the detective after some thought flint decided on the latter course naturally he did not wish that every one concerned should know what had happened for that seemed unnecessary he believed that gordon would concentrate on a few in tended victims at first and if the de tective could discover who those per sons were he ought to be able to trap the rascal without allowing the others to know what had threatened them it was his confident belief that prac tically every one who might be visited or written to by the blackmailer would try to get in touch with himâflintâ at once that made him willing to play this waiting gameâat least for a time the first one who communicates with me he thought should give me a line on the fellows methods and plans no one is likely to yield to his demands on the spot and if i can learn of a proposed rendezvous or two the rest should be fairly plain sailingâun less the scoundrel learns of my return and plays dead for a while he had reached this point in his mus ings when he heard a furious ring at the doorbell possibly thats the first of the vic tims now he thought if it is i must prepare myself for some more or less wellgrounded reproaches i can stand them though if in addition im put on the track of the man i want to lay my hands on more than i ever wanted to lay them on any one else chapter xlii the first victim shortly afterward the butler knocked at the study door and opened it mr chester j gillespie to see you sir he announced before flint could reply or the but ler could get out of the way for that matter the young man named pushed into the room his face pale with agita tion you must help me mr flint he cried excitedly iâ he paused as flint motioned the but ler to withdraw and close the door when the servant had complied flint said quietly sit down mr gillespie im very sorry to learn that some one has at tempted to blackmail you but theres no necessity for such great haste his caller had started to take a chair but paused with his hand on the back of it and stared at flint in the greatest amazement presently a spot of angry detective story magazine red appeared in each pale cheek and his rather weak jaw was thrust out ag gressively by heaven he breathed i be lieve you are in league with the fellow ill swear i do how otherwise could you know thatâ that will be about enough of that gillespie the detective said sternly he had heard too many such accusa tions in the last few hours if you have come to me for help as your rather abrupt opening words would seem to indicate let me warn you that you are not furthering your cause by insulting me iâi beg your pardon mr flint the bewildered young man stammered i didnt mean it of course but you are positively uncanny and i could not un derstand howâ its very simple though flint told him ive been robbed of some papers unfortunately and those dealing with your case are among them naturally therefore when you rushed in in that fashion i concluded that the thief had tried to bleed you oh so that was it gillespie murmured somewhat sheepishly again however his anger and sense of injury got the upper hand then its you i have to thank for this after all he cried i supposed my secret safe with you as safe as if it were buried with me now you calmly announce that it has been stolen from you this is too much flint cant you keep your papers where they will be safe what right have you got to preserve such records anyway why dont you destroy them for the sake of your cli ents its unbearable this will be the ruin of me if florence finds out about it she will refuse to marry me andâ the detective held up his hand com mandingly and the young manâhe did not appear to be over twentyfiveâ lapsed into silence i have already told you gillespie that i profoundly regret what has hap pened you are forgetting yourself though and wasting time i already know who made away with those pa pers and with your assistance i hope to lay a trap for him that will bring his schemes to an end very quickly i think i can promise you that there will be no publicity and that nothing need inter fere with your approaching marriage now tell me precisely what has hap pened young gillespie was several times a millionaire having inherited a large for tune from his father a year or two be fore the responsibility thus involved upon him had sobered him down in a remarkable manner and he was looked upon in certain quarters as one of the coming leaders in the financial world before his fathers death however he had sown a lot of wild oats of one sort or another and it was in connection with one of these youthful escapades that flint had been called in about four years previously the affair threatened to be very seri ous for the time but the detectives skill had been brought to bear in a sur prising manner with the result that everything had been smoothed out as well as possible without the vaguest rumor having got abroad the young man fumbled in his pocket with a gloved hand and produced a sheet of notepaper the top of which had obviously been cut away that was found under the door when the house was opened up this morning he said heres the en velope it was not stamped of course flint smoothed out the sheet of pa per and looked at the sprawling uncer tain writing that covered it he read i know all about the affair of four years ago my price for silcnce is one hundred thousand dollars have it ready when i call or pay it to any one who may present an snarled identities order from me dont think you can stop this by trying to have me arrested you will fail and the whole story will come out i have fully arranged for its publication no matter what happens to me the money is the only thing that will buy my silence pay it and your secret is safe what is more you will never hear from me again refuse to pay it andâruin it was a bold letter but flint saw that it was nothing but a bluff he said as much i hope you havent been deceived by this he remarked tapping the sheet this fellow is working alone you may be sure and therefore it isnt at all likely that he has arranged anything of the sort in case he should be ar rested by this as you ought to know the newspapers would not publish a story about you without warning you have too much money and too many friends you would have an oppor tunity to bring your influence to bear and the story would be killed that sounds plausible enough gil lespie admitted thats what i would tell any one else in my position if he were similarly threatened when this sort of thing comes home to a fellow though it makes a lot of difference i know the detective replied with a nod thats the sort of mood such a scoundrel counts on he paused and thoughtfully fingered the letter i must confess that this is a disap pointment he resumed slowly i had hoped that the blackmailer would set a definite time for his call or ask you to take the money to some specified place this however avoids anything of that sort and leaves me nothing definite to go on all it tells us is that he expects to call at some unnamed hourâperhaps today perhaps tomorrow perhaps not for several days i think we need not bother about the hint that he may send some one with a written order for if such a person presented himself i feel sure it would be the blackmailer and no other this absence of details how ever makes it rather difficult to know just what to do how would this do gillespie said hesitatingly you are a genius at makeup why dont you pass your self off for me go to my place on fifth avenue and wait for this fellow wherever he is to call the chances are that he wont put it off very long and even if you had to remain there a couple of days you would not mind would you if you could nab your man at the end of your wait chapter xliii an astounding ruse giillespie went on more confi dently it ought to give him the shock of his life to think hes dealing merely with me and then to have you reveal yourself to him of course we could both stay there and you could walk in and collar him while he was holding me up but im afraid he may be watching the house in that case he would be suspicious if he saw any one else going in and not coming out again no matter whether he recognized you or not flint smiled slightly you must have been reading detec tive stories lately gillespie he com mented however it isnt a bad idea and im inclined to try it there are certain other advantages about it which make it appeal to me how about you though you would have to remain here as long as i found it necessary to stay at your place oh thats all right i dont mind ill promise to keep out of sight and if i have to stay overnight i suppose i can find a bunk somewhere if youll explain my presence to your servants you certainly can flint assured him and lets hope that you wont have to kick your heels here very long the detective conducted him into an a ds detective story magazine other room and seating him in the light proceeded to busy himself with his makeup materials and appliances at the end of half an hour the trans formation was complete will this do asked flint turning from the glass and facing his visitor by jove marvelous gillespie cried enthusiastically by the time youve got into my clothes youll be able to pass for me anywhere luckily theres only my old butler simms and his wife at the house as ive been abroad and was not expected home as yet the chauffeur outside is a new man and has never seen me before good flint answered now for the clothes soon the disguise was complete and after another careful inspection of him self flint was ready to leave ill explain matters to my people here as i go out he said come this way and ill show you the room you may occupy in my absence i hope youll find it comfortable dont hesi tate to ask for anything you want and ill let you know as soon as theres any thing to report after conducting his guest to one of the spare bedrooms the detective parted with gillespie and ascended the stairs five minutes later he stepped into the waiting car as if he owned it home he ordered and the ma chine whirled away in the direction of upper fifth avenue meanwhile from behind one of the curtains at the front of the detectives house the young man had seen the car drive off and as it passed out of sight a remarkable change came over him he threw back his head and laughed in a curiously noiseless way that many an exconvict has he laughed until the tears rolled down his cheeks and at last flung him self into a chair and fairly panted for breath at length he recovered him self however and wiped his eyes simultaneously his face took on harsher lines the fresh complexion of youth seemed singularly out of place now for age and experienceâand evilâpeered through the veneer had there ever been any doubt about green eye gordons daring there could be none any longer for this was the criminal himself in some manner best known to him self he had managed to learn of flints return and had taken this extraor dinary means of fooling the detectiveâ an example of supreme audacity in which he was manifestly taking the greatest delight he expected to kill more than two birds with the one stone oh what a sell he thought how are the mighty fallen you dont hap pen to know my dear flint that the real chester gillespie is still abroad and that while you are waiting for your bird in that gloomy old mansion across from the park your enterprising little friend ernest will be tapping the vari ous other sources of income as rapidly as he can nevertheless when the first flash of triumph had passed there seemed to be an undercurrent of uneasiness in the scoundrels mood and manner doubt less he knew that in boldness lay his only hope but perhaps he allowed him self to fear for the time being that even boldness would be insufficient in the long run against such an antagonist apparently the great detective had been completely taken in by this latest astounding ruse but very likely gordon realized that he was in the lions mouth and that there was no knowing when the jaws might close with a snap some time after green eye returned to flints study the door opened and judson entered flints assistant did not look any too well satisfied with his work thus far i beg your pardon he said halting snarled identites at sight of the supposed gillespie i didnt know any one was here are you alone yes gordon answered coolly mr flint has gone out i think he left word for you with the butler but i might as well explain that hes absent on an errand for me and that im to remain in more or less close confine ment here until he returns and in response to a look of sur prise on judsons face he explained a little further if you wish to call him up no not now flints assistant inter rupted quietly i have nothing to re port as yet that was good news to gordon for he felt sure that judson had been try ing to pick up some clew to the where abouts of the electric car and if so it was plain that he had failed to make any headway well ill leave you in possession here and go into the room mr flint placed at my command green eye re marked easily rising to his feet and helping himself to another of flints cigars if theres no objection i shall appropriate some writing materials judson supplied him with paper and envelopes et cetera and assured him that the study was his to use if he wished but the visitor would not con sent to be in the way three minutes later he was in the bedroom with the door closed quickly he removed the tapestry cover and droplight from the small table between the windows and draw ing up a chair set to work it was clear that his desire to write some letters was genuine enough and the fact that he cut the engraved head ings from several sheets of paper sug gested that the privacy of the room was welcome at the end of an hour he was still writing and beside him were several sealed and stamped envelopes addressed to a number of wellknown names the campaign was going forward i shall have to find some means of getting rid of this man judson though green eye told himself as he finished one of the letters and leaned back in a chair these fellows i have written to will come flocking here be fore long and i must be thorndyke flint again in order to receive them properly chapter xliv flints suspicions confirmed if the criminal could have read thorndyke flints mind about that time he would have been still more un easyâand with good reason ernest gordon had not been the only one who had played a part during that interview with flint which had ended in the detectives act of copying his callers features and borrowing his clothes for the first few minutes it must be confessed that the detective was com pletely deceived he knew green eye to be a master of surprises but it had not occurred to him to suspect that the clever rascal would resort to anything so spectacular besides gordon had placed himself so that the light did not fall strongly it was not until flints caller sug gested a change of identities that the detective began to question it was very seldom that a client presumed to offer such assistance and flints knowl edge of chester gillespie had not pre pared him for such a proposition he gave no evidence however that the seed of suspicion had been planted but fell in with the suggestion knowing that in carrying it out he would have the best possible opportunity of studying his visitor he noted a slight hesitation on the latters part when he had asked him to detective story magazine take his place in the brightest light ob tainable and the subsequent scrutiny had soon confirmed his suspicions gillespie was plainly ernest gordon no makeup could have stood that testâat least with thorndyke flint at the observers end what fools the cleverest of us are sometimes the detective thought with an inward chuckle gordon has such a good opinion of himself and is so certain that a man needs only to be daring enough in order to carry every thing before him that hes actually will ing to undergo this sort of thingâand he thinks hes getting away with it it was no part of the detectives plan however to reveal his knowledge of the deception he wished to give the masquerader as much rope as he could in order to find out just what gordon was trying to do moreover he was curious to visit gillespies house and find out how green eye had succeeded in making himself at home there gillespie might have been overpow ered and stowed away somewhere or even murderedâthough that was un likely unless the crime had been com mitted owing to an accident or miscal culation on gordons part when the detective reached gilles pies house on fifth avenue he found the situation just as gordon had de scribed it an aged butler answered the bell and save for him the big house seemed deserted flint was about to question the old man in a roundabout way in order to discover if possible whether there had been anything which might seem suspi cious or not before he could do so however the butler offered a couple of letters on a salver flint took them after a seconds hes itation studying the butlers face as he did so from the mans squint and the lines about the eyes he saw that the butler was nearsighted probably he had been in the family for a long time but this defect in his eyesight explained his failure to detect the deception but where was the real chester j gillespie whose second double was now entering his house and calmly in specting his letters gordon had given flint certain neces sary particulars concerning the ar rangement of the house and thanks to these the detective mounted the stairs with the utmost assurance leaving the nearsighted old butler bowing in the lower hall he found his way to gillespies pri vate room easily enough the letters still in his hand after looking about him curiously and noting the certain evi dences of recent occupancy he sat down and glanced mechanically at the letters one of them obviously was a busi ness communication but the other was not the envelope was unusually large and of the finest texture as for the writing it was big heavy and sprawl ing in the lower lefthand corner were the words importantâplease for ward and they were heavily under scored all is fair in love and war they say and if that is so all is fair in detection as well especially when the detective is trying to safeguard the man whose identity he has temporarily appropri ated under the circumstances therefore flint felt justified in opening any of gillespies correspondence that seemed to promise a solution of the mystery just as he would have ransacked the house for a similar clew there might be nothing in it of course but this letter appeared to be somewhat out of the ordinary and might be valuable consequently after a little hesitation flint ripped the envelope open without the slightest attempt at concealment and drew the inclosure out soon he was snarled identities very glad that he had done so for the letter read as follows dear old lunatic you do not seem to have improved in the matter of memory or levelheadedness you write me from some unpronounceable place in south americaâi judge solely from the postmarkâand do not tell me where to find you how the dickens can i join you down there for a months shooting if you do not give me more par ticulars i know you too well you see to imagine for a moment that you stayed more than a day or two at the place from which you wrote that was nearly two weeks ago and by this time you may be thousands of miles away from there your letter was forwarded to me up here in maine and the best thing i can think of doing is to send this to your new york ad dress in the hope that it will be forwarded to you with as little delay as possible there was a little more of it but the rest does not matter it was signed by a wellknown young man about town so that was it was it the only original chester gillespie was still down in south america and only about two weeks before had written to a new york friend inviting him down for a months shooting that argued that he did not expect to return for many weeks in some manner gordon must have learned that interesting fact and seemingly had disguised himself as gil lespie with the aid of a photograph or photographs of that young man so much for the way the trick had been sprung for the rest there was no doubt in flints mind as to green eyes further intentions the criminal had learned of the detectives return and had guessed what flints plan of campaign would be in other words he had concluded that flint had the index of the records in the safe and could easily find out which ones were missing knowing by that means where danger threatened flint could see a trap for the black mailer with the help of one or more of the latters unidentified victims he knew just about what to ex pect the detective mused and when he found that gillespie was out of the country having left only a couple of old people in charge of the house he hit upon this scheme of circumventing me if hes left alone hell find some means of sending judson off on a wild goose chase or otherwise dispose of him and then hell impersonate me once more and in that disguise hell probably advise his victims to pay the sums demanded oh its a pretty smooth schemeâ one of the smoothest anybody ever thought out im afraid however that hes inclined to underrate my intelli gence and to overrate his own ability chapter xlv flint and judson compare notes it was not until dusk that thorndyke flint left the gillespie house and when he did so it was on foot he had not gone more than a block or so how ever before he hailed a passing taxi and ordered the chauffeur to drive to a certain corner of madison avenue the corner named was only a block from flints house some hours had passed since flint had read the letter which revealed the whereabouts of the real chester j gil lespie but he had been in no hurry to act for one thing he wished to give the scoundrel a sense of security in this new and climaxcapping adventure flint was still disguised as gillespie but he was wearing a golf cap which he had pulled down over his eyes and a light overcoat with upturned collar his purpose was to get in touch with his assistant in one way or another and his only anxiety concerned the possi bility that gordon had already got rid of judson fortunately that was not the case and after a wait of no more than half or threequarters of an hour the young detective story magazine detective left the house and uncon sciously approached his chief who was lounging at the comer as he passed flint the latter said quietly go around the corner and wait for me his assistant stiffened slightly at the wellknown voice but that was the only sign of surprise he gave with a grunt and a nod he turned about at right angles into the side street and along this flint presently followed him a short distance beyond the corner well out of sight from flints house judson paused and there his chief over took him i havent made any headway yet judson announced without any pre liminaries i located the car late this afternoon but there i came to a dead stop never mind about that flint said quickly it doesnt matter in the least i can lay my hands on greeneye gor don at any moment the deuce you can ejaculated judson then i should certainly say you dont need meâfor the sort of leg work ive been doing today at any rate what about my double though flint put in swiftly without giving jud son time to ask any questions is he still at the house and if so what has he been doing hes there all right hes been writing letters in the bedroom he de clined to use the study ah flint murmured in a peculiar tone letters eh has he mailed them no i offered to do it for him a lit tle while ago but he said he would be going out himself later on flint thought over this information for a minute or two while his assistant watched him questioningly did you happen to see any of the letters flint inquired at length rous ing himself from his abstraction i mean could you tell whether they were stamped or not his assistant nodded i got a squint at a little pile of them he admitted the top one was stamped but i could not say as to the rest this required further thought on flints part he was tempted of course to end matters then and there before those letters could reach their destination and cause the consternation they were certain to create on the other hand he felt it necessary to give gordon a little more leeway and in order to do that it seemed essential that the letters be mailed he had searched gillespies private rooms on the theory that green eye might have left the stolen papers there but he had found nothing of the sort yet it was imperative that these papers be recovered if possible at the same time the rascal was captured unless that were done the precious records might not be returned at all for certainly gordon could not be counted on to restore them voluntarily to be sure the fact that he had been writing those lettersâdoubtless black mailing onesâunder flints own roof suggested that he had the documents there to refer to that however was by no means certain for he might have put the records in some remote place perhaps a safedeposit vault after mak ing a list of the names and addresses desired therefore it seemed wise to give the fellow his head for the time and mean while to keep him under observation in the hope that his movements would give some hint as to his possession or nonpossession of flints papers the detective was about to explain this to his assistant when the latter broke in excitedly for the love of pete whats up he demanded what are you cooking snarled identites up in that brain of yours and why arc you so curious about gillespies doings gillespie is down in south america judson flint returned quietly thats why our friend back there in the house isâwell you can guess i imagine and then he proceeded to give his in structions to the dumfounded judson chapter xlvi gordons letters reach their mark exsenator william deane phelps smiled complacently as he stood before a glass in his dressing room he was a tall man and the sixty years that had passed over his head had left him his rather slim and up right figure his hair was white but abundant and on the whole he had good reason to consider himself a hand some and wellpreserved man is there anything else sir his valet asked respectfully no the exsenator answered its probable that i shall be very late so you need not wait up thank you sir shall i ring for your car no no a taxi will do possibly the ghost of a smile curved the lips of the valet but if so it was quickly gone if his employer chose to keep his movements secret that was his employers business exsenator phelps took the light coat and silk hat that were handed to him and strolled toward the door he was a single man but his position in the world had made it necessary for him to keep up a rather pretentious estab lishment he stood in the doorway holding a cigar as the taxi drove up but at that moment his valet who had followed him as if to close the door spoke up in a surprised tone i beg your pardon sir he said but this was lying on the floor you stepped over it just now without know ing it its addressed to you and marked urgent its stamped but not postmarkedâlooks as if it had been slipped under the door instead exsenator phelps took the envelope with a careless air and no premonition chilled him as he stepped back into the light of the hall and tore it open as he glanced at the single sheet of paper however his face turned ghastly and he reeled against a small statue that stood on a pedestal throwing it to the floor and breaking it after all these years he muttered hoarsely to himself then his eyes fell upon the amazed face of his valet and as he crushed the letter in his hand he made a great effort to pull himself to gether iâi shall not be going out after all he said in a curiously dead voice im notâfeeling well every year of the sixty seemed to weigh heavily upon the exsenator as he pushed open the door of the room on the left his feet dragged across the thick carpet so that he stumbled and when he dropped into a chair buried his face in his hands the fortysecond street theater had been famous for years as the home of light comedy of the more brilliant sort that night was to witness a new pro duction for which great things were expectedâfor had the play not been written by one of americas cleverest and most experienced playwrights and staged by a production wizard and was not the star harold lumsden already the cheaper parts of the house were packed and the orchestra was filling up here and there a pair of white shoulders gleamed in one of the boxes which would soon be filledâ for it was a foregone conclusion that the s r o sign would have to be dis played in the lobby that night detective story magazine harold lumsden himself was peer ing through a peephole in the curtain at that moment idly surveying the nucleus of what he knew would prove to be an unusually brilliant firstnight audience for years he had enjoyed great prestige and this was to be his first appearance following a successful invasion of london which had added greatly to his laurels this is going to be some night har old his manager remarked im pressively coming up from behind and putting his hand on the stars shoulder dressed early didnt you yes i felt restless was the reply hanged if i know why this sort of thing ought to be an old story to me by this time if its ever going to be as he turned about to face the portly manager he noticed an envelope in the latters hand knowing the managers absentmindedness he inquired that letter isnt for me is it why yes it is was the reply i had forgotten it for a moment its marked urgent but i suppose its only from some friend of yoursâor more likely some friend of a friendâwho aspires to the deadhead class probably harold lumsden agreed as he glanced at the handwriting for a moment and then ripped the envelope open we havent needed to paper our houses for the last few seasons have we old man whats this great heavens the distinguished actor clutched at one of the wings for support and the letter fluttered to the ground the man ager stopped to pick it up but with an oath the star forestalled him seizing the letter hastily and thrusting it into his pocket bad news the manager asked anxiously a rather disagreeable surprise lumsden managed to say making a strenuous attempt to control himself its nothing you know anything about you know and ill be all right never fear harold lumsden played the part that night for there was nothing else to do and the traditions of his profession demand that an actor or actress should always appear unless ill in bed no mat ter what news may have been received or what tragedy may have been left at home but some idea of the sort of per formance the famous star gave on that memorable occasion might have been gathered from the newspaper com ments the following morning for all the critics seemed to agree that lums den was far from himself and that his conception of the part was strangely heavy and lifeless such was the effect of greeneye gordons second demand there were other lettersâseveral of them in fact âbut we need not trace their influence here there was no doubt that the black mailer had struck some stunning blows expecting that gold would flow from the wounds thus inflicted chapter xlvii the blackmailer advises his victim ernest gordon was inclined to consider the world a pretty good place as he finished his breakfast in flints dining room the following morn ing everything had gone very well thus far and he seemed to have reason for selfcongratulation he had peddled the letters around himself the night before thus saving time and making it more difficult to trace them as he believed he did not know that he had been shadowed throughout by judson who thereby knew just what victims the blackmailer had chosen for his first broadside later he had returned to the detec tives house and so had judson then there had come a telephone message to snarled identities the latter from flint sending the young detective out of town for at least twentyfour if not fortyeight hours that unexpected turn of affairs had caused gordon great satisfaction when judson gloomily confided the news to him the chief seems to think that fel low gordon has doubled back and is hiding not far from new pelham the assistant informed gillespie he still hopes hell turn up at your place and is going to wait there all of tomor row if not longer but he wants me to get busy and see if i can locate gordon independently it seems unnecessary to me but what he says goes the worst of it is though ive got my or ders to pull up stakes at once of course gordon did not know that this was all a putup job flint by seeming to play into the rascals hands had worked out this scheme in order to get judson out of the way so that gordon would not feel compelled to take strong measures to accomplish the same object as a result green eye had slept alone at flints that nightâexcept for the servantsâand now after a good breakfast looked forward to a day of undisturbed peace and freedom to do whatever circumstances might require first however it was necessary for him to absent himself temporarily in order to make up as flint once more therefore he made a flying trip to one hundred and twentyfifth street and there disguised himself returning as fast as the taxi could carry him when he reentered the detectives residence it was in the character of the owner has any one called up or been to see me he asked the butler no sir was the reply a welcome one to the scoundrel for it meant that none of his victims had yet sought the detective he did not have long to wait how ever for hardly more than half an hour later the butler entered the study and presented a card which bore the name of exsenator william deane phelps show him up the supposed detec tive said with a glow of anticipation the butler turned on his heel to obey and if greeneye gordon grinned be hind his back his face was serious enough in expression as the exsenator nervously entered and closed the door behind him in the few hours that had passed since he had received the threatening letter a great change had come over this man whose name was known from one end of the country to the other it was plain that he had not slept and there were heavy loose bags of skin under his eyes his face was almost grayish in hue i feared that you would feel com pelled to come here before long sen ator the impostor said gravely then you know his visitor asked in surprise yes gordon answered some one knows the facts in regard toâ well we need not go into the caseâ and is attempting to blackmail you phelps sank into a chair and drew a sheet of paper from his pocket the infernal scoundrel demands one hundred and fifty thousandâno less he said hoarsely it isnt so much the money but iâi naturally assumed that you alone held my secret green eye rose to his feet and his face was very solemn until a short time ago that was the case he answered and crossed to the safe the records were here and you will see that it has been burgled if its any comfort to you though ill tell you that you are not the only one who will suffer i care nothing about that phelps said angrily its my own plight that interests me to the exclusion of every thing else do you wonder this is detective story magazine terrible flint terrible i thought i could trust you and now after all this time i find that ive been living in a fools paradise the criminal interrupted him with a dignified gesture i dont think i deserve that sen ator he said quietly thorndyke flint has never yet betrayed a secret much as i regret this unfortunate oc currence however i dont see how i can be held responsible for it i didnt rob my own safe and certainly i wouldnt have chosen to have it robbed if i could have helped it thats neither here nor there de clared the exsenator why didnt you destroy the records do you expect me to destroy my stock in trade or burn up the reference books i have had occasion to consult countless times i hadnt thought of it in that light phelps confessed even that doesnt make it any easier to bear however what can i do im sorry to say that i see nothing for you to do except to pay green eye answered fingering the letter which had been handed him phelps looked at him in amazement you actually give me that advice he murmured green eye nodded i know im disappointing you he said but thats the best advice i can give under the circumstances it may sound strange but we must face the facts i know perfectly well who is at the bottom of this and i have to confess that hes one of the shrewdest men who ever defied the law hes amazingly daring senator and you may be sure he means exactly what he says hell drag this whole unsavory business into the light if you dont stop his mouth with gold and stop it with out delay but arent you going toâ of course im going to do every thing i can to catch him senator the criminal interrupted in a tone which seemed to imply that that was a matter of course if possible i shall try to trap him just after you have met his demands and while he has the money on his person i cannot promise how ever to catch him today or this week and knowing his methods as well as i do i know that you cant afford to risk any delay the chances are of course that i can make him disgorge and that youll get your money back but the im portant thing is to play safe isnt it exsenator phelps nodded slowly and hopelessly i suppose youre right he agreed i had hoped for immediate help flint for something that would put new hope into me evidently i expected too much though ill do as you say of course and try to believe that every thing will come out all right good morning and with that he left the room walk ing as if he were seventy instead of sixty number one greeneye gordon chuckled as he leaned back in his seat a hundred and fifty thousand isnt bad for a starter i wonder who will be the next chapter xlviii up against it at last a few minutes later the frontdoor bell rang again and this time the salver which the butler presented to his supposed employer bore the card of harold lumsden gordon nodded impassively very well he said i only hope hell prove worth the trouble he told himself as the butler left the room hes a spendthrift of course money turns to water and runs through his fingers no matter how fast it comes in hes just back from london however and i hardly think snarled identities he has already squandered everything he picked up over there then the door opened and a tragic figure entered the callers face was haggard his eyes wild his hair disor dered even his clothing seemed care lessly worn and ill fitting though lums den had always been considered one of the bestdressed men in the profession certainly he did not look like a comedian now successful or otherwise something terrible has happened he burst out mr flint i am being blackmailed somebody has learned the secret which i thought safe with you and has demanded an enormous sum of money it means my ruin un lessâ i know all about it i am sorry to say the bogus detective interrupted once more he gave a brief and very unsatisfactory explanation pointing to the rifled safe and winding up with a statement of his belief that there was nothing to do but to payâjust as a temporary expedient of course naturally that advice did not appeal to the actor any more than it had to ex senator phelps but gordon adroitly argued him into a somewhat less im patient mood how much does he want a cool hundred thousand was the bitter reply and it did not convey any real news to the man in flints desk chair and i havent more than eighty thousand to my name the devil you havent green eye exclaimed harshly not after that london engagement he had spoken without thinking and did not realize what he had said until the caller looked sharply at him i beg your pardon lumsden he hastened to say that must have sounded impertinent im afraid i meant no offense i assure you it was merely surprise you know we out siders are inclined to think that you popular actors are made of money well were not the other an swered as if slightly mollified what shall i do pay what you can gordon an swered promptly i know it doesnt appeal to you my friend but as i have said its only temporary ill have the fellow where i want him in short order you may be sure this is only in the nature of insurance to keep the rascal from carrying out his threats before i can stop his activities that seemed to appeal strongly to the actor its asking a good deal to trust everything to you including my whole bank roll when the trouble originated through you he said however i see nothing else to do ill do as you suggest anything is better than ex posure and i can always earn more money if i have to see the last of this he paused for a moment by jove he ejaculated you have made me feel that i shant be comfortable until ive paid the money over if you dont mind ill make out a check to self right now and take it to the bank to be cashed so that i can turn over the currency to the scoun drel when he comes green eye had no objection to that of course in fact it brought an an ticipatory glitter to his eyes with shaking hands lumsden took a check book from his pocket seating himself in the chair which gordon vacated for the purpose when he tried to write however he found it exceedingly diffi cult to do so confound it he cried impatiently see how infernally nervous i am would you mind filling this in for eighty thousand mr flint and then ill try to sign it gladly green eye said with alacrity reseating himself in the va cated chair and taking the pen from his visitors trembling hand detective story magazine the masquerading criminal held down the cover of the little check book with his left hand while he began to write with the other lumsden leaned over his shoulder watching him as if ready to try his luck at signing his name as soon as the rest of the check was filled in his hand slipped into his pocket however and when it came out silently there was something in it which had a metallic gleam ah thanks he exclaimed a mo ment or two later you have made it very easy for me gordon simultaneously there was a sudden unlookedfor swoop followed quickly by the click of a pair of handcuffs as they closed on green eyes wrists and the voice which uttered the mocking words was not the voice of harold lumsden but that of thorn dyke flint himself gordon knew it after the first word or two and even if he had not done so the action which went along with it would have been en lightening enough flint by heaven the rogue cried hoarsely jumping to his feet and over turning the chair flintâexactly the detective agreed removing the wig which had played such a large part in transform ing him into harold lumsden you didnt think you were going to have this little masked ball all to yourself did you after the first dazed shockâa merely momentary oneâhad passed gordons face seemed to grow actually black with rage and hatred you may think you have me curse you he snarled but ill show youâ he leaped forward his manacled arms raised to strike together flint quietly sidestepped the mad bulllike rush but green eye turned and charged him again there was one more surprise await ing him though the door opened and judson en tered coolly fingering an automatic pretty neat weapon isnt it gor don he asked in a matteroffact tone then stopped in feigned surprise oh you and mr flint are having an argument hope you dont think ive butted in now that im here though i think i might as well stay you look as if you needed your wrists slapped and the chief may not care to bother with it the escaped convict had halted in his tracks at the first interruption and was now looking from the detective to his assistant with baffled rage he would have liked to fight it out to a finish but his shrewdness told him that he would gain nothing by such a course and it was one of his rules never to exert him self unnecessarily the consequence was that he merely shrugged his shoulders so be it he said quietly you fellows can trump my ace i see let me remind you however that you havent got that gold that our mutual friend john simpson took such a lik ing to likewise youre a long way from the possession of those papers which you were foolish enough to keep in a more or less ordinary safe flint and judson looked at each other and grinned think so queried the former im afraid in that case that you are scheduled to receive another disagree able surprise or two i located the gold yesterday afternoonâin one of gilles pies closets as for the missing rec ords i feel very sure that we shall dis cover them on you and they did therefore there was no need of de lay and no clinton was shipped northward to dannemora the next day under escort lucky for us that he belonged to the gray brotherhood flint remarked to griswold when he turned a little snarled identities over seventyfive thousand dollars in gold over to him otherwise he would have gone scotfree just as in the case of simpson as it is hell get something extra for his escape at least and i dont believe hell have a chance to slip away again but another case like this would give me heart disease im afraid he added to himself the end decades murders and homicides the most murderous city in all the world is memphis tennessee where persons

australia thirtyone in prussia and fiftysix in italy tales of the chemists club viii every man has his price by howard fielding bertram j ritchie was a mining chemist in dawson and he was not making money he was a failure there as he had been at home behold him pacing the floor of his laboratory and swearing aloud to the bare walls and meager furnishings that he had but one desire in life which was to get away from dawson the reason why he did not leave dawson was to be found in his trousers pocket he could not pay his way it was equally true that he could not remain except to starve unless for tune relented he would much rather have seen a chance to get out than a chance to stay and make his living he was sick of the place in most respects it had proved to be just what he had anticipated he had always possessed a singular talent for discounting misfortune it may be said that his single reason for satisfaction with himself was that he had never been so foolish as to look for good luck anywhere yet of all the calamities that he had foreseen in this particular adventure none could approach in the quality of misery the one that he had encountered unexpectedly it struck him as a last proof of fates injustice that in coming to that howling wilder ness he should have run into a snare of love yet he perceived it very early the first time he met jennie winsted he knew why she was there he reasoned it all out after their first half hour of acquaintance miss winsted was in dawson city in her fathers care though her version was that she had come to take care of him he was a person about whom nobody seemed to know very muchâ in which respect he was by no means singular in that city he said that he came from boston and no man could prove the contrary he seemed to have plenty of money for he and his daughter lived as well as people could live in that region at that time it was said that winsted was prepared to speculate in mining properties but he was not known to do anything of that sort in the first months of his residence there he was a singularly placid indi vidual on the surface a man of strong frame of a genial countenanceâsuch as capital wears when depicted hand in hand with labor in a prosperity tales of the chemists club cartoonâand of most benign de meanor it is not to be supposed that he favored ritchies attentions to his daughter yet he viewed them with the most unmoved composure and put no perceptible obstacle in the young mans way unfortunately the daughter was quite as calm as her father by which token ritchie knew that he had not one chance in a million of winning her and it was all preposterous anyway because he was a poor beggar who would never be richer and would prob ably starve to death in the coming win ter the only thing for him to do was to pull up stakes and get away so that he might be spared the humiliation of starving in her presence but a man must have either money or exceptional nerve to get out of that country and ritchie had neither the information which has been im parted to the reader was the basis of ritchies reflections as he paced the floor of his laboratory anathematizing fate his steps and the flow of his language were interrupted by the sound of voices and the creaking of a stair case presently three men entered the room one of them he knew slightly the second he remembered having seen and the third was a tall young english man who was a total stranger to his eye good morning professor ritchie said number one whose name was atherton shake hands with my partner mr tripp and then with mr medway of london ritchie said good morning and acknowledged the introductions in the manner suggested weve come on a little matter of business atherton continued i sup pose you know all about my uncles claim up burnt creek i know that your uncle died a short time ago replied ritchie and that you were supposed to be his heir i also knew that he had dug quite a hole in the ground alongside of burnt creek i believe he called it the yel low dog didnt he right you are responded ather ton that was his name for it well the estate is all squared up now and the yellow dog is mine or to be exact twothirds belong to me and onethird to mr tripp to tell the truth i didnt believe the claim was good for anything until a few days ago when i got my legal business settled and took it into my head to have a look at the yellow dog tripp and i went up there and we came back with the con clusion that that dog was a valuable animal he is yellow with gold pro fessor mr medway also has had a look at him and he wants to buy him well you know said medway apologetically im considering im not altogether convinced but upon my word the ore looks goodâand ive seen a good deal of that kind of rock really i have you know we want you to make the assay said tripp theres a boxful of speci mens outside on a wagon they were taken under mr medways eye and according to his directionsâand im bound to say that hes all right when it comes to that sort of business i sampled the main lode at intervals of ten feet said medway breaking the ore across the full width youll find everything in good shape for your work and when thats done we shall know as much about this matter as any body can know about a mine you see said atherton this is all an open negotiation all we want is to get at the real value of the property and no advantage to be taken on either side is that right gentlemen tripp nodded with a somewhat sav age emphasis for he happened to be biting off a piece of plug tobacco at the time and the englishman said quite so very politely during this conversation ritchie had detective story magazine been consulting his memory regarding atherton with a result exceedingly meager in the matter of good report he had had so bad a reputation just before his uncles death that that event had been viewed by many with sus picion as frequently happens in such cases the discovery that the suspicion was baseless had gone far to rehabili tate the young man in popular esteem moreover he will gain friends who falls heir to properly and athertons uncle had been reputed well off though he was one of those men whose left hand does not know what the right hand doeth tripp had the air of an oldtimer and he did not look honest medway the englishman bore himself like a gentleman he was probably thirty years old but he looked much younger and he had the unduly confident man ner of a smart boy altogether the case seemed clear enoughâa matter of a lamb and two wolves the chemist felt a strong dis inclination to assist in the slaughter however if certain samples of ore were offered him for analysis he could hardly do less than put them through the process and pocket his fee at the suggestion of atherton his partner and the briton went down to get the box of ore no sooner was the door closed behind them than ather ton turned quickly toward the chemist and walking up close to him said in a low intense tone there is money in this for you if you do the right thing ritchie felt that he ought to be angry but it simply wasnt in him he had worried and suffered until he hadnt energy left for a strong senti ment of any kind bogus report i suppose he said wearily sinking down into the only good chair in the room dont let that bother you said atherton i know how youre fixed you cant afford to be honest your name is dennis if you do im right on to you you havent got money enough to do one thing nor the other you cant either quit or hang on heres where you get your chance that fellow medway has got more money than a horse can haul downhill and hes no baby anybody that can fool him will earn what he gets you ought to have seen him at work out there in the yellow dog there aint a man on the yukon that could have made a better examination of a claim hes fair game that fellow if hes so sharp a man said ritchie why didnt he tumble to the fact that the claim was no good that rock would fool anybody re sponded atherton tripp and i know theres nothing in it but you wont until youve run it through your mill now quick what do you say i wont do it said ritchie but he spoke without spirit will you take the stuff in here and keep it till i can have another talk with you tomorrow before the chemist could answer tripp and medway appeared at the door with the box they put it on a table and invited ritchie to take a look at it he complied like a man in a dream this thing had fallen in so op portunely that he was dazed by it he had been declaiming his willingness to do anything that would get him out of dawson city and satan had taken him at his word did fate mean to make a rascal of him if so judging by the record of his past performances he would probably become one anything to oblige destiny was his motto the ore looked good as atherton had said it would fool anybody ritchie found it hard to believe that the stuff was worthless though he had once or twice seen equally promising rock with no tangible value tripp and atherton were obviously anxious to get their victim away and tales of the chemists club they succeeded before ritchie could make up his mind upon a course of pro cedure when they were gone the chemist sat by the table trying to think he made poor work of it being deadly tired in the brain he would fancy himself engaged in formulating a line of action and would wake with a start to find his thought busy with a prob lem of years gone by a question of conduct long ago decided the wrong way again he would picture himself denouncing atherton on the follow ing dayâspeaking a speech to him full of high moral principles and absurdly unsuited to the person addressed while his mind was thus running around like a squirrel in a revolving cage accomplishing nothing at great ex pense of energy he was suddenly aware of medway who entered in haste ive got rid of those fellows said he and now i want a few minutes quiet talk with you you cant talk too quietly to suit me replied ritchie ive got nervous prostration medway looked as if he thought the chemist expected him to laugh and then he shifted to the serious side of the proposition youve been having a hard time said he i know that and its the real cause of my being here atherton thinks its your reputation for honesty and that i trust you no sir youre hard up and youve made up your mind not to stand it any more suppose i have said ritchie what then medway leaned forward and tapped him on the knee in the britons hand were some coins which jingled as he tapped youll give me a private report on that ore said he ritchie had hardly expected the lamb in this transaction to show so much worldly wisdom why whats the game he asked stupidly they think the yellow dog is no good said medway and they intend to bribe you to make a favorable report to me take their money take my money and make three reports one pri vately to atherton that the claim is no good another privately to me stating the facts and a third to all of us con taining whatever they want you to put into it you can all go to blazes cried ritchie i dont want anything to do with you medway laughed youll feel better about this tomor row he said sleep on it but for the love of heaven get to work on that assay as soon as you can im scared grayheaded for fear some one else will come along and make them an offer for that property ten thousand dollars would buy it and unless ive lost my eye its worth fifty times as much my terms with you will be these a full price for your work anywayâ and you can get another one out of atherton so youre a winner anyhow âand if my game works ten per cent of the difference between what i pay for the mine and its honest value get out said ritchie medway laughed and made a hur ried exit saying as the door closed think it over think it over ritchie tried to think it over but the harder he tried the less he accom plished experience had taught him that when he got into that condition he could find some small relief in work so having nothing else to do he began to prepare some samples of yellow dog ore for assay no sooner were his hands busy than his brain evolved a ra tional idea ill make an honest assay of this stuff said he to himself and force those fellows to pay for it ill charge them enough to get me out of this for a ds detective story magazine saken wilderness and they wont dare to refuse for fear ill blow the whole story with this inspiration he went to work in earnest and was speedily con scious of a betterment of spirits pres ently he found himself thinking of jennie winsted and in a pleasant vein in utter hopelessness he was trying to earn enough money to take him forever out of the sight of her and yet as he worked he indulged himself in day dreams of success in the world and the winning of her favor he ate with appetite at noon and his pipe was more than ordinarily satis factory when he set it alight in the laboratory after returning from dinner he remembered to have felt this un reasonable sense of cheer many years ago just previous to his one brief run of good luck was the sensation pro phetic this problem occupied a good share of his thought for an hour or more and then a most unexpected oc currence drove it out of his head this was no less than the appearance of mr winsted ritchie had never been thus honored before and he was childishly pleased the more that mr winsted should have found him busy and such a weight of ore upon his table the coincidence was astonishing indeed it is probable that winsted was surprised by what he saw but he was far too well bred to say so he greeted ritchie most po litely and sat down on a cracker box with the grace of one who is at home in the drawingrooms of the rich and great very fairlooking rock said he in dicating the ore it is indeed replied ritchie any objection to telling where it comes from no objection to telling you re joined the chemist it is from a claim on burnt creek that they call the yel low dog the statement seemed to make a con siderable impression on winsted he rose from the cracker box and paced the width of the room twice or thrice do you know a man named syd cullom said he suddenly never heard of him responded ritchie frankly meeting a searching glance from winsted why he told me this morning that id better look into the yellow dog prop erty said winsted i didnt know but he might have had the tip from you that wasnt in my mind when i came here however i was only thinking that perhaps you could help me to get a line on the value of the claim i dont know anything about it my self yet said ritchie im going to make an assay for young atherton and an englishman named medwayâwho may purchase one assay for both parties yes its an open business no it isnt either why should i lie to you its a crooked game on both sides and he told winsted the whole story when he had finished the elderly gentleman went to the door and softly opened it there was no one in the hall so he closed the door again and walked up to ritchie give me an advance report on this stuff said he and ill make it worth your while ritchie whistled this is a pretty good day for bribery and corruption said he never you mind that my son re sponded winsted remember which side your bread is buttered on and let others attend to their own those fel lows are trying to cheat each other why shouldnt an honest man step in and get the property your english man thinks ten thousand would buy it if offered spot cash ill put up the money and give you a tenth interest it is unnecessary to follow the con versation in detail the charitable tales of the chemists club reader will remember ritchies unfortu nate condition of mind and his still more distressing condition of heart and will pity rather than censure him for agreeing to this nefarious proposition when winsted had gone the young man sat for many minutes with his head in his hands a prey to remorse then he sprang up and began to rave he swore that all was fair in love and gold mining that the moral law was well known not to extend north of the fiftyfifth parallel of latitude and that any man alive would do the same under similar conditions having relieved his mind in this way he went to work with vigor no leisure and short allowance of sleep was his rule from that time forth during the course of these analyses he was occa sionally interrupted by one of his three temptersâfour indeed counting mr trippâand he agreed to every propo sition made to him but he touched no bodys money it was four oclock on a certain morning when he finished his work and made the last of his calculations from the full report he made a brief abstract in which the results of his analyses were shown in three classifica tions as follows ounces of gold per ton value per ton no no no the yellow dog was a surprisingly good property judging from this assay and from what medway had said about the general characteristics of the lode if winsted could buy it for ten thou sand dollars he ought to be a good fatherinlaw to the man that had given him the opportunity this thought in confused form was in ritchies brain as he turned from his work in utter exhaustion throw ing an old fur coat upon the floor and drawing the first thing he could get his hand on over him for a coverlet he pre pared to sleep upon the problem in volved in his singular situation when he awoke it was noonday and the problem had solved itself for there sat winsted beside the table digesting the result of ritchies labors the young man had forgotten to lock his door before he slept well upon my word he ex claimed raising his stiffened and aching frame from the floor and glaring at his visitor winsted nodded pleasantly as he thrust the report into his pocket its all right he said im going to find atherton youd better take an other nap he was gone before ritchie could in terpose any objection as quickly as possible the chemist followed winsted was out of sight in these circum stances it seemed to be ritchies duty to hunt up atherton and medway and make a report to them he sought them all day and for some hours of the evening vainly at last in great weariness he went to bed on the following morning he decided that the best thing to do would be to wait in his laboratory it should be a certainty that those he wished to see would come here during the day at four oclock in the afternoon they had not appeared at five there came a young indian with a note it was from jennie winsted and it ran as fol lows dear mr ritchie i know that you are perfectly innocent but father is crazy ath erton tripp and medway have decamped together of course you know by this time that father bought the mine for fifteen thou sand dollars cash it was all a swindle the ore that you analyzed never came from the yellow dog mine it was bought some where else medway of course was in the plot they got that fellow cullom to give father the tip and they knew hed go to you because we all like you so much and you have been seen so often with father and me its dreadful but dont you worry i wont detective story magazine let father do anything bad a little bit of money wont hurt him he is very rich richer than youd believe if i told you so cheer up ill stand by you through thick and thin i am yours most truly jennie winsted for one instant ritchie was stunned an alternating current of bad and good news had shocked him to the marrow then he slowly came to a realization of what it all meant the old mans abuse of me has done the business he cried it has put jennie on my side and all is won now let me starve or freeze i am content with any fate heaven bless ather ton and tripp and medway may all their past sins be forgiven and all their future ones be profitable they have saved me and made a man of me it is the turn of the tide he danced around the table to the great amazement of the youthful in dian whom at last he surprised even more by a large gratuity ritchie saw nothing of winsted in several days he received however several notes from jennie describing the varying conditions of her fathers feelings and her own warfare upon ritchies side then one fine day win sted walked into the laboratory smil ing as sweetly as ever and with ex tended hand ive thought this thing out he said and youre not to blame i swindled myself thats the fact about it jennie has shown me how the case really stands shes a bright girl and she likes you she wants you to come up and take dinner with us today and i like you myself be hanged if i dont shes talked me into it i think you and i can make some kind of partner ship i believe youre an honest man and i need your advice iâi want you to help me soak somebody else with that yellow dog claim as an honest man said ritchie i cant view that proposition with favor but i will go to dinner no ix of tales of the chemists club will appear in the issue of the detective story magazine out october th new counterfeiting scheme weeks of patient searching and watching by captain loughry of the police bicycle squad of fort worth texas were rewarded when he placed under arrest a white man who is wanted by the federal authorities in connection with the recent counterfeiting operations of two men at abilene the other man in the case was arrested about three weeks ago and according to captain loughry is now serving sentence in one of the federal prisons captain loughrys prisoner was transferred to the federal authorities for a hearing counterfeiters

with sandpapers tinting was done in a crude way and wonder is expressed by authorities at the ability of counterfeiters in passing their spurious money operations were carried on principally in the vicinity of abilene and baird federal authorities say suggestion by im hanbury but when he touched his wifes temple with the revolver he saw the old love light come into her eyes he knew that look was a farewell to the dead man behind him but he could not fire kitty kitty he cried in anguish i cannot kill you then he raised the weapon to his own head a flash and he fell thank heavens thats finished pasquale muttered writing this kind of rot takes it out of a fellow ive heard of actors becoming criminals because theyve always played criminal parts but when a man has had to feel the part of a husband wife and a lover before he can write a convincing novel he stands a fair chance of becoming a central figure in the annals of psychical criminology pasquale author and genius dropped on his bed and as sleep instantly claimed his exhausted brain and body forgot that he had been trying to per sonify a woman standing between a dead lover and an equally dead hus band the next morning he awoke de pressed and unrefreshed nerves overwork he growled and dressed hurriedly all the while fighting the feeling of impending disaster but later as he swung down the strand he laughed at his previous forebodingsâ for the world was going well with pasquale his publisher had not yet arrived and while waiting for him pasquale took up the morning paper the same sordid story he groaned glancing at the headlines chelsea suicide and murder lord fairfield shoots his wifes artist lover then himself lady fairfields fatal condition without interest pasquale read how hearing the shots men from a neigh boring studio had rushed in and found lady fairfield standing beside the two dead men she seemed dazed and nothing could be learned from her her mind was evidently unhinged by the shock the devil pasquale cried and with sudden fear searched for his manuscript yes it was safe every page properly numbered and in order was he mad or had last nights work been too severe that he had his story always before his eyes that was it of course he was tired and had dropped to sleep in the office chair and dreamed he laughed and cursing the state of his nerves again took up the paper on the front page he read chelsea suicide and murder passing his hand over his eyes he saw what this would mean to him his long work was now useless no one would take a story good enough in it self but an exact copy of a sensational tragedy told in the morning papers laughing hysterically he staggered down the stairs and found his way home detective story magazine it was a cruel blow and hit pas quale hard for ten years be had writ ten stories of life stories of death love and adventure every character inci dent and situation was born in his own brain and he heartily despised those who drew their copy from current events now by strange coincidence on the night when he had finished his latest book his plot had been acted by live people in some other part of the city worn out and disgusted pasquale left london indefinitely but soon publisher and public were clamoring for more of his work so once more bloomsbury saw him working at his table putting all his mind into a tre mendous burglary serial which when finished was to bring him a sum suffi cient to drop out of the old life for a year or two the principal feature of the serial was the inexperience of the burglar and the safes lock pasquale all his old college books strewn about the floor studied to work out a simple and orig inal combination for weeks he worried over the lock the combination bothered him until one day he accidentally picked up an article on suggestion and will power being a practical young man the facts seemed hysterical but being also an artist the idea pleased him greatly that night while absently going over the diagram of the lock his eyes followed the care fully traced lines of the combination and he saw with surprise that the letter which had always eluded him was a g and having found it the key to the opening of the safe was the word suggestion strange i didnt see that before he mused i didnt even know there were two gs in suggestion now for the character ive got him in my head but i dont seem to get in touch with the unwashed devil the story dragged and when com pleted pasquale reread it with dis gust its weak he complained and heres two months already gone and the whole thing has to be rewritten its that burglar he isnt the right sort âhe doesnt live lighting his pipe pasquale sank wearily into a chair twenty minutes passed an hour he reached mechan ically for his pouch and still staring into the fire refilled his pipe again silence then his lips moved ive got you at last you inexperienced fool he muttered the room was full of smoke pas quale leaned forward in his chair his face flushed with excitement then from his trembling lips the words fell in whispers no not that way two gs suggestion yes good heavens cant you spell there youve got it three hundred thousand pounds clear for you now git pasquale fell back in his chair ex hausted and fainting suddenly he arose with a start good heavens two oclock i must have been asleep im dead tired and dont feel like work but that serial must get off tomorrow and it has to be completely rewritten stretching himself he crossed the room to his littered table and listlessly prepared to write after the first few words his pen flew the ideas tumbled from his brain so quickly that he could not keep pace with them hurrah he cried joy ously ive got it its like a dream and clear too i must have caught that young burgling rascal when i was asleep just now laughing like a boy pasquale set to work in earnest as the clock struck three his door burst open and billy sheldon oddjob man on the daily scum rushed in come on pierre he called put up suggestion that stuff and come with me the scions got wind of a big thing and im booked for the details burglary and combinationlock affair with old moor kins the millionaire thrown in get out pasquale growled never lifting his eyes from his work ive a burglar and combination lock of my own on hand and theres more money in it than in your reallife stuff get an easier job billy bring your burglars to your rooms and make your own combination locks sheldon laughed and seeing his friend had no intention of accompany ing him ran downstairs and off to his story five hours passed and as a foggy sun peered through the window a woman entered pasquales room with a tray he looked up in surprise whats that mrs green lunch or dinner breakfast sir the good lady re plied sniffing the heavy smoky air and youve been working all night again sir look at your face pasquale rose to his feet but stag gered back against the table there there mrs green he laughed dont worry about me its my last allnight bust today i get a fat editorial check and trot off to the green fields i caught a perfectly in nocent young man and its been an all nights work to turn him into an intel ligent burglar for the fiddler mrs green sniffed again and set down the tray if bein a genius sir means id have to talk crazylike id rather keep my house sir and cook for folks what never eats she ended wist fully genuine concern on her moth erly face she went below pasquale smiled goodnaturedly at the retreating figure swallowed his tea and tucking his manuscript under his arm started off for the office of the fiddler hello pasquale the editor said cordially weve had an awful scare about you were just going to press and that story of yours has to appear in this issue advertised it four months ago what was the matter youve never been so late before a lock for one thing pasquale laughed and a burglar for another its taken me two months to get a com bination because i had forgotten how to spell then the man wasnt real and the whole thing was silly but last night i got the hang of it and rewrote the entire first part for which my land lady is at present in tears the editor laughed glanced over the manuscript and wrote a check one thousand pounds he groaned heaven help you pasquale if it isnt one of your best this is the biggest check ive ever signed and it depresses me but if anything can pull up the fiddler its a story from you so long old man get your moneys worth out of that piece of paper in a little village in cornwall a man dug his potatoes smiling the while oh the joy of it he laughed as he threw himself down on the warm earth to inspect his blistered hands just then the rural postman shouted across the fields mr pasquale sir hang grumbled the farmer as he crossed the potato patch i told burns not to bother me with mail until i sent for it he stuffed the letter un opened into his pocket and resumed his digging but the touch from the out side world had jarred and putting up his tools pasquale went into the house hang burns he repeated as he opened the lawyers letter dear pierre you had better come back at once your publisher is making the devil of a row and has sent back your story at the same time demanding his check for one thousand pounds i do not wish to write much so come up detective story magazine immediately for at any moment the fiddler may turn the matter over to their lawyers that moorkins burglary is still bothering scotland yard and if your story gets into their hands before they catch their man well have to put up a big fight i need not assure you old man that my mind is at rest knowing there is some ex planation which at the time of writing my matteroffact brain is incapable of conceiv ing therefore directly you arrive come to my office yours ever arthur burns whats it all about pasquale mused arthur writes as if he is try ing to soothe a lunatic or give courage to a criminal glancing at his watch he left the bungalow and sprinted along the country road to catch the london express when pasquale arrived at his law yers burns led him into his private office glad to see you old man he said affectionately have a cigar and sit still while i tell you my story and then you can talk fact is im all on edge over this blamed thing and feel as if i want to keep you from talking as long as possible sort of everywordyousayshall beusedagainst you eh pasquale laughed as he settled into his chair hurry along arthur i want to get back to my potatoes burns walked up and down the room and finally blurted out in quick nerv ous sentences about four months ago you re ceived a commission for a story from the fiddler on the morning of may st you took the manuscript to them you were nervous and unstrung and told the editor you had written the story only the night beforeânight of may th the editor gave you check for one thousand pounds you disappeared same time as first install ment went to pressâmorning may st the daily scum came out with the moorkins burglary case the scum was the only paper that had anything about it as moorkins had cautioned scotland yard to keep the thing quiet since then all the details have come out andâandâhang it all man the only difference between your story and that robbery is that you wrote the one and the other is dry police fact the fiddler sent for me at once gave me back your manuscript and in tend to sue if you dont make good their check for one thousand pounds they believe you got the whole thing from the scum and played a lowdown trick by sending it in as original stuff good but their lawyers will want to know how you got the details how you learned the combination of the lock moorkins invented and manufactured himself remember all these details did not come out until nearly a week after your manuscript went to press now man its serious and if you cant make it clear youll probably be under suspicion as the man for whom the police are at present scouring lon don thats allâand for heavens sake say something like a man who had received his death sentence pasquale raised a white face and looked at his friend just my luck arthur theres my little potato patch and the bungalow with the yellow roses all wiped out burns looked at his friend with con sternation man alive stop this talk about potatoes and yellow roses cant you understand its this did you rob moorkins safe and get off with three hundred thousand pounds or did you like a beastly cad sneak the whole story from some reporter and pass it off as firsthand stuff the first i wont believe the other why its your utter ruin and the ruin of whoever gave you inside information in that case youll be lucky to get off with heavy damages but youll never be able to soothe the feelings of the public after playing the fool like this ruin man utter ruin pasquale stood up wearily and suggestion walked to the door its no good ar thur youre wrong in both conclu sions i wrote the story out of my head and thats all there is about it burns started as if his friend had struck him prove it prove it man by showing where you were that night tell me everything nothing to tell pasquale sighed i was in my rotten digs in blpoms bury and wrote the whole thing dur ing the night then my landlady brought up some grub and i went to the fiddler and got a check but didnt any one see you at work didnt anything happen to prove you were there before the landlady came in the morning burns asked excitedly noâyes pasquale an swered wearily billy sheldon came up i think still im not sure for my head was full of the story then i re member it was the very deuce to make it run smoothly but burns had rushed to the tele phone daily scum he shouted send mr sheldon to no frog morton street at onceâarthur burns âthird floor then as he hung up the receiver he began to pace the room again sit down pierre he ordered the two men sat in silence until billy shel don hurried in copy lust lighting up his handsome young face pasquale glanced impatiently at his eager friend for heavens sake billy look less like a newspaper man and stop grinning he growled then when youve found out what burns thinks hes been explaining come and tell me what the rows about im going to your rooms when pasquale had gone burns turned to the reporter mr shel don he said i hope you have noth ing of importance on hand for an hour or so and that i may speak to you now as a friend of pierre pasquale and not as a newspaper man seeing the old mans worn look shel don answered seriously wherever pierre is concerned mr burns my chief fault is sincerity and affection for there never was found in the make up of one man a greater genius and a greater child burns took the young mans extended hand and characteristically went to the root of the matter at once it is this mr sheldon our friend may be dragged into the courts and con victed for the moorkins robbery on the sole evidence of an unfortunate story he tells me you came to him on the night of the robbery is that so yes sheldon answered immedi ately and he was head over heels in work when i went up at two oclock in the morning then under the law yers questioning sheldon set himself to remember every detail of the con versation on that night and you did not return later with any further details you had learned burns finally asked no nor did i see him again until half an hour ago in this office more over i could have told him nothing further for we didnt know the details ourselves until three or four days later when all the stuff about the lock being moorkins invention came out well sheldon im floored burns muttered here read this its the story youll then understand how serious this is sheldon took the manuscript and for an hour read in silence its great he cried when he had finished but all the facts are stale now what do you make out of it mr burns nothing or everything i dont know go back to pierre and make him talk it will take both of us to sift this especially as at present his mind runs on nothing but potatoes when sheldon reached home he found pasquale working over a sheet of figures which proved to be an ac detective story magazine count of the profit to be made after three years from an investment of five hundred pounds in potatoes let em wait pierre he said awk wardly and talk to me burns is not himself with worry about you and you can put everything straight in a minute by saying how you got the facts for your story pasquale looked like a hurt child wrongfully accused but touched by the expression on his friends face an swered slowly out of my head same as i told arthur but the combination lock moorkins invented and put together himself out of my head and a devil of a lot of bother it gave me six months ago six months ago sheldon ex claimed that was when moorkins was inventing his lock cant help that pasquale was be coming irritable if you want to know anything else get my old trunk out of the warehouse and youll probably find the diagrams somewhere with the story as i first wrote it before the whole thing came like a dream im fond of you billy but you and burns are get ting tiresome fish out that trunk and leave me alone more to gain time than with any hope of solving the riddle sheldon hur ried off to the warehouse pasquales authority to get the trunk in his pocket a little later he was back rummaging the trunk for the first proofs of the burglar story at the bottom he came across a roll of manuscript and drew it out whats this pierre he called glancing over the papers never seen it in print turned down pasquale looked up from his figures for a moment oh that no never in print rotten piece of luck that made me so disgusted i nearly chucked writing read itâits good enough stuff sheldon opened the packet and be gan to read suddenly he cried its fine pierre but its the story of the fairfields and poor old ceril thornby the artist it is pasquale laughed thats just what i said too when i sat in the publishers office with my manuscript under my arm and read the whole thing in the morning paper youre not trying to tell meâ im not trying to tell you anything except that that story gave me the blow of my life i thought it rather good for me then some live fools acted the whole thing before i had time to get my stuff into printâand as put down in journalistic eloquence it was a rotten story too thats what i am trying to tell you though not for a moment thinking i can explain it to you sheldon sat like a frightened child and stared at his friend dont tell me its suggestion pierre for although i once wrote an article on that for the scum its rot and i dont believe in it suggestion pasquale shouted then youre responsible for my lock combination you villain that article of yours stuck in my head and finally i found that the combination i was working out opened my oncethought unique safe by that one word spelled differently from the way it ought to be however sheldon still stared openmouthed at his friend then without a word col lected the scattered manuscript and rushed from the house to burns here read this burns he cried he wrote it before the fairfields case came out in the papers unable to grasp what sheldon meant burns took the manuscript and read aye its uncanny man he said at last relapsing into his native tongue the lad is clean daft or under some evil control i dinna like the sound of yon articleâit reads like he kens too suggestion weel the feelings of these itlier folk its as if he went into them and listened to the things they say and do a the time keeping the power to write it doon it smacks of forcing the puir souls to do what he writes doon for siller its likeâits like suggestion sheldon whispered to himself aye man whats that ye say sug gestion thats the word laddie its as if they have to because he is think ing of it i dinna like it but it proves pierre didntâ sheldon began and hesitated aye it shows the laddie never did bother moorkins money or no its nae mair than some evil influence the lad is un der ill telephone the fiddler and see what we can do as they waited for the representative from pasquales publisher the two men talked but pierre has spent more than half the thousand pounds al ready sheldon objected to the law yers suggestion that they refund the money with the explanation that being pressed for time pasquale had taken the entire story from the newspapers hoping it would pass unnoticed for burns explained so long as it has not gone to their lawyers there is no danger of the editor wondering where the details came from he doesnt know whether they were known before the newspapers printed them later and in the meantime scotland yard will probably catch their man burns was interrupted as the clerk ushered in the fiddlers representative be seated sir burns began sternly the light of battle in his eye i have sent for you to tell you how much i regret the inconvenience to which your firm has been put and to offer you in the name of my client mr pasquale the sum of one thousand pounds as compensation for your loss of time and money spent in advertising and print ing his unfortunate story i also re fund you the one thousand pounds paid to him by your firm the only ex planation my client wishes to offer is that he was pressed for time and money and as it is perfectly legitimate to make use of any current topic he used the moorkins robbery as the theme of his story however if by any further work he can further compensate you i have no doubt he will gladly do so burns paused and sheldon wander ing where the lawyer intended getting two thousand pounds looked on aghast compensation the representative cried in disgust we will accept the check but as for any further commis sions from us or any other selfrespect ing paper you may tell mr pasquale from me his account is closed this is his ruin not one of us would touch the greatest work in the world if writ ten by him burns grown suddenly gray and weak sat down heavily and wrote a check for two thousand pounds the fiddlers representative looked at it this is your personal check sir he asked yes burns replied simply mr pasquale deposited that amount to my account when he realized he had made a mistake in thisâhis only unworthy act then as the man left the office burns dropped his head on his arms like an old man who has looked on the destruction of his lifes dream sheldon stared at the bowed head for a moment anger and emotion fight ing in his heart then he too wrote a check and laid it beside the old man you cant do it alone burns he said kindly pierre is my friend too at the unasked question in the lawyers eyes he added quickly oh ive a couple of hundred left and nothing to do with em then seeing the other still doubted he turned on his heel and left the office detective story magazine pasquale was still at work sheldon touched his shoulder and said quietly go back to the country pierre andâ give up writing old man your pub lishers are liberal in their denunciation of you and your stuff good pasquale exclaimed re gaining his good humor at the thought of an immediate return to his potatoes i never intend to write another word in my life goodby billy and thanks awfully for whatever you and arthur have done though for the life of me i still dont understand what the rows been about both of you come down some time and ill show you a potato patch that will make your hearts young again during the five years pasquale had planted potatoes his ardor had never for a moment diminished true for the last year he had been constantly drawing on the bank but to him that seemed the sole excuse for its ex istence so when he received word that his account was overdrawn he felt as a petulant child might when tem porarily deprived of jam nor did he realize the seriousness of his position until the plow needed a new share and he had not the where withal to purchase it then it was only anger he feltâanger against the bank the series of bad summers and the world in general there is noth ing for it but to write again he told himself dejectedly calling his farm hand he told him the facts ive no more money john and we need a new plow and lots of other things it seems i cant buy them so ill have to pay you off and get along alone as best i can until i get fresh funds john who was devoted to pasquale would not hear of his plans i shall work on as before sir he said me and the missus have saved up a tidy sum from the overpay you always give me andâandâwell sir i never earned that money and please sir wouldnt you use it sir until you get the other money sir johns honest face was red and em barrassed and pasquale slapped him on the back in friendly fashion no john ill have a check in two or three weeks but if you wont go i suppose youll work on thats all it wont be long before i can square tip anyway that night pasquale wrote to his friend billy sheldon come and see fair play billy i wont use my own name and ill spin out a yarn about myself this time so you and arthur can put your old minds at rest about the tender feelings of the public then he shut himself up in his den to work fine subject i am for a penny shocker he mused im afraid ill have to be satisfied with the heros part and john can be the villain he chuckled to himself af the idea and wrote rapidly all through the night the next morning john brought in breakfast as usual pasquale eyed him with amusement not so polite my villain he laughed to himself as the adoring john left him after a puzzled stare at the pile of manuscript strewn about the table you dont strike me as a murderous ruffian and youre no inspiration at all when you look at me like a worried old hen that afternoon sheldon arrived see that pasquale laughed as john served the dinner that speci men of british honesty is my villain he has to make away with me the eng lish baron sheldon glanced over the manuscript and found it to be one of pasquales best but later when john confided to him his fears that his young master was overworking and related harrowing tales of untouched breakfastsâhe se cretly marveled at pasquales san suggestion guine genius if he intended to get copy from his devoted servant sheldon retired early tired with the unaccustomed outdoor life and pas quale worked in his silent den a few nights later sheldon was awakened by the sound of a window shutting thinking it was pasquale going to his room after a long nights work he called out that you pierre there was no answer so he got up and followed the direction he imagined the footsteps had taken before he had gone far a cry rang through the house it came from pasquales den and as he dashed downstairs sheldon collided violently with some one run ning up hello pierre he gasped you all right wheres the row then he saw the man was john oh sirâmr pasqualeâin the studyâquickâhes dyingâi killed himâquickâfor the love of heaven sheldon ran to the study and for a moment was relieved for there at his desk his back to the door sat pas quale but as sheldon crossed the room the figure slid from the chair and fell in a heap on the floor instantly sheldon was beside his friend and saw that pasquale who had been stabbed from behind was rapidly dying as sheldon bent over him he struggled to speak and at last whis pered faintly billyâheâcouldnt help it it mustâhave beenâlikeâthe other stories promiseâto clearâhim then as the blood gushed from his mouth pasquale sank back and died bewildered and half fainting shel don still sat beside his friends body when the door opened and john stum bled in he threw himself upon the dead man moaning and muttering in coherently until sheldon forced him aside roughly what are you doing here at this hour of the night he asked harshly john began to moan again and with difficulty sheldon caught the drift of his mutterings i found myself dressed âand with a knife i dont know how i got out of my houseâi ran along the roadâi climbed into the windowâi dont know why i only know i suddenly awoke with the handle of a knife in my hand oh heavens the blade was in my masters back i must have done itâi âi must have killed him then before sheldon could stop him the distracted man had plunged the knife into his own breast morning found the local police in possession of the little cottage with the yellow roses and the potato patch but although the den gave evidence of re cent use and work they could find noth ing to show what pasquale had been doing on that fatal night so baffled they called it murder and suicideâ motives unknown but sheldon and his friend burns were in possession of pasquales last manuscript and in the lawyers town office they read it and together deci phered the last bloodstained page aye the laddie created his ain mur derer the scotsman said sadly and oot of a perfectly innocent and affec tionate man too did i no say twas a power from the evil one see his last words stealthy footsteps stole down the hall and creeping behind his mas ter john raised his arm and the knife the puir laddie never wrote that last word buried or sank or whatever was in his mind for john struck then helplessly doing his mas ters bidding and it was only when the influence of that strong mind was broken the puir creature came to him sel and saw what he had done ah my puir puir laddie after a few moments sheldon said softly burns i feel it my duty to detective story magazine write this up for the sake of poor lord fairfield and the innocent man who robbed moorkins safe he is no more guilty of theft than was john of mur dering his master nay laddie burns replied sorrow fully you nor i can do naught are ye hoping to stand op before a judge and twelve healthyminded british jurymen and convince them of this thing that neither i nor you can under stand think of the feelings of the public when they read the accounts of your speech in a respectable morning paper darn the feelings of the public sheldon exclaimed as he mixed him self a stiff drink passing of new yorks chinatown time was when poker threatened the supremacy of fantan in new yorks chinatown the elusive full house was taken to the chinese bosom and players sat up far into the night in pursuit of the higher learning which tells a student of hoyle when to toss away one of his two pairs for the sake of improving his chances in the draw but that time is past in this day poker and the chi nese of pell street scarcely speak as they pass because poker with its chance for the individual player as against games in which the dealer holds all the advantage appeals to the chinese gambling sense it thrived in chinatown the american deck was easier to handle tooâand per haps to slip into a capacious sleeveâthan the narrow cards of the orient but its vogue was of brief duration for american detectives who knew even more about the game than the crafty chinese swooped down upon it confiscated the cards and chips and arrested the players fantan came back into its own because to quote one of the detectives who helped put poker out of business you cant tell by lookin at a bunch of chinks playin th blasted game whether theyre gambling or takin up a collection for the belgians when detectives battered down half a dozen icebox doors broke their heads in lowceiled passageways and barked their shins on chairs thrown in their path by fleeing lookouts they often got to gambling rooms to find from half a dozen to fifty blind chinamen sitting about tables and fingering buttons and dominoes there was no money in sight sometimes they went over roofs clambered down fire escapes dropped into courtyards shinned a wall and let themselves in through a window by the time they had pried loose the iron bars covering the glass kicked out the window frame and tumbled into the room there was one suspected gambler left and he was asleep his head pillowed on a gambling table today there is no gambling in chinatown that is a statement worth em phasizing the activity of the police department is responsible consequent of this chinatown is threatened with extinction in another year those who know say there will be hundreds in the district where once there were thousands the chinese theater is gone stores are closed chinatown is near effacement because of the closing down of gambling the chinese is the worlds natural gambler he will wager on the number of seeds in an orange on the number of grains in an ear of cornâon anything in fact that affords the chance unless he can gamble he does not stay in his home absolutely without home ties and willing even to sacrifice his business of what ever it may consist for a chance to be where he may bet something something he packs up and gets out when gambling is denied him headquarters chat it was the worst snowstorm of the year two oclock in the morning the wind struck hard at the two figures toiling through the drifts one was taller than the other a man by his manner

issue so solve it now and when you get detective story magazine the october th number see if your solution is correct here is the puzzle go to it following the arrest and conviction of slim pete who committed one of the most daring burglaries in the history of crime the police of one of our largest cities spent considerable time and went to great pains before the loot was recovered the only clews they had to work on were a note containing a pur poseless lot of words and the whispered word hoakersville which passed from the lips of pete to a pal as he tried to hand pete the slip of paper just as two detectives were leading the dejected prisoner into the station house the quick ear of one of the detectives caught the word the note was taken to the handwriting expert at police headquarters and when he had spent con siderable time with it he discovered that it contained a sentence telling the location of the spot in hoakersville where the loot was buried a search was made and the stolen property was recovered in writing the words the burglar jumbled them in an unintelligible string and intended that his pal should work over them until he had them rearranged in a sentence containing correct english in order to make it a little easier he built a skeleton of this sentence as it should be by placing the first word and each sixth word after it in its proper place and made it necessary to rearrange only the other words in his note this the handwriting expert tells us is what he meant by the memorandum in the upper lefthand corner what can you do with it st and each
