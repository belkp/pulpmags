scuitissinia vergine glided with slug gish motions out past the guardian fort on the mole and on into the open sea not until well into the afternoon with not a sail in sight and the african coast lost in the southern haze did anyone breathe freely the captain searched the hori zon carefully crossed himself twice and laughed for the first time in many hours time for the resurrection dig out the genoese pigif the pisan pig has not smothered him shouting and joking the men sprang to obey laying the meat aside they stripped off the weighty pigskin roughly and a frightful caricature of humanity sat up and glared at them messer duardo was not pretty but the pisans enjoyed his appearance the heat had melted the lard that clung to the thick skin and it warted him in gouts and gobbets ran down his purpled cheeks in shiny rivulets stuck in his upended hair and encased him from head to foot in a slippery coat that streaked and mottled him grotesquely holy san giorgio he exploded when he finally got a lungful of good untainted salt air and you laugh he roared the pisans laughed harder than ever messer duardo grasped the edges of his wicker cage and tried to clamber out but he was a greased pig and he slipped back calling upon all the saints to let him have but one chance at his tormentors with the galley rolling jerkily because of the bad stowing of her heavy cargo each time he stepped the slippery tacky mess of mingled lard and grease and blood his foot shot from under him as he raised the other to thrust it over the side of the basket the pisans rolled on the deck most helpless of all was the captain whose laughter turned into violent hiccups which infuriated him and added to the uproar on deck forgotten was all the risk they had run even the money they would make from this amazing rescue was as nothing com pared with the relish of such a gargantuan joke messer duardo stopped his futile struggling with a particularly choice sea blessing he tore off the ragged fragment that served him for trousers turned it in side out and managed to get a foothold the next instant he was out on deck glar ing naked and glistening in the sunshine gaily two of the sailors set to work with soft soap and sand to clean him it was a mighty task and as the lye in the soap bit deep into his unhealed wounds he bawled in agonies that being sloshed with cold salt water did not lessen much for some minutes so tense and anxious had everybody been when he came aboard that wounds had not been thought of now the whole crew gathered about him in pity and sympathy crossing themselves and mut tering at the savagery that would inflict such abuse on any human being as they worked now carefully and kindly messer duardo displayed a long gash in his right side when that black brother of the devil stabbed into the meat i let out all my breath and made myself very small but he touched me the first time just a hair more to one side and his knife would have struck bone then he shrugged elo quently the men crossed themselves some hours later clothed and made as comfortable as might be with a soothing ointment drawing the inflammation from his wounds his shoulder and both hands bandaged crudely but effectively and his belly comforted by the christian meat and adventure wine for which he had hungered so long in slavepen and galley messer duardo had regained a good deal of his genoese robustiousness by the time the santissima vergine reached porto pisano and was signalled to go on up the arno to the mooringrings along the levee inside the city he was as unpopular as he had been when first he stood on the foredeck of the vessel and demanded to be taken home remember grumbled the captain after the author ities had cleared the galley and given permission to unload and discharge the crew i do not entirely trust you because you are a tricky genoese you have given me a writing on your banker it is true and the mag nificent podesta of pisa has granted per mission that you may wait here until your ransom is paid but we pisans have no cause to love you genoese tf you have any sense you will not go about the city talking as you have talked on my ship i do not want you killed after all the trouble i have had to get you back to italy so behave yourself you will consider yourself my prisoner until your banker sends me the gold come back every night to sleep in my house you cannot escape the watch at every gate will be looking for you parole of a soldier snapped messer duardo haughtily i do not trust you but i have to ungrateful dog thief of a trader do i have to go about this city of cutthroats without even a dagger by the most blessed madonna you cer tainly do shouted the captain give you a weapon and let you wander around pisa looking for a chance to bury it in some noble and unsuspecting citizen you are lucky that i dont have you locked up in the gualandi tower for safekeeping messer duardo spread both hands in a scornful gesture and strode away per haps it was just as well after all not to show his contempt and hatred too plainly his hands had healed up nicely far quick er than he had dared hope and though his shoulder was still very stiff from the hole the whip had dug in the upper muscle and his slashed rib was still sore he was in excellent condition the soil of italy caressed his feet and assuaged the bitter ness of his soul his only worry now was whether messer federigo santorini had cashed his draft for the venetian and so would be unable to meet this fresh demand for funds mayhap the venetian had died in the saracen raid on rhodes and the draft had perished with him anyway there was no sense in worrying his head about it yet the captain had said a ship would be leaving for genoa in three days until it returned messer duardo felt like taking life as cheerily as god meant it to be taken he cocked his cap at a rakish angle and smiled his best at a pretty young pisan standing in a doorway the girl smiled back at him coquet tishly but he was not thinking in terms of dalliance for the moment with his mind fixed upon weapons and a mail shirt he strode on for the captain to have re fused him weapons was a perfectly natural precaution for the same man to try to take them away from him once he had them was entirely different this captain might be a blond tuscan and a stout lad but in fighting he must realize that he was a mere soft amateur compared with a vet eran crusader pursing his lips into a gay whistle that made no sound messer duardo wandered briskly on until he found what he was seeking hmmm he mused glancing into the little black shop from whose somber in terior came the glow of a forge and the clang of hammers this will serve he strode importantly in and looked about an old smith rubbing his grimy hands on his leather smock stepped forward what does your magnificence wish from me he said bowing low a blade fit to split saracen heads with a sound casque lined with good leather and a shirt of the best mail oh yes and a crusaders dagger long and heavy the armorsmith regarded him closely this time he did not bow you must be the genoese the galley santissima vergine brought in today they say you were a crusader before the infidel captured you will you take the holy cross again so soon an idea burst dazzlingly in messer duardos head if god wills it he said the sword of captain duardo with seeming indifference is pisa send ing out an expedition is pisa the armorer bowed contritely magnificence will pardon my dull wits i forgot you are but returned to italy this very day if you will go to service in the new cathedral yonder he jerked his head toward the distant jumble of building and scaffolding where the duomo was beginning to assume im posing proportions around the crypt and lady chapelyou will hear not alone the holy mass but such preaching of the cru sade as man never put ear to before ahhh if i were but a young man again messer duardo laughed at his enthu siasm i have been through it all in many a hot fight it is true that i am come but today from the galleys of the infidel while i wait in pisa for my ransom to come from genoa i must get me the arms of a gentleman magnificence will forgive me but swords and mail and stout headpieces do not come for nothing to whoever whistles after them lout i am a crusader oh aye as to that retorted the smith comfortably we all lie when it suits our purses or our needs a crusader is after all only a man messer duardo concealed his fury and caught up a splendid twoedged sword lying on a chest beside him it was a cunningly fashioned blade of sweet bal ance and a weight that exactly suited him stepping back a pace to clear the old smith he shadowfenced with it sprung the blade fiercely brandished it and laid it aside this is nothing very special he observed critically but it will serve until i can get my own armorer in genoa to replace my tongue of flame that the well i will take it anyway he finished lamely glad he had caught his impulsive tongue before it admitted that a pisan pirate had taken his favorite weapon that blade the smith said slowly is not for you forty years of experience have salted it it is so keen so true it will rive a man from crown to belly for hands that use it well or with another stroke snip lightly through fustian or silk from cathay a marvel of a blade truly scoffed messer duardo amused you will tell me next it was forged to honor his mag nificence the podesta the smith shook his grey head slowly nay sir stranger for one greater than the podesta this sword was commanded of me by no one less than the magnificent messer capitano luigi scornigiani the valiant corsair scornigiani cried messer duardo his florid face suddenly purple scor mgiani aye luigi scornigiani with this he will hew the heads from many stout ene mies of pisa ah sir genoese there is a man for you he now as god is my life bellowed mes ser duardo furiously this fellow scorni giani makes a stink in my nostrils the blood pounded in his temples and his eyes burned red and strained blood of the martyrs but i will have that sword and if that spawn of the sewers of hell and i ever meet i will flesh it in him until not even the crabs of his ocean will be able to find all the pieces hurt to shave your chin rest try a star blade on those tough stubble patches those spots

blthvtd whisky proof x rain niutral spirits adventure to be creeping over to the east i could see it out on the open lake when the water got blue and black when the gusts hit it and even in the lagoon where the little catspaws were scratching at the surface in passing he was right damn it he finished his rootbeer and we hus tled him back down to the boat for the second heat jock fussing nervously with this and that until the engine turned over and sent typhoon out onto the course again and into a good race that it was the best race she ran that year she slithered and skated and howled and roared her way across those thirty miles with chugger getting away in front and staying there all the way he was not shaded at all that time and when he bounced over the line in a flurry of spray lamont rode two lengths behind and jock got lyrical and danced and shouted and i guess that i did too but when chugger swung into the pits i saw his face and my heart lurched and jocks eyes turned black its like i said chugger remarked when the engine died im afraid shes done she aint burned up is she jock asked he looked like the whole world had caved in no but shes passing oil she needs new rings already even so i dont think shell make the third heat its getting rougher all the time out there hell she wont jock said somehow buoyed up put new rings in her youve got all night and its only eighty miles back to the yard he turned to me you go with him georgie chugger shook his head i can do it myself i dont need no help for this and if i do theres guys at the yard jock demurred but chuggerd made up his mind if it was going to be done he would do it himself that was that and we concurred the morning dawned bright and brisk and jock and i were down at the course early to watch the east wind kick the water into a ten inch chop he shook his head and looked sad as though it fore tokened something ominous i wish he was here he said where in the hell could he be anyway the heats at ten i didnt know and i wouldnt guess and jock kept muttering and fretting and studying his watch and finally at nine thirty he clutched my arm suddenly and croaked there he comes over there i turned and looked watching jocks green sedan thread through the trailers parked cars and stacked boats the trailer followed obediently but when i got a good look at it i felt my insides liquefy beside me jock moaned softly and sank down on the top of a fuel can shook my head slowly trying not to believe what chug ger had done but i had to it was there or rather she was there nell the old dowager riding in for a gay day in chi cago we should have told him jock wept we should have told him god what a peabrain he wandered off then like a stricken man when chugger weaved the trailer into the pits i was so sore i was nearly speechless but i managed to babble something about jocks fifteen grand and chugger smiled and said he knew he smiled some more but wouldnt say anything and when he saw jock tottering around by himself he merely clucked and shook his head a few times nell was in the water then and the other boats were storming out for the final run chugger climbed in and kicked her over he grinned again and waved i waved back the way you do at a small child who is leaving for school in the morning since i expected nothing but the com plete smashing of any hopes we might have had i wasnt even faintly surprised to see nell cross the starting line in seventh place and it would have been eighth if sid duroches boat hadnt wallowed and conked out in a great big wave of blue water chugger skipped around duroche and lit out after the rest of the pack going into the first turn just as the leaders la mont and gurney were coming out on the far side nell took the turn nice and if there hadnt been that big wad riding grandma was a lady her deck i would have enjoyed watching her have another fling at life as it was i had a sour sunken feeling in my middle which kept sinking lower and getting heavier as the time went on when chugger came out of the first turn he trailed the field by a good hundred yards lamont nearly up in line with the pits while nell leveled out beyond the last pylon and it got worse she was a beautiful thing to watch was old nell she had a grace and a manner with the rough chop that the others didnt have she just seemed to skim over the stuff and since the wind was from the east i could hear the high sweet hum of her engine which though some four hundred cubic inches smaller than the others seemed to be running smoother not work ing so hard nor taking the jolts of the others but races dont pay off on beauty and nice sounds and nell kept falling farther and farther back at the end of the second lap chugger lagged a half mile old nell danced past the pits on her transom and aimed her bow for the south turn far around on the other side gurney stalled again and lamont passed him easily not working hard just taking it easy but i knew that he could do that and still win probably figuring hed rather save his boat and make sure of the fifteen than knock him self out driving a hot race he didnt have much of anything to worry about that i could see nell stormed on down toward the pylon and as i followed her along the shore and into the turn my eyes drifted a little to the right and i saw jock standing there with his hands jammed deep into his dungarees he looked sad and disconsolate and every few seconds hed kick at a rock or a stone i could almost read his mind and it wasnt pleasant when the leaders came out of the turn and into the backstretch the heat was near ly half over i could see check topping the chop in a fine mist of spray and as he came down abreast of me i could hear the banshee wail of the blower and then the heavy snarl of the engine and after him came fanning and davis and versick going by in a scream and a roarand then nell up in fifth place and going by in the high woooooo of typhoons blower by god hes lost his mind complete ly it was jock looking wild and climb ing back into the pit i didnt give him any argument on that but if chuggers brains were addled they were beginning to produce something amazing in the way or results nell moved up fast skimming the water like a golden phantom and kicking out a high rooster tail that trailed far behind shell blow every brass screw in her jock croaked but she didnt chugger kept moving up fast and nearly all the way out of the water on the north turn he swung in close shaved the pylon and left versick in his wake when he came out on the shore side heading south old nell was boom ing she came by the pits like a wild thing winding up higher than id ever heard and going a damned sight faster than i thought she could she ran smooth and she ran light the chop didnt seem to be bothering her at all and i remembered then what a good roughwater boat shed always been and i wondered too if that might have oc curred to chugger or maybe it was just blind love with him whatever it was it didnt matter be cause she kept right on going she didnt blow and she didnt unravel he sneaked up quick on davis and fanning on the fourth lap and passed them in a shower of white water on the backstretch and by the time he came out of the north turn he was nosing the white foam of checks wake he stayed that way right behind him all the way through the fifth and into the sixth and last i dont know if check knew he was there or not but i dont think he did because he made no move to break his easy stride beside me jock was sitting down again and beating his head with his hands all the way through the sixth lap my blood pressure kept kiting and all the while chugger kept trailing down past the pits into the south turn down the backstretch and into the north turn but continued on page curse of the by w d hoffman buchara was knocked down and clubbed by the en raged natives and then i saw the giant xosas springing toward me shining stones the black was staggering still buchara wielded the hippohide sjambok its lash eating into the zulus flesh oozing red veins marked the glistening skin of the victim i turned sickened at the sight hard boiled as any of the mines police in going after the diamond smugglers i hated tor ture the portogreek overseer was ex ceeding his authority yet i had no right to interfere buchara was head of the kaffir gangs with instructions to stop the filching among the blacks but use of the whip was against syndicate regula tions illustbated by fbank kbameb the lashing took place in an obscure corner of the compound behind the work ers shacks out of sight of captain hong ward i could see the captain standing back at the hole looking my way his in tent searching eyes were getting on my nerves he probably suspected me of knowing where the diamonds were going i in turn suspected even he might be in volved things had got to such a state adventure everybody mistrusted everybody else even the sleuths my fear was that captain hongward might try to frame me to pro tect himself i could hear the terrible lash of buchara hissing exploding off in the hole the basuto workers xosas kaffirs mixed bantus and zulus toiled in the sultry heat ignorant of the whipping only a few offshift blacks were in this hous ing section of the compound bucharas brutality turned my sympathies toward the kaffirs they were like children if corrupted by the illicit diamond buyers the real solution was more i d b prose cutions outside the mines a low wail from an old zulu in the doorway of a corrugated iron shack drew my glance again to the torture scene now the victim was sinking to his knees his bloody kaross touching the ground his chin was still raised there was a calm haughtiness in his dusky eyes brave men those zulus and of splendid physique but there is an end to human endurance gradually as the whip con tinued to lash his bleeding body the black man went down on his face he lay un moving and i knew he was unconscious a runner now left the enclosure in a wild race toward the main compound and the mines buchara wiped his sweating brow his portogreek countenance ugly with exultation he wielded the sjambok over his head ordering a pair of kaffirs to carry the victim of his lash across the compound into the field hospital i knew well enough bu chara had exceeded his au thority yet it was not my business to tell him so but when he strode nearer my wyoming blood was ghoking me i challenged him the g m wouldnt stand for that bu chara you did it out of sight of the main compound i notice youre a damned low dog and worse than the kaffirs buchara stopped his eyes were cold his small dark red mouth hard and cruel youyou he began but feared to use the word knowing i carried a gun he was just another of your black pets ensley caught with a stone in his mouth ill break it up if i have to cut them to pieces thats orders off in the distance kaffirs on the crushers the sorting shed and in the hole halted work muttering in an ominous roar the runner had carried the news of the whipping some of the most daring began to trot toward the housing yard their oxtail girdles swaying armlets and anklets gleaming feathers waving as their lithe bodies covered the ground now a calabash drum sounded in a steady sinis ter beat from a zincandiron shanty a throbbing chant arose from hundreds of throats sullen rebellionladen i believe you lie i answered the over seer the syndicate would never stand for that sort of thing the mixed blood of the portogreek went black in his sodden face you sneaked in here to spy on me did you stand back you damned yankee blight er he lifted the sjambok in a threaten ing gesture sight of that deadly whip got me i struck his leering face with a fist that had a hard lift behind it buchara went down like a sack of diamond mud blacks were swarming into the yard i sensed the thrill among them as they stared toward me and the fallen overseer their mournful chant took on a shriller note for a minute i regretted the blow fearing a dangerous outbreak if they killed buchara fortunately he was able to drag himself back on his stocky legs we faced each other a full minute i knew the portogreek was a coward at heart and in spite of the whip he feared me so he stammered cravenly wip ing his battered mouth youve made more friends among the jackals by that ensley he lumbered off muttering what he dared not call me openly the zulu chant became a wail of agony and of protest i squinted toward the dis tant field hospital dr jeffrey stood there waiting while they carried the unconscious victim through the door attracted by the running blacks cap tain hongward of the mines police ap proached me from his quarters with him was the visiting chief of the south african constabulary dawson as i crossed to meet them the chant of the natives broke into the equivalent of a cheer baasinkoos son of the yel curse of the shining stones lowmaned one knocking down bu chara had made me a hero among the zulus yet i noticed a giant xosas sub boss eyeing me with sinister hostility i had had a little trouble with this fellow be fore he was known as the lizard lagavaan his six months contract serv ice was up and he was leaving today you hit him rapped captain hong ward serious business ensley his jaw squared meet me in the g ms office in the morning i nodded losing my job would be bet ter than jail on a frameup charge the drum beats had stoppeda guard had ordered the weazened old drummer out of the shanty later in the afternoon at the xosas pit in the hole a hurried gathering of offi cials took place they were taking out of the blue earth a whitish mass that looked like rock salt the size of a pigeons egg it had been found before the usual trip through the crushers kaffirs were mut tering blink klip shining stone guard lines were quickly thrown around the workers buchara the overseer wielded a piece of pipe driving the kaffirs back others crowded up jabbering excitedly the commissioners agent gave his opinion the diamond was purewater of equal quality with the best de beers or premier laughingly he named the new find dawson in honor of the visiting chief of the constabulary suddenly the blacks rushed buchara he had done something i did not see the pipe was wrenched from his hand he was clubbed by the enraged natives knocked down and a dozen of the blacks leaped upon him kicking the life out of him as the guards rushed to his aid i saw the giant xosas the lizard springing toward me with the uplifted pipe in his huge hand before could back off or pull my gun he had struck me through the hel met knocked senseless for the moment my head was a wrenching exploding chaos visions of a hundred battling blacks danced through my brain gradually i fought off the dizzy nausea captain hongward and dawson were helping me back out of the pit guards at gun point held the furious zulus who had bounded to my aid when the xosas kaffir attacked the lizard was badly mauled would have been clubbed to death but for the guns of the guards but those guns could not save buchara the brutal portogreek whipper was dead in the hospital dr jef frey looked me over and i was given leave for the day well old chap he said you got yourself out of hand with bu chara now the blacks have killed him i hope they dont charge you with incite ment to murder i thought you americans were made of sterner stuff eh what buchara had it coming i said grim ly and told how he had exceeded authority in using the sjambok that zulu doc tordid he come through no ruptured appendix jeffrey an swered ruptured appendix i stared into the etherfumed operating room the blighter would have died anyway within a week important kkeml kreme never leaves anv while

advantage of relieving dryness of both hair and scalp removes itchy dandruff flakea vmsra vkessmmzmz fox adventure as i looked into his pinched face and the pale gray eyes i marveled at his pro fessional callousness by the by ens ley he said cant you and marcia be my guests at the rhodes jubilee thurs day evening i evaded that my wife did not much care for dr jeffrey marcia a montana girl was unquestionably one of the most beautiful women in south africa she was returning that evening by capecart from a blesbokshooting trip into the veldt with the colonial secretarys party carry ing her montana love of hunting into the colony take a rest for a few days jeffrey advised with a laugh from the looks of that riot id say you werent too safe in the compound from now on that evening at the diamondfields club i ran into general manager rafflehold over his whiskysoda he beckoned me to his table i hastened to block immediate discharge by narrating the whipping in cident buchara overstepped himself the g m assented frowning that doesnt justify his murder do you know any thing ensleywhat happened during the riot it was a queer question and i did not get it at the time i told what i had seen and argued that our efforts should be con centrated on the i d bs outside the compound for awhile rafflehold scowled more would take their place the jails are full of them and still they operate he eyed me pity ingly you came highly recommended ensley experience checking highgraders in america and all that yet smuggling goes on right under your nose i doubt the blacks are doing most of it i said stubbornly you dont know my man you dont even know what happened this afternoon ask captain hongward he gave me a penetrating look as though he suspected me then he went on to say how serious the syndicate regarded the exportation of uncut i d b stones to new york and amsterdam flooding the market threatening the world price on diamonds no more valuable than opals if the vaults of the syndicate alone were thrown open theres a trick in the compound he declared angrily i counted upon you to learn what it was ironically he repeated the old story of carrier pigeons the arm pit incision the hungry dog fed diamondencrusted meat reiterated how when the recreational director allowed the blacks to play american baseball an over thetence ball was found loaded with gems how even a boxing kangaroo had been brought into the compound and its pouch stuffed with stones were smugglerproof with a charged fence he scoffed and yet the traffic goes on great scott ensley havent you got an idea i was making a lame defense when cap tain hongward entered when rafflehold was through the captain called me to his rooms youll have to strip he said i obeyed readily submitting to the search knowing there must be a reason for such extraordinary precautions hong ward was closemouthed until he had done his duty regulations old fellow he said then genially nobody was exempt not even myself the dawson diamond disappeared during the riot this afternoon at the xosas pit i was speechless that was what the g m had meant when he said i didnt know anything yes hongward went on blandly it will jolly well cost us all our posts uness we recover it the stockade is full of blacks under examination and charged with bucharas murder weve gone over the whitesyoure the last the devil of it is everybody is suspected he laughed uneasily watching me out of the corner of his eye i wouldnt be surprised if you had it in the back of your head that even i might be in on it eh what i was startled at his manner there was a threat behind the bantering ques tion he had only implanted more deeply the ugly idea i had in mind i acquit you i returned making a joke of it a real sleuth has got to suspect his own brother in this game he went on with a shrug thats the hell of not having anything to work on the plunder doesnt fly out on pigeons wings or by airplane thats certain yet it goes out by physical means its our job to learn how his pupils contracted into an intent curse of the shining stones stare i say old fellow he went on slowly since youve talked to the g m forget that meeting in his office youre not going to be discharged for knocking buchara down thanks i wondered if he didnt need me on the job for a more serious charge he was considering it was in my mind to go to work that very night among some i d b suspects outside the compound on going down to the transport station i learned my wife had already arrived i hurried out to our cottage marcia still in hunting togs seemed upset as she turned to kiss me i noticed she was pale in spite of the suntan from the trek dr jeffrey was here she said in a disgusted tone of voice i didnt know whether i should tell you i did not understand at first but why why shouldnt you tell me i had just arrived home from the trek she said angrily then he came inviting me to the dance thursday night with you he said you hadnt made up your mind and he would take me if you didnt go i never liked him he had shown too darned much interest in me before though i never had mentioned it knowing your temperand i had heard he was somewhat of a rake he made advances said he was infatuated and that sort of rot suddenly he tried to kiss me and i struck him and ordered him out i leaped to my feet dumbfounded ill get the dog for that i cried marcia shook me there i knew you would fly off the handle well the rotter wouldnt leave until i told him you were coming he begged me not to tell you on account of his position also said it would make an ugly situation for me if you tried to force a scandal of it better not make anything of it chuck except to tell him to watch his step for the first time since our wedding my mind rocked with jealousy with hate of a man because of marcia but with my wife in my arms tender with emotion i knew she was in no way to blame for what had happened dr jeffrey would answer to me privately and effectively say nothing to anyone i cautioned marcia ive got a night assignment and will be back about midnight no it isnt to go after that crawling insectjust yet i wanted to prevent public gossiping that might involve marcias name with the dapper doctor then too the trip to flavins would help drive the bitter thing from my thoughts i related the days events in the compound told where i would be if needed she begged me to take no un necessary risks in my lizzie i drove out on the country road to the queens good fellow flavin the greek con ducted a pub and dance es tablishment that had har bored i d bs in the past wed sent over several greeks to join the horde in the old fort prison mozambique angola and union but we never could pin anything on flavin id made myself an occasional patron at the place flavin a broadfaced oily white encouraged european trade bibu lous remittance men portuguese and english sailors boerdutch with sepa rate accommodations for mixed breeds kaffirs and other blacks an ideal under world setup for the traffic the place was well filled the noisy crowd helped drive from mind the picture of jeffrey annoying my devoted golden haired marcia flavin mingling with his customers at the tables and the bar had his eyes on me from the start i knew he would tip off those in the trade but i came out into the open with him now told him i was looking for the dawson stone his cold eves did not water you can search senhor i swear i know noth ing i would not take such a risk this is my businessi do not seek to work on the breakwater look around my friend and welcome flavin was cunning if guilty i watched the greeks in particular throughout the evening with an eye on the blacks who might contact them several had been released from their long compound service that day but if there was any transaction among them i did not discover it it was after midnight when i decided to leave intending to return unexpectedly in an hour or two at the front entrance a sharp pang brought me around with a jerk in the adventure doorjamb quivered a longbladed knife instantly four zulus dashed toward me jabbering others rushed toward a side room i drew my automatic lagavaan lagavaan cried the zulus and i knew they meant the lizard had hurled the knife turning i sped with them back into the pub other blacks were hurling chairs and a dopkeg against a side door we rushed forward as the door crashed inward there stood the giant xosas togged out in a red jacket and dirty soldiers pants o lagavaan evil doer you have taken the shining stones chanted a zulu our baasinkoos the black mans friend son of the yellow maned one has come to use the white mans magic the lizard sprang like a huge leopard toward the entrance leaping high knock ing a pair of zulus sprawling i struck at his kinky head with my pistol hit him a glancing blow three other zulus hurled themselves upon him dragging him back into the little room they stretched him out arms held wide legs spread one of them sitting on his chest quickly they applied a refined form of torture his fingers were bent back and a workyellowed thumb pressed at his twitching neck behind the ear his eyes rolled like chalk and his tongue wobbled in and out at last he was willing to talk he had stolen diamonds in the compound and turned them over to the portogreek buchara who kept the shining stones in a hollow of the sjambok whipstock he knew nothing of the big gem he swore by the great chaka the black napoleon he did not understand how buchara had smuggled the contraband out of the com pound at my command the zulus released the big kaffir it had turned out a fairly good nights work after all that whip secret was my first real clew smuggling from the compound would probably cease for awhile with buchara dead i put handcuffs on lagavaan and drove him to the compound detention quarters then proceeded home a light was burning and marcia was up though it was past one oclock in the morning our basuto boy sat on the stoop a knobkerrie club in his hand i saw the fright in marcias blue eyes as she opened the door at my call did you see any one out there she quavered several men were hiding in the pampai dont know whether they were blacks or not ill go see i turned taking the gun from my shoulder holster my wife clung to me fearing to let me go i pressed her back ill kill the skul kers whom will you kill ensley came the brittle voice of captain hongward as he yanked in the door he walked slowly toward me sorry old man but ive got a reason for making another search been waiting for you never mind strip ping just yet he bowed and apologized to marcia his rugged face harsh in the lamplight stopping close to me he ran his hands into my pockets his gray eyes contracted and his mouth went hard as his fingers scraped the bot tom of a coat pocket slowly he drew out his hand opened it and exposed three whitish pebbles the size of a large pea each blink klips he said blandly i stared at the three rough diamonds it was hard to believe what i saw marcias face had gone gray i faced the captain with an effort at control ive just been at the queens good fellow if those stones were in my pocket someone there planted them on me i said levelly i just took lagavaan to the compound jail but he was handcuffed and could hardly have done it sorry you know what this means ensley youll have to tell that plausible story to the magistrate madam look ing grimly at my wife i regret this thing had to happen for your sake i sat down weak with shock to have uncut dia monds in ones possession was an inescapable felony the penalty seven years unless i could produce witnesses to prove i had confis cated them as an officer i would be in the same situation as any i d b culprit fac ing a long sentence at hard labor on the capetown breakwater someone in flavins pub put them thereto get me out of the way i choked captain you dont suspect im a criminal do you curse of the shining stones in this game weve got to suspect even our own brother hongward said thinly my job is to take you in but im not through yet ensley hadnt you better save your own time and mine by producing the dawson stoneor shall i go ahead with the search that angered me marcia had flung herself into my arms sobbing look here hongward i flared if someone didnt slip them into my pocket during the melee when i caught the lizard to night then maybe you did it just now why would i do that he asked for the same reason they might have done it at flavinsto put me away right when im getting hot on the trail id advise you not to talk yourself into conviction ensley hongward cut in sourly youre only proving the case by admitting you cant tell the source of the stones wildly charging even me with planting them on you saw my temper had gotten the best of me the captain stepped to the door called in three of my fellow officers the next hour saw me searched to the skin and the house ransacked from ceiling to plumbing even the pipes being sounded in the hunt for the big dawson stone too bad hongward said at last maybe youve got it inside the compound yet i feel sorry for you and mrs ensley too shell have to get along without you for quite awhile i fear its late he added brusquely ill hold several men outside you can get some sleep and go along to the magistrate in the morning dismissing his men he bowed to my wife walked out and relocked the door with his own passkey maybe it was decent of him to give me this consideration on account of the injury i had suffered in the riot i wasnt able to make up my mind about him but the suspicion that he had crowded his hand in my pocket with the diamonds already in his fingers persisted the deaf ear he turned to my account of the flavin raid the knife attempt on my life and the lizards arrest showed him to be as hard as the missing stones he soughtmaybe because he was blind to everything but his duty maybe for another reason i got little sleep with the police guard patrolling the yard with the prospect of years in the penitentiary but i thought it all out i was trapped unless i could find the man who had planted the evidence on me and prove he had done it this looked hopeless with me in custody when hongward returned in the morning i stalled for time if youll take me to the compound on the way to the magistrate ill show you some real evidence i offered the whipstock was in my mind and i wanted to study hongwards reaction to that also i wanted to get into the compound for a lastminute punch at dr jeffrey before the jail doors clanged shut behind me the captain hesitated eyeing me sus piciously i had not told him of the sjambok maybe he did not want any real evidence if he was mixed up in the thing i had to let him think i was coming clean with a deal involving the blacks no shenanigans the captain warned as i tore myself from my distraught wife and entered his car on passing through the compound gate yoo too oo can keep awake when you have to with a nodoz awakener since americas famous wakeup tablet harmless as coffee why fake a chance at the wheelall asleep in a movieyawn thru a bridge game it it easy safe convenientto keep awake with com adventure i led hongward around to the slain porto greeks quarters and found the sjambok without trouble fingering the butt of the whip i soon discovered a screw cap of metal when opened it showed the stock was hollow as the lizard had said hongwards eyes were veiled as he looked at it buchara he muttered he got the stones from the blacks slipped them into the whipstock then passed them to you his heavy neck veins bulged but even you had to sub mit to search on leaving how did you do it ensley maybe i didnt i said banteringly maybe someone else was the smuggler you said youd have some real evi dence he grated if this is the extent of it well be moving on i was stumped desperately determined to delay arraignment and jail without bond i couldnt tell a plausible lie even had i wanted to lacking the key to the allimportant part of the compound running that whip i knew had never been taken out of the minebuchara would not have dared let it be known he was using such an instrument of punishment come along if thats all youre tell ing hongward ordered lets go into the hospital i proposed pretending there might be a link in the evidence there my real object now was to fly at dr jeffreys throat or club him with anything in sight as a parting shot to the outside world the thought of marcia being alone for seven years in the same colony with jeffrey was worse torture than the whip would have been dont forget were after the dawson stone hongward reminded assenting grudgingly as we passed the hole the zulus raised a chorus of baasinkoos the boss friendson of the yellow maned one matagati the wise man who searches for the big shining stone bowing and scraping they made it known the amazulu were my friends and servants i turned to the captain whats going to happen to those boys who killed buchara he jerked his thumb toward the deten tion jail at the edge of the compound theyll all be given long terms for that after dr jeffrey goes over their naked bodies with the xrays for hidden stones his voice chilled get the dawson diamond i felt his gun boring into my side that stone disappeared in the riot after i was hit over the head i scoffed true hongward gritted but you know how it was accomplished you can tell where the dawson is very likely to be want that information ensley he seemed in earnest about it i could not have given that information any more than the g m himself knowing a smat tering of the zulu tongue i called out to the workers in the hole amazulu people of the zulu attention inkoosie zaua o brothers of the yellowmaned one i orated in their rounded phrases if you love the white friend of the black man tell me what became of the big shining stone of yesterday in the name of the great chaka and cetewayo and the mighty impics of dinizulu let the big shining stone have voice so that your white brother may hear it sounded like a lot of hooey of course unless you know zulu nature i was gambling on the chance that some of the blacks might have seen who took the big diamond during the riot but from the blank faces of the natives and their silence i knew they were as much in the dark as i was at that moment i saw dr jef frey crossing to the detention building where the prisoners were confined take me there i think i can get the stone i told hongward another stall sneered the captain the big kaffir i arrested named iagavaan is in there hes a confederate of buchara maybe i can make him talk it may cut your sentence a little if you do growled my guard and we start ed for the compound jail jeffrey was leaving by a side door with four kaffir prisoners under guard taking them to the hospital for examination cursing my bad luck i was forced to delay meeting jeffrey for the time being we entered the detention quarters and hunted up the lizard curse of the shining stones he had been placed in a solitary cell by the jailer after i had delivered him at the captains request the jailer un locked the cell door go in and talk to him directed hongward i stepped in feeling safe against the black with the two armed officers on hand but the moment i was in hongward snapped the lock and rushed away with the jailer a disturbance among the prisoners at the rear might have led him to do this but it looked to me as though he had another object if in on the traffic he would know how lagavaan longed to strangle me before i could open my mouth the giant kaffir sprang at me his great eyes bulging in a blaze of hate and vrngeance i was unarmed and no match for such a specimen his fingers locked about my throat like enormous talons and he bore me down to the cell floor chocking me i could hear hongward talking to the jailer as the cell whirled and my breath swelled with the wrenching agony of that grip i saw the burly officer as the real murderer willing to have me killed be cause i suspected him the apelike kaffir would have strangled me in a couple of minutes sparing me the long prison term but for a grip i managed to get on the little finger of his throttling hand i twisted it forced it back and heard the bone snap he released his hold jumped up and got ready for an other spring rising quickly i tried to face him down pretending fearlessness and mas tery i came to spare you from the sjambok lagavaan i said steadily from the sudden terror in his eyes i knew he dreaded the whip above every thing even a term in prison he quailed staring at me and i knew i was safe your friend buchara is dead i am the only induana of the black man who can save you from the torture i told him in a lame bantu dialect where is the big shining stone out with it i know not inkoos he wavered fright in his eyes my belly is full of the little shining stones he went on in his native tongue o save me from the whip friend of the black man those who go under the sjambok always join the dead in the sands of the kopje he meant the burial plot beyond the compound i realized lagavaan attacked and beaten during the riot had had no part in stealing the dawson stone and though he was diamondstudded within from swallowed gems that did not help me to unearth the prize hongward and the jailer returned to the cell no dice yet i told the captain grimly but take me to the hospital to question jeffrey about his xray tests on the prisoners to get a chance to confront jeffrey i was willing to ignore the cell incident dont worry ensley youre scheduled for an xray examination yourself hongward grunted i hid my elation id settle with jeffrey as much as an un armed man could do it then hongward said the g m was waiting to see me we went into the ad ministration office raffle hold called me into a private room im amazed ensley at the news about you he began for a time he lectured me about yielding to what the kaffirs called the curse of the shin ing stones risking the penitentiary for illicit gain something he never expected of a man of my standing disgracing myself and bringing sorrow to a young and beautiful wife suddenly he leaned for ward i dont often do this ensley but the dawson stone is of such value ill not prosecute if you produce it or tell us the operating methods of the smugglers so we may find it do that and you and your wife may take the first boat and leave south africa i felt like a whipped cur admiring the g m as i did and seeing him regard me as an ungrateful thief leaving south africa in disgrace would have been pre ferred to what i was facing yet he might as well have offered me the moon i denied i knew about the big gem but it was plain he did not believe me the interview ended with his fervent promise to prose cute and ask for the sevenyear limit come along ensley hongward directed youll have to go through with the xray routine with the blacks he escorted me to the hospital adventure dr jeffrey and his assistants were busy with the rioters who had killed buchara mainly zulus it was unlikely any of them had swallowed a stone as large as the dawson find but regulations called for examination for smaller gems doctor you may not have heard of ensleys arrest the captain said as jeffrey came into the waiting room we took three uncut blink klips from him at his home during the night jeffreys lightish eyes contracted as he looked at me i was waiting for him to come a step closer by jove ensley he breathed i hate to see you in this fix old man his pale thin face went cold hard on marcia eh what my lips were taut and my eyes bored into his he did not waver though he must have known from my look that marcia had told me everything i edged nearer i feel damned sorry for marcia he had the audacity to remark come in ill have to xray you he turned his back with hongward i entered the laboratory an assistant was just finishing with a black and he motioned to the table youre next i could see nothing but jeffreys un healthy face measuring it for the blow the glistening tight skin the pale eyes the thinlipped mouththose lips he had tried to force on marcia my brain went on fire and i struck my fist reached him full on the mouth drawing blood on my knuckles loosening a tooth or two but he caught himself as he staggered back holding his legs the captain grabbed me uttering an oath jeffrey tried to laugh his bruised mouth working its a personal matter between us captain he said with sur prising calm i dont think hell explain but ill have to strap him to the table or he might do it again he called to a young english interne and with the willing help of hongward raised me to the table and buckled me down with straps used for that purpose on unruly blacks i was held down by arms and legs the metal carrier was rolled over under the xray machine you neednt wait captain jeffrey said it may take an hour on account of the rushing business this morning under guard more blacks were filing into the waiting room and among them i glimpsed lagavaan the lizard as they passed the door fright was in his ebony face doubtless because he knew those swallowed gems would be located by the white mans wizardry then he would go to the breakwater an assistant moved the ray focusfinder above me the machine hissing intermit tently as the power was applied while this was going on jeffrey directed a guard to bring lagavaan into his office they were there for some time then the kaffir was wheeled out on a narrow surgical table into the operating room jeffrey now came to me his swollen lacerated mouth greasy with salve took my tem perature and some drops of blood from my veins placing them between squares of glass taking my blood count i won dered about that he was gone for fifteen minutes then returned and wheeled me into the operat ing room with the lizard that alarmed me whats this i gritted between my teeth jeffrey laughed turned and locked the door leaving me alone with him ap pendicitis he said softly my spine went suddenly cold he turned to the kaffir who like me was strapped in told him in dialect not to be afraidthat i alone would go under the knife marcia told you he asked blandly my nostrils were stinging with the pun gent odor of ether is this murder i choked as he clamped the ether pack over my mouth and nostrils acting as his own anesthetist i fought to raise my arms to fight him bulging the straps but they held firm jeffrey had me completely at his mercy he had not covered my eyes i could see his white deadly face like that of a man wasting from narcotics and the pinpoint pupils were those of an addict in that terrible moment i realized i was in the grip of a fiend he was probably engaged in the illicit diamond traffic like an electric shock the truth hit me it was dr jeffrey in our home who had planted those uncut stones on me he had placed them in the pocket of my suit coat hanging on the wall while he visited curse of the shining stones marcia i had forgotten until this mo ment i had taken off my work jacket and donned the coat before going to the queens good fellow wmi tried to cry out but jsxvliml ony a muffled squeak came from the ether pack the fumes of the drug were stran gling me breathe deeply he whis pered into my ear youll be under in a minute before you go my dear fellow please realize this is for my own protec tionsince you know so much with buchara gone and you gone ill take care of my friend lagavaan his words were growing fainter as the drug began to affect me i could hardly strain at the straps now but his callous limecolored face was as vivid before my eyes as ever now his free hand raised holding before my gaze the big dawson diamond since you are such a smart detective look at it he murmured i had intended to sew it up in lagavaan with some others so senhor flavin could locate it on the kopje in his grave but now i think ill let you be the carrier my clever friend quite a joke whatensley smuggling out the big stone after all can you hear me ill help marcia with the funeral arrangements sweet dreams and goodbye i was passing out a great round point of purple light seemed to whirl far out in the heavens and then draw down upon me in that twilight zone i was faintly con scious of a thumping sound of a struggle i sucked in a strangled breath then a quick succession of lifegiving draughts that revived me and realized the pack was off my face the giant kaffir and the doctor were tumbling wildly about the room i knew lagavaans muscular body had burst the straps of the table as in a frenzy of fear he had seen what jeffrey was doing to me believing his turn would be next abrupt ly i saw the lizard plunging headlong through the window shattering the glass all about jeffrey staggered to the door turned the lock and a revolver was in his hand i could hear the kaffir yelling jeffrey dashed out three quick shots roared in the compound the cries of the xosas giant broke off in a moment jeffrey ran back into the surgery panting and excited the gun still in his hand he turned the key in the lock and in terror i saw him take up the ether pack once more having killed the big lagavaan he was going to finish the job of wiping out the evidence seeing to it that i died in the operation using my body as a ghoulish device for running the compound gates only the wild dream of a dope addict could have conceived it my will battled against the weakening tide overwhelming me with marcia seem ing to beckon me a tremendous roar broke upon my ears i thought it was the ether through my brain rushed a pic ture of buchara plying the torturous sjambok lashing struggling kaffirs into unconsciousness so that jeffrey might ply his murder trade at intervals to furnish human deposit boxes for illicit gems the building shook a weird frenzied continued on page shocking facts about pinworms you may

pnforpinnorm dan carpenters fingers were itching for the wheel he was master of this small ship and she was making her first cargo port why shouldnt he take her in he lifted his binoculars and stared hard at the break in the coast that was san ybel above as if poised to pounce on the little port crowded the wrinkled mountains of puerto rico at the wheel john lane straightened his tall body and glanced inquiringly at dan you know this place john dan carpenter said and leaned moodily against the side panel of the islanders tiny wheel house masterly inaction a ship is a dead thing without a crew but only a skipper he was discovering knew what a headache a crew was he had spent plenty to make sure there was nothing wrong with his ship such as she was a hundredtenfoot subchaser converted to carry cargo but sure as shooting there was something wrong with his crew that was the stiff job nurse maiding the crew not handling the ship i ought to le carrying a lousy psychol ogist in davits aft he muttered sourly whats eating this bunch illustrated bt charles geer he was her master captain dan car enter and he couldnt show distrust of is mate of his engineer of his cook or of his three deckhands although every last one of them was slanteyed about some thing or maybe about somebody for example tall john lane there at the wheel once her master and owner now her mate just what did they anticipate treach ery or no pay anyhow this unease was for him to soothe he was her master their papa if he was the youngest guy in the ship the islander approached the erratic clangor of the sea buoy no pilot offered although the pilot would be in the port charges the little ship her diesels throttled well down entered a channel that threaded a way through broad flats john lanes spare sunwrinkled hands eased over the a new light suddenly hooded the belle kates deck and a siren let go a scream of warning richard howells watkins adventure wheel carefully to compensate for a stiff easterly that hit her on the beam the man was a seaman sure every one of these six including lane seemed to be waiting for something to happen something not nice dan carpenter scrutinized the port not a ship stirring of the handful within but of course this was sunday think capn colmars right about there being some cargo here dan asked he has a nose for freights skipper john lane said tonelessly he squinted his eyes theres his belle kate in line with the cathedral the islanders engineer cliff bronson stuck his greasy visored cap into the wheelhouse he was no bigger than a jockey but he never let it bother him you cant spot crated pineapple from here skipper he said grinning relax im looking for an engineer wholl stand by his motors while were entering port dan said going aint i hey cliff jerked a thumb and screwed up his face mysteri ously dan carpenter stepped down out of the pilothouse and followed the small engineer aft to the engineroom companion cliff jerked his thumb again john lanes a good seaman and a square enough guy though shy and standoffish he said but his luck is strictly class z so it was lane who caused this un ease lane and his luck well dans voice was frosty im scared a meteor will sock him just as hes trying to lay her alongside you better take her yourself skipper men make their own luck dan said forget it forget how he lost six weeks at cien fuegos waiting for a boat charter that didnt show how he was caught laid up in a shipyard when the boys went on strike how he had her near burnt up on him in port au prince how if youve got any charge to make against lane spit it out cliff dan said crisply otherwise go take a look at your lube oil gauges im not firing a man for having bad luck charge i like the guy cliff pro tested its just i dont want to see you lose the islander back to that money lendin capn colmar like he did and ok im going he shot feet first down the oily ladder as if intent on suicide his heel hooked into an iron rung he fell heavily to the plates and sprawled there motion less dan slid down and picked him up after a moment cliff waggled his scrawny neck feebly never did that before in my life he muttered see what i mean you were due for it dan said hold ing him up all right now the ships bottom rose abruptly under them they fell together the port diesel lifted on its bed its shaft breaking into shattering clamor cliff scrambled up and staggered forward dan beat him to the controls and killed the motor start your bilge pump dan shouted shes holed he streaked up the ladder and toward the pilot house wrecked in a broad chan nel with fists clenched and eyes blazing he thrust past the wavering cook and the three sailors the stricken gray face of john lane confronted him the man hands clutch ing the wheel was trembling but the ship was already headed toward a sandbar east of the channel i was going to beach her lane said tautly he stepped to one side of the wheel silently dan grabbed the spokes he set the starboard engine telegraph to dead slow and turned her into the wind to kill her speed measuring the distance to the sandbar he beckoned to a sailor miguel go to the engine room ask the chief how high the water is getting the man ran dans eyes swept the channel a black can buoy near at hand marked a sharp turn what happened dan asked savage eyes turning to lane did you cut that can lane hesitated moving his lips i would swear i left it to port he said i you wont believe me he dropped suddenly onto the helms mans stool as if his backbone had turned make your own luck to water i dont believe myself he said hoarsely ii dont believe plainly the smart thing to do was to bounce this guy onto the beach fast and fight on from there with a united un jittery crew on the other hand lane was in her crew and he dan carpenter was her master lets have a look at that chart dan said bear a hand will you john lanes teeth were gritting he grabbed the chart folded it over and with a trembling finger indicated their location the cans station was off a reaching coral reef invisible in the roiled water of the bay miguel stuck his head in teeth agleam in his twisted mouth chief say water his hand palm down lifted quickly he rig another pump shakily lane pointed toward the head of the harbor capn colmars coming why not dan muttered sardonical ly hes still got five thousand bucks in this busted hull and he knows i figured on insuring her after i got my first freight miguel waved an arm toward a sizable steamer anchored nearer the town in the only spot of deep water shown on the chart she was lowering a lifeboat this isnt a marine disaster dan growled its only a bankruptcy his eyes probed again at john lane i can only say im sorry lanes voice was desperate youre thinking i wrecked her out of spiteor envybut well hold the inquest later dan said why didnt he suspect lane of treachery a master should know his men as well as he knew his ship what else but treachery could you call this go below and estimate the damage dan said i wont beach her unless theres a marine railway in san ybel thatll take her i dont doubt itll take her dan said thinking of the two hundred left in the strongbox in the tiny chartroom get the report miguels soft brown eyes stared curi ously at lanes departing back she is not lucky thees ship capitan he said not for senor lane no his curiosity switched to carpenter get the anchor clear to let go dan commanded harshly move the motor lifeboat from the freighter horace c brown closed up a lean ram rod of a man in her sternsheetscapn slocum he called himselfproffered a rather contemptuous offer of help dan declined he looked toward the buoy any other ship come in today he asked captain slocums eyes followed his no i arrived yesterday and that ves sel his eyes indicated colmars belle kate came in during the night the buoys not adrift captain did you leave it to port the contempt was plain now in the nasal voice redfaced dan did not an swer youd better beach her or head for the yard captain slocum said tartly as he swung his tiller a ship on the bot toms expensive dan kept her on the edge of the channel as he waited for lanes report was there a chance he could beach and careen her and make satisfactory repairs with his own dispirited men lane came back wet dirty and tautlipped she was holed forward and amidships the port tailshaft had cracked and done serious damage to the diesel the two pumps were about holding the water dan scowled at the black can think back lane he said exactly what happened idid say i left it to port lane said his hollow voice was not convincing or even convinced why didnt he lie better than that if hed cut it there was a catch here just for laughs im going to take soundings around that marker dan said miguel you and tonio get the boat over colmars belle kate twice the little islanders tonnage ranged alongside her colmar squat blackhaired stood at the rail waiting his chance and swung his short body surely across a threefoot gap down onto dans deck the two craft diverged colmars keen gray eyes drove john lane out of the pilothouse he asked calm unhurried questions adventure i was just figuring on dropping a sounding line around that buoy dan said shamefaced in spite of himself was he at the wheel captain col mar asked with a twitch of an eye toward lane dan nodded that explains it son colmar said he hesitated i was watching through my glasses didnt you keep an eye on him he cut the buoy colmar nodded quickly i told you he wasnt reliable he reminded dan calmly thats why i finally had to take over his ship all i said to you in his favor was that he did know the islands the shipping agents the business reliable or not dan said slowly hes got a masters ticket and it becomes ingrained in a man right said captain colmar his voice remained even theres no use hunting excuses for lane we masters must be hard men about the safety of our ships lane smacked that reef because i sold you his ship some mens minds work like that dan grunted how mens minds work is always news to me lets be charitable and say hes hay wire colmar said almost indifferently get rid of him son when im sure said dan slowly he pointed at the buoy you wouldnt check the water youre a shipmaster now colmar said the story of how you hit a rock and then tried to blame it on a govern ment marker would follow you all over the islandsmake you a figure of fun dan nodded over on the belle kate chain rattled through a hawsepipe and the ships anchor plunged into the shoal water in the shelter of the reef ill lie here tonight colmar explained in response to dans surprise im set to leave at ten in the morning to grab a juicy five trip charter if i get another radio from miami why arent you heading for the yard broke i was making up my mind dan said slowly youre wasting time colmar said calmly he tapped his toe on the dead deck shes logy already i had some notion of beaching her captain colmar shook his head ive got to remind you that amateur fumbling wont mend this ship thats what a ship yards for the one here is reliable i understand you own a piece of it dan said and watched him with some intensity colmar frowned very slightly beside the point he said this ship is my security for the five thousand you owe me i have a natural interest his voice became casual if you want to hand her over ill take a look below and see if i can allow you anything on whats left of her allow me colmars eyes opened widely a slight smile twisted his lips you dont think a craft like this bare ly able to stay above water is worth much more than five thousand dollars do you i paid you before she was wrecked dan carpenter shook his head you think too fast for me captain he said ill need time to catch up and ive also to talk to my engineer im in the way captain colmar said he smiled encouragingly and laid a hand briefly on dans shoulder son youre taking this like a soldier im trying to take it like a sailor dan said get her to the yard colmar advised buy yourself a drink and sleep on it now if youll call a hand to row me to my ship further aft cliff bronson stuck his head up above the engineroom companion to stare at the departing visitor his nose was still swelling from his recent dive and he fussed at it with a greasy hand finally he emerged all the way and came along to the pilothouse he glanced at his watch and at the flaming red sunset dont pull the brass knucks on me skipper he said gloomily im not say ing i told you so right now were holding the leaks but if one o those pumps sneezes keep em turning dan said he watched captain colmar board his an chored vessel with smooth ease he was met on deck by his engineer a massive man in dungaree pants a full head taller make your own luck than colmar they disappeared together into the narrow wheelhouse dan reached for the almanac he looked up the moon with cliff watching suspiciously rises at nine minutes past midnight dan said to the inquisitive engineer cliff bronson muttered peevishly his eyes slid forward to where john lane was sitting on a hatch hunched over watching his twisting fingers that guy is cracking up cliff said bad as this smells id say it was just more tough luck but lanes stood his last watch or the board of inquiry is nuts the board isnt going to like me either dan said unless i make myself some luck huh you heard me right dan said a floating nuthouseand not so very high it aint floating neither cliff bron son said in disgust and stamped aft while the sunset blazed more fiercely john lane went overside with a rope around his middle after lungtearing underwater efforts he tacked a square of canvas smeared thick with white lead over the forward hole dan had not objected to the project and he watched dispassionately there was nothing phony about lanes efforts he wanted to stop that leak the job eased the labor of the pumps only slightly but it helped dan make up his mind while doubt remained in his mind he couldnt chuck any man of his crew onto the beach across on the anchored belle kate captain colmar from behind watchful binoculars roared hearty approval of lanes attempt too hearty the doctors belated boat came out gave the islander pratique and accepted a carton of cigarettes while the sunsets flames were dulling to tropic night dan made two tentative passes at the sandbank south of colmars ship each time he reversed his single motor and drew away just before the islanders bow took the sloping sand these hesitations won no comment from captain colmar or his burly engineer as darkness closed in around the leaking islander the uneasiness of dans three sailors and the cook was rising almost to the verge of mutiny they wanted action to beach her or run her to the shipyard to do something lane stood by in silence cliff bronsons cracks were get ting sharper nobody understood that the san ybel shipyard meant finish without a fight in the pilothouse dan inspected the blackness of the night thick enough he turned the wheel and headed the islander toward the channel then called john lane to the helm im going over in the rowboat to see captain colmar john he said take her in to a berth off the pier lane drew an audible breath you want me thats right said dan shes yours till i get back cliff bronsons been talking a lot about my bad luck skipper lane said his voice was strained hes letting me down easy its not just bad luck it cant be itsincompetence ive quit trying to find some other answer dont trust me with your ship incompetence dan said captain colmar says different that i meant to wreck her thats what he said dan waited hopefully captain colmar lies john lane blazed with some real spunk ok dan said briskly leave it to me im your old man now take her in stand watchandwatch with cliff if anything happens use your own judgment throttle her down while i get clear in the boat he glanced into the tiny chartroom he had a calibre revolver in his strongbox but what he was up against was too smooth for a gun he stepped out of the wheelhouse and walked aft weve got a chance he told himself for once cliff bronson was below with a valvehandle in his fingers dan did not disturb him he pulled the rowboat towing astern in alongside her quarter and dropped into it the islander slogged past him toward the distant lights of town quietly dan rowed upcurrent from the lights of the belle kate a hundred adventure yards away he lowered the grapnel and anchored the boat he shed his shirt pants and shoes and slid overside into black water as warm as fresh milk and silky smooth to his skin a school of mullet was splashing around on the surface fleeing from something bigger dan grunted softly and swam faster downcurrent toward the bow of the belle kate there was no trick about boarding captain colmars ship her anchor chain was ready to his reaching hands and he swarmed up silently onto her bow close to him the vague form of a flat motion less man showed on her forward hatch a light burned in her wheelhouse and some body was on the bridge probably watch ing the departure of the islander dan lay still on deck till he had finished dripping and the man on the bridge had left then he made his way rapidly aft and up the ladder he pulled aside the cover of the port lifeboat and slipped into the musty smell ing boat ready to duck he glanced across the harbor at the tart yankees freighter a quarter mile distant and at smaller craft farther away in the quiet waters then he settled down to waiting the tinny chime of the wheelhouse clock beat out the bells of the slow passing first night watch dan writhed on the lifeboat bottom as discomfort became pain and then torture but at last midnight was coming upand with midnight would come the moon lights ashore were scattered now and only the riding lights showed on the ships the belle kate remained dishearteningly silent dan stiffened suddenly maybe he wasnt so nutty at this time of night when the belle kates hands should have been sleeping most soundly the ship began to come to quiet life men muttered on the maindeck the davit falls suspending a small boat at the ships stern creaked and the boat took the water dan saw it creep away below the belle kates main diesel began to hum a hand entered the wheel house and switched off the overhead light footsteps sounded on the bridge and then captain colmars voice gave a guarded order dan crouching in the lifeboat followed by ear as the anchor chain came in and she got under sluggish way all lights even her riding lights had been doused dan groped in the boats locker until he found among her gear the metal case con taining a dozen red lights he held it in his hands waiting the ship moved only a short distance then lay with no way on colmar left the bridge and walked to the focus of activity aft low voices rumbled in her stern and a chain clinked repeatedly the man in the wheelhouse came out and hung over the rail dan slid out of the lifeboat with his metal box and drifted aft until he could make out the blurred movement of bodies his face hardened a man came hurrying forward and dan flattened out on deck along the edge of a hatch by his squat figure and faintly discerned silhouette the moving man was colmar he was bound for the bridge dan trailed as far as the lifeboat colmar gave an order to the wheel house the belle kate surged slowly ahead abandoning stealth dan darted aft he ignited red flares fast and stuck them along the rail a red glow began breaking out along the ships deck captain colmar swore and his feet clattered on the bridge ladder he raced aft kicking at the flares calling in re strained fury to his milling men the lights were glowing in fierce red brilliance now making the belle kate a ship of hell dan ran to the bridge and flung overside a lifering with its attached water light the light plopped into a dazzling white glare dan climbed the ladder to the wheelhouse top he flung m a s ieac anc et a m k series of yelps as command ing in the quiet night as the whoop of a destroyers siren they were hardly needed the lights had wakened the sleep ing harbor of san ybel colmars voice was roaring orders dead aft make your own luck dan jerked off the searchlight cover switched on the light and swivelled it aft its brilliant white shaft pierced the red ferocity of the remaining flares the belle kates stern and the waters around it were as bright as a red day vividly there was revealed the black can buoy just astern of the ship a wire hawser from the belle kates capstan was shackled to the buoys mooring chain and the belle kate still under way was tow ing the buoy and its heavy anchor through the water toward the channel cast it loose leggo that hawser colmar cried and his voice was gaining volume losing control full astern douse those lights overside with em move you blasted fools the scene was like a welllighted stage setting and with every second more spectators on ships and shore would be watching the sea sacrilege that was taking place a ship at black midnight dragging a sacred government marker nobody within a mile could miss that action dan looked toward the big freight er and saw flashlights were already glint ing beside one of her lifeboats the man at the wheel of the belle kate completed the disaster he signalled to reverse the engine then froze on the tele graph while the belle kate began churn ing backward toward the black buoy the wire cable went slack and twisted in the water as colmar and his hands threw the wire off the capstan whirling propeller blades twisted the wire strands of the haw ser around the propeller shaft colmar was roaring but the ship was inexorably secured to the black can buoy her fouled shaft ground to a stop the frantic colmar gave up his efforts aft his squat body came charging up the path of the flashlights glare with a mass ive shackle gripped in his hand every trace of his habitual smoothness was gone with no reluctance dan moved to the head of the ladder conie on colmar cried get this man a new light suddenly flooded the belle kates deck it was a ships searchlight from a black ship close at hand her siren let go a harsh scream of warning at col mar dan recognized the screech this was the islander coming down on them without lights dan knew why during the long watch john lane must have worked out what might be up he was risking his luck in the dark harbor to back his skipper the islanders light did not slow col mars charge he was past caring about witnesses but across colmars bright path a mans leg suddenly stuck out the squat shipmaster tripped and crashed to the deck a big man dropped on him and pinned him to the deck somebody did not favor murder in public whos that dan called down the belle kates giant engineer planted a knee in the small of colmars back and squinted into the light green sir he said most unctuously are you capn carpenter of the islander ive just flggered what this snake was up to no said dan my own skipper too likely this is mutiny but i aint standing for this rough stuff with govenment markers sudden virtue dans lifted hand con ceded a grin you didnt know i didnt realize sir green said smoothly he jammed colmars skull against the deck as the captain lifted his head last night sir i fell for colmars story that he was shifting that marker secretly because a friend o his command ing the coast guard buoy tender had placed it wrong and was going to be in a terrible jam green shook his head slowly and sor rowfully i believed him he announced indig nantly colmars own smooth line was recurving on him now even when he said hed shifted the buoy a bit too far out o the channel by mistake so the islander hit the reef i believed it was just accidental the righteous engineer said thats why i helped tonight to get it back but i see it all now he did it on purpose like he did john lane dirt to get his ship off him continued on page the reunion achtung smartly the line of men and dogs came to attention at the oberleutnants command so that each man stood with hands stiffly at his sides eyes straight front motion less and beside each man ten inches to his left head on exact line with the mans left knee stood a dog equally motionless equally disciplined the oberleutnant strode briskly along the line inspecting each man and animal for every detail of equipment and appear ance when he had finished he again took his position on the right and at his suc cessively barked commands the solid line moved forward a few paces faced right to form a single marching file of men with a single marching file of dogs beside it then broke into groups of eights and continued rapidly precisely through the intricate movements of the drill an imposing sight thisone which under other circumstances would have been thrilling the lines of uniformed men marching deploying in perfect uni son and beside them the dogs as alike in appearance as their uniformed masters and as expertly disciplined doberman pinschers powerful black animals with markings of rust on jowls and lower legs cropped ears standing straight from the wedgeshaped heads spring steel muscles moving with an effortless fluidity which made iheir bodies seem almost to float rather than to impose weight upon the legs and the higharched rounded paws approximately seventy pounds each of fiery courage and lethal striking power to be held in leash or exploded into action at the word of command the sunlight set up bright points on the arms and equipment of the men and illustrated by eabl eugene mayan by e h toussaint reflected from the burnished silky black ness of the dogs coats midway of the line polizeihund num ber once named in the famous kennel of his birth gerd von sigalhof moved with the other dogs in perfect execution of the commands responding automatically to the discipline which had ruled his life from puppyhood he stopped steinert was on his back with the guard kneeling on his chest and slowly drawing his pistol tor the finishing shot adventure turned sat arose ran or walked in fault less obedience outwardly he was the perfect product of his training but deep within him where the feelings the senses the soul of him still dwelt he was troubled and uneasy to his human masters the bright air carried only the usual odors from the wire enclosure of the concentration camp which they guardedfoul odors at which they sometimes cursed but for which they and others like them were responsible but the sensitive nostrils of the doberman capable of separating and analyzing odors as the eye of the artist can separate and analyze colors were filled with a scent which set him quivering with nostalgic loneliness with anxiety and with frust rated affection somewhere close by was steinert the man to whom he had long ago given the deep and lasting affection of which the dobermans fiery soul is capable the one human being to whom he gave obedience gladly and not merely because discipline demanded it the intricate movements of the drill took the company of guards up and down before the wire where the prisoners stood or moved listlessly about in fact the purpose of holding the drill here was to impress those prisoners with the power and efficiency of their human and canine guards so that they might see how hope less would be any attempt at escape by day or by night from this living hell in which they dwelt walk run sit lie down they were nearing the wire now and the scent poured in like a hot draught soon stein ert would speak soon the beloved hand would run with a firm pressure over the sleek head would flatten the pointed ears for a moment and then pass on down the arched neck to finish with a sharp smack on the hardmuscled shoulder then all the great dogs world would be right again the long period of lonely waiting would have ended but the oberleutnant barked another command they turned from the wire formed their long line and marched off in the direction of the bar racks steinert had not come forward steinert had not spoken the loneliness descended again the waiting the piti ful timeless waiting of a dog for his mas ter continued inside the wire men or what had once been men sat or stood or moved listlessly about pale emaciated their faces drawn to the thinness of caricatures their bodies shrunken by starvation so that their clothing hung ludicrously about them of all ages and social strata they were now alike in their raggedness their filth and the air of utter hopelessness which bore them downall except one who despite his thinness and his rags had about him an air of selfrespect of competence which was recognized by prisoners and guards alike he was as starved as the others as ragged his clothes hung about him like the castoff garments on an effigy but in some way or other he had managed to keep aloof from filth and to keep his mind from despair so that the unconquerable spirit shone through and marked him as one apart a fighting man this much of his strength now gone but with the fighting soul still hot and strong within him for steinert had always been a fighting man and if he died here as he probably was destined to do he would die a fighting man they could starve himand they had they could beat himhis body bore scars both old and new but when at last they killed him they would have to stand back from his fists and feet and they would have to hear him cursing them as he died steinert was new to this prison having been brought here only yesterday from another concentration camp which was being discontinued and this was the first time he had seen the guards and dogs drilling outside the wire he knew why they drilled there he was in sympathy with the growls and muttered curses of his fellowprisoners as they watched but he could not help standing straight and brighteyed with interest when he saw the dobermans he could not know of course that among these dogs was an old friend they were too much alike in appearance for him to pick out an individual and identify it at that distance but he watched and strained his eyes for a glimpse of a telltale scar across one of the wedgeshaped skulls once he almost thought he saw it but he could not be sure and when he moved closer to the wire for a better look the sentry warned the reunion him back with an oath afterward he realized that probably the momentary sight of a scar had been only the creation of his imaginationthe product of his wishful thinking this friendship between man and dog was the attachment of those who have been brothers in arms they had served together in the police force of the old republic before murderous maniacs had come to power and made the police the instrument of brutal oppression then the police had been truly the guardians of the peace a body of trained efficient men respected by decent citizens and pro foundly feared by those who sought to live outside the law in those days only able men could serve in the police ranks and a man could be proud of the uniform he wore steinert had worn that uniform for many years and had contributed per haps more than his share to the honor in which it was held gerd the dog had been selected by the police trainers when he was a six monthsold puppy purchased from the famous kennels where he had been whelped and shipped to the police school there for nearly two years he had under gone the rigorous training which fitted dogs towork with human policemen in every phase of their duties from routine patrols to life and death battles with des perate criminals first he had been taught to distrust anyone who came as a stranger without proper introduction for the first several weeks of his stay at the school he had been kept in an enclosure by himself with frequent visits from one manalways the same man this man fed him petted him played with him then one day a stranger entered the enclosure the dog greeted him with puppy friendliness only to be rewarded by the terrifying cracking of a whip which the stranger produced from under his coat frightened at first the puppy backed into a corner but finally in desperation he showed fight immediate ly the stranger ran out and closed the door after him within a few minutes the regular trainer entered the enclosure and petted and fed the dog the next day another stranger came in and the per formance was repeated it did not require many repetitions with different men be fore gerd learned that the way to avoid the whipcracking and unpleasantness was to snarl and threaten immediately when any stranger came through the door then one day the regular trainer came in bringing another man with him gerd was puzzled and aloof but his trainer called him and introduced the stranger repeating over and over the word friend and the other man petted the dog and tossed a ball for him in succeed ing days the performance was alternated whenever a stranger entered without the trainer he threatened the dog until he was driven from the enclosure whenever a stranger was introduced by the trainer he turned out to be a pleasant enough fellow the doberman is frequently called the dog with the human brain it was only a matter of days until gerd knew that people not properly introduced were all dangerous and that people who were properly introduced were all pleasant folk then there was the little matter of ac cepting food a piece of meat found on mystery and adventure make good reading they make good listening too gregory hood mondays pm est tales from

possible variations in broadcast schedules adventure the floor of the enclosure and gulped with puppy hunger turned out to be loaded with red pepper which set his mouth and throat on fire and made his eyes stream a morsel accepted from even a properly introduced stranger without the trainers permission was similarly loadedalways but if it came from the hand of the trainer or was given to him by someone else with the trainers permission it was good always so he learned not to pick up food or to accept food except from proper source or with proper authorization this was only the beginning these were the simplest things and after ward came long weeks and months of in tensive training as he progressed through the program carefully laid out and skill fully followed by men whose profession was training and who were aware of the allimportant fact that a dog deprived of the power of speech and of the ability to fully understand speech can learn only by his own experiences that the same reward and the same penalty must follow the same act without one single variation or reversal whenafter nearly twoyears he was graduated from the school he could do an amazing variety of things he could pick out from a pile of miscellaneous objects the one or two or three which had been handled or sworn by a single in dividual whose scent he had been given he could locate in a group of twenty or thirty people the one individual whose scent had been given to him on a gar ment worn he could leap at a tenfoot high wall catch his forelegs over the top and drag his body up and over and leap down on the other side he knew how to bore in on a man with a blazing pistol zigzagging at lightning speed so that he made an almost unhittable target until he was close enough to spring and seize the mans forearm in a crushing grip which opened his fingers and sent his gun clattering to the ground he would on command knock a man to the ground and hold him pinned there unharmed but also at command he was quite cap able of tearing the mans throat out he responded instantlyalmost automatically to every word of command without regard to any instinct or feeling or desire of his own affection for any individual was a feeling completely unknown to him he gave perfect obedience to what ever individual had been placed in charge of him he ignored all others with the dobermans blank straightahead stare he was in short the perfect product of the police school a machine a potential bolt of lethal lightning wholly and en tirely subject to the will and the command of man pie had been assigned then to patrol duty at night with a police officer in the tough waterfront section of a port city it was an area of wharves and ware houses not frequented by the usual water front riffraff who found nothing there to attract them but the valuable contents of the warehouses offered a rich return for boldly executed thieveryand the maze of alleys and narrow dark streets provided tempting cover for those who would attempt such forays through the long hours of each night the man and dog moved through the threatening darkness alone except for each other alert and strong and unafraidthe law the police officers name was steinert four years they served together there and in those years they earned three cita tions of special merit for gallant and suc cessful action against superior numbers of men readv and desperately willing to kill rather than be taken in the act of robbery in and on their bodies too they carried certain permanent mementoes of those days a bullet which the surgeon decided not to remove from steinerts body and the scars of two vicious knife thrusts a scar made by a creasing bullet along the top of the dogs wedgeshaped skull and another made by the ripping thrust of a heavy knife in his breast but the man who had fired those bullets and the men who had made the knife thrusts had been brought in by the policeman and the dog weak from loss of blood but still on their feet and in control of the situation something else had occurred too in those years for life had not been all fighting and danger through the long hours of those nights there had been time for the feeding of tidbits for the teaching of special tricks even occasion ally for the tossing and catching of a ball the reunion on the broad expanse of a moonlit wharf at midnight when they had a half hour rest period they would sit looking out over the restless harbor water side by side and often the mans powerful arm would lie about the hardmuscled neck and shoulders of the dog and he would talk quietly to him so had grown the bond between these tworooted deeply in the lonely soul of the fighting man and in the heart of gerd von sigalhof deprived in his puppyhood of the dobermans birth right of undying love for a single human being it was early in their fifth year of service together that the trouble began for them one night steinert was kept off his patrol for several hours while another man took his place when he returned just before midnight he was taut with anger gerd sensed it for the relation of the doberman to the one chosen master is close and what the man feels the dog feels with him then two nights later an inspector of police intercepted them when they were partly through their second patrol an other policeman was with him the in spector acknowledged steinerts salute and spoke curtlya command when this was not obeyed he spoke again his tone more peremptory steinert said no word made no move only stood stock still and looked with hard eyes at the inspector while the muscles stood out in ridges along his clenched jaw and through that mysterious bond which links dog and master gerd sensed his feeling and shared it so that a matching fire of rage kindled and burned within him so that the hair on his back and on the top of his powerful neck rose and stood like a mane while a snarl gathered deep in his throat the inspector was nothing to him a man who was steinerts enemy was his enemy also to be attacked if permitted and killed if the master so commanded then the tension was broken steinerts lips moved in a restraining command so that the dog lay down at his side moving slowly as if his fingers were numbed steinert unfastened the short leash which hung unused at his belt snapped one end in the ring on the dogs collar and handed the other end to the policeman who stood beside the inspector it was the ceremony of turning over command it meant that the dog was now to obey the commands of the man to whom the leash had been delivered that had been the end of it except that just before steinert went away with the inspector he had turned back and stoop ing had run his hand over the dogs skull momentarily flattening the sharp ears then down along the neck to the hard muscles of the shoulder it was his usual gesture of caress but tonight steinert pressed his hand hard as if to put into it the full power of some strong emotion then he went away walking beside the inspector that was the last time gerd had seen his master it had been the end of service and the end of liberty for steinert a basic part of the nazi strategy had been to remove men like him from the police force and to replace them with gangsters who could be depended upon to carry out any orders without question and without regard to law or human decency each mans records were examined thoroughly for material on which to base his expulsion and steinerts record was made to order for their purposes it showed that his mother was of jewish descent a quite sufficient cause for his dismissal dismissal might for the time being have been all if he had fawned and crawled but he didnt when con fronted with the evidence of his crime he not only had failed to be apologetic but he had been proud and defiant it was not his nature to grovel it was his nature to fight lie had cursed his inquisitors and called them the gutter scum that they were and so in first one prison and then another he had earned the reputation of being stubborn dangerous and hard to handle every move had meant for steinert a prison where the treatment was more harsh the conditions more heartbreaking than the last now he had reached bottom and he knew it this was the great camp from which men did not emerge aliveor women or children either death did not come quickly here it came only after starvation beatings humiliation then the gas chamber if one was lucky or the medical experiment laboratory if one was not adventure it was two weeks after the day when gerd had first caught steinerts scent before he had any further indication of his nearness he was one of a detail of guards and dogs waiting at the main prison gate shortly after dawn to take out a work party they stood back a few paces from the gate on either side of the dusty road which led into the wire en closure a smaller gate set into the big one would open at intervals to let out prisoners in groups of three or four a guard standing just outside the gate would check their numbers and send them on to join others already waiting ankledeep in the dust of the road the prisoners an swered tonelessly as their numbers were called they shuffled rather than walked up the road to join the group waiting there they would have been ludicrous in their rags if they had not been so pitiful gerd like the other dogs watched them with mild interest while they moved paid them no attention after they stopped he sat on his haunches alert but at easea sol dier on routine duty then the gate clicked open again and at the same instant the dogs nostrils were filled with a warm scent which brought him sharply to his feet his body tense and trembling and a little shuddering sound of eagerness gathering in his throat a man came out alone a big man who held himself erect who did not shuffle but walked with a clean stride who answered the guard in a voice which was not toneless but firm and brisk a fighting mansteinert at the actual sight of him at the sound of his voice gerd von sigalhof was almost beside himself but the iron discipline the habit of meticulous obedience held po lizeihund number rooted to the spot where he stood trembling making that eager shuddering sound in his throat pleading mutely for recognition but un able to move from his assigned place to seek it and there was no recognition neither here nor on the long dragging march out to the farmlands nor during the long work hours of that day with all the dobermans quick intelli gence with all his ability to learn he still is a dog with a good dogs honesty he has never learned to dissemble nor to recognize dissembling by others gerd could not know how steinerts heart had leaped when beside the road at the prison gate he had seen the bulletfurrowed skull the scar in the kniferipped breast he could not know that when in mid morning gerd had pulled a little too hard on the leash and the beefy guard had yanked savagely on his choke collar steinerts hands had clenched hard on the rake he was holding as he choked down his wrathful protest at such mistreatment steinert had heard that shuddering sound in the dogs throat had seen the trembling of his body and he had in terpreted correctly he knew that if he gave but the slightest sign the animal would come bounding to himand would be promptly shot by the guards and so he had done that most difficult of all dif ficult things he had after all these years refused to give a sign of friendship to a beloved comrade who was pleading for it with an eloquence far more potent than that of any human word or gesture it was shortly after noon when the trouble occurred working next to stein ert piling hay as steinert raked was an old man a jew with the serene eyes of a rabbiwhich he was all day he had worked steadily and without a murmur of complaint steinert had felt surprise that his slight old frame could put forth so much energy but now he was weakening the heat of the august sun the weakness of undernourishment were telling sev eral times when the guard was at the other end of the line of workers steinert had helped him pile hay to catch up with the raking but now he was falling back again and the guard was coming along the line angrily bellowing at him to work faster the old man raised his head at the sound of the guards voice for an instant he looked at the guard steadily quietly then just as quietly his knees began to buckle and he slid forward face down in the stubble the guard mouthing curses came and stood over him then he drew back his booted foot for a kick but it was never delivered a powerful hand seized his shoulder and swung him half around so that he looked into the hard lean face and furious eyes of steinert only a few inches from his own dont touch him gutter rat steinert raspedand knew that he was signing his own death war the reunion rant the nazi was indeed what steinert had called hima rat furious though he was and armed against a weaponless man he took the precaution to glance around quickly for help and seeing no other guard close by he merely growled a threat and walked away face to face encounters with angry men were not in his line he wanted superior numbers an excuse to shoot from behind but he would wait and not forget steinert knew the type it would come before this day was over and he would not get a chance to defend himself he lifted the old man and laid him near one of the haystacks where he would get at least a little protec tion from the direct sun and where a guard would not be so likely to notice him then he went back to work raking fast and then piling to keep up with the other prisoners the men on either side helped him as best they could the guard had not come back it was almost sunset be fore the guards told them to stop work and pile their tools then steinert woke the old man and he got up rested but em barrassed and apologetic when another prisoner told him what had happened he was frightenednot for himself but for steinert my son they will kill you for this he said better that you had let him kill me steinert grinned good riddance he said you will yet return to your people and you will be worth something i am not worth anything any more when the line was formed to leave the field two guards stepped up to steinert and one of them touched him on the arm wait here he said you will be at the rear the line moved off with its slow shuffling gait and steinert fell in at the end of it behind him were two guards the one he had threatened and another holding a dog on leash stein erts pulse quickened it was the beefy guard and the dog he held was gerd slowly the line dragged itself along the road the dust rising to hang waist high like a gray haze in the evening air the shuffling of many feet made a soft brushing sound behind him steinert could hear the heavier tread of the guards boots and he listened for any change of pace to indicate that one of them was slowing to aim a pistol at his back or coming closer to shoot him at pointblank range the road led through a small grove where the trees made an avenue of semi darkness now that the sun was low when they were partway through it one of the guards called to steinert to halt he obeyed and turned to face them the beefy guard holding the dog was a few paces away the other the one steinert had threatened stood a little to one side the line of prisoners shuffled on the brushing sound of their feet drew farther and farther away until finally it was lost a sudden fluttering in the treetops sounded startlingly loud as a belated bird sought its shelter for the night at last the beefy guard spoke now my friend we are going to give you a little lessona lesson to others too for they will learn it in the morning when they come here to bury you he stooped quickly and unsnapped the leash from the dogs collar the other guard drew his pistol from its holster and slipped off the safety steinerts voice rose suddenly now in a highpitched frightened wail dont dont dont let the dog kill me anything but that please he dropped to his knees in the dust and began drag ging himself toward the guard his hands raised in panic pleading the guard stood watching him making no move until steinert was close directly in front of him then he drew back his heavy boot and kicked savagely at steinerts face this move was what steinert had ex pected it was standard procedure it was what he had played for he twisted his body aside so that the boot heel only grazed his arm and the next instant he had seized the outflung leg with both hands and was lifting it as he came up powerfully from his knees caught off balance the guard was flung backward so heavily that he was momentarily stunned despite the cushioning effect of the soft dust steinert spoke the dogs name twicegerd gerd and gave an order then he threw himself on the prostrate guard not waiting to learn whether his order had been obeyed or whether the dog confused by his sud den assumption of authority his memory dimmed by the long years of separation adventure had hesitated or refused he knew that if the dog failed him he had only an instant to live before a bullet would come tear ing into his back from the other guards pistol but meanwhile he must play this one slim string to the very end with every ounce of desperate strength he could bring to the attack he seized the thick throat with both hands his knee slammed down hard to pin the hand which was trying to draw the pistol from its holster the man beneath him writhed and strained in his grasp and the blood drum med in steinerts ears as he strove to keep his hold then behind him he heard the other guards voice raised in a sharp order a quick startled curse the ter rible deepthroated snarl of the attack ing doberman the punctuation of two pistol shots a shrill scream beyond that he could hear nothing for the beefy guard was fully recovered now and fighting desperately with his free hand he clawed and beat to break steinerts grip on his throat his thrusting knees dealt hideous punishment and steadily his other hand worked nearer the holstered pistol they fought like animals the thick dust and blood in their mouths and their eyes the guard was a powerful man as big and wellmuscled as steinert had ever been but not as skillful stronger than steinert was now after the years of starvation motivated by fear as steinert was by blazing hatred and desperation and inevitably the starved years began to tell steinert felt the weak trembling in his body felt the strength going out of his hands as they slipped from the sweatgreasy throat steinert was half rolled as the guard twisted free and then he was on his back with the guard kneeling on his chest and slowly drawing his pistol for the finishing shot steinerts sight clouded for an in stant from sheer exhaustion then with a last supreme effort of will he forced it clear to look openeyed and defiant into the dirtcaked bloody sweating mask of triumph and hatred which leered above him and so it was that he saw the sleek black body come through the air in its pantherlike spring saw in a last brief in stant of consciousness the knifescarred breast and the clipped ears lying flat to the wedgeshaped skull as the white fangs struck home in the trained killers lethal slash it was full starlit dark when they finished doing those things which must be done before they could leave this place it was graying dawn when they crossed the first ridge of the moun tain range and found a clean little stream coming down through the thick woods at its foot they drank thirstily of the bright clear water and after steinert had washed the filth from his hands and face and arms they sat down to rest for a few moments man and dog side by side their bodies pressed close they still had a long way to go and there was danger and possible death ahead but for now they were together and for a moment it seemed like the old nights on patrol back in that other ordered world when they sat thus side by side and looked out over the restless harbor water steinerts arm went out and lay around the powerful shoulders of

whatever comes we shall this time stay to gethernicht walir his arm drew a little tighter around the muscular should ers the flat scarred head turned quickly then and a pink tongue touched steinerts facejust onceas if in answer and in thankfulness that the long time of lone liness and waiting was at an end the scarf of shane by thomas gilchrist suddenly oshanes heart turned over and he slammed the port shut with a muttered curse in the hands of oshane the scarf had strangled a native to death in madagascar and now used as a cummerbund it served the prosaic pur pose of holding up his white pants to oshane it was much more than a belt of course being associated with the strongest deed of his life it was also a symbol of his prowess and he was wont to straighten his narrow shoulders and fill out his chest whenever his fingers should happen to touch it mr oshane first officer of the salawar had never been quite the same since he had acquired that scarf he was not a strong man he was in fact a very weak illustrated by roger l thomas adventure man not so much physically as in other ways his eyes were small pale blue and shifty the heavy and untidy yellow mustache from beneath which he con stantly sprayed tobacco juice failed to hide the meanness of his mouth his voice was nasal and uncertain often petulant he frequently forgot to wash and his hair seldom knew a comb being the negative sort of man he was he was naturally immensely proud of the madagascar affair and anyway it was a fine scarf as he often pointed out heavy silk a cloth of native fabrication gorge ously streaked with yellow and black and with strange glints of green when the light caught it just right it was as beau tiful as a cobra tt had belonged to the native girl and mr oshane had one or two other souve nirs of that night a glittering stone with thin screwwire that had pierced her left nostrils a little anklet of sharks teeth a heavy gold bangle and some other trinkets he had found in the leaf built hut all were mementos of to him the magnifi cent force of mr oshane he did not trouble to remember that in the province of majunga and under french rule the natives were generally docile on pain of death the other mementos he kept in a drawer whence he would refer to them in secret moments but he always wore the scarf about his waist it excited com ment and gave him the opportunity of telling his story from time to time at first he had been very careful not to wrinkle the scarf he had wound it ten derly about his waist and clipped the end with a large safety pin but gradually the thing had stretched though without losing any of its beauty and he had acquired a certain nonchalance and now he merely fastened it with a big knot oshane had gone ashore that night even more bent on evil than was his wont per haps the climate had some thing to do with it perhaps it was too much gin and vermouth certainly lib eral drinks of the local firewater after din ner had set his blood on fire and then there were his usual appetites the hot whispering night the big stars the reck less sense of being in a country where the white man was king and the natives flinched when one went by whatever it was oshane had left the white settle ment to its club its billiards its bar and its gossip and lurched along the jungle path to where the leaiandcane huts of the native village sat and sweated in the clearing the scents of the jungle about them and the low sustained droning of insect life making the steamy darkness pulse and he had found the hut he wanted he had seen her that afternoon she was coming up from the river there was a basket on her head a basketful of red and green fabrics she had evidently been washing head erect on the smooth col umn of her neck her carriage was mag nificent her long legs her rippling thighs carried her along with a sensuous grace that oshane had never seen her breasts were erect too and when she turned he saw that every little muscle in her smooth back was alive her arms one of which was decorated with bangles that shone in the sunlight were softly molded she was a goddess in ebony a comoran islander oshane would have said she had not seen the white man watch ing her and oshane knew better than to startle her he remained concealed sweat ing behind the tetai tree and noted the hut she entered secretly oshane broke into cold per spiration when he thought of the native who had unexpectedly entered the dark hut that night he could still hear the hoarse cry and the swish of a knife drawn from within a lavalava and the cries of the woman desperately he had leapt to his feet groped in the dark for a weapon and as the woman cried out the native had dropped down to her side and with scarcely any conscious volition oshane had kicked out with his heavy boot it was then he became aware of the scarf in his hands the scarf his groping fingers had found and in sheer panic he pounced and drew it tight about the mans neck his version of the story was different of course selfdefense a native gone berserk as he passed through the village his woman dragging the body into a hut why the woman was probably nuts too she had laid a curse upon him the scarf of oshane oshane would chuckle when he told of the native curse he would chuckle when he told the story out on deck and in daylight or when he told it to new shipmates in the saloon or in the bar rooms of the orient with a bottle of whiskey before him but alone in his room or in the immense silence of the nightwatch he would remember her crouched there in the corner of the hut beside the body of her man scarcely more than the whites of her eyes visible her teeth flashing as her mouth formed words slowly coldly and with terrible intensity and the dirge that the insects played out side in the jungle it was then that oshane would find himself flicking the sweat from his brow with a trembling hand and if he were on the bridge looking from the cover of darkness at the native helmsman whose eyes glittered whose face appeared to float without a body in the light from the binnacle and he would go over and quiz him and check his origin again for oshane had made sure that never since had a comoran islander joined the crew that had all been a year ago and since then oshane had enjoyed the reputation that his scarf kept alive for he backward in telling his story of the nights adventure particularly he liked to tell of the curse the woman had set upon him setting snakes after me he would chuckle can ye fancy that the snake will come white man she says or some thing snakes its the queer ideas those natives have there was a touch of bravado in this the morning after the madagascar affair when the salazvar was at sea mr oshane had recounted the story to mr watson the chief engineer and mr watson had shaken his head i dont know he had said i dont know mr oshane those natives have queer ideas all right but i wouldnt laugh if i were you i knew a feller once in haiti who got a native sore at him and the native set spiders on him yes spiders an im blamed if he didnt find em all over the place after that hed always run into two or three in his bunk when he went to turn in an hed have to shake em out of his shoes in the mornin thats a fact out of his shoes theyd get into his tobacco somehow and into his water and into his clothes i dont know how im just telling you spiders all sorts an shapes of spiders big fellers an little fellers the man went crazy at last just blew up an jumped overside we found a whoppin big tarantula sittin on his desk afterwards you dont mean to tell me theres any thing in those native curses demanded oshane uneasily i dont mean to tell you nothin said the chief engineer but what in hell did she mean by settin snakes on me oshane inquired the chief engineer was a morbid man well he said with relish i do hear some o those natives worship a sort o snake kinda devilgod you know they tell me that when they want to get even with you they just wish the snake on you sure its a lot o rot it is bloody rot said mr oshane emphatically maybe agreed the chief but im just sayin i wouldnt laughyet but mr oshane did laugh and he continued to tell his story but each time he told it there seemed to be something inside him that made the whole thing sound wrong longforgotten irish tales of banshees at dark window panes came back to him and they began to take on at least a suspicion of reality he couldnt forget the man who had spiders set upon him and the more men he tackled on the subject of native curses the more his laughter took on a hollow note for planters traders and seamen to whom he casually introduced the subject were all dubious they had lived a long time south and east of hells gate and they had seen things and heard things its a lot o bunk declared mr oshane but whenever he thought of it he took an extra long pull on the bottle to stop his nerves from twitching he was a weak man and it did not help mat ters that many of his fellow officers took to chaffing him about snakes this present voyage for example the salazvar was pushing her blunt and rusty snout into the lazy swell of a shimmering indian ocean they were bound for adventure moulmein for a cargo of teakwood logs for bombay and the second mate re minded mr oshane of a certain disturb ing fact teakwood logs eh he said youd better look out then you know you can load as many snakes as logs up that stink ing river oh shut up snarled mr oshane well i thought youd just like to be reminded that wench back in madagas car might have a special snake fixed up for you oshane stumped away for a drink but the salawar loaded teakwood logs for a week without incident her first officer thought snakes for a week and could not forget them even with frequent reference to his supply of highland nec tar teakwood logs being what they are and moulmein being what it is ships officers had to think of snakes even in the ordinary run of events as it happened there wasnt even a minor sting among the native stevedores but just the same mr oshane breathed a sigh of relief when the salawar finally pushed her creaking leisurely way seaward once more the holds full and on her decks a cargo that rose to a height of eight feet mr oshane left the bridge that night at eight oclock sticky and sweating from the heat and desperately in need of a drink the heat in his cabin was terrific his duck pants and cotton singlet clung to his wet body he plucked at them loos ened his clothes a little then unscrewed his forard port which opened on deck and suddenly his heart turned over and he slammed it shut again with a mut tered curse mother o god he exclaimed what a nest for snakes the hollow end of a log was against the port oshane flicked the sweat from his forehead and sat down limp he noticed his hands were trembling as he picked up his log book and he swore between his teeth im getting like an old woman thats what he told himself savagely and reaching for his whiskey bottle he poured himself a stiff drink he secured his chewing tobacco his log book his pen and ink and oil lamp and he went into the saloon where it might be cooler the breaking of the darkness as he brought his lamp into the place sent the cockroaches scurrying over the edge of the table and setting his things down oshane vented some of his feelings upon them stamping them into nothing on the deck the salawar rolled a little to the ground swell he steadied himself then dropped into a chair with a grunt of re lief and arranged his log book for writing he called to the boy in the pantry fetch me a candle he ordered sharp ly this damned lamp would roast the devil himself and then ye can make me a cup o tea he muttered to himself ripped off his sweatsoaked singlet and all but naked he went to work now just why it is that a sudden and all but irrelevant thought will come to a man may not be known oshane wras utterly absorbed in his log book was thinking of nothing else all that could be heard were the little sounds that only accentuate the silence the scraping of his pen the tiny noises of the cockroaches the tired creaking of the beams as the ship rolled to the swell and overhead the occasional footsteps of the third mate moving restlessly on the bridge oshane was utterly absorbed in his log book and yet his mind clicked as it were in mid career and he heard something else he heard the voice of the woman as coldas cold as death and he could have sworn that the man he had killed was standing by his shoulder his teeth grin ning his eyes glittering oshane stopped writing and he did not dare to lift his eyes from his log book he sat petrified for a moment not breathing and then he set his teeth and cursed it was a lot of rot he needed another drink that was all his nerves were going to pieces the damned cli mate the fever mists of moulmein perhaps that was it a touch of fever a man did hear things at such times he swallowed hard and could feel his heart pounding in his ears he cursed again and turned with a jerk to shoot a nervous spit into the spittoon and then he froze in his chair he saw it on the deck in the shadows the scarf of oshane right at his feet lying in a perfect coil hood up and not eighteen inches from his right leg he could even see it swaying in the candlelight as the ship gently rolled he stared petrified his face dead white and he couldnt move a finger he tried to get up he tried to shout for the steward but his throat was con stricted no use he could do nothing the sweat icecold now trickled down his face and into his eyes but he did not notice it there was a voice screaming in his head there was a thundering in his ears and teeth flashed as a woman laughed the snake would strike and then in a minute two minutes perhaps he would die the woman had been right the snake had come he was still for the space of three long heartbeats and then a tremor ran through him he coughed a few times and slumped gently forward his eyes slowly glazing as he died and just within the candlelight the native messboy a cup of tea in his hand and his teeth flashing in an odd grimace stood transfixed and gazed at the twitch ing figure of the first officer with the pallor of death upon him and then his eyes fell again upon the thing that lay in the shadows coiled as it had fallen from the waist of oshane glinting strangely in the flickering light the knotted end propped upright against a stanchion the boy had always been fascinated by that scarf it resembled so much his devil

shop like it and i have never seen a guy like holy moses murphy he reaches in his pocket and digs out a rubber ball and bounces it and catches it as we walk along just like a little kid he stops by a big bench covered with shiny plates and magnifying lenses on standards and the best inspection equip ment i have ever seen and this bench is presided over by the most gorgeous girl i have even seen

get fired mike keeps his jaws full of chewing tobacco and keeps making his regular trips to the barrel hes got a cheek full continued on page shark bait by wilmon menard some sportsmen are contemptuous of shark hunting but i find it par ticularly exhilarating the chief complaint fishermen have is that the shark gives up too easily but not the tigersharks of the dangerous isles yes i never pass up an opportunity to kill a shark i still remember my first shark kill and i am sure it was the most exciting of all it was off barbados in the west indies i was seventeen at the time my harpoon was a crude affair fashioned out of a shortened oldfashioned french bayonet near the point of which i had brazed stout barbs in each of the concavi ties of its threeedged blade i also at tached an expanding ironsocket to the spearhead for the reception of a de tachable fifteenfoot mangrove pole a really formidable sharksticker i recall that it was a fine balmy day the sun overhead very hot and the sea blue and sparkling standing forward on the harpooners pulpit rigged to the bowsprit of the schooner i had a clean sweep of the sea far ahead then sudden ly i saw a huge black fin cutting the shimmering surface a hundred yards or so off the port bow my heart leapt and i trembled with excitement the black boys dumped over some pig entrails and blood and the killer scenting the blood turned sharply and cruised back sliding up silently alongside and gobbling up the viscera then it circled away warily for a moment i was afraid it had left for good but five minutes later it swam slowly below the bowsprit now take your time my father whispered tensely hit hard behind the gills i gripped my harpoon tightly saw that the line was free then when the shark passed underneath again i drew in my breath sharply and struck downward with all my strength good boy my father shouted loudly i felt the pole jerked out of my hand and the line began whizzing out with beginners luck i had sunk the harpoon deeply in a vital spot behind the gill clefts the monster pulled out more than fifty yards of the stout line then went to the bottom where it sulked but with all of us straining on the line we pulled it in the shark was goaded to wild fury nowhe circled and charged mopi who nimbly somersaulted and cama up under the brute for another hard knifethrust a fact story adventure under the counter jerked its head out of the water and with a i sent five slugs into its savage brain before it ceased its wild thrashings the brute measured more than ten feet it was my first shark yes sharkhunting is dangerous and ex hilarating ive seen black boys of the west indies tease sharks underwater then expertly slit open their white gleaming bellies with longbladed sharkknives in macassar in the celebes tourists are en tertained by a small boy fighting a shark in a specially built pool for this commer cial and sordid form of amusement in the solomon islands i have seen stalwart na tives battle with sharks over fishes trapped in fishnets or dynamited the crafty sharks have learned to rush to a spot when they feel the concussion of dynamite knowing there will be a feast on the stunned fishes in honolulu i saw a sharks belly ripped open by its captors and in its stomach was found the mangled arm of a soldier drowned off waialua after experimenting with many types of shark harpoons i have found that simple swivelheaded harpoons are the best they are easy to handle and are quite cheap to make in the deep water i have used expensive quintuplebarbed harpoons but when harpooning in a lagoon or bay with shelving coral or rocky ledges it is rather foolhardy for a shark hunter to risk losing its costly harpoon head a shark often goes for the bottom and it can very easily foul the line around craggy projections of rock and coral and quickly sever it by its wild antics to free itself from the barbed harpoon the con stant jerking of the line across a sharp piece of rock or coral can rapidly cut it and the shark is off with your harpoon still in its hide the killer might perish out at sea but this is hardly a consolation considering the costliness of a fine quin tuplebarbed harpoon the hardy natives of nukurua and also of other atolls of the dangerous islands are born haters of sharks in every family of pearl divers you will find a fatality by these marauders of the sea among the pearl diving atolls during the diving sea son they are met singlehanded by ex perienced divers who contemptuously tease them and then dexterously slash off their flukes horribly maiming them as a warning to other killers the sharks de prived of their steering apparatus dash headlong into sharp coral ledges and growths killing themselves or they are eaten by their cannibalistic brothers and sisters who have been goaded to the kill by the scent of blood and the helplessness of their mutilated member sharks are cannibalistic by nature when their food supply becomes scarce they will slaughter each other their style of attack upon another is always the same they will rush in swiftly and bury their teeth in a victims stomach for here a softer and firmer hold is assured also sharks have found each others entrails quite toothsome i set out many lines in the lagoon of nukurua buoyed with empty oil drums and when i would go out to inspect them id find my shark had been torn to pieces by others every thing from the pectoral fin backwards would be gone when i hoisted my har pooned sharks off the beach by their tails with the blockandtackle i had lashed to the coconut trunks their huge mouths would spew out livers intestines and skin of sharks the gullet of a shark is merely a large unobstructed tube to its capacious stomach so when the shark is hoisted by its tail into the air the gullet and stomach becomes everted disgorging anything that has not been wholly digested on one occasion i had brought along some lengths of onehalf inch iron from tahiti and as there was a small crude forge owned by higgins chinese assist ant ah cheung i quickly made a number of harpoons i tempered and sharpened them myself and if i do say so they were much better than i could have purchased experiences in sharkharpooning had made me a reasonably adept fashioner of harpoons which really work the iron shank of the harpoon expanded into a wedgeshaped socket for the reception of a pole and a steel cable was attached to a ring on the harpoon head to which yards of quarterinch norwegian hemp line was tied during the night roo and i set out shark lines with the hooks baited with five pounds oi eel and attached to air planewire leaders with ioot lengths shark bait of quarterinch hemp line tied to coco palms on the beach this distance from the coral strand sharks seven and eight feet long foraged over the lines i hung two bottles which at the slightest jerk or tension gave out musical tinkles i would frequently be aroused five and six times during the night by the clinking bottles and rushing down with a lantern wed have a lively time pulling in the vicious brutes but sharks couldnt be allowed to lie too long on the beach they are with out exception the worst stinkers of the sea i would quickly strip off their hides and salt them down for shagreen which made excellent bookbinding material i harpooned most of my sharks from the coral reefs or ledges the water was deep below the ledges and in the blue shadows large maneaters basked or cruised every day roo and i scouted along the fringing ledges the strong combers crashing loudly over the coral barrierreefs were reduced to only a small wash of wavelets barely more than two or three inches deep by the time it breached over the wide coral mole the top of the barrier reefs were spongy with marine growths and i experienced an un canny sensation as i felt living things crabs and mollusks crawl suddenly in fright under my bare tread i had to maintain strict vigilance that i didnt step on nohus or viperous black seaurchins and of course i had to be careful not to walk on deceptive coral crusts which would break and send me into deep water at the mercy of the sharks most times i had to locate my sharks through a glasspaned waterbox the open end of the box was large enough to insert my head and placing the glassed end into the water i could see fathoms below in the sunlit depths fish of every imaginable shape and color swam schools of butterfly fish with long gossamer tails flitting between coral fans silvery mul lets sea horses sea cucumbers rainbow fish and red and blue parrotfish group ers and wrasse there were fantastic min iature trees and shrubs yellow and pink coral vines seaweed prolific as coral of purple and mauve colors on white sandy spaces i could see sea anemones urchins sponges hermit crabs and turbos all of such varied hues and shapes that they de fied description often i would see the flatboned broad heads of giant conger eels protruding from coral grottoes but sharks were my pet hates and i would soon be snapped out of my reverie by the sight of a long gray body cruising into the picture then id put my water box aside and toss bloody fragments of eels and fishes into the lagoon i wouldnt have to wait long sharks have the most sensitive snouts in the world a fin would suddenly break the still surface of the lagoon slowly craftily the monster would circle about then with a rush would come at the floating fragments with which i had chummed it then i had to work fast at a distance of twenty to thirty feet i could chance launching a spear some times i got the shark the first time many times i missed and on rare occasions the shark casting all caution aside would come back again even after being wounded and would generously give me another try a bloodcrazed shark will do strange things once i saw sharks mad dened by blood go berserk had dumped some pigs entrails and blood into the sea and within five minutes the water bris tled with fins i wounded one with a har poon thrust and the other killers imme diately tore the crippled shark to ribbons then with nothing else to eat they turned on each other it was a wild and terrible scene of cannibalism again i smeared some blood on the snout of a dead shark we had pulled up on the coral strand and its mouth opened and closed spasmodically and its whole body trem bled the smell of blood had brought it back momentarily from the grave the job of landing a shark is not an easy one although these gangsters of the deep will not do a highlandfling or the rumba on the surface they can be obstinate as mules they will pull and charge like enraged bulls believe me its backbreaking labor pulling one in then once youve beached it you can exhaust yourself trying to make it let go its stub born hold on life the natives usually beat out their brains with clubs and spears but i soon found an easier way to finish mine off i inserted a sharp knife at tached to a stout shaft into one of the gill adventure clefts back of the pectoral fin and giving it a hard turn would neatly sever the main artery in the neck there was of course a limit to the size of sharks i could harpoon in the lagoons of nukurua sharks over ten feet long would not enter the lagoon although the reefpassage was quite wide there were some shoal heads here and a wily man eater will not enter a lagoon from which it cannot make a quick egress a shark is a dastard at heart and when the odds be come too great for it in conflict it will turn and run one morning roo and i aided by four nukuruans went sharkhunting in the outer sea in a small cutter that had called at the atoll i did not have to wait long for a target for my quintuplebarbed harpoon the shark fought us stubbornly for more than an hour but it was worth the tussle after much heaving we got its head out of the water amidships we dan gled a large sharkhook baited with fish over the side and although wounded it bit at it and the hook sank deeply into the jaw cartilage in its mad thrashings it got the bronze leader between its teeth and had almost bitten the links through i ran a bolineandbit down the leader and got it back of the monsters gills one of the nukuruans had lashed a block to the rig ging and i threw the bit through the open slot and we heaved strongly when the shark had been hoisted high enough i cut the main artery in its neck i was really proud of this brute it was the largest i had harpooned in the dan gerous isles it measured more than thir teen feet the sharks jaws were more than three feet in circumference fully opened an opening large enough for a boys shoulders and hips to pass through comfortably indeed the natives of the dangerous isles know full well that it was a mako shark that swallowed iona jonah and not a tohora whale a sharks teeth are really most terrify ing no marine monster save possibly the giant barracuda has such an infernal and wicked system of teeth they are large sickleshaped and are of indestructible pure enamel the glasslike enamel on the edges of each finely serrate denticle will cut a hair as cleanly as a razor late that afternoon roo and i began cutting away the jaws of the shark which i intended keeping for a souvenir strip ping the skin away from the lower jaw and throat i found that this region was impregnated with the stings of rays or seabats i even found them between the rows of teeth deeply embedded in the gums and cartilage and in the muscle masses adherent to the jaws i found thirtythree stings these dagger spines of the rays doubleedged and sawtoothed were driven four and five inches into the cartilage and membranes some buried in cysts attesting to long wounds while oth ers were surrounded by congested blood telltale signs of recent conflicts in the stomach of the shark were fragments of leopard rays aetobalus narinari and car tilaginous fragments of their skeletons incidentally a shark will go far out of its way to take a bite out of a ray this is not to be wondered at when you stop to consider that sharks and rays are the oldest form of marine life and probably the stock from which all other fishes evolved so any antipathy toward one an other must be instinctive although they differ somewhat in external aspect and their means of attack and defense they are related in structure in sharks and rays the skeleton remains cartilaginous instead of hardening into bone each like wise has a threevalved heart a spiral valve in the intestines but no airblad der when you slice off the wings of a ray you have a small though per fectly formed shark with the same under slung mouth i think they are closely re lated and if so it is only one more point in proof of a sharks cannibalistic traits it revels in slaughtering its own kind i always used leopard rays for shark bait whenever i could catch them the large rays normally lived close to the lagoon floor where they fed on mollusks and marine animals on the bottom rut they often came to the surface to bask and that is when i had an opportunity to har poon them once i carelessly permitted my legs to come too close to the deadly spine of a ray and i received a grazing stab it was a superficial wound but the slime on the sting set up a chemical poi son together with the poison it ejected from the small poisongland at the base of the spine that flowed down the grooved shark bait sting into the flesh and blood the swell ing was rapid and the pain excruciating it laid me up for six days the natives of nukurua asked me as a special favor not to hunt the great blue shark this species they firmly believed were not of a rapacious nature and were supposed to be protected by tane a pow erful god of the sea who would severely punish anyone molesting them i had no quarrel with blue sharks tigersharks galcocerdo tigrinus were my victims those gray vicious bullies of the sea run ning in numbers launching sudden and cowardly attacks upon weaker prey but always turning tail and streaking off when the odds became too great for them treacherous cowards at heart and with souls of scavengers these gangsters of the deep are the most despicable of all the lanmidae family of sharks i have had of course many harrowing experiences shark hunting you cant fool around them long without running risks of having a leg or an arm chewed off once while swimming in the lagoon of nukurua toward the beach with a string of fishes which i had just speared tied to my waist a small baby shark slid up stealthily and tore the fishes away miss ing my stomach by only a few inches al though not endowed with sharp eyesight its sense of smell has been highly devel oped as i have stated animal or human blood spilled into the water will bring this killer from a great distance it wor ries its victim like a wolf circling about it in constantly diminishing circles then a sudden rush and savage attack when surprised or cornered it bites first and then flees if the odds are too great it will run away from a formidably large barra cuda and most times from a man swim ming most casualties concerning sharks and swimmers can be attributed to the shark biting out of curiosity or colliding accidentally with another strange object because of their poor eyesight sharks have learned from experience to use their teeth first when striking another mobile object underwater a few months previous to my coming to nukurua i had witnessed a sight at the island of rapa to the south of tahiti which has made me a sharks enemy for life frequently in the afternoon off the headlands of the bay of ahurei i would see schools of young whales guarded by huge bulls on their frolicsome way south to polar waters on this occasion i sud denly saw two small whales no doubt stragglers from the main school blithely tarrying and sporting on the sunlit surface of the ocean a native suddenly gripped my arm and pointed toward them crying hoarsely makos sharks rushing out through the headlands of the bay were countless sharks who had long awaited such a chance to ambush whales singly or in pairs in a minute or so the water bristled with the black fins of the killers as they closed in on the now startled young whales before the whales could sound their flukes were ripped to pieces and their great bulks torn to shreds by the hungry bloodthirsty pack from that moment on i declared unceasing war on tigersharks native divers working pearlshell beds underwater have frequently collided with sharks and have had their arms or legs seized and with a mad wrench the mon sters have stripped off the skin and flesh leaving lengths of white bone protruding several divers in the dangerous isles with whom i have talked have crashed headlong into sharks while descending and the brutes have sheered off parts of their jaws and cheek leaving their teeth gleaming wolfishly in their ravaged faces forever after but the most wonderful story in the dangerous islands is the tale of how a giant tuamotuan mopi by name rode on the back of a huge tigershark french traders schooner captains and colonial of ficials verify the account so i accept it as the gospel truth while gathering pearl shell underwater at the pearldiving atoll of hikueru mopi bumped heads with a shark the monstrous creature fully twelve feet long circled swiftly and at tacked him mopi caught offguard was forced to seek refuge in a coral cavern but the shark lunged in after him and mopi seeing no escape leapt desperately upon its back burying his strong fingers in the wide deep gills the shark en raged and startled headed with express train speed for the surface there the adventure brute barrelrolled and leapt clear out of the water with terrifying impact trying to free itself of its rider it suddenly shot to the bottom again crashing wildly through brittle coral trees and growths slashing mopi cruelly again it zoomed to the surface blood gushing from its torn gills this time it headed toward the sub merged reef near the native village where it accidentally beached itself there the villagers who had lined the coral strand watching with horrified eyes mopis amaz ing ride attacked the shark with spears and clubs mopi walked unaided to the beach his entire body bleeding and torn by the sharks rough skin and collisions with coral then seized with blind rage he whirled around suddenly ran back to the dying shark and gave it a smashing blow in the snout with his fist but at that instant the sharks jaws flashed wide and mopis hand was gone i had always hoped to meet this ex traordinary tuamotuan and one morning this wish was fulfilled a loud yodeling call aroused me just after dawn one day and when i protruded my head from my palmleaf hut i saw a polynesian giant standing beside a beached sailingcanoe he had only a blue and white pareu tied around his loins and his muscular body was scarred by long serrated livid scars the telltale decorations of a veteran shark killer his head was massive with tight crisps ringlets of gray hair massed low up on his wide forehead his eyes were large and liquid tender though giving the im pression of absolute fearlessness when he saw me he grinned and waved gaily his right hand was severed at the wrist ullo big boy he cried in a deep booming voice my name mopi i been frisco i walk down market street by cripes yah vera ka hau hot stuff mopi had once voyaged to san fran cisco on a copra schooner where he had picked up an amazing vocabulary of eng lish words he rushed up to me and threw the scarred stump of his arm around my shoulders in a rough hug it was an eerie embrace i come nukurua i hear you no like makos he shouted blowing the fumes of coconut toddy in my face i say damn hell to sharks i think we give em blen tay hell by cripes yah mopi shared my simple breakfast with me washing it down with a mighty draught of palm toddy he had brought with him he wanted to show me some tricks with sharks underwater so we hur riedly launched the canoe across the la goon to the foraging ground of the sea gangsters the surface of the lagoon was unruffled and the marine garden which spread out below us could be seen as clearly as if viewed under an immense magnifyingglass making shapes and sizes of marine life and plants appear gigantic and grotesque no soil or mud fouled the crystalclear depth nor was there any debris floating in it as the coral was hard and brittle and shed no particles to cloud the pellucidity of the water the shifting sunlight wavered in wide ribbons of light through the water and was reflected from the coarse sandy bottom and starkwhite coral ledges shooting through the green translucence again and again in diffused rays creating halations around coral grot toes and spires and casting deep shadows in coral caverns where lagoon monsters were possibly hidden the suns rays shifted and filtered through the rough un even windows of ancient battlemented coral castles and poured in subdued pat terns through interminable forests of coral trees in which blue butterfly fish flitted now a shaft of light would transfix the sliding body of a barracuda or a small lagoon shark or the green slimy sheen of a twisting convulsing congereel it was like an amazing kaleidoscope when i turned around to speak with mopi who was in the stern paddling i saw that he was affixing a leather stirrup terminating in a brasscap on his wrist stump in the center of the brass end was a threaded hole he reached down grin ning and lifted up an object wrapped in an oily cloth when he unrolled it i saw it was a long tripleedged knife this he screwed securely into the threaded hole of the brassguard i give sharks blentay hell he yelled waving it truculently in the air i indicated the deep water near the pass where the sharks came to forage and shark bait after inspecting the depth through a water box he nodded his head in agreement in the blue murk shadowed by the over hanging coral ledges he had seen the long gray shapes of large sharks he pointed out a huge brute to me that was cruising slowly among the smaller sharks he feel my knife first the canoe rocked suddenly and mopi was over the side with hardly a ripple to mark his descent through the waterbox i watched him descend feetfirst the knife flashing brightly in the clear water then at a depth of about ten feet he turned and shot like a torpedo head first for the bottom the smaller sharks took instant flight at his intrusion but the large mon ster he had singled out circled him warily at a distance mopi swam toward the shark boldly the knifearm extended the killer swam deeper and mopi followed him until i could see only a shadowy outline of shark and man a few seconds later they rose higher and i suddenly saw mopi make a quick lunge at the shark mopis face was upturned now and i could see that he was making faces at the puzzled shark i wondered if the palm liquor had not made mopi too reckless then mopis fixed sword flashed out and a small jet of gray smoke was ejected from the belly of the monster blood in seawater at this distance becomes gray in color the shark was goaded to wild fury now and circled quickly and charged mopi who nimbly somersaulted swim ming deeper and then came up under the brute for another hard knifethrust mopi was tormenting the shark now in the man ner a picador does a bull the shark was now leaking puffs of gray smoke in two places again the native swam nimbly around a coral fan and pricked the thrash ing enraged shark thendanger a small though dangeroussized shark came into the scene attracted by the blood of the punctured monster it saw mopi first and headed toward him but the tuamo tuan was not to be caught napping and when the small shark swam past flashing its jaws for a bite he sank the knife deep ly into its neck just back of the gills the shark was moving away from him at the time and by its own momentum drew the knife out clean without jerking mopi around the shark floundered weakly off vomiting blood from its gulping mouth but the large shark was still to be reck oned with it rushed in for a swift attack upon mopi and the native jerked his body aside just in time to save his limbs from a cruel bite mopi realized that he was exposing himself needlessly to danger with so much blood in the water so he quickly reached out and grabbed a fluke of the brute twisting his body under its stom ach and at the same time sinking his knife deeply into its belly then he re leased his hold on its fluke allowing the force of the sharks motion through the water to rip open its own stomach blood and entrails poured out of the sharks sliced belly the shark swam in a wobbly fashion finally giving a convulsive trem ble and sinking slowly toward the bottom of the lagoon mopi came to the surface blowing his nose lustily and began to blow whistling gasps through his clenched teeth with that peculiar fashion divers in the tuamotus have to relieve their strained lungs and to accustom their lung muscles to normal action then he climbed unaided into the canoe unscrewed his bayonet and wrapped it in the fishoil saturated rag he gestured down into the lagoons depth now you go down and give makos hell i gave mopi a long speculative stare my good friend i finally announced grinning when i want to cut short my life ill try to find a pleasanter way of doing it than rubbing noses underwater with sharks mopi gave me a broad understanding smile maybe you right hunting party captain zachariah max well retired and now en route to find gold at bozeman rode out of the brash white glare into fort phil kearney and found his old classmate captain graham out on duty his first concern was to scrub down and shave after this he soaked in the heat and dust and rawness of the small post and was badly impressed by almost everything he saw keyed truculence hung like a smell about the men there was laxity wherever he looked he saw men sleeping and gaming who could have been policing and dressing up the post if nothing better there was an arrogant sloppiness that needed discipline he was a man who had served with considerable dash at crack parade posts along the potomac and he had been a staff officer with gallantry and courage by t c mcclary ambrose ripped out a savage yell and cried charge sabers gleamed and they struck the undecided indians with cold steel during the war now what he saw brought mixed disapproval and concern at four oclock he watched graham form out of the swirls of lifting yellow heat beyond the gate by fourthirty they had cracked the ice of time and distance and fallen into friendly heckling the condition of the post was a reflection of its commander not wishing to say this outright yet wishing to make graham re member better times maxwell said but damn it george theres not a shred of regulations and deportment here and where youve got no discipline youve got no esprit de corps no wonder the red skins arent impressed into respect youve got a bunch of thugs not soldiers grahams thought went back to the charming dashing life of the eastern posts the background from which this opinion came there had been discipline at those neat green and white trimmed posts there had been military ethics in fight ing and even at shiloh they had found time and the desire to strike heroic martial poses looking back at it it seemed like magnificent but damned fool childs play maybe youre right max he con ceded amiably it is about what the in specting officers from washington think the last time i requisitioned new car bines they said our guns were in good adventure enough order but they sent out six bath tubs there is no seriousness in you max well accused and sooner or later it will show up in your troopers sergeant ambrose rolled toward them from barracks along the echoing board walk he saluted with the inevitable ex plosion of dust and thereafter dropped formality with a good spit he was a man built of solid iron and rock black of hair and smoldering of eye and with a black burned highboned face holding hues of dark brick red his collar was open his tunic unbuttoned nearly to his waist his knuckles were raw against his sunburned flesh and there was a suspiciously recent gash above one eye he said i was delayed in the line of duty captain graham regarded him with a twinkle the duty would not have left you too sore for a little ride sergeant not me ambrose grinned but i am afraid i will be short a man a squad will be sufficient graham said i want you to circle up through the big horns from clear creek and find out why red clouds braves have sud denly found that country such good hunting ah ambrose breathed with kin dling lights in his gaze maybe we will bag an antelope or two to break the monotony of issue diet he cocked an eye speculatively at the sun dropping out of the molten cauldron of the sky id say nine oclock would be a good time for departure sir graham nodded and casually returned the casual salute maxwell said with per plexity george you have staled that man sounded more as if this might be a good hunting party than duty maybe it will be graham grinned without disturbance they will go out there and spend their time fishing maxwell said with convic tion i would like to see the report he looked at graham with sudden sharp ness almost with accusation you gave him no general orders graham looked tolerantly amused but through it his eyes held a grim hard light max he said there is only one general order out here dont get killed if you can help it sergeant ambrose in spected his men saw to the muffling of bridle chains and accouterments with rags and for a short space debated with him self the taking of extra blankets he met their eyes in the shadowed yellow lan tern light and said no the extra weight is liable to become heavy before were back it is liable to get damned cold in those hills corporal lacey grunted cold or stiff which will ye be am brose growled and promptly answered his own question cold saddles and keep yer big mouth shut the log gates of the fort swung back they moved out in a column of twos sinking into the fluid starwashed shadows of the plains they rode silently until after midnight holding to the troughs and valleys there was no breeze and the heat of day held and a great dust cloud from a buff herd hung clear to the horizon he pulled them up in a stand of thick brush he sat for a space with eyes nar rowed upon the silhouette of the horizon nose lifted and ears strained and a hand upon his horses neck for any telltale tightening of muscles he might feel he let his senses reach out and bring back re actions too fine for the brain to define or grasp lacey said there are some rocks where we can build a fire it will be cold camp ambrose grunt ed what do you want to wake up without yer head lacey growled you couldnt see it from atop that rise but a sioux could see the glow on the dust cloud three miles away ambrose snapped unsaddle and picket to yer own heads and get what sleep you can he stood on the ground until the grumbling men had pulled their saddle blankets over them and their breathing was regular and heavy he moved out to a distance and sat down listening to the infinitesimal small noises of the night form a mood of silence that held the prairie vaguely he sensed the move ment of the horses and the breathing of the men and beyond the rise an owl hooted his attention sharpened and he hunting party leaned putting his ear flat against the ground if there were sioux lying near they would be telegraphing through the ground the owl hooted once again and then there was silence and after an hour he joined the circle of his men fifteen minutes before gray smudged the paling east he had his men awake and in the saddle and moved down through a trough between the hills at dawn they reined up beneath a rim and looked back nothing stirred around their campsite or on their trail he grinned and felt a mans gratifica tion at something well done the sioux lay thick as flies in the hills around a fort well we have given them the slip he said he led off in a brisk can ter to warm off their chill at the mouth of long chimney he said all right buckos make a fire and eat hearty the smoke will come out six miles away you bet eat hearty lacey grum bled it may be the last fire he gives us for a week compared to these hanting redskinned ghosts the rebels were just giving us a party in midafternoon they hit the clear water watering up they moved over be hind a parallel line of low chopped hills and began to climb the uptilt of the plains to where they broke against the wild and torn shoulders of the big horns here and there they cut sioux sign but noth ing of any account and nothing recent they broke from timber into the high grasses of the upslanting shelf and the vast lonely solitude of the big horns blew its breath upon them it showed instantly in the changing humor of the men their easily aroused temper and laughter sank alike behind expectant and tight and watchful care three days out from fort phil kearney ambrose looked out from noon camp and thought he saw a jackrabbit pop over the hazy brow of a hill he finished his meal and wiped his kit clean with grass and coming erect stretched his big rawboned body his mind was still on the rabbit al though there were no rabbits out in this high heat and there had not been any antelope in the bowl his eyes took on a dry and hard expression he said keep a sharp eye boys i think i smell sioux you think lacey corrected informa tively for the group you saw a jack rabbit pop along the brow of that hill but being a pennsylvania dutchman you will have us believing it was something whispered you by a hex at the stroke of midnight in the dark of the moon one of these fine days ambrose growled i am going to be sending that big mouth of yours to red cloud to wear around his stomach i do not like the way were picking up no sign he barked a gruff command and they pulled in their horses from picket short ly they rode in column across the bowl and up across the sheer face of a chalk blue bluff onto a brim half a continent opened eastward to their view from here on they were in a world of wind and space and sky the valleys grew narrower and the walls slit with dark dank gorges they skirted precipices that reared and leaned over their heads it is eerie country ambrose said lacey what sign have ye cut since noon none lacey told him not even a bend of last years grass then they are around us thick as snakes or they have moved up into medi cine wheel for hunting keep a sharp eye the light softened into evening tints and the haze drifted slowly clear at sun down they cut sign smoke signals rising sheer as mist against a dark red butte they stopped and watched with grim fatalism trying from the angle to make out where the signals were meant for every one of them had been through at least part of the rebellion and they were long since past heroics a man fought and won if possible when the time came but he tried to sneak an edge on trouble in the war it had been a matter of guts and stubbornness and daring fighting indians was a question of surprise and craft ambrose said it is my guess we have walked into the middle of them and they have us cornered like ferrets on a rat always a happy thought from our sergeant lacey grunted this is yel low fangs country ambrose and he aint adventure red clouds nephew for nothing when he closes he will have called in ten times our number maybe he wont close ambrose speculated it is hard country for a war party to make a quick gather he turned his horse down through a wash into a valley filling with the tide of deep blue shadow watering their horses they watched the crimsonjonquil splash of sundown in the creek ambrose ordered forage and camp and a screened fire as dark dropped like a net cast from the bright peaks the men made bivouac and ate well weve found what we wanted lacey allowed they are up in here thick dont get homesick ambrose warned were not going back until weve circled cloud peak were martyrs to his damned dutch vanity lacey growled he wants a furlough and to get it he will have us massacred in glory the men grinned the long shadows reached out from the mountains thicken ing over them wave upon wave it grew pitchdark down there while day still lingered in the sky ambrose stretched back against his saddle watching the greenand redlicked shadows of the men against the fire the smells of wood and bacon and coffee were on the air mixing with those cavalry smells of oiled steel and wellsoaped leather and horsesweat and dust there was an arrogance in the occasional glint of a brass buckle and there was hard combative pride in all of them and there was trust and comradeship in the troop ers low talk it formed a close intimacy of fighting men such as civilians never know the courage and loyalty and friendship of the cavalry were all here in this small scene it was something that lifted a mans feelings with its bigness and yet let him feel big and individual within it it was a thing they cursed and grumbled about and said they hated but every one of them signed up again when the time came he flexed broad shoulders against the ache of muscles and sat forward a moment enjoying the spread of dampness that drifted out along the creek he watched lacey knock out his stinking pipe and bank the fire and then he came erect all right he said no noise no talk and no spitting from you filthy chewers i we are going to saddle up and move downstream down lacey queried most usual ly you rode against the current finding surer footing more control down are ye deaf ambrose growled and hold yer horses up he saddled and scattered a little dirt upon the fire so that it gave the merest glow mounting he led out into the stream and looking back saw even the nearest man blanketed by the deep shadows of the cot tonwoods along the banks two miles down moon light began to spread across the peaks with its com ing they would be picked out clear against the water as in a lighted mirror he pushed his horse a little faster head swinging like a birddogs from bank to bank a mile further he found a wash of shale and rock and put his horse up the bank circling back he stopped below the crest of a ridge that gave down on the camp theyd left they heard sharp coyote calls ripping off from there and answered through the hills he grinned feeling a warm satis faction at a successful trick they came in for the feast and couldnt find the car cass he chuckled they will freeze half into a fever tonight looking for us up creek while we lacey grunted will be toastwarm in a cabin for certain ambrose answered mockingly and led the way into a brush darkened ravine cold camp he or dered at dawn they moved back upstream they found moccasin prints beside their first evening camp and ate breakfast over the poked up coals it was several hours before the sun reached them to warm off their chill the valleys became narrower and their walls sheer the trees shortened and grew gnarled and the peaks turned jagged and enormous rearing straight overhead they hunting party moved steadily upgrade altitude began to show in their harder breathing by noon they were cutting sign on yel low fangs warriors travelling sioux fashion in groups of twos and threes but always travelling so that a war party could be called together by a signal lacey said they are not just hunting they are headed somewhere there is a big wagon train heading up from laramie for bozeman ambrose said these damned sioux have a tele graph better than our wired one they had eluded trailing for the mo ment yellow fangs braves having turned downstream in hot pursuit after finding no trace of them above the sergeant led them at a rapid pace in midafter noon they came into a stand of gum pine and with feelings akin to heresy he had them coat their metal and smear on char coal to dull the shine sunset caught them on a high plateau between the mountain ridges and there was not a man but did not curse him for the blankets he had not let them pack lacey growled belligerently well be stiff as boards if we should get a dawn attack pile up some dirt here ambrose said and picking a ditch piled in brush and wood he had it covered with dirt leaving an opening at each end and just at sundown put a fire into the long shal low trough they cooked and stoked the fire again covering it with another layer of dirt and slept with their bellies across this heated strip their middles roasted while their two ends froze within two hours of sunset it was bitter chill and late in the night they were drenched by icy rain they dug their trench open at dawn and made breakfast upon the coals they moved down through a damp gorge all morning shivering then sweated furious ly while they climbed a sunblistered shoulder to a shelf they felt the suns rays lift bubbles in the flesh around their necks their dappled horses were solid black with sweat from the shelf they looked down and saw puffs and plumes of dust moving northward and converging upon the val ley that twisted out through the moun tains below fort c f smith ambrose said how many scattered parties do you make out lacey five lacey grunted that is quite a party i make out six ambrose said you would the corporal growled he scowled at the sergeant then swung his head with consideration toward the plumed head of cloud peak that closes the circle trail how the hell we going to get out of here right where youre looking am brose allowed and tore a fresh chew from a black plug we will use high pass the horses will never stand the pull then well carry em ambrose an swered unruffled and gave a copious spit they dropped over the rim of the shelf and down onto the gouged and canyoned uptilt of devils table a tangle of fresh trails made a crazy pattern across the floor rambling according to the ease of travel but all converging toward the val ley there was sign of pole drags and sledges which meant the sioux were moving their women and belongings and were travelling in tribal numbers they were right smack in the middle of them probably and it was a thought that put a tightness clean down their spines they travelled the troughs and dry beds with flankers scouting every rise twice they pulled back hastily and stood with hands warningly on their horses muzzles while groups of sioux drifted diagonally across their track it was slow and tricky going ten yards travelled for every one gained due forward sundown caught them still on the table and they found they had again been spied by trail ing scouts smoke signals were rising from the ledge where they had looked down on the valley they may know where we are or it may only be a guess from sign ambrose said in any case it is cold supper lads some day lacey grumbled i am going to go on a nice easy scout with you we will only run up against the devil they were dogtired but with dark ness ambrose pushed them along and in two hours they climbed the steep grade of a high ridge the top held no cover but sparse brush and boulders and was flat as a pan they made cold camp shivering under saddle blankets adventure at midnight a wind lifted out of dead calm and and slashed at them with a vicious whine cloud peaks crown was ripped in fragments against a cold white moon the wind bit at their flesh and knifed through their bones and the cold came down in numbing solid layers the horses were down and now ambrose kicked them up and put on alter nate horse guards to keep them whipped into motion at daylight the wind stopped as at a signal lacey cursed it would now well likely roast ambrose inspected their pinched blue fleshed faces and pounded some blood into their backs at least were not roasting on a fire yet were likely to lacey growled there are only two ways down both single file and tricky and there will be sioux ambush at both trailends theyll have a long wait ambrose told him lacey looked at him with angered mocking gaze you see any nice fresh springs around up here you talk too much ambrose grunted keep yer big trap shut before i put a fist in it he moved along the edge of the ridge afoot eyes searching the sheer walls where there was grade it was almost perpendicular and mottled with sharp outcroppings and treacherous slides even the faint big horn trail rambled to the far end of the ridge which was sign enough if there was a crevice one of those cloudhopping sheep was sure to have been there sometime well youve done it this time lacey grumbled with gloomy satisfaction youve got us swinging at the top of the world with no way to get down we will thirst ourselves weak and then get massa cred and well all win a medal when were gone to our eternal glory you are getting fidgety as a damned infantryman ambrose barked whats wrong with going down here lacey stared at the sheer wall beneath his feet it was a wash that had indented the ridge countless rains and winds had scoured out a sandstone slide as smooth as cement and steeper than an alpine roof yere gone berserk with mountain fever the corporal said nothing but talk ambrose rasped will you get movin or must i send you skiddin down there on yer backside allowing for the angle the drop was he judged about a hundred feet with nine picket ropes they could just make it he let lacey down first using a loop under his buttocks with his heels gouging hard against the wall the length just made ground which meant that with a horse it was going to be about three feet short if the horse didnt twist loose or snap the line and plummet on his head ambrose let down two more men and the quivering of their bodies when they hit the ground showed the affect of alti tude and strain he skidded the first horse down with a loop caught under its flanks and brought up beneath with a runner through its bridle to hold its head in line the horse backed down trembling with fright one slip of its hind legs and the loop would zip out from under it one eanicked pitch of its head and it would oop over backwards and roll out of bal ance the ropes were strong but not meant to hold against dead weight watch ing the horse slide toward them lacey could recall no sioux skirmish or ambush as harrowing he let go a blast of breath as the ani mals hind hoofs touched the bottom then realized with an epic string of pro fanity that the worst was yet to come the animals weight was pulling against the loop so there was no way to slip it without untying the knot that meant shouldering each frenzied and quivering animal up right while he got under it and worked at the square hitch at the end of two hours the horses and all of the men but ambrose stood upon the floor of the chute wiping sweat clear of his eyes lacey looked up and rasped now he is stuck up there or must come down and leave our ropes and i hope the sioux catch him while hes figuring it out there was a good deal more to this than the matter of losing government equip ment before they got out of the moun tains they would almost certainly have vital need of their picket ropes again they watched ambrose move around hunting party the rim perplexedly and finally come over the side and let himself down hand over hand midway he paused for rest with boots braced against the side but the strength to hold there was not in either his arms or legs and a leg gave and banged him violently against the wall he skidded a yard and caught but it was a drain on his strength and a hurt and they saw the wince and sudden pallor of his face serves him right lacey said but his eyes were riveted upon the sergeants fight after a space he said quietly get three saddle blankets boys on the dou ble they squared them and stood with them forming a landing net ambrose stopped at thirtyfive feet and again at thirty and again almost immediately beneath touch ing the rope lacey could feel the heave of the sergeants tortured lungs and the throb of his quivering muscles he is a heavy man the corporal mumbled and will land like a rock hold steady at twentyfive feet ambrose stopped to rest again and the hot drops of his sweat came down like rain his legs buckled leaving him hanging against his knees they saw his arms pulled out slowly to fulllength overhead and his hands begin to slip the sound of his breath pounded down on them in great torn gasps let go lacey called up and drop relax the sergeant let go and dropped heavi ly hitting the blankets feet first he ripped through but at the same time bounced he bounced hard and smashed his nose against the wall and came back down with blood spurting from his face lacey had him laid out on the ground and bathed his hands and knees and face with most of what water they had left he rubbed bear grease from a can into the raw flesh treating him as gently as a woman with his big calloused hands but when ambrose sat up lacey allowing for the angle the drop waa about a hundred feet with nine picket ropes they could just make it adventure said disgustedly it is too bad we did not let you land upon the flooring you ripped three good blankets you big ox why do you think i told you to relax ambrose felt of his nose and scowled why didnt you come up after me he rasped he got up and the strain upon him was clear in the tight pull and the pallor of his face he grabbed the end of the rope and gave it a few whirling snaps and they watched the loops travel upward and un snap the knotted top it came down bring ing a small rock the size of a fist lacey watched this procedure with per plexity knowing there had only been one rock near the rimtop and that not of a nature to crotch a rope he moved over and picked up the small rock examining the edge of it and finding it mashed with play against a bigger stone he threw ambrose a glance of grudging respect you mean you used this for a lock rock he demanded what else the sergeant grunted only an absolute idjit would trust his weight to that lacey stated with convic tion now you know the kind of ser geant weve got buckos a simpleton ambrose made noises in his throat he was too spent to hand out the fist that was his inclination the weight of the horses had played hob with the knots they spent a half hour cursing and rip ping their fingers raw getting their picket lines apart again they followed a drybed out of the wash riding low beneath the rim until they had twisted across behind a row of upthrown hills in late morning they stopped for their first blow and climbing a gullied hill with lacey ambrose cut for sign upon the ridge he looked a long time and then turned with a tough grin that is a pinto tethered to them alders and no rock i have been looking at that lacey said for a whole ten minutes nobody but a thickheaded dutchman could get into so much trouble and fall out brains ambrose stated his corporal snorted they bellied back and went back to their horses and felt the strike of the sun upon them like a hot knife they cut fresh sign and followed the tracks until they spread out like a fan on all sides ambrose lifted his arm to halt and considered grimly that is a party posted out for scout just in case we got loose and headed this way he looked back and coming to a deci sion shook his head we cant go back he said and we cant stay here he narrowed his eyes at a shaft of blinding glare breaking down the hollow from a micadesert i guess that is our trail it is six miles across there lacey said and that floor is like the lid of hell it is better ambrose stated than toasting atop a sioux griddle they moved down the gully and at the edge of the desert felt the solid impact of the heat they were a good nine thousand feet with their hearts tripping from the rare air but it did nothing to kill the heat and glare of the desert when the sun was strong he stopped and ran his tongue across his lips and stared out into the glit tering bronze flames licking up into the hot and solid wall of heat he said all right off man afoot and take a stirrup and dismounting himself whacked his horse and stumbled along beside in minutes the haze gobbled them their feet were blistering and the heat pressed in burning on their lungs the floor was uneven but there was no per spective in the glare and the men and horses stumbled as they moved along the dust stirred up choking and saturat ing them like liquid eating raw lines along their sweat creases at intervals the men shifted from foot to saddle but the ani mals were slowing their eyes glazed dull their strength ebbing on open prairie you figured four miles an hour alternating foot and saddle up here it took them three hours and a half to cross they fought their way upgrade and came out of heat as suddenly as from a sea onto a beach they threw them selves to the ground dead weary sucking for air that no longer scorched their lungs their muscles felt beaten and their flesh was burned black and cracking ambrose looked them over and grated harshly why yer a fine looking pack of bums lacey yer big platter mouth is spread over yer whole face hunting pakty the corporals eyes fired angrily and then suddenly he broke out a harsh dust choked laugh you should see that big dutch schnozzle of yer own the men pulled themselves half up and grinned with vary ing humor and derision but there was not much humor left they were dead spent their strength was gone their muscles one throbbing driedout ache their hearts were hammering and there was a buzzing in their heads they needed water and rest and hot food and a good nights sleep and considering their needs against their chances ambrose thought they could not have any of them there was one last spring this side of the high pass but it lay around a shoulder of the mountain that might be swarming with sioux he gave orders for a small drink and one for their horses which left their can teens stripped the sun was dropping per pendicularly beyond the gold and azure peaks and its oblique rays glinted off a tongue of glacier almost right beside them he said i am damned if i know why a man ever joins the cavalry and gave them fifteen minutes more and then signaled them to saddles the heat of day lifted with great pulsing breaths the cool gave fresh strength and vigor to their bodies but soon they would be cursing it they moved across a grassed and brushed land filled with treacherous rain cracks and hit a steady grade that grew precipitous at sundown they stopped to blow at the last fringe of brush towering over them was a world of solid ice and rock they ate cold jerky which was the best they could hope with the suns last oblique gold and crimson light upon them they looked back to where night had al ready fallen in the valley they saw fire signals at the edge of the desert where they had crossed and shortly saw signal smokes start up on the rim of a high bluff opposite ambrose watched with grim belliger ence in his eyes he said they are sig naling back down onto this side for a party to head us off theyll be racing up that next gulch trying to beat us to the pass the blistered and bearded men looked at him with strained faces in their minds they weighed their chances against de manding a decent hours rest there was a point at which the human body was numb to the threat of danger and they had very nearly reached it the sergeant saw it and his jaw set and lacey saw it and growled well the injuns will not catch us at the pass our sergeants going to have us dead first instead there were no grins but it put the weight of grim humor in the balance the men moved stiffly and came to their feet and started along the trail that reached above them like a thread with the suns disappearance chill struck against them like a knife the cold drifted off the gla cier spread over the ridge and moved down upon them in a steady wave they climbed at a stiff angle their breath whistling with the altitude their minds in a fuzzy painracked blank am brose had known vaguely for a long time that his horse was stumbling and sliding before he realized they had come onto a field of barren rock and shale he called a halt and the men dropped down from their horses and massing to gether like a herd of cattle slept almost as they stood he had to give lacey a shak ing and boot swan and rider hard to make them strip off blankets he went and leaned against a rock and took a chew not daring to sit down while he mounted guard he watched the moons glow brighten beyond the pass at the first edging of solid silver he kicked hanrahan awake and sank into stupor himself there had been four guards of a half hour each when lacey shook him violent ly he battled out of dead sleep shaking his head like a bull he bent his head for ward and down and pressed hard at the nerves at the base of his neck he lifted his head with a fierce blown breath and then jumped to his feet and felt the dead ness leave him it was damned cold and he realized his teeth were chattering lacey said theres sound below they walked beyond the fringe of re verberation from the mens hard breath ing and stood upon a ledge listening in tently there was a low hogback which it was not possible to cross but barest sounds came intermittently up across its adventure surface twice there was a sound of roll ing stones and once a heavy sound as if a horse had fallen he was thoroughly awake now and his mind worked rapidly three sounds in that short time suggested a large party not every horse kicked a rock rolling every half mile he waited silently but heard nothing more and finally drew back from the edge id say two hours behind if they were on this trail my guess lacey nodded i dont know that gulch but it is steeper maybe were got three it is not too much ambrose grunted and they set to shaking and kicking the men awake the stone field looked pre cariously steep of pitch in the bright silver light they charged it leaning against the grade on the second switch back they felt their animals begin to peter out and got down to lead they had to beat and pull their horses the last three miles they entered the pass and stopped to blow and they looked like gaunt specters from hell in the shifting silver light men and horses were about done in they needed at least an hours rest desperately but dawn lay beyond the pass in a pearl gray mist and it was important not to be caught silhouetted against the sky they stumbled through floundering falling cursing crying with fatigue and halfcrazed from the rare air they stum bled out into the first warmth of the sun and looked down upon the zigzag of the trail and their mouths were thick as cot ton with a mad thirst ambrose said we have got to hit brush before the sioux come up behind there is a spring just at timber line boys keep your minds on that he started down stumbling in a half daze at brush line the grade eased and his horse began to find its balance an hour below he got back in the saddle from desert and rock his boots had gone clean through he looked around at his men once and saw the fierce burning and the hollows around their eyes and knew the signs they were dead beat he kept hold of his pommel and set his teeth and kept his gaze ahead the sun was striking at them with real heat when he looked back at the pass and saw those damnable signal fires put their smoke plumes toward the clouds he had hoped they would have no means of mak ing fire but they had carried tinder he gave a hoarse grunt for lacey and barked from a swollen throat that will draw an ambush below at the spring lacev answered cracked and raw of voice the horses have got to have water the boys cant last much longer either ill ride ahead and draw them off the sergeant said ride in fast and water up and then cut down that gulch and meet me at the end he rode ahead and they watched him round the corner above timber they were at the corner when they heard the first distancedimmed shot and the hoarse savage yells there were two more shots and then the drumming of running hoofs lacey growled over his shoulder come along and make it fast riding in on the spring he had his canteen ready as his horse dropped its head to drink they watered and turned down the gulch at a dangerous stride the gray shadows reached at them and the silence mocked their hurried sounds abruptly the sound of scattered firing trailed up dimly from beneath they hit the floor and the sounds came stronger riding from the mouth they saw ambrose holed up in a boulder nest holding off ten braves he had taken position so that the sioux were at an angle they were not conscious of the others until the fusil lade of fire smashed into them and one sioux pitched the others broke in their circling and milled and foolishly emptied their few guns at laceys crowd ambrose ripped out a savage yell and cried charge sabers gleamed and they struck the unde cided indians with cold steel there was a milling and moil of dust thick with yells and shouts then six indians broke free and raced back into timber ambrose staggered out from the rocks hit in four places but only grazed his knees buckled under him and he sat hard upon the ground putting a canteen to his lips lacey growled just a damned pantywaist for a sergeant ambrose took a long full drink and hunting party wiped the back of a hairy hand across his lips whod they get nobody lacey grunted swan and rayburn are knifed up a bit you hurt hell no ambrose growled and took another drink were still twelve miles from trail and were going to have one devil of a ride for it he got to his feet and tending his horse climbed back into the saddle he put his horse into a steady jog and held it to the pace they hit the bozeman and then the clearwater looking back they saw streamers of dust hanging every which way across the mountain ambrose gave a tough grin through the enormous burden of weariness he felt he said therell be a patrol along in an hour strip down and let yer bon carcasses soak up some of that water swan was the first to have enough and climbing the bank demanded you dont figure to make us shave hell no ambrose grunted back where dya think were going to a dress parade the bath freshened them flkjl taking the worst of the ache a and strain from their bodies at three oclock the patrol rode by and joining the detachment they rode on in ambrose brought his men to a halt before officers stoop where cap tain graham was having a cool drink with maxwell ambrose saluted with his casual slightly truculent manner and then spat scout reporting cloud peak circle cap tain sioux are making a gather through the center valley to come out this side of fort smith thered be id guess about two hundred warriors graham looked at him at the lines drawn like webs from the corners of his mouth and eyes at the gauntness of his bearded face and the stiffness of his hands at his boots what else nothing but in line of duty little skirmish and four sioux dead he could not hold his enormous yawn then he said wasnt much hunting captain graham answered his casual salute and watched the squad ride back toward sta bles from the signs he had seen his ex perience filled in the details he could al most have drawn a precise map vaguely maxwells irritated tone floated through his thoughts on my word george youve let them get all out of hand a week for a fifty mile circle and a report they could make from riding along the bozeman trail from the looks of them id risk theyve been holed up on a good drunk maybe youre right max graham said without disturbance we get pretty lax at these frontier posts pardon my poison platters j by fergus truslow exgi wades record factory was strictly legit until he saw the shapely nylons under the work benchand his partner drank a cyanide cocktail plus deaths glass slipper by robert martin and other exciting novelettes and shorts in the may issueon sale now mask meeting on john donnelly had not forgot ten nactoo the eskimo and wal ters his white companion but he did not think of them constantly because he could think of little except himself he walked with a shuffling tread and his head was bent towards the ice over which he travelled blowing out of the ice pack the wind beat against his back donnelly hunched his shoulders together as though to ward off the bitter wind that was blowing right through his caribou skin clothing and into his flesh he seemed to have forgotten the time when he was a man walking with two other men towards a polar island whereon walters had been positive that they would find a great deposit of uranium to john donnelly that was another world and an other life one so different from this that he had difficulty recalling exactly what had taken place he knitted his brows because he could not remember and de voted concentrated effort to reconstruct ing the chain of events which had brought him here the picture he conceived was only a hazy and a partial one he had been loitering about a trading when the bear launched his charge the man jerked his rise to his hip and shot the ice jim xjelcaard illdsteated by daniel piebce adventure post waiting for what might turn up when walters told him of the island and its wealth intrigued donnelly had im mediately declared his willingness to help relocate it and he had had enough money to buy a dog team and supplies as well as to hire nactoo donnelly remembered that much quite clearly the rest was a vague dream a dis torted nightmare of which he could piece together only parts following walters compass course he walters and nactoo had travelled for many days over the ice pack then donnelly frowned all that he under stood perfectly was a great hunger and a mighty gnawing in the pit of his stomach there were still times when he seemed to be transported out onto the ice pack dimly he remembered dropping behind walters nactoo and the running dogs to tighten a loose sight on his rifle start ing out on the trail of his companions he had come upon suddenlybroken ice and this was one of the parts he couldnt seem to forget nactoo and the sledge and dogs were gone but walters was clinging desper ately to the edge of the ice he was look ing straight at donnelly and shouting something which donnelly could not hear above the roaring wind but walters pleading face spoke for itself then more ice crumbled and walters disappeared with it it had all happened in less than five seconds donnelly told himself and he had tried his best to rescue walters but he knew that walters had clung to the ice for more than three minutes and don nelly might have rescued him had he dared try he had let walters die that memory was no longer so tor turing or anything save an uncomfort able background thought because now donnelly seemed unable to think clearly of anything save the food cache they had left on cape moon he could reach it he told himself donnelly checked his compass and swung the rifle from his right hand to his left all he had to do he told himself again was keep going he would not be one of those fools who brought about their own death because they were afraid to fight a little harder a great surge of confidence crept over him he knew his compass and com passes do not fail not once he was cer tain had he varied the minutest portion of a degree from the course that would take him straight to the lifesaving food in fact he must be very near it right now he had been walking for many days some of the weariness faded from don nellys smile more than two months ago the old polar bear had started a journey over the ice pack he had no special purpose in mind and no particular desti nation he was simply impelled by a rest lessness that would not let him be still he had to wander because he was a polar bear and because he had grown weary of his old haunts he set an aimless course sometimes travelling straight for two or three days and at other times doubling back on the way he had come when he was hungry the old bear killed and ate one of the numberless seals that basked on the ice flanking open leads it was good and easy hunting and the old bear had grown fat now he was so gaunt that his belly skin hung in great sagging folds and he was very surly for the good hunting had run out many days had passed since the old bear was able to kill and eat a seal he had stalked the last a single seal lying alone at the edge of a narrow lead after eating his fill he had slept rising the old bear walked on in the direction he wished to go so doing he ventured onto thick ice where there were no open leads there were seals but they lay beneath the ice and breathed only through gnawed holes the old polar bear could not catch them on the third day he turned back to the frozen remnants of the last seal he had killed and ate the stonehard skin bones and flesh for a moment after eating the bear sat like a great dog on the ice and let his huge head droop so that his nose touched the few remaining shreds of seal then because he was still de termined to go east he swung again in that direction he knew that he could not catch seals and therefore that he could not eat in meeting on the ice that area of thick ice which lay imme diately ahead of him but the old bear had crossed many such barren stretches without ever having to go hungry for a dangerous length of time he was cer tain that he would find food before very long there was still little except thick ice the old bear travelled for three days be fore he ran across an open lead with seals basking at its edges the old bear flattened himself on the ice pushing him self along with his hind paws and pull ing with his front ones for all his twelve hundred pounds he made no noise and his yellowwhite fur blended so perfectly with the ice that he was almost invisible certain of a kill the old bear slid for ward he would have killed had he not made an error all his attention was fastened on a fat seal at the edge of the lead and he ignored entirely an ice hummock near it lying behind that hummock a seal that the bear did not see saw the bear as it passed the seal splashed into the water alarmed the rest of the seals wriggled from the ice into the open lead and dived deeply the old bear stood up working his jaws angrily and glaring his frustration he should have eaten here and the fact that he had not been able to do so whetted his alreadykeen edge of hunger the old bear went on quartering back and forth over the ice and trying to find another open lead there were none and the scent of untouchable seals at their breathing holes was maddening the old bears increasing hunger infuriated him and fury mounted to consuming rage he stopped suddenly snuffling into the wind and reading with his nose the scent it carried the old bear shuffled nervous feet and swung his head to look behind him he turned again to face in to the wind the wind brought man scent to him and the old bear still carried in his side an imbedded slug which was an always present reminder of what men could do they were mightier than he and had he been wellfed the old bear would have run now he did not feel like running for he was desperately hungry slowly exercising all his craft and cun ning the old bear began to stalk john donnelly despite his efforts to achieve one john donnelly still had no constantlyclear picture of just what had hap pened he knew only what was about to happen and everything hinged on the fact that he was walking towards the food cache on cape moon he was positive that he was doing so because he constantly checked his course with his compass and compasses do not lie but the obsession which gripped him was not completely overwhelming most of the time it held him but sometimes it relaxed to let him think of other things it was at such times that he thought of nactoo and of walters clinging to the edge of the ice when these thoughts re curred they were so real and near that donnelly seemed to be reliving the actual experiences and he screamed aloud he had made no effort to save walters and in spite of his selfassurances that he could have done nothing he knew otherwise thought of the food cache always crowded these nightmares from his mind he knew that he had to be very near the cache but he could not be certain of how near always he tried to force from his mind the shadow of what might hap pen should he not be near enough he tried to think of other things which he might be doing he knew something of arctic hunting and he was sure that there was a method of taking seals from beneath the ice but whoever attempted such a feat must have a dog and he had none the notion that only lack of a dog stood between himself and life was an aggravating one but he could do nothing about it there was just no way of getting a dog he must try to think other men had been caught on the ice pack far from food or any source of food and they had sur vived they knew ways to procure something to eat at least enough to keep them alive until they could get to a cache john donnelly could think of nothing he knew a moment of great depression he had walked for very many dayshow many he did not knowand all that time adventure he had eaten nothing perhaps he was only deluding himself and would not find the cache maybe when he became weak enough he would simply fall down on the ice and freeze the thought was a strange and morbidly fascinating one but some how there seemed to be no real connec tion between such a possibility and him self other men might be overtaken by that fate but surely he never would he turned around and the corners of his eyes wrinkled as he studied the hum mocks and pressure ridges through which he had come he tried to think clearly about what he had done and could think only of the food cache on cape moon john donnelly stared at something which had not been there before it looked like ice but it was not ice the wind ruffled it and wind did not move ice hummocks the curious thought occurred to donnelly that he was looking at a polar bear and at the same time he had the even more curious sensation that the bear was hunting him the bear too must be hungry as slowly and as carefully as he could john donnelly raised his rifle however he no longer seemed able to control it the sights blurred the barrel wavered and when he looked again the bear was gone for a moment he stood bewflderedly anxiously holding the rifle and staring at the place where the big bear had been then he realized the opportunity he had missed and a sob broke from him john donnelly choked it back and hope replaced despair the notion that the bear was hunting him strengthened per haps he could be persuaded to return john donnelly weaved among the hum mocks holding his rifle ready he knew that he must have this bear if he was going to live john donnelly climbed to the top of a snowcovered heap and looked all about he could see over the tops of the hummocks and ridges and the snowcovered level expanse which lay beyond them this was a good place to stay he could see the bear if it moved the old polar bear was almost ready to rush his victim when the man looked around without thought acting only upon sure knowledge that the rifle was deadly the bear glided behind a ridge and slipped away he went neither far nor fast for great hunger still ached in his belly and since nothing else was available he knew that he must have this man to eat if he would survive however he had to get him by stealth and take no chances with the rifle as soon as he was certain that the man could no longer see him the old bear slunk back he came cautiously testing the wind with every step and verifying with his nose the mans exact location step by step always shielding and never revealing himself the old bear crept along parallel to the mans trail when the right second came he would rush the man had climbed and was stand ing upon a snowcovered hump that was separated from and higher than the ice hummocks and ridges the hump stood alone with ten yards separating it from the nearest ice hum mock the man on top held his rifle ready but he was staring hard in the op posite direction and his back was to the bear slowly staying behind hummocks until he was almost within the exposed ten yards leading to the hump the bear stalked forward he gathered himself for the swift rush that would take him across those ten yards and up the hump the bear launched his charge he was within feet of the snowcovered hump when the man turned jerked his rifle to his hip and shot the bear felt the terrific impact of the slug and its burning course into his body he faltered but he did not stop or even slow his pace the old bear struck once the man collapsed like a fireseared plant and he did not move again for a moment the old bear stood on weakening legs which mysteriously refused to do his bidding any more like a slowlyde flating balloon the bear melted down be side the man he had killed that night a heavy snow covered the hump and made it just another mound forever lost in the vastness of the arctic but before the arctic cold got in its freezing work body heat from the two things that lay on the hump melted the snow beneath them side by side they lay on the tarpaulin that covered the food cache at cape moon the campfire where readers writers and adventurers meet three very welcome newcomers to the ranks of the writers brigade this month first we want to introduce arthur s riggs whose byline should have ap peared in these pages long before now for commander riggs career has been every bit as adventurous in its way as that of the swashbuckling hero of his ex citing novelettethe sword of captain duardowhich gets this issue off to a rousing start from whos who we learn that arthur stanley riggs is a retired commander in the u s naval reserve with a long and colorful experience at sea a former newspaperman and editor he is a special ist in italian medieval history and the author of many historical books and arti cles he was awarded the rank of officer of the crown of italy by the late king vit torio emmanuele and decorated knight commander royal order of isabel the catholic spain he served in the span ishamerican war and world war i and in world war ii acted as librarian of the office of cable censorship and was awarded a special letter of commendation by the secretary of the navy for outstand ing performance of duty commander riggs writes that he has just returned from a flying trip to panama navy flew me down air force brought me backand we gather that he is a very busy man indeed but were mighty glad he found time to write the sword of captain duardo in our opinion its one whale of an adventure yarn but lets let him speak for himself i suppose that i am one of the oldest men you have ever graciously admitted to the charmed circle of the campfire that makes me feel pretty humble in asking ad mittance to a group of lusty young buckos to whom a man of seventy must seem a true adventure oldtimer but i too have had my share of adventuring in various places and been mixed up legally and otherwise with four wars tried out the tropics been shot down m the trenches in and have just flown to panama and back despite my dislike of any but water transportation i have never shot a tiger but i once got entangled with a giant ray and was towed all over manila bay for hours until some soldiers shot the brute for me i should have shot the filipino boatman who harpooned the monster and then had no axe to cut him loose my specialty in recent years has been the study of interoceanic waterways or canals especially the panama canal on which i have already done five articles three of which have been reprinted in full in the congressional record as documents of na tional importance my lifelong interests however have been history and the navy in i was an enlisted man in the fleet an observer attached to the british french and belgian armies in world war i and during the last fracas was chief librarian of the office of cable censorship with ad ditional duty as information officer this was one of those headache jobs nobody wanted but somebody had to do and do right it took a lot out of me especially as i was eager to get back to sea where i had a lot of nonnaval experience some in sail the story in this issue of adventure is a curious byproduct of a big historical job i undertook some years ago no one had in cluded between two covers the astonishing story of the rise and development and then the crash of four of the great italian mari time republics between the fifth and the eighteenth centuries as being the real foun dation of the italian renaissance and so of importance in world history the research and slow collation of facts took many years in the course of it i ran into one very curi ous statement about a citizen of one of the republics who was captured by a pirate and sold not for a good price as a sturdy galley slave but for a mere lot of onions that was too rich a hint to forget so i filed the reference and data and eventually messer duardo emerged like topsy full grown the curious feature of the rivalry between the states of amalfi pisa genoa and venice was that they hated each other and fought each other quite as cheerily as they did the saracens and being good traders even be fore they were good christians they traded serenely with the enemy whenever they could make a deal notwithstanding the threat of the pope to excommunicate anybody caught selling the saracens anything that could be used against the socalled christian nations perhaps after messer duardo gets back from his present crusade maybe too much disabled to do any real fighting again we may be able to involve him in some devi ous trades and find out what it means to have an expert kiss the feetbastinado to you who have never seen its results i did just once which reminds me that re cently in the little town of chorrera in panama i heard of an indian trick prac ticed on the spaniards in the early seven teenth century the indians caught some spaniards and because the whites had been so crazy about gold tortured them unmerci fully and finally killed them by giving them gold freelylots of it melted and poured into their their veins gentlemen your pardon i talk too damn much tj h toussaint who contributes the moving story of a greathearted dog and his beloved master in the re unionsee page steps up to the campfire with the following introduc tion i was born a reasonably long time ago at barryville new york which is a commun ity so small you cant find it on most maps right along the new yorkpennsylvania border there was a tradition in that area that if once a youngster wet his feet in the delaware river he would eventually return to spend the balance of his days there i fell in at an early age and perhaps that is why i eventually came to live in philadelphia which is on the delaware river the jour ney from one place to the other however was rather long and very devious i received my grammar school and high school education at matteawan and fish killonhudson new york now officially named beacon new york this happens to be the same grammar school which j v forrestal attended and he and i were in the same classesnot that that makes any differ ence because it is reasonable to assume he has forgotten even my name by this time i enlisted in the army shortly before the outbreak of world war i and having been so fortunate as to come through a good part of that war without getting very badly dam aged i was sent to the training school for artillery officers at samur france where the french instructor staff while teaching us the latest techniques in artillery fire di rection and control also seemingly tried to kill us off by teaching us to ride horses over hurdles and down dirt slides without benefit of reins or stirrups after graduating from there i finished out the war with the feeling that nothing much could happen to me that hadnt happened already in the years between and the pres ent i have managed to complete my educa tion and have earned a living in the profes sions of sales management and market and sales research this type of work requires extensive travel and although this is inter esting for a reasonable number of years it eventually acquires the monotonous charac teristics of a trolley or subway trip a couple of years ago being fiftyish it dawned upon me that for thrills i was call ing on the memories of a life which has led me into some unusual spots and some inter the campfire estlng situations at about the same time i became rather acutely conscious of the eco nomic pressure exerted by a twelve year old daughter a wife the income tax and the high cost of living thats when it occurred to me that i might give myself an excuse to dwell upon memories by writing of some of them and at the same time acquire a little of the extra wherewithal to pay the costs of said daughter wife income tax and the h c incidentally the writing process fills in very pleasantly many long hours spent on overland trains and in hotels as to the background on how this partic ular story came to be written it is some what in the nature of a tribute to the best of the many doberman pinschers i have known and owned the appearance and the character of the dog in the story are those of my own gerd von reyno who passed to his reward some seven years ago the plot is a combining and dressing up of several separate incidents for the authentic detail of the oldtime german police training methods i am indebted to william necker of libertyville illinois the famous trainer of these dogs as a close friend he told me much of the history the romance and the lore of this breedand he did a wonder ful job of training my intelligent dog and his dumb owner to work together and thomas gilchrist whose unusual tale of a man who lived and suffered under the spell of a madagascan curse the scarf of oshaneappears on page gives us a bit of background on himself and explains how he happened to write the yarn from bonnie scotland to sea as a brass pounder at masters ticket at com mand at at broke away from brit ish ships sailed australian u s and ca nadian ships thereafter with periods ashore as cafe proprietor which persuaded me i was no businessman freelancing mainly radio plays and talks aired in aus tralia and since in canada chief nau tical instructor to ship gun crew com mand no u s army in australia this last during time off from my jaunt with macarthur from sydney to tokyo in com mand of u s army transports the war was over before i dined with some of mac arthurs generals at the imperial writing under the friendly guidance of the late dick wetjen and captain a e dingle i puttered about for a number of years selling fiction in british and aus tralian markets and i was translated to the danish and german i became a writer by inclination and a sailor of necessity for i wrote stories to establish myself ashore and then found i had to go back to sea to write the stories on my odd excursions into the new york fiction world however i foun dered lamentably until a year ago i got the right sailing directions and a good pilot one captain gow whom i knew years ago as a ship surveyor in seattle is respon sible for the scarf of oshane the old man would reminisce by the hour and he spun the yarn that makes the climax of my story he had actually experienced the illu sion though not of course with such serious consequences i had been to madagascar and i had seen things and heard things so i handed them to an irishman who would

pay off is just one of the many exciting feature stories in the big may issue of railroad now on your newsstand dont miss it adventure heres an item which we thought was well worth inclusion in campfire the story of the american legionnot the one we all know but the original legion an organization sponsored by adventure way back in it was brought to our attention recently by legionnaire harry galbraithwho mailed in a clipping from a recent issue of the denver post that sent us scurrying to the files of old copies of adventure to check the facts the abovementioned newspaper item as writ ten by post staff writer bernard kelly follows the last living member of the american legion in el paso county is hale and hearty today still carries his card and still wears his pin he is harry galbraith veteran newt paperman member of the colorado histori cal society and a profound believer in the horses place in the toomechanical world of today but the american legion he belongs to is not the presentday veterans organization with millions of members the american legion he belongs to and whose pin he wears probably never had more than members all adventurers but they were patriotic men ready to go to battle for the united states of america on a moments notice the american legion galbraith belongs to according to his story was a body of about men organized by teddy roosevelt and gen leonard wood in when world war i broke out in europe they were pledged to go on call any time day or night for service at home or abroad he said the mens magazine adventure became interested n the movement and became a prime mover in its promotion with the result that word of the venturesome pa triotic band reached into the far corners of the earth men came home from the congo the yangtze the gobi desert and remote places everywhere to join galbraith said when the united states entered the war in roosevelt offered the services of the unit to president wilson but the offer was refused and the organization disintegrated galbraith held on to his card and pin however he still has both the pin which he wears daily is a round gold lapel but ton threeeighths of an inch in diameter it contains a blue fivepointed star in a white field surrounded by a red border the only other man in el paso county who belonged as far as i know galbraith said was the late james gowdy justice of the peace who died last august he once saw my pin and recognized it at once histories of roosevelts life make fre quent mention of his division and his effort to get presidential consent to lead it in battle none refers to the body as the american legion however just the same that was its name galbraith said thats the name on the membership card maybe the present le gion came by its name through somebody who was a member of teddys american legion our thanks to mr galbraith for send ing us this interesting story and to the denver post for permission to reprint it here those original legionnaires of trs division must have been true ad venturers as well as patriots and heres hoping legionnaire galbraith will be wearing that pin and carrying his mem bership card see cut below for a

in alaska queryi have done a lot of travelling and can get along anywhere i like outdoor life and do not mind solitude so i think that after i leave the army i would like to try prospecting in alaska can you tell me the best place for a lone independent prospector to start out what should i buy to outfit myself for this expedition and approximately what would such an outfit cost can you suggest books about mining that would be helpful to me pvt donald j batchelder hq tr nd sq th car apo unit reply by victor shawi know alaska well having lived and prospected there for years part of the time just before world war ii and can recommend it for prospecting and mining unreservedly its a far better region than any part of the states today only trouble it costs morel for transportation chiefly as if you get your outfit in seattle its cost is same as for going somewhere down here it has onefifth the area of usa and has been explored for minerals only in certain spots yet and only percent has been surveyed and mapped geologically by the usgs so far as climate goes climate along coastal areas as far up as cook inlet and kodiak island is about like that of puget sound due to the north arm of the japan current that warms it all on the ocean side of the coast ranges most of the heavy rains you hear about are in the southern get elsewhere portion of the panhandle from ketchi kan up to skagway and north and west of there it rains lesslike around seattle in interior regions there is only normal rain everywhere and winter low temperatures are only in the interior and north of sew ard and anchorage youll get along ok being the sort of guy you say you are as to possible locations for commercial ores the areas more easily reached have been prospected more or less since the klondike days as you must realize es pecially for quartz gold and gold placers dut until more recent years not by modern methods for the earlier rock hounds and panshakers went at it blindlyby guess and by gawd so they overlooked plenty in a few places not so far inland one such is along the upper part of cook inlets west shore from mt illiamna and mt redoubt on up to the mouth of susitna river oppo site anchorage i mean the streams flowing into the inlet from the aleutian range that lies to miles back from the coast there theres gold placer in many of thoae streams and their branches but the coarsest gold is inland along the foothills in the upper portions of those streams this for the reason that the heavier gold is dropped where the ground flattens off thus slacken ing the water velocity lighter gold is carried on for a little way and only flour is found nearer the coast get the idea and by the way this goes for any gold bearing creek or river and heres another hint since all placer gold comes from a quartzgold vein in near by hills if you find pay placer never over look hunting the hillsides above it for the parent vein maybe its rich ore ask adventure  there are many other localities down the panhandle strip of s e alaska from skag way south including the numerous islands offshore of which prince of wales baran off and admiralty and chichagof are es pecially favorable in places i suggest how ever that you pick some area among these named first since itll cost less before you tackle those farther north or in the in terior and even the latter have been pros pected more at that along the kobuk koyokuk chandalar rivers and branch creeks flowing into the yukon from forty mile and klondike on down to st michael why because river travel is cheaper for places named above say cook inlet you should have at least for a summers work and or js safer areas north and inland need a grubstake starting at at high prices nowadays regarding outfit itll be the same as for the states unless you go inland or north where the clothing item will be different but the tools and camp outfit will be the same as anywhere of course foods for inland and northern areas are much con densed to save weight whereas in coastal regions you can almost live on the country outside essential staples as game and fish are plentiful and easily secured necessary tools wont cost in seattle more than and probably less if you get some at a secondhand store such as pick shovel miners singlejack hammer etc and for both lode and placer work they should include a inch goldpan magnify ing glass inch horseshoe magnet a pros pectors pick lb miners pick no round point shovel a jpint iron mortar and pes tle to crush ore samples for panning about two square feet of soft buckskin to squeeze excess mercury from amalgam and a wire brush to scratch richest gold from bedrock seams should also have lbs miners mercury in proper small jug and a pint iron retort to take gold from amalgam leaving saleable bullion also save the mercury camp outfit will be same used in states a tent bedroll cooking equipment grub rifle trout tackle compass ax oneman crosscut saw rope twine assorted nails notebook pencils camera binoculars a pair heavy hiking boots woolen underwear and extra sox and so on a proper tent can be either an atypc or better the new um brella type with a waterproof tarpaulin for a ground sheet in alaska with plenty of wood fuel do openair cooking but a gi small pressure stove is useful if it rains costs about down here um brella tent about at army surplus stores binoculars used for hunting and examining distant hill cliffs etc for possible ore veins and so on you should also have map firstaid kit some books ill mention and some reports on area youre in of

also get prospecting and operating small gold placers by wm f boericke price postpaid sold by mine and smelter supply co box denver colo in addition i suggest you get an im portant book by prof wilkerson titled determinative mineralogy for alaskan prospectors used as a textbook by uni versity of alaska priced at and sold by the alaska sportsman ketchikan alaska editor emery tobin youll get special service by naming me as i used to be on their staff another excellent book is by stephen jacy price also sold by alaska sports man jacy is an alaska prospector who wrote the information he gained at first hand prospecting up there its ok ive always planned to issue a book myself but never got around to it about taking a short course in rocks and minerals it will be a great benefit to you also in connection with the book concerning that subject mentioned just above by prof wilkerson most universities the past years have put in these short courses and im thinking the calif university at berke ley must have one if youll inquire there maybe theyll give it free to a gi if so at any rate itll be a big help because to find favorable areas to prospect you have to know just what types of rock the various commercial ores occur in as well as what the ores look like in veins on surface etc in such courses they have samples to study and that is very essential and if i can help further write me direct any time in closing ill say by reading the books mentioned and when you go sticking to it youll win success for it sure is there for youif you sabe enough to find it no kidding no swelled heads among the jivaros queryi have read that there is a savage tribe of indians in western south america that has a process of shrinking the severed heads of enemies killed in battle i believe these heads are reduced down to about the size of a baseball as i remember though the features remain perfect in miniature im wondering if you could tell me briefly how this is accomplished c m roach takoina park d c adventure reply by edgar youngthe indians you inquire about are the jivaros of southern ecuador who were still practicing head hunting when i was in that vicinity but who now are said to have abandoned the practice except here and there and now and then in remote localities they raided neighboring tribes zaparos cururays napos and others under cover of night and after stealthily landing their canoes they charged on the communal hut in which the whole population was sleep ing and in the resultant excitement killed every man woman or child they could lay hands on then after cutting off the heads with a wooden macana or steel machete they rushed to their canoes and paddled swiftly away halting midway home to pre pare their trophies for the welcome and feast that awaited them at their home village a great deal of misunderstanding exists about these trophies which are almost uni versally thought by people here in the u s and elsewhere to be shrunken heads with the bones and skull intact and that the indians used some sort of magical process in shrinking them the truth is that there are no bones inside as you can easily prove by examining one of the several which are in museums there in washington and also in new york and brooklyn here is how the process was performed enroute home the indians camped on a sandy river bank and immediately piled up piles of sand and built big bonfires around and over them and while the sand was heat ing they skinned the scalp and face from the heads by making a slit upward at the back of the neck until the scalp and face could be yanked away from the bones just like turning a sock inside out the eyes were left in the skull and the facial skeleton was left intact the scalp and face were then turned rightside out the eye holes closed with stitches and the lips sewn together with three stitches sinews or raw hide being used for thread the back of the neck was also stitched together where it had been split the whole party were in the act of preparing the heads each warrior keeping his separate until the sand became hot enough then they set about preparing them by the simple process of filling them with hot sand and while they were full by ironing them on the outside with hot ocks after an hour or so of this the flesh and scalp had shrunk to about a third or fourth its former size after having been constantly refilled with hot sand when the former sand became cool they then embarked in their canoes and went on home where they drank chicha and danced until they wore them selves out the trophies were just for this one celebration and when it was over they were tossed away to be played with by the children and pet monkeys and sold to pass ing traders when they went up or down the amazon i have seen hundreds of them down there that have been bought by people in ecuadorian villages and i saw large col lections in guayaquil and quito also an american named morley who lived at huigra on the gq rr had over sixty in his collection which he had bought for a dollar or so each the country inhabited by these indians are the lower stretches of the rivers run ning south from ecuador and entering the amazon where it swings around the big bend and heads east to iquitos there is a damn good book in your public library dealing with these indians and their habits written by upp de graff and i think published in london by unwin it is called among the headhunters he is possibly embellishing the facts in a place or two but it is an interesting book to read for the country and setting and the action is true to life lteres an interesting exchange of correspondence between mr lewis barton and our rifle expert donegan wiggins the moral still seems to be take it easy with those souvenir firearms friend wiggins have just been reading my november issue of adventure magazine my favorite magazine since and i always read the ask adventure depart ment first i read the letter from mr c k parker of eastman ga to you regarding car tridges for his japanese rifle and i read your reply to him truly a dis couraging reply to a fellow who has a rifle he is anxious to try out i hate to differ with you friend wiggins but in the interest of good sport i must in this case a mr j r pittillo of crowell texas makes a cartridge that is giving good results in the japanese rifle he makes them from the swift case soft point and loads with grains powder he sells them for for a box of twenty express charges paid by the buyer while i have never personally fired these shells i know of persons who have and say they have given satisfaction mr pittil lo has a federal license i am writing mr c k parker and tell him of this man before he gets around to the point of throwing his rifle in the nearest creek trusting you will not feel offended at my presumption i am yours sincerely lewis o barton clifton texas dear mr barton in response to your recent letter ill say i am not in the least put out by its contents guncranks like to compare conclusions you know im a life member of the national rifle association so you can readily see from that that i like arms ask adventure now back to the nip rifles i do every thing possible to discourage the use of these arms a local man is resizing ml shells and reloading and selling same for the mm nambu rifle but i dont tell anyone of that fact we have seen several of these that actually had cast receivers in place of forged and machine ones we wonder how long such things will hold together under actual firing the prewar rifles seem to have been accurate weapons from what the lads who were under fire by snipers in the islands have told me but the wartime made ones dont look so good i think they carried manufacturing methods to a new low in safety margins from my observations of the rifles now the following firm advertises that they will be able to supply the mm arisaka ammo later this fall stoegers inc fifth ave new york

bug and china bed bug to the scientist they are known as triatoma porcata these bugs occasionally invade houses or more commonly attack campers normally they occur in the nests of the wood rat they occasionally attack man producing a severe bite but are generally not considered fatal they are also known to transmit a disease from rats to man the patient de velops nausea rapid breathing heart beat and pulse this is followed by marked in flammation of the skin and a considerable stinging sensation these symptoms develop only if the bug is carrying the disease otherwise only a serious transitory stinging effect results this is a western species which ranges eastward to utah and south into mexico i have not met with this fellow personally although i have seen specimens in various collections i have had experience with a central and south american species which transmits a very serious disease known as adventure chagas fever i have also had experience with triatoma sanguisuga which probably inflicts as serious a bite as the species you have in california i agree with you that they are bloodthirsty beasts once while camping in okcfinokee swamp georgia i received many bites from these bugs for two days i suffered with high fever terrific headache and was generally uncomfortable to lick these pests avoid places where they are known to occur if sleeping out doors do not

different magazines any good can they be used for marine use they are surplus from army aircraft are a chrono graph and a chronometer the same i saw a chronograph for i was under the impression a good chronometer cost or more is there anywhere in the state of washington a person with a grade school education can go to learn navigation i can and have run fishing boats all over the in land water of alaska can go and come at will and ease and have never piled a boat up but that wont get me a pilots license can read a chart and set a course but have never used a sextant melvin h dudley norman ark reply by c b lemoni gather from your letter that you are anxious to obtain a coastwise pilots license i do not know offhand of any school of navigation private ly run in washington state why not look into the possibilities of the california state school ship it is not necessary to be a licensed mariner to obtain a coast pilots license however write to steamboat in spector service uscg customs house seattle washington for a copy of pilot rules for coast and inland water and it will give you the requirements necessary for such a pilot license i could not say if the bubble sextants ad vertised for sale are any good or not if new they would undoubtedly be in good condition and if they were surplus prop erty they would no doubt still be good but a thorough check by a competent person would be desirable bubble sextants are primarily for aviation use there is quite a difference between a chronograph and a chronometer a good chronometer by a reputable maker is ex pensive a good used one can also be found and if purchased should be checked before using a chronograph measures and reads time and velocity of projectiles a chrono meter is an instrument which measures time with great
