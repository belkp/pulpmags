but how about the other law of evi dence and your own senses if you saw and heard a man in that impossible situation or condition which would you believe the law or your own eyes and ears but the thing is impossible so then how about this on one of those fine italian spring mornings that pass for summer in the puget sound country there entered the savoy hotel seattle a man who ordinarily would not call for specific description but who for the sake of this argument we need to identify particularly he stood out from the world about five feet eleven inches weighed ap proximately one hundred and sixty to one hundred and seventy pounds was apparently in his late thirties or early forties wore a neatly trimmed brown mustache and beard of the cut known as vandyke spectacles with large rim less eggshaped lenses a soft black broadbrimmed hat blue serge suit with doublebreasted coat black tie low tan shoes carried a lightweight gray over coat a black gladstone bag and a sole leather suitcase he walked with a slight but noticeable limp of the left leg relinquishing coat and bags to a bell boy the newcomer nodded pleasantly to the clerk and registered in a dis tinctly legible hand the name samuel smith without address this done he set his watch by that of the clerk it was just a mreceived his key and followed the bellboy to room tipping the boy generously but not lavishly he asked that the hotel valet and public stenographer be sent to him to the one he gave a suit of clothes for pressing to the other he dictated two short letters returning to the lobby he bought a dollars worth of cigars asked to be directed to the totem national bank glanced at his watch and commenting audibly upon the time walked out into the crowd on second avenue nothing remarkable or unusual about that nothing that does not occur in a general way in a thousand hotels all over the land every day in the year true but wait a moment the case is not stated yet on that same fine italian spring morning of the same day in this same city of seattle washington there en tered the butler hotel a man who ordinarily would not call for specific description but who for the sake of this argument we need to identify par ticularly he stood out from the world about five feet eleven inches weighed ap proximately one hundred and sixty to one hundred and seventy pounds was apparently in his late thirties or early forties wore a neatly trimmed brown the man who was seven mustache and beard of the cut known as vandyke spectacles with large egg shaped lenses black tie low tan shoes blue

him to the one he gave a suit of clothes for pressing to the other dic tated two short letters returning to the lobby he bought a dollars worth of cigars asked to be directed to the to tem national bank glanced at his watch and commented audibly upon the time and walked out into the crowded street that makes it just a little mce un usualeh what but dont be impa tient or jump at conclusions there is more to come on one of those fine italian spring mornings that pass for summer in the puget sound country there entered the rainier grand hotel seattle a man who ordinarily well theres no use going through it all again in the style of one dark and stormy night in the carpathian moun tains a robber band gathered about their chief to clinch the matter a man of ex actly the same appearance as described above entered at the same hour and minute signed the same name in the same handwriting did exactly the same things made the same remarks and left at the same minute not only the savoy and butler but also the rainier grand washington lincoln seattle and frye hotels hotel clerks are observing people as men go and each of them of all seven hotels not only stated the facts as here set down but swore to them with many additional and confirmatory details you have not been bothered with talk about your alibis most men are content with proving that they were at some one other place at a given time but here was a manif the singular pronoun be correctwho was in seven different places at the same time with some thirtyodd reputable witnesses able to testify to the fact if it was a fact that sort of thing isnt an alibiit is the fourth dimension chapter ii you never would have taken jim carranaugh for a detective he was too obvious entirely too big too big by a number of inches both ways to be sure he could and had by strenuous starvation trained down to two hundred and eighty pounds also he had reached four hundred and one some place between these two ex tremes might be called normal if jim could be called a normal human at any time four inches and a half above six feet and almost an equal distance around his equator makes a fairly siz able man so it is no wonder he at tracted and held attention wherever he went but for all his size carranaugh was nimble of hand and foot as well as of wit and could catch a car or a culprit as readily as the point of a joke his command of polyglot american was the marvel and joy of his friends the english language could not be broken into too small or too irregular pieces the man who was seven to escape his power of mimicry had he not been the able detective he was he would have made a rare character actor had he not been so good an actor he might not have been so efficient an officer of the law chapter iii the totem national bank of se attle occupies a onestory building of its own just off pioneer square in the older part of the city close to the wholesale and commission firms ware houses and shipping interests that form the bulk of its depositors westward to the present shore or wharfline is all made ground the lower layers of this are or were saw dust and slabs from the sawmills that were one of the earliest industries of the little town that was to become a great city to this substratum was added the refuse of the growing com munity until finally the casual and in determinate merged into the planned and ordered earthandstone fill upon which paved streets and huge buildings rest the outer and western edge of this district still is however in more or less of its earlier formative state piled and planked over for much of the area be tween western avenue and elliott bay beneath these streets and their wooden structures the rising and fall ing tides slosh about and the industri ous toredo lunches on fir and spruce with creosote dressing on a certain summer monday morn ing the steamship bertha arrived at her dock in seattle bringing from alaska via skagway a shipment of in goldbars nuggets and dustcon signed to the totem national bank as was sometimes the custom in those days this gold was displayed heaped up in the banks windows to satisfy the curiosity whet the avaricious appetite and inspire the confidence of passersby this comfortable fortune was ex hibited during banking hours on tues day and wednesday under the jealous eyes of two guards stationed within the bank and two others at either side of the window on the street outside there really was no danger of robbery the heap of gold weighed over a thousand pounds and the window was heavily and closely barred inside and out the guards were nearly as much a part of the peepshow as the gold the addi tional and necessary touch to give it the proper importance in the public eye at night the gold was transferred from the window to the bank vault with due ceremony lapsing there to its proper measure of importance in a bank that reckoned its resources by the million so much for the stage setting now for the first scene of the comedydrama chapter iv perhaps it had better be called pro logue since it happened nearly a week before the arrival and display of the goldto be exact on the very day that the bertha cleared from skagway at that time it attracted no greater atten tion than any other of the many rou tine transactions of the totem na tional being merely the leasing of a safedeposit box one of the largest such as generally is used for the safe keeping of large books or other bulky records of value the lessor gave his name as seth c seeley address temporary hotel savoy seattle permanent bankers trust company new york business dealer in securities in less than an hour after receiving his card of identi fication and key seeley returned with a large parcel heavily wrapped and corded apparently of considerable weight and of a size that just fitted the man who was seven into and filled the box remarking pet tishly that the totem national should be prepared to supply its customers with more adequate accommodations seeley grumblingly hired the two ad joining boxes of the same size as the first and in turn filled them with sim ilar parcels these like the first he carried and put in place with his own hands despite their evident weight roughly declining all assistance prof fered by the banks employees thursday morning of that wreek daniels first assistant cashier of the totem national unlocked the vault to withdraw the cash necessary for the days business and to superintend the removal of the gold to its place in the limelight he took one step within the battleshiparmored doorway gasped and took two steps backward yelling for help there were two entirely sufficient causes for the first assistant cashiers excitement the most apparent was the body of a man lying sprawled on the vault floor very evidently and most completely dead the second to dan iels trained eyes the almost equally obvious fact that the vault had been lootedof the in gold and he did not know how much more for reasons that all bankers will un derstand and sympathize with but toward which newspaper men hold very different attitudes the officials of the totem national made every effort and used every means at their command to keep all news of the robbery from the public to such good effect that no sus picion of any of the happenings here related reached the newspapers until the whole incident was history the body of the dead man added annoying complications to this hushingup proc ess but the power of money is great even when it lies fallow in banks so no insinuation of bribe tendering or ac ceptance is intended here far be it from me to even remotely suggest that a banker would give or a policeman take money for the suppres sion of the truth the police were only too willing to keep the whole thing quiet until they hould have arrested the thief and murderer which consum mation they assured the bank would be a matter of only hours or days as is the optimistic not to say egotistic way of policemen the world over whatever the views on publicity held by the board of directors of the totem national they were not disposed to take their loss philosophically or inac tively while they assured chief stein of the seattle police that they had every confidence in his zeal and ability to both capture the thief or thieves and recover the stolen valuables they also availed themselves of the additional services of the pinkertons and the gov ernment secret service men the latter being interested by reason of the fact that part of the loot taken was some thousands of dollars worth of revenue and excise stamps temporarily in the care of the bank while in transit to other points of distribution as this indicates the worth of gold was not all of the treasure that was missing the total figure reaching to over the million mark whenjhe care ful check of the vaults contents had been made this sum was made up in addition to the gold brought by the bertha of gold coin bank notes and easily negotiable securities silver spe cie bills of small denomination and papers of problematical value to the thieves were found scattered about the floor of the vault around and under the dead body discarded as contemptu ously as this now insensate and useless clay the body was that of a man about five feet eleven inches in height weight one hundred and sixty to one hundred and seventy pounds in his late thirties the man who was seven or early forties with neatly trimmed brown mustache and vandyke beard it was dressed in a suit of blue serge doublebreasted coat tan shoes on the floor near by lay a lightweight gray overcoat a broad brimmed black soft hat the broken pieces of what had been spectacles with large rimless egg shaped lenses a black gladstone bag and a soleleather suitcase the last named was empty but the bag was partially filled with pajamas shirts collars and the usual toilet acces sories of a man particular about his ap pearance in the pockets of the clothes there was found nothing by which to identify the dead man except a card case stamped with and containing cards engraved with the name samuel smith and receipted bills made out in the same name and all bearing the same date that of the previous day from seven seattle hotels but the foregoing might apply in a general way to the body of any dead man under normal circumstances what took this body out of the ordinary was not only its inexplicable presence in the locked and guarded vault but also the fact that from the back there protrud ed the handle of a large hunting knife one of the elkhorn variety never car ried except by chechahco hunters the long blade was buried in the body just below and to the right of the left shoul derblade between it and the spine and had been driven in with such a forceful blow that the haft made an indentation iri the flesh about the wound an inquiry conducted quietly and circumspectly out of regard for the tender feelings of the totem national developed the fact that a man answer ing to this description and the name of samuel smith had stopped at each and all of the hotels indicated by the bills that he had settled his accounts and de parted the day before wednesday for a destination unknown to any of the clerks leaving no forwarding address but the policeman in plain clothes who reported on this feature of the case was not gifted with imagination above carrying a message to garcia and so he did only what he was told to do and asked only what he had been told to ask thus he overlooked the coincidence in the times of arrival and departure of the said smith which later was de veloped the chief of police and the city de tectives working under him on the case were unanimous in their opinion of the dead mans part in the problem there was not the slightest doubt chief stein declared and the others echoed that the man must have been one of the gang that turned the trick and that he had been murdered by his confederates dur ing a quarrel over the division of the spoils the suitcase they pointed out un questionably had been provided for carrying away this smiths share of the proceeds of the robbery and its empti ness was conclusive evidence that he in turn had been cheated of that share and stabbed when he attempted to pro test to them the police the dead man simply was one crook the less to require their attentionand good rid dance nor to them did he even pro vide one of their dearly beloved clues the government officers were not in terested at all in the death or murder except for its possible value as an indi cation of the gangs identity presup posing that there was a gang that had turned the trick the mans face and description were not on file at any po lice headquarters in the country and cabled inquiry abroad did not serve to identify him as a known or suspected criminal the pinkerton operatives acting di rectly for the bank and the bankers protective association were like the secret servicemen far more interested the man who was seven in the recovery of the vanished treasure than in avenging the death of an un known and presumably unimportant stranger who probably had received only his just deserts so the main facts of the case were and so they remained without a single illuminating ray of enlightenment at the end of a week after the discovery of the crime of course the police ar rested a number of tramps i w ws exconvicts and others known unfavor ably to the force but were forced re luctantly to let them go again for lack of a single item of even police evidence that would warrant their further deten tion as suspicious characters that is one of the annoyances of police ad ministration under our puerile system of limiting the power of the guardians of our wealth and safety now in russia oh yes stein reported daily to the officials of the totem national that he was making progress but nothing whatever had been discovered to indi cate the means taken by the thieves to enter or leave the vault or the bank building itself the guards regular and special watchmen the patrolman on the beat had seen nothing heard nothing all doors and locks were in perfect condition as they had been left the night before the robbery there were no signs of violence other than the dead body and the litter within the vault no toolmarks no fingerprints no tampering with combinations noth ing that appeared in any way different from the way it should be the treasure had disappeared the dead mans body had appeared that was all and it remained all until chapter v i came in for a little help tom said jim carranaugh to tom peiper son head of the seattle advertising service as the big man entered his friends office sorry but im down to small change if that will do you any its not bracing you i amthis time i want a little advice maybe a little help into the bargain cheapest thing i know im up against a queer sort of proposition lets have it you noticed about that last ship ment of gold from skagwaytwo hun dred thousand dollars worth on the bertha yes saw it in the window of the totem national now if they only would let me handle their advertising id never mind about that now tom if you can help me pull off this stunt ill whack up more than all the banks in seattle would spend for advertising in a year that sounds reasonable proceed can youwill you keep mum if i tell you something that the newspapers would break their city editors necks to get hold of i can and will listen that two hundred thousand in gold along with over eight hundred thousand more in money and securities was stolen from the totem national a week ago last night what who stolen when i havent seen a word about it in the papers whered you get the story have they caught cease firing the what ive just told you ill give you details in a minute the who is for us to find out you havent seen anything about it in the papers for the very good reason that they neither know nor suspect any thing about itand are not apt to un less and until the thing is cleared up then how where did you the man who was seven ive just come from an interview with old man snedekerpresident of the totem you know he sent for me this morning swore me to secrecy by every oath a banker knows and told me all about it seems stein the pink ertons and the secret service men have been working at the case for a week without finding the smell of a smell snedeker said he was disgusted with the whole outfit had heard of the work i did in that praxiteles affair i didnt interrupt to tell him that you did as much or more than i in clearing that upand that if i could do as well in this case for him thered be a cool fifty thousand in it for meand no questions asked i gathered that he meant he was much more anxious about the banks recovering the money than about catching the thieves though of course he wants them snagged too if possible so its up to us think of it tom fifty thousand bucks sounds very luscious but why the us where do i come in fiftyfifty with me or better twentyfivetwentyfive but youre the only original sher lock jim im ready to tackle any problem in the advertising line but when it comes to how about the praxiteles case that wasnt detecketing that was just advertising you dont ex pect me to run a personal do you say ing the gentlemen who robbed the totem natibnal bank will learn of something to their disadvantage if they will call at the office of james carra naugh sleuth nooo not quite that not quite what in the name of the chilkat gods do you expect me to do nothingthat is i want you to tell me i thought you might be able to help me locate or find out something about a chap by the name of samuel smith who stopped at seven seattle hotels one day last week whats that at seven hotels is this smith a man or a convention thats one of the things that i dont know that we have to find out but he or they is arethat is were give her more gas jim your en gines missing fire dont josh tom this is the biggest thing ive ever had a chance to tackle one of the biggest ever pulled off on the coast and if iwe can makegood be fore the government men pinkertons and police our reputations made and with that reward we can buy that island in the south seas and all wait until you catch your hare to return to this samuel smithwhere does he come in he stopped at seven hotels so you said thats unusual but not necessarily criminal and they found him in the vault hold on whats that found him in the vault i thought you said a minute ago that they hadnt caught anyone didnt know who did it if theyve got him whats the use of theyve got smith all rightat the morgue but that hasnt helped any yet at thehes dead as dead as they make em about eight inches of knife in his back better back way up jim and tell me the whole story if you want me to help if i can help you at all its begin ning to get interesting itll get a heap more so before were through or i miss my guess well snedeker told me there is no need of repeating what carranaugh told peiperson of what snedeker had told him when the detective had finished re counting the details of the robbery the advertising man smoked thoughtfully for nearly five minutes gazing out of the man who was seven his window at the olympics with their perennial snow peaks like old men in nightcaps coming out of his trance with a jerk peiperson grabbed his hat and was halfway out of the door of his private office before carranaugh could heave himself to his feet wherere you going to those hotels come on hurry you have the list must get busy theres something queer there might as well start at that as well as at any other place now that youve roped me into this and id have murdered you if you had left me out then we can go down to the morgue and the bank and the rest was lost to carranaugh as peiperson stopped to tell chris his of fice boy that he probably would not be back that afternoon and to tell any possible callers that he was busy figur ing on a big contract and thats no lie he said to jim as they ran for the descending elevator going from one hotel to another un til they had talked with the clerks and attaches of all seven they gradually pieced together the amazing and per plexing problem of the apparent seven fold identity of samuel smith as they left the hotel butler the last on carranaughs list jim uttered a piously emphatic belief in his future eternal condemnation and tom peiper son agreed for both of them mulling wordless over this mystery within a mystery they walked over to the morgue and as silently checked up the items of the dead mans former appear ance that coincided exactly with the seven times told description they had just listened to discuss it from every angle they were no nearer a solution when within a block of the totem national peiperson halted saying no use both of us covering the same groundtheres plenty for each of us to do and then some you go on to the bank and have snedeker let you examine that vault as you suggested and pick up anything more you can about the way the body of smith looked when they found it i dont suppose any of em had the brains to take a flashlight of the vault interior before they disturbed the layout thats what comes of keeping the newspaper boys out of it if they had been let in on it from the jumpoff we wouldnt have to be depending upon the alleged mem ories of a lot of incompetent witnesses who have probably forgotten most of what they did see and imagine a lot that never was theyd have a detailed and exact description by someone who knew how to see and what to look for this hush stunt makes me tired but in that case maybe we wouldnt have had a chance at the fifty thou sand thats so maybe not anyway its too late now while you are at the bank ill get busy and see if i can learn any more about this samuel smith talk about your alibis meet me at my officewait for me or i will for you adios chapter vi it was close to nine oclock that eve ning when a tired hungry perplexed and perspiring advertising man let him self into his office to find an equally hungry and perplexed detective await ing him well whatd you find how about it your lead tom it wont take me long to tell smith left town the day before the bank was burgled left town but the dead no alive six times or six of him he took boat for victoria san fran cisco and skagway and train for spo kane portland and vancouver b c the man who was seven the same day the same day the same smith the same samuel smithor a man who is described as looking exactly like him and who used that name but i tell you hes dead maybe so maybe so but he wasnt last wednesday not six of him but he couldnt no he couldnt any more than he could have done the same things at the same times at seven different hotels but they could i get you there were seven of himthen seven is rightseven men who looked alike who dressed and acted in the same way according to a carefully prepared and rehearsed schedule each of whom appeared did his little stunt and disappeared by and on the appoint ed minutes but that lets them out of cracking the vaultif they left the day before everything was all right up to mid night wednesday a week ago six of them left town that tues day six six then the seventh turned the trick and arent you forgetting the dead man found in the vault with a knife in his ribs well ill be you probably will if you continue to insist on it but dont lets worry about thatyet im anxious to hear what you found at the bank theres nothing except the results that is inter esting about my afternoons work i simply made the rounds of the railroads and steamship offices depots and docks until i satisfied myself beyond any doubt that all six and only six samuel smiths had left for the places i named that they actually had gone and not merely pretended to i would have thought the seventh one had taken an automobile for his getaway if it had not been for the man in the vault he com pletes the count that surely lets them out of itat least of getting away with the million but if they didntthen why all the acting they must have been mixed up in it in some way or one of them wouldnt be in the morgue and i was almost ready to finger snedekers check damn then you found something at the bank i didor i think i did i cant be sure untilbut wait until i tell you i told snedeker what i wanted and he gave me the run of the whole place but with that idiot daniels tagging at my heels and blatting every second about the effrontery of the miscreants in picking on the totem national for their dastardly outrage to hear him youd think that the totem was the only bank that ever had been cracked that it was nothing short of sacrilege and high treason for rude hands to touch even a deposit slip belonging to it if daniels was judge and jury the thieves would be convicted on sight and boiled in oilwhen theyre caught and he thinks the whole city state and coun try administration should come to a halt until the heavy hand of the law is laid upon themand that of the totem na tional on its million he got on my nerves until i wanted to hit him choke him anything to stop his incessant cackleuntil i discovered what i think i discovered then i didnt hear his clack any more though he kept it up without interruption he oh cut the daniels part now jim tell me what you found well i think i found the way the thieves or thief got into the vault you did think mind you im not sure and cant be until i get a chance to investi gate further if im right i dont want the man who was seven snedeker to know about ityet not until we are ready to spring the whole story he might go blabbing to the cops and spill our fat in the fire they would try to grab all the credit and nose in on the reward then where would our island be we dont want for the love of mike jim can the soliloquy and get down to cases what did you find im telling you fast as i can aint i of course if you want to call in every flattie on the force to share our pie or take it all away from us and put that island in the too muchee bime by peiperson threw up his hands in mock despair and jim grinning got down to cases as exhorted i had gone over every inch of the vaultwalls floor ceiling every nook and cornerseveral times without see ing a single thing out of kilter and was standing thinking what to do next wishing daniels would shut up long enough to let me think uninterruptedly for a second when i noticed one of the plates in the floor the vault is built up snedeker told me of threeinch chrome steel plates three feet square bolted together un derneath like those of a battleship and set in concrete the vault the whole building in fact rests on solid ground snedeker said without cellar or space of any kind below the level of the street seems they were afraid of wa ter in that locality he had assured me that our burglars could not have broken in from underground whatever other route they may have taken of course i took his sayso on this point for what it might be worth and no more but as i looked at that plate in the middle of the vault floor i began to suspect that his confidence was not based on any firmer foundation than his building the plate looked just like any of the others it was the appear ance of the lines where it joined the four around it that made me kneel down for closer examination and you know i dont stoop my proud stomach any more than i have to luckily daniels was puttering around absorbed in his monologue of gott strafing all bank burglars and paying no particular attention to what i was doing his opinion of detectives i had gathered was only one point bet ter than it was of burglars what first had attracted my atten tion was no more than that the lines of demarkation between this particular plate and the others seemed a bit wider than the corresponding lines elsewhere and quite a bit dirtier as if they were filled with greasy dust when i knelt i found i was right about boththey were wider and they were dirtier it was greasy dust or dusty grease and deeper than i could probe with my fin gernail though the similar lines near by were not depressed over a few hun dredths of an inch i confess that my hand trembled as i opened the blade of my knife and thrust it into those cracksnot in one place only but in a dozen on all four sides of the plate and each time it went clear in its full length without meeting any obstruction i scraped out a little bit of that greaseill show it to you in a minuteand then smoothed over all the holes that i had made what do you think of that sticking an ordinary knife blade through chrome steel lets look at that sample of grease carranaugh took his wallet from his pocket and from it a cigarettepaper wrapped pellet of a greasy gray steel color it was odorless had the feeling and consistency of paraffine filled with small grit and then asked peiperson laying the man who was seven the gray pellet carefully on the desk be side him then more with the idea of getting daniels away from that vault where he might happen to see what i had seen than with any idea of finding anything more i asked to be shown the other vaults i went through them all but discovered nothing until we came to the one used for the safedeposit de partment next to and directly east of the one from which the money had been taken in the floor of this vault and as far as i could judge without making measurements in direct line with the other loose plate was a section in ex actly the same conditionthe same thin crack all around it filled with this carranaugh touched the gray pellet and replaced it in his wallet and isnt that enough there have been at least twenty trained men sup posedly experts who have gone over that vault with finetoothed combs in the past week and not one of them discovered a smidgeon of evidence to show how the vault or the buildingwas entered and here i its mighty fine work jim i didnt mean that it wasnt i simply was anxious to know what came next if you mean what did i do nexti told snedeker i thought i would have something interesting to report within fortyeight hours he sniffed and mumbled something about they all say that but i didnt mind his being scep tical cant blame him for sniffing at the end of a week of nothing but prom ises without performances then i came here and put in the time while waiting for you in figuring out a work ing theory have you got one sort of one remember im not sure those plates are loose i only think so but im basing as much of a theory as i have on their being so then they must have tunneled un der the building after allis that it it looks that way something like that but what im bothered about is the loose plate if it is loose in the safe deposit vault instead of making the proposition simpler it complicates it what on earth did they want to mon key round that vault forprobably not enough valuables in the boxes to pay high class crooks for the taking men who were figuring on more than a mil lion can you dope that out i cant yet maybe they made a mistake opened up the wrong vault first and then went on to the right one maybe thats possible but not probable expert cracksmen who could locate the center of the vaults at all wouldnt make a mistake of over twenty feet in their point of attack no that isnt the explanation im sure it isnt theres some other twist in the tangle a better reason than that then maybe hold on a minute tom an al most human idea is trying to bore its way into my brain and im afraid to frighten it away by talking sit still and pray peiperson smoked his pipe and was silent as directed while carranaugh almost visibly labored in his effort to concentrate on the glimmer of thought that suddenly had occurred to him finally slowly his eyes brightened his huge body seemed to bulk even more hugely he breathed like a diver com ing to the surface as he whispered bythesevengods who rule the seas i believe ive got it i believe i believe i know where that million is lying this blessed minute and how it got there i believe i could lay my hands on it in less than ten minutes walk from where were sitting i be lievei believehis voice trailed the man who was seven off into nothingness as he stared at the wall as if his eyes were piercing through and beyond it to the hiding place of the missing million spring it jim spring it but carranaugh insisted that they go and eat their long deferred dinner before he told his vision declaring that he needed to piece it out in spots be fore telling even tom so it was not until he had fed mightily that he ex plained his almost human idea then the two fell eagerly to discussing the pros and cons the possibilities and their plans of activity for the morrow a morrow that was fairly well begun when jim caught a madison street car for his houseboat on lake washington and tom one going south for mount baker park where he knew that mrs tom would be waiting up for him even at that hour so unholy for the home coming of a married man chapter vii at nine oclock next morning peip erson appeared at the office of the city engineer and asked to be allowed to examine plats of the pioneer square district new and old the older the bet ter there was little that tom could not get granted when he asked for it as he knew how to ask for the next several hours he pored over the maps looking for a certain definite something that he felt convinced was in existence whether the plats showed it or not luncheon and everything else were forgotten as he dug and delved through the dusty blue prints tracings and brown paper drawings finally as his finger followed line after line on the earliest city map he could find it came to rest upon two par allel series of small dashes enclosing the word abandoned heaving a sigh of combined satisfaction and wea riness he borrowed a piece of tracing cloth and a pen from one of the draughtsmen and made a rapid but carefully accurate copy of the street and property lines in the district sur rounding the spot that had ended his quest and the contiguous waterfront and wharves this sectional map he then compared and checked with the latest official plat noting the changes and corrections made by the citys development and growth thanking the engineer who had assisted him he departed trying to whistle and smoke at the same time meanwhile carranaugh had put in an equally busy morning at the totem national going over the records of the safedeposit department making nu merous inquiries of the bank official directly in charge and generally in the opinton of that official and of daniels making a pronounced and utterly use less nuisance of himself instead of going right out and catching the thieves and returning our money to us as daniels phrased it to his fellow employe who agreed whole heartedly adding that asking foolish and impertinent questions about re spectable customers who rented safe deposit boxes was not the way he would have set about catching bank burglars if he had been a detective which he was devoutly thankful to say he was not little better than burglars them selves declared daniels no wonder they talk about setting a thief to catch a thief and so on in undertones during the interims between carranaughs count less inquiries of who why when and whither about the men who held the keys to those boxes finally carranaugh discovered the specific something for which he had been looking as evidently as had peiper son made an entry consisting of three the man who was seven numbers in his note book smiled con tentedly in selfappreciation that would have been no whit lessened had he overheard the opinions that had so re cently been expressed about detectives in general and one in particular and betook himself to the appointed ren dezvous with peiperson about six oclock that evening car ranaugh and peiperson dressed in old clothes and rubber hipboots rowed out into the bay in a boat in which fishing tackle was prominently displayed and other equipment as carefully concealed at nightfall they had not returned but the boat owner knowing both in timately as fishermen and men neither worried nor waited they would get back when they returned this safetyfirstprophet de clared and was satisfied to let it go at that chapter viii it was high tide and dark when tom and jim rowed in from the bay head ing for the lights of the west seattle ferry slip they did not stop at any of the land ingfloats but pulled slowly along the face of the wharves until they came to an opening between the piles near the foot of yesler way here they shipped the oars eased the boat through the gap and so beneath the wharf and pull ing and pushing with their hands con tinued eastward until they felt the bow bring up softly against the ooze a hun dred yards or so in from the dockline of railroad avenue with large electric torches to light their way and using the oars for poling they slipped and slid still further through the liquid muck until they were stopped by comparatively solid ground here they tied the boats painter to a stringpiece and with grimaces of disgust stepped overboard sinking at once almost to the tops of their hipboots into what seemed to be nothing more than a semisolidified smell stifling their gorge they made their way inland carranaugh flounder ing like a stranded whale spouting un seemly language peiperson long lean and lank not having a much better time of it what the one suffered on account of weight the other equaled by greater ease of penetration but all things mun dane must have an end and eventually peiperson exclaimed in an excited whisper there it is dead ahead just where i said it would be it in the flare of their flashlights was a sixfoot circle of even deeper darkness than the surrounding gloom in another minute they had entered the old woodenstave sewer pipe that had been indicated by the parallel dashes marked abandoned on that map in the city engineers office to their gratification and yet according to their hopeful expectations they found this ancient sewerpipe not only in an excellent state of preservation due to the thick cedar staves of which it had been constructed but unchoked to a remarkable degree by the debris of years that normally would have been looked for chain called carranaugh a hun dred feet in the rear as the surveyors steel hundredfoot tape tautened giv ing the signal to indicate that another length of the chain had been meas ured and as he came up with peiper son who pointed to the tally mark that makes five hundred guess we can thank our friends for this easy going remarked tom as he prepared to go on again unhhunh must a been a nice job of housecleaning puffed jim who very nearly filled even that sixfoot pas sageway im glad the old sourdoughs the man who was seven who built this boulevard made it sizable enough for a man to squeeze through or i sure would have been up against it taking part in this expedition we ought to be nearly there keep your eye peeled for signs of their work watch the ceiling about four hundred feet more if my estimate of the distance was correct look out for a big nag here chain was called three more times and peiperson had dragged out more than half the length of the tape again when carranaugh heard a muffled shout from the darkness ahead where he could just make out the flare of his friends torch dropping his end of the tape jim plunged ahead at as near a run as he could achieve in the for him cramped quarters until he joined peiperson who was pointing dramatically with his hand holding the torch at something over his head and with the other at something else evidently lying in the darkness at his feet was i right panted carranaugh as he came up right as the seventh son of a sev enth son you son of a gun of a prophet look carranaugh looked up directly above their heads was an opening similar to what miners call a raise roughly squared six feet by six cut through the stave pipe and continu ing upward as far as the light of their torches penetrated at one side was the lower end of a crude but strong ladder rising into the darkness at their feet upon a mix ture of mud rotted planks and sawdust broken concrete and general debris lay several hand drills shorthandled sledges picks shovels a hand pneumatic pump what looked like a complicated variety of plumbers blowpipe a head piece such as is used by electric welders a vshaped trough about five feet long and a foot deep made of some highly glazed material resembling porcelain a broken electric torch and odds and ends of toolsaxes saws braces and bits nails a small iron pot for melting glue or lead all the miscellany of a small workshop our friends the samuel smiths evi dently knew what they wanted when they wanted it commented peiperson and youre a wiz for doping out their plan of campaign jim my kindest regards carranaugh only grunted in reply as he heaved himself up the ladder gin gerly testing each rung to see if it would bear a weight not usually required of such a makeshift well ill be eternally and ever lastingly floated down to peiperson from the regions above as he scrambled quickly upward he found carranaugh standing on a small platform of heavy timbers set solidly into the earth at either end in the center of this there was raised an other boxshaped structure about five feet square and upon this were set four jacks such as are used by contractors for raising and upholding buildings the upper ends of the jacks thrust through a space that had been filled with the reinforced concrete that extended from the hole in all directions were resting against or rather were rested upon by a steep plate and if any iden tification of that plate had been neces sary it was supplied by a narrow streak on all four sides outlined in dirty steel colored grease so this is what holds up that vault plate said carranaugh as he patted one of the jacks i wondered how they had managed that now lets see if my other guess was as good as this one they descended the ladder went some twenty feet deeper into the abandoned sewer and then saw that carranaugh had guessed right both times the man who was seven here a practical duplicate of the other raise and its several features led up to another similarly supported plate they would only have to release the four jacks lift out the plate section and raise themselves through the opening to be standing in the safedeposit vault of the totem national bank but fearing the possibility of heart disease afflicting the guardian who probably was standing no more than three inches above their heads and for reasons not unconnected with their own safety should that extra vigilant watch man suddenly see their heads above the floor level of the vault they reluctantly postponed making the spectacular en trance into those sacred and supposedly safe precincts that would have been at orice so easy and to say the least unex pected two very tired and extremely dirty but almost hilariously elated fishermen tied up their boat in its appointed place some time after midnight and disap peared in the direction of the alaska clubs turkish baths in these sapo naceous quarters as moist as those they recently had left but gratefully clean they luxuriated for a good part of the night chapter ix when u p snedeker president of the totem national bank arrived at that institution shortly before ten oclock the morning of the tenth day after the robbery he was in a very bad humor the board of directors as well as several gentlemen who were powers in the financial world and coincidently in the affairs of the totem national had seen fit the day before to treat him u p snedeker as he often was in the habit of treating lesser employees of that bank in a word he had been called upon the carpetthe carpet of his own com fortable and handsomely furnished of fice to speak literally as well as figura tivelyand there also called down he had been spoken to in very plain rude words words that were not minced and that hurt his selflove and pride pointed words that also seriously threat ened to affect his almost equal love of pelf and position he snedeker u p snedeker presi dent and autocrat of his little realm who daily was accustomed to making his power and personality felt by all with whom he came in contact in the bank or out had been told in almost the same tone and terms he would have used to a mere bookkeeper that one more chance would be given for him to make good making good in this case signified the recovery of the lost million of the banks most liquid assets a loss it was inti mated more directly than diplomatically which was due to his snedekers failure to foresee and provide adequate safe guards of the funds intrusted to him as the controlling official of the bank if he failed to restorerestore was the word they usedthe funds within the additional time allotted to him by the aforesaid powers his resignation would be acceptedwithout regrets not only without regrets but it was intimated with the possibility of civil or criminal action they handed it to him good with no more regard for his feelings or the facts than he himself would have shown so as has been said u p snedeker was in a very bad humor he barked at the doorman snapped at the receiving teller and almost bit daniels it was into this surcharged atmos phere this mental and temperamental curtain of fireand brimstonethat jim carranaugh entered a few minutes later a very blithe and cocky carra naugh radiating peace on earth and goodwill toward all men including even burglars and bank presidents one may b maug the man who was seven almost say particularly toward burglars and bank presidents since it was to the happy combination of gentlemen pursu ing these more or less diverse activities that carranaugh owed his present high spirits nor were these spirits in the least ironed out or even dampened by the scowl of the doorman the snarl of the receiving teller or the snap of daniels no not even by the excellent imitation of a savage and surly dog given by snedeker the honorable james j was above and beyond the reach of all such petty irritations human or canine good morning to you mr snede ker grunt ive a bit of news for you growl you remember i promised to report progress this morning grumble but first i want to have a little un derstanding with you the substance of snedekers response divested of its accompanying verbal adornment was to the effect that car ranaugh certainly would come to an un derstanding that would leave no room for doubt about the bank presidents opinion of all detectives in general and carranaugh in particular when the cyclone had passed carra naugh unruffled by so much as a single hair continued about that fifty thousand reward it is too bad that snedekers language at this part of the dialogue cannot be re ported verbatim but the rules of public print forbid if beauty consists of ar tistic expression then snedekers re marks were beautiful however inde cently nude but beyond a smile of appreciation for successful effort car ranaugh continued to be unimpressed and unmoved from his line of thought and conversation will you pay it upon return of the money and securities or must delivery be made of the thieves as well snedeker with a bankers sense of the allimportant when actual cash is the subject under discussion immediately stopped wasting perfectly good words and countered have you found them the money or the thieves botheither i think i have think think im not paying you to think im paying you to know begging your pardon mr snedeker but youre not paying for eitheryet you are only promising to do so and it is what that promise covers or de mands that i want to know did i say fifty thousand carra naugh wasnt five the sum i men tioned seems to me as far as i can remember youll have to remember a good deal farther than that mr snedeker if you want me to recover that million for you if you are trying to crawfish because you think maybe i have succeeded where all the others failed if you are trying to jew me down because jou think ill be lucky and glad to get even fiveanything you choose to paywell all i have to say is that you have another think coming if thats the way you feel about it ill say good morning and you can go to tut tut mr carranaugh dont allow yourself to get so excited and jump at unwarranted conclusions maybe it was fifty thousand i said maybe it was no maybe about it is it fifty have you got them that depends as i said before dont fence with me man this is serious very serious much more serious than you can imagine im not fencing with you i am trying to do business fifty thousand dollars worth of business to mea mil open the door please the guardian of the door looked from the big man to the presidentpage the man who was seven lion dollars worth to you and if youll kindly cut out the cuss words and the condescension drop the rough stuff and talk like a gentleman as well as a banker maybe we can do that busi ness what the devil do you mean you impudent oh very well said carranaugh rising to his feet and picking up his hat if you are going to start that again ill be on my way and see if peter b far one syllable of that powers name was enough under the recent circum stances and carranaughs implied intent to bring snedeker to at least an outward semblance of politeness sit down mr carranaugh sit down i didnt mean to be hastybut you dont know the load of responsi bility i am carrying what a strain ive been under the past ten days sit down and tell me all about what you think you have discovered and ill try to re strain my natural impatience between my anxiety and the everlasting promises of tomorrow of the score or more men ive had working on this case you should not blame me for being sick of your tribei mean of your incom petent competitors thats all right mr snedeker i understand only dont class me with them or try to talk to me as you may to them im apt to be fussy when im sworn at and now if you will answer my question i will answer yours what question do you pay that reward of fifty thousand dollars for the return of the million or must the thieves be included in the delivery damn the thieves that is of course you understandwe must do our duty to society uphold law and order at whatever cost to ourselves con sider the public weal and the demands of justice and then i understand the money and the securities will be enough have you negotiated for their re turnehthat is i mean can you de liver themif we dont insist on ap prehending the i can you can you mean it my dear mr carranaugh you dont know what a load you are lifting from my heart you surely i surely can all of it every souless the fifty thousand you mean they no i mean me if i turn over the whole thing to you without a dollar or a bond missing do i get the fifty thou sand snedekers eyes narrowed as he gazed straight into carranaughs and carra naughs eyes were blandly wide open as he gazed back snedeker sighed cleared his throat twice as if something was sticking in his thorax finally squeezed out you do will you be good enough to put that on paper do you doubt my im not doubting anything merely a matter of form of business procedure ofshall we sayordinary banking precaution mr snedeker can you do it you can lay your hands on that million in less than five minutes after you sign that promise to payor you neednt pay snedeker wrote hastily for a few minutes made the wholly illegible scrawl that passed for his signature and handed the paper to carranaugh with an explosive there now show me carranaugh read the instrument nodded in satisfaction with its provi sions folded and placed it carefully in his wallet and the wallet in his inside the man who was seven vest pocket and with a deliberation maddening to the banker heaved him self to his feet if youll just step this way mr snedeker leading the banker into the general offices of the totem national where they immediately became the focal point of every eye in the place carranaugh stopped in front of the treasure vault from which the million had so mys teriously disappeared open the door please the guardian of the door looked from the big man to the president and the latter frankly mystified and curious nodded as they stepped inside the detective said i first want to show you how this vault was entered and the money taken out if i turned it over to you first im afraid you would lose your interest in this feature of my discoveries all right only hurry as had been said carranaugh would have made a good actor if he had not been a better detective as his ensuing actions proved nothing of their his trionic value being lost because his au dience was limited to one with much the air of macbeth in the apparition scene he advanced to the center of the vault making an im pressive gesture with his arm calling snedekers attention to the floor upon which he tapped lightly with his foot it is permissible exaggeration to say that snedekers eyes threatened to pop out of his head as fascinated they saw one of the floor plates one of the three inch chrome steel supposedly impreg nable floor plates part company with its fellows and drop out of sight to be re placed a moment later by the head and broad shoulders of a man who turned a very dirty but grinning face up to look into the bankers own remarking hello jim all ok wh wh wh what gasped snedeker this is my partner thomas peiper son of the seattle advertising service mr snedeker mr snedekermr peiperson well explain all the details later just now you must be more in terested in the money come on tom the banker nodded having no words to express his feelings just then and followed silently after carranaugh and peiperson as they led the way to the door of the safedeposit vault it must be confessed here and now that for all his mystification all his eagerness snedeker was not as nervous as his two outwardly calm but inwardly anxious guides whose nerves were on a wireedge they had bet on a long shot were gambling to a large extent upon what they felt were probabilities beyond reasonable doubt but still prob abilities it was just possible for all the evi dence upon which their belief was based for all the feasibility of their theory for all their confidence in their deduc tions that the thieves had not hidden the million where carranaugh and peiperson felt they must have hidden it they might even be right in the place of concealment originally chosen but again there was the possibility that it no longer held the treasure that it subsequently had been removed to a place of greater safety for the thieves so it was that there were three in stead of only one extremely nervous men who watched the vault attendant unlock with his masterkey boxes num bered three of the largest boxes in the vault the three boxes that had been rented by one seth c seeley chapter x sometime later when the contents of the three boxes had been most care fully counted and checked when every the man who was seven dollar and ounce of gold every bond and security every item of value down to the last sheet of government revenue stamps that had been missing were ac counted for when that paper signed by snedeker had been exchanged for a totem national checking account made out to the joint credit of james carra naugh and thomas peiperson when snedeker had telephoned to certain gentlemen in a tone of voice suggesting injured innocence triumphant over un deserved criticism when jim had told their story with such emendations and additions as his imagination suggested were called for by its proper presenta tion and to the due credit of one peiper son and himself when these and sun dry lesser matters had been attended to a smiling and affable snedeker asked of a smiling and equally courteous car ranaugh now that everything of importance has been attended to suppose you gen tlemen go to lunch with me and later tell me how the trick was worked and how you are going to catch the thieves the luncheon todaywith pleasure the explanation next weekwith equal pleasure but the thieves mr sned ekerdont you think it only fair to leave the glory of catching them to chief stein and his men surely we should grant them that consideration not usurp their special prerogatives mr peiper son and i are not common cops man hunters bloodhounds willing to sacrifice value for victims we are simply may i say mathematicians who put two and two together for the benefit of the finan cial interests of the community of course we could catch the men responsi ble for this outrage on you and your bank if we wanted to stoop to the lower problems of our arithmetical hobby but you hardly would expect us to do that i am sure any more than you would stoop to the practices of a pawn broker i know you wouldnt your own position at the head of your profes sion enables you to appreciate our stand ing and feelings at the head of ours so we may call the case closed the problem solved may we not thank you with which to peiperson deliciously ironical effrontery and to snedeker properly phrased and satisfactory end ing of what had been a very unpleasant experience which he would be glad to forget completely as soon as possible carranaugh rose to his feet and mutely signified his readiness to add several more superfluous pounds to his weight chapter xi but if snedeker was so easily an swered a certain married woman in seattle was not she demanded full explanation of several features of the mystery that the bank president was content to consider unimportant if not irrelevant details but thenthe banker was a man and had recovered a lost million and a nearly lost place and prestige while mrs thomas peiperson though she had a proprietary interest in a certain fifty thousand dollars still was a woman and a woman not disposed to forego her feminine and marital prerogatives and as moreover she was the wife of a thoroughly homebroken and properly trained husband her questions could not be so easily evaded not even by the clever twistings of the tongues of that husband and their mutual intimate on an evening a week or so later having fed the brutes according to the injunction of mrs solomon placed them in easy chairs before the big fire place with a supply of tobacco and glasses that tinkled enticingly and curled herself up on the couch in an entirely graceful and receptive attitude of beautiful body and alert mind she commanded the man who was seven now begin i know all about the seven samuel smiths stopping at the seven hotels the six who went away and the one whowho stayed how they stole and hid the money and the wonderful work you two did finding it what you are to tell me now is why and how the one was killed how the money was taken after the six were gone and the seventh was dead why they masqueraded that way when it was sure to attract attention why they put the money in another vault of the same bank instead of taking it away with them andand all the rest of it go ahead im listening guess its up to you jim perform for the lady said peiperson dropping into a touch of the brogue that he sometimes affected when in cer tain moods carranaugh grinned back saying shes your wife not minesorra be its too full i am of her dinner and good things to talk yet awhile im too busy looking at her and thinkin what a fool for luck y are tom dear besides ive gained another twenty pounds the past week and its on my conscience i must bant again bad luck to the fat of me let me meditate in peace upon the last mans meal ill have for manys the day do you tell the girl ill add a word or two here and there should you forget or correct you if you dont give me the credit thats due me egregious egotist that y are make him mary theres the darlin and mary made him well dear itll do no harm to con fess in the bosom of our family that we only can guess at part of what you want to know deduce other parts from cir cumstantial evidence and be sure only of the little that remains but if you will take the explanation as a mixture of all three and let it go at that without being too particular about which is which here it is so that you will understand from the outset something that bothered us a good deal and very nearly threw us off the right trackas it was intended to doill begin in the middle with the fact that the body found in the vault was not one of the original seven samuel smiths at all was not murdered or killed by them or anyone else and had nothing to do with the looting of the bank except as a bit of evidence plant ed in the vault to complicate the case and confuse the police the leader of the gang the real samuel smith or whatever his name is saw very clearly that an attempt at least would be made to trace the move ments of the seven men he made the departing trails of his six assistants very easy to follow once they had done their part of the heavy preliminary work in the old sewer he figured that the police finding six identical clues would be so puzzled that they would simply begin to chase their tails and even if they caught one or two of the six they would still be beaten for the money was still safe in the vault but since he himself was compelled to remain in the city to carry out the actual robbery and then wait until it would be reasonably safe to take the swag out of town without being caught at railroad station or steamship dock by the plainclothes men on guard it was necessary that the seventh mem ber also should be as easily accounted for thats where the murdered man came in as part of the setting of the scene he had it is probable been pro vided for in advance and held in readi ness for the silent but important part he played it was no insuperable diffi culty for such a clever and resourceful crook as samuel smith to secure from some other city a body of a man with a vandyke beard and looking sufficiently like himself and the other six to pass the man who was seven musterespecially since the police and we ourselves were only too ready to jump blindly at conclusions it really needed no more than a fair suggestion of a likeness coupled with the duplicate clothes and belongings to turn the trick and make us all think that the entire gang was accounted for and we would have let it go at that and probably never dispelled the mys tery if it had not been for our sleepy friend here jims suspicions were aroused the first time he visited the morgue and examined the body the wound in the back didnt look just right to him as a basis for a burial certificate and there was not nearly enough blood on the blade of the hunting knife to satisfy his demand for gore he fussed around and made himself such a gen eral nuisance to the coroner and the coroners physician that to get rid of his pestering they agreed to perform an autopsy they did jim was right that wound in the back was not the cause of death the knife had been driven into the body at least and probably more than fortyeight hours after the man had died of a hemorrhage of one of the large abdominal arteries due to a ma lignant ulceration of the intestines this was proved not only by finding the very evident proof of the internal rupture but also by the fact that all the blood in the body had drained into the abdominal cavity where it had almost entirely coagulated also there was no sign of bleeding in or about the region of the wound so much for so much ive just suggested the reason for their not taking the loot with them at onceevery avenue of egress from the city would be watched for days after ward by the forces of the law well then what hiding place would be less likely to be suspected than the safede posit vault of the bank itself smith was evidently too experienced a crook to find any difficulty in getting hold of a master key so he simply opened the boxes took out his packages emptied the rocks or old bricks that filled them into the sewer opening and put in the gold money and securities now he could come back weeks or months after ward take out his packages and escape all suspicion but jim here doped it all out the moment he ran across the trail of the three boxes rented by seth c seeleywho of course was none other than the gang leader himself after he had discovered the second loose plate if you could have gone through that abandoned sewer with uswhich your sensitive nose may be thankful you didntand seen the amount of work it must have taken to clear it of the debris of years to cut those holes up to the concrete foundation and then chip it away under both plates through several feet reinforced with steel rods and finally to burn those extremely narrow cuts through three inches of super hardened steel you would have won dered that it had not taken seventy men instead of seven they must have been at it for weeks the greasy dust was paraffine mixed with fine steel filings and served simply to fill and hide the cuts made in the plates about the masquerading as you call it at the hotels i think some of that performance was just that and no more a touch of melodramatic theatricalism put on for its own sake and to gratify the whimsical humor of samuel smith who i imagine is a bit of a farceur in his way of course he had a serious purpose also his planwhich he car ried out exactly in every detail except the final disappearance with the million called for the transference of the treasure from one vault to the other in a single night and by himself alone the man who was seven after the plain departure of the six lesser crooks this involved not only a number of hours of very hard work for him but also the running of the greatest degree of risk that had been taken he planned in the event of his being caught at any stage of the proceedings except when he was actually handling the valuables to be able to make all attempts at posi tive identification so ridiculous that no court would have held him on the evi dence submitted he would have some thirtyodd reputable witnesses to swear that he was in seven places doing the same things at the same timesand so discredit any police testimony about his actions at any other time if the one was impossi blethe other would or might appear equally so or at any rate the chance was worth the effortthe chances plus the pure whimsical humor of it there you have the whole story do you mean to say that you are going to stop there that that is all there is to it fiddle it isnt a bit as ex citing as i thought it was going to be youve taken all the romance out of it i want to know what became of samuel smith and his six doubles or would you call it sextuples what he did when he found you had opened those boxes instead of hishow he finally got awayand a whole lot of other things expostulated mary peiperson pouting at her husband and the somnolent car ranaugh sorry sweetheart but ive told you all i know and there isnt any dramatic end ing guess not thems the bare unin teresting facts in a nutshellunless you want to call an interchange of ads dra matic ads what ads one i wrote and one in reply from samuel smith that sounds a little encouraging thanks for the wild applause i can quote them both from memory mine published in all the large papers of the northwest ran to the seven who were one and the one who was seven greeting thanks for your contribution to the deserving charity that begins at the home of c and p and he replied in the same papers c and p you are welcome since i was unable to contribute to the still more deserving charity nearer home that i had intended to benefit sorry not to be able to offer my congratulations in person but the first law of nature forbids possibly we shall meet at some later date tables have a way of turning au revoir the man who was seven the end im going into that room myself he said severely and well have this nonsense over withpage the summons by henry altimus it was elsa lloyds first experience with death as a nurse at st lukes she was the youngest graduate at the hospital slender and frail with blue eyes that betrayed the strain she had been under despite her brave effort to appear selfpossessed the older nurses had been extremely helpful not at all resentful that she had been chosen for so important a case but she had pur sued her duties to the very end courage ously and competently without requir ing any assistance it was nearly over now scofield carrington was dead his body was soon to be removed to his home and she was studying the care fully kept chart of her patient prepara tory to turning it over to the head nurse she was seated at a little table in the floor office the chart before her using this brief respite after the trying ex perience of the preceding night to col lect herself when the bell rang softly and the indicator clicked over her head elsa lloyd did not look up as carringtons private nurse she was ex pected to answer only his summons but presently she was aware that a floor nurse had entered in answer to the bell and pausing a moment before the indicator had come up close to her its calling said the nurse isnt that carrington elsa lloyd came to her feet quickly her eyes lifting to the indicator a little tinge of color coming to her cheeks yes she said weakly her lips fell apart her hand caught the back of the chair from which she had just risen her eyes still fixed on the little plate showing the numerals on the indicator her tired brain could not grapple with the strange situ ation carrington had passed away in the early hours of the morning and only half an hour before she had left his room her duties over and nowthe bell she turned at last question in her eyes perhaps its dr stockbridge the nurse ventured hes in the operating room said elsa quickly or some one else and seeing the weariness in the young girls face she added shall i answer for you thank you ill go she hurried down the long silent corridor she paused at the door hesi tated then knocked lightly there was no response her hand lowered to the knob she turned it and the door yielded there was no one in the room everything was exactly as she had left it half an hour before the drawn shades through which the morning sun light filtered pale and warm the still ness of death and in the far corner of the huge room the bed with its rigid silent occupant elsas first impulse was to turn and escape but she checked herself waited her back to the door while the rapid beating of her heart subsided presently she moved toward the bed slowly her feet scarcely lifting from the floor nothing had been altered not a wrin kle in the sheet that covered the dead the summons mans body had been changed she looked down into his face observed the strong features immobile in death the thin lips firmly locked the square chin thrust forward defiant challenging even now scofield carrington had not wanted to die the great financier who had feared nothing had ilot feared death but he had not been ready to go he had wanted to hold off the hand of death only a little while longer but it had come relentlessly and his fea tures still showed the marks of the dead mans struggle the unhappiness of his last moments which had come without the fulfillment of his cherished hope elsas eyes lifted to the bell that hung from the back of the bed corded wire with a button at the end the pres sure of which had summoned her so often in the past few weeks to the side of her patienthad summoned her even now to his side some hand had touched it within the last few minutes whose she lingered a while baffled immo bile in the presence of the inexplicable circumstance it must be some mistake she said at last she spoke aloud to reassure herself and to reassure any one who might hear her somehow she felt a vague presence in the room she dared not look about her and having spoken she turned and hurried out of the room the nurse was waiting for her at the office door she noted the pallor in elsas face the agitation which her strained features did not conceal elsa took the hand she extended leaning heavily on it some one has been and gone she said in a soothing voice youre un strung you ought to she stopped abruptly their eyes met and they stood close neither daring to turn for the indi cator had clicked again it was the elder nurse who first sum moned the courage to look and when their eyes met again elsa knew what she had seen its said the elder nurse in a hoarse voice elsas head lowered a shudder run ning down her frame and her compan ion led her to a chair into which the girl dropped heavily sometimes the indicator gets out of order muttered the elder nurse it may be that though i dont recall its ever happening before the wires may get crossedor something her voice trailed away she knew that her assurances were unconvincing to elsathey were unconvincing to herself she realized that her usual pres ence of mind was not at her command disciplined in the shadow of suffer ing and death she was aware that for the first time in her experience she was confronted by the intrusion of an intan gible element which eluded her under standing carrington was dead there was no one in his room yet his bell was ringing we ought to report it she said at last some one ought to be in the room its she paused as a young interne en tered the office her face lighted up hopefully doctor she said coming toward him is calling wont you thats carringtons room isnt it asked the interne yes well its miss lloyds case why doesnt she go shes just been there and theres no one in the room what stammered the interne and thats the second time the bell has rung the summons more from the crumpled attitude of elsa lloyd in her chair than from the words of the elder nurse the interne gathered the meaning of the strange situation his eyes were wide with amazement he looked to the indicator and then turned to the nurse his lips moved stirred mutely a moment does dr stockbridge know he asked at last no ill tell him and he spun about on his heel and was gone the nurse moved toward the indi cator mechanically her hand lifting slowly and pressing the knob that re leased the number the indicator was bare but scarcely had her arm low ered to her side than a bell tinkled it was again elsa lloyd her elbows on the little desk her face buried in her hands did not look up she knew from the touch of her companions hand on her shoul der what the bell meant the nurse slipped into a chair beside the younger woman for a long time she was silent then i cant understand it she muttered half to herself ive never had such an experience before ive seen so many deaths and death was always so final so completely thethe end of course theres the soul the spiritits called by so many names and ive heard much nonsense about it i never be lievedfew of us dobut every now and then something happens like this what can it mean despite herself a tremor half of doubt half of awe shook her she turned to elsa what do you know about carring ton she asked you were with him for weeks can you think of anything that she did not complete her question her thought too unformed fof words was there anything she resumed in a moment before he diedanything that might explain this elsa sat up but her head was averted as she spoke i dont understand she said her voice low and frail but when i was in the room just now i felti seemed to be aware of of what prompted the elder nurse something i dont know what as though some one were in the room besides myself andand it the corpse elsa nodded he didnt want to die the girl went on after a while there was some thing between him and his son you know how unhappy he was about him he loved him his only son and he didnt want to die feeling that young carrington hadnt redeemed himself you know what a black sheep hes been once i came into the room just after his son had left the old man had been crying i think it was that that kept him alive long after we knew his case was hopeless he told me once he couldnt die until his son had made good that his spirit would never rest his spirit did he say that yes the elder nurses eyes closed slowly and her hands met in her lap do you think began elsa leaning forward i dont know muttered the elder woman her voice scarcely audible ii both women came to their feet as they heard hurried footsteps approach ing the interne entered a coat flung over his arm hes coming he announced dr stockbridge entered the office visibly annoyed and angry his long fin the summons gers busy with the laces of his operat ing apron which he was removing be hind him came unhurried and calm carringtons lifelong friend and the executor of his will madison dodd vhats this silly nonsense i hear about bells the surgeon demanded slipping into the coat the interne held and advancing toward the women why didnt you notify me sooner and why arent you in the room to find out what it means miss lloyd she just came from the room dr stockbridge explained the elder nurse defending the girl there was no one there this is too absurd exploded the surgeon ive never heard of such a thing miss lloyd should be in that room shes had no sleep doctor and shes very tired then why dont you go i youre afraid how ridiculous well well have he turned but the interne was gone dr stockbridge frowned his eyes went toward the indicator when did that bell ring he de manded about ten minutes ago and a bell rang and a faint click came from the indicator the number which had not been lowered vibrated its been ringing every ten minutes just like that said the elder nurse edging away from the instrument dr stockbridge frowned then striding across the room he pressed the knob releasing the number he turned to the nurse im going into that room myself he said severely and well have this nonsense over with someone is ring ing that bell and well know who it is if it rings while im there let me know he stepped toward the door ill go with you doctor said car ringtons friend speaking for the first time the men walked down the corridor side by side the door of room was closed dr stockbridge pushed it open impatiently and allowed dodd to enter first i hope youll forgive this nonsense mr dodd he said closing the door these womentheyre but dodd paying no heed to the doc tor was advancing toward the bed his face grave he stopped within a foot of it looking down on the still form beneath him his hands clasped behind his back dr stockbridge looked about the room its hospital bareness made it manifest at once that no one could be concealed in it it seemed to him absurd and undigni fied that he should be engaged in such a futile and meaningless undertaking he paced up and down pausing every now and then to observe the immobile figure of carringtons friend wonder ing what he could be thinking of the whole ridiculous episode he was a little disturbed that dodd should take the thing so seriously treat the matter with silent respect once he paused beside him im a man of science mr dodd he began to me theres no such thing there was a light tap on the door and he stopped he strode to the door and opened it the internes head showed lt rang the young man said dr stockbridges lips parted in as tonishment his hand on the knob he paused un decided looking toward dodd for some intimation the course to pursue but dodd had not stirred and stock bridge turned to the youth thank you he said and closed the door the summons for a moment he was at a loss but when he tried to speak he was silenced by dodds beckoning hand he ap proached stopping at dodds side his eyes following the other mans finger i want you to tell me what you see in his face said dodd the request seemed so strange to dr stockbridge that he glanced up quickly to see if dodd were in earnest what could he see in a dead mans face but death however a glance was suffi cient to assure him of his companions earnestness and he lowered his eyes a long moment of silent scrutiny and then the surgeon bent lower his eyes nar rowing yes he muttered awed by his dis covery i see what you mean its amazing it wasnt that way when he died what do you see interrupted dodd the mouth said dr stockbridge the corners seem to droop more and the eyelids look more strained his whole face seems to have changed as though he were dissatisfied prompted dodd as the surgeon hesitated yes as though he were restless and unhappy about something ah muttered dodd i noticed that when i first came into the room and i have been held by it dr stock bridge he added looking up for the first time my old friend is restless dis satisfied his spirit is not at peace and that is why the bell is ringing then you think i am certain and i have been standing here wondering what he was distressed about what message he was trying to convey he is trying to say something to us doctor he is trying to direct our attention to something he wants done and he will not rest doctor until it is done i must try to understand him i must find out what he wants have you any idea perhaps but i am not sure he turned shall we go back to the office he asked when they reentered the office they found a group of internes and nurses gathered in a corner of the room the report of the mysterious calls from room had spread throughout the building and an wed silent circle of men and women in hospital uniform were watching the indicator for the call that was momentarily expected an in terne came forward as dodd and the surgeon entered it rang twice while you were out fie said and young carrington is here in the inner office he was told and when he heard the bell ring and how the number came up he fainted hes lying down in there dr stockbridge followed by dodd hurried to the inner office elsa lloyd was bending over a couch on which lay edward carrington his back to the door the girl came forward as the men entered hes better now she said dr stockbridge approached the couch caught carringtons wrist and touched two fingers to his pulse the youth did not stir his arm hanging limp in the surgeons grasp dr stockbridge looked up at last and nodded reassuring ly to dodd then he turned to the girl ill look after him he said we wont need you the girl withdrew madison dodd retired to the window and he stood there his eyes fixed on the horizon in deep thought the surgeon came up to him poor fellow he muttered i can understand how hed feel about it the summons dodd did not reply once more the bell in the outer office rang the indicator clicked dr stock bridge turned to observe the effect on the youth he lay there very still as though he had not heard but his eyes turned to the wall were wide open he seemed too stunned for any sensation as the moments fled by the surgeon grew more and more ill at ease under the strain of the silence and the unsolved mystery he wondered why they were waiting there inactive undecided and yet when he tried to think what they could do he was at a loss he could not wait there all day however obedi ent to a vague call an intangible sum mons from the dead if only he could persuade dodd of the absurdity of the whole situation but how could he convince dodd when he was himself so completely at sea he had never believed in these things had always waved aside any testimony concerning spirits as the invention of gullible minds yet here before him there was evidence that he could not thrust aside so easily he paced the room restlessly finally pausing beside carringtons friend what can we do he asked i am thinking said dodd quietly his eyes still on the horizon but persisted the surgeon do you still believe i am sure that the bell is a summons to some one if you do not understand its message it is because it is not for you perhaps it is not even for me for i do not seem to grasp the meaning of it but it is calling to some one here or it would not ring and that one will understand if he is here still pursued the surgeon encour aged even granting the existence of a spirit that exists after death is it con ceivable that that spirit can assert itself in this way as a man of science it seems too fanciful to me what replied dodd can be more fanciful than science itself it is dumb before the mysteries which it pretends to understand can you as a scientist explain to me why when a button is pressed in room a bell should ring in this room electricity began the surgeon and what is electricity even science does not pretend to know is it not in conceivable that it should be able to flow through a solid copper wire and yet it does mans soul his spirit is more mysterious than electricity why can it not flow through the ether and create a disturbance in its environment re leased from the body which it inhabit ed why can it not hover near by and make its will known to those it wishes to reach scofield carringtons body died but his spirit refusing to die un satisfied is still alive restless insistent urging the fulfillment of its desire that it may be set at peace and it will not give up until it is satisfied there he added as the bell rang it is still call ing it will continue until he for whom it is meant obeys the call but who is it for asked the sur geon weakly madison dodd turned slowly but his eyes did not meet the surgeons they made a circuit of the room and came to pause on the figure of young carring ton who had stirred for the first time and was now sitting up his elbows on his knees his face buried in his hands the surgeon followed his companions gaze it suddenly came to him that per haps young carrington who had not ut tered a word understood for he could see that beneath the surface of his im mobility there was a great struggle go ing on that a difficult resolve was form ing he turned to dodd expecting some revelation from him but the mans face was a mask his fingers were twined in the cord hanging from the window the summons shade and his eyes were fixed on the youth the surgeon observed the youth once more slowly edward carringtons hands lowered from his face slowly he rose and turned his eyes were clear his features were firm and he came for ward with decision in his whole bear ing mr dodd he said in a slow level voice pausing before his fathers friend that bell was for me iv dr stockbridges eyes grew wide with amazement at this simple avowal but madison dodds expression did not change well he prompted calmly his fin gers still toying with the windowshade cord i have been fighting it out with my self said young carrington all morn ing ever since father he paused and his lips were unsteady you know how unhappy he was over me my fail ure to live up to his name and he died feeling that he had failed to redeem me but all morning i have felt his near ness and when i came in here and they told mewhen i heard the bell and saw the call from his roomi knew the call was for me i under stood what he wanted me to do i obey he came forward a step and his hand went to his breast pocket when it came forth it held a long envelope this is it he said handing the en velope to dodd it is fathers will it leaves me without a penny as he said it would i have deserved nothing bet ter the shade flew up with a bang as madison dodd released the cord and ex tended his hand for the envelope heav ily sealed and addressed to him slow ly he put his goldrimmed pincenez to his nose and then he thrust his finger under the flap of the envelope to tear it open but he paused and looked up as he heard a low murmur in the outer office dr stockbridge looked up too nurses and internes were whispering excitedly to each other their eyes on the clock the surgeon followed their glance and then he understood the meaning of their agitation the minute hand was pointing to the halfhour the bell should have rung as it had rung every ten minutes all morning with un failing precision it had not rung the hushed excitement of the uniformed men and women grew in intensity as a minute passed and still the bell was not heard two minutespassed three minutes dr stockbridge turned to madison dodd carringtons friend stood near the window a sheaf of legal papers evidently the will in one hand a type written sheet in the other he was reading this and he looked up as the surgeon came toward him he waved his arm in the direction of the outer office send them away doctor he said quietly carringtons summons has been answered one by one the nurses and internes filed out of the office in obedience to dr stockbridges gesture of dismissal when they were gone the surgeon re turned to the side of madison dodd youll understand when i read this said dodd he adjusted his glasses and brought the typewritten sheet closer this is my last test for ed he read if he gives this envelope to you as i instructed him then my original will stands as it is leaving all to him when i gave my boy this envelope i told him it contained a new will disowning him and leaving him without a penny if he has enough manhood to give this to you then i shall know that he has repented and that he has the courage to take his punishment manfully in that case he b maug the summons will prove himself a true carrington and will deserve the fortune that comes to him this is exactly as we planned it old friend my prayer is that he will make good my spirit shall not rest until he does and i trust that my everlasting peace will not be disturbed by my boys craven failure to deliver this mes sage to you scofield carrington madison dodd looked up his fingers folding the sheet he had just read scofield carringtons spirit is at peace now hg said in a solemn voice v the mens hands met at the door it was a silent clasp dr stockbridges lips pursed and his eyes lowered mr doddlie said this is the first experience of the kind ive ever had as a man of science my dear doctor broke in his com panion science is still in its infancy some day it may be able to explain many things that are still beyond un derstanding he nodded and turned on his heel there was a smile on his face but dr stockbridge did not see this basement skid dodd to the ele vator man as the car shot downward emerging from the cage dodd hur ried down the dimly lighted corridor he paused before a door over which there was a neatly printed sign elec trician a man in overalls rose as dodd en tered touching his cap did i get that shade signal right he asked with a smile perfectly said dodd drawing a banknote from his wallet and crushing it into the mans hand and now you may rearrange those wires you did splendidly thank you the man touched his cap and madi son dodd nodding passed out of the room the abandoned house by beulah poynter i the blinding rain which had been steadily falling for the last hour cut and stung our faces and the wind wheezing through the trees about us rocked our little car until it made progress almost impossible an illuminating streak of lightning fol lowed by a deafening crash of thunder caused me to cower down in the seat and cover my ears with my hands well heres our finish exclaimed my brother who had valiantly striven to pilot the machine in the storm theres a tree lying directly across the road he brought the car to a standstill and turned his spotlight on the dark object blocking our path it was a huge tree evidently stricken down by the light ning and it covered the entire road what on earth are we going to do i sobbed hysterically we cant stay out in a storm like this and we are miles and miles away from anyone we had been steadily dimbing an up ward grade and the cavernlike ravines on either side and the depths of black ness behind me struck a chill in my heart i wish wed never come out on this crazy motor trip i wailed new york is good enough for me alan what can we do ill see he answered keep your hand on the brake this is a pretty stiff hill and the road is slippery if the car starts skidding its good night he spoke jocularly enough but i knew he was worried climbing out of the machine he went around to the big supine tree and examined it its no use nell he called to me pitching his voice above the roar of the wind i cant budge it in the brief light caused by a second flash of lightning i saw the stark bare outlines of a twostory house possibly a hundred feet ahead of us on my right alan theres a house a house up there further on the hill i cried wildly youre right there is its either an empty one or its occupants hit the hay early ill pull the car out onto the side of the road and well make a run for it he got back into his seat and with a few careful maneuvers of the wheel suc ceeded in bringing the machine around to a spot where it might stand in safety then he searched in the darkness until he found a rock which he placed under the wheel in case something should start it rolling downgrade turn up your collar the rain feels like icewater when youre out in it that house is probably farther off than it looks taking my hand he helped me out my feet went into deep mud and i al most lost my balance with a little shriek i clutched him to save myself then we started to run it was uphill all the way a much steeper and longer climb than i had an ticipated and as alan had said the rain was like icewater beating against the back of my neck and shoulders i was shaking and shivering like a drowned cat by the time we reached the stoop on the front of the building the house was barren of fence and surrounding trees and stood on a sort of knoll at the side of the hills no light was visible anywhere alan used the abandoned house his pocket flash and that guided us to the front door which was swinging dis mally back and forth on one hinge mak ing a doleful creaking noise distin guishable above the wind we did not stop to knock feeling pretty certain the house had no occupant or the door would be locked on a night like this for such shelter let us give thanks alan chuckled grimly pushing me in first he closed the door after us to shut out the rain but it immediately swung open again we found ourselves in a long wide hall which evidently divided the house through the centre at the extreme end was an oldfashioned staircase with ban isters the floors creaked and gave with the weight of our bodies as we walked and i fancied a rat scurried across my foot there was an odor of mustiness and damp about the place as though it had not been occupied for years there were no furnishings of any kind no blinds to the windows and fnost of the panes of glass were miss ing but even in the dim light that alans spot afforded we could see it had an oldtime elegance probably at one time monstrous log fires had burnt in the massive brick fireplaces at the end of the two rooms opening off the sepa rating hallway the woodwork ap peared to be of black walnut the floors unquestionably had been highly polished though now they were worn and earth stained the ceilings were falling and the wallpaper hung in great strips from the plasteringa more uninviting place could not be imagined i clung to alans arm half afraid to venture farther im awfully cold i whimpered through chattering teeth dye sup pose theres a stove in the kitchen maybe we can find some paper and start a fire if there is alan did not answer but led the way to the back of the house before some swinging doors he hesitated a second then flung them open and entered i fol lowed it was an oldfashioned brick floored kitchen in one corner stood a battered rustcovered coalrange the chimney was disconnected and part of it lay on the floor before the open oven piles of old rags and broken bits of twigs and newspaper filled a box near it alan thrust the spot light into my hand and pounced upon the debris in a little while he had a fire burning in the old stove and the kitchen was filled with sooty smoke and blessed warmth i stripped off my soggy motor coat and flung it across the box to dry out alan removed his coat and did likewise now if i just had a cup of coffee and a sandwich i wouldnt be at all un happy i said forget it he laughed nothing doing its a lucky thing for us this old barn is well built if it wasnt i could see visions of that wind lifting it off its pins and tossing it down into the cavern i shuddered lets not think about it the car may not even be there in the morning to kill time and to get our mind off the storm outside i suggested that we rummage around a bit and see what the place was like upstairs as we stepped into the long open hall way a gust of wind whipped through the swinging door and carried with it a perfect torrent of rain that made little puddles at our feet fearfully i followed alan up the long broad flight of stairs feeling that uncanny something that is so often pres ent in an old unused house i half ex pected some spectre of the past to reach out and lay clammy unearthly hands upon me or a shadowy something to greet us on the landing where we paused and looked about there were six doors leading off the corridor all exactly alike with the ex the abandoned house ception of one they were slightly ajar the sixth appeared to be locked curiosity prompted me to go toward it first the knob turned in my hand but the door stayed closed bluebeards den laughed alan take care that you arent another ann its locked obviously i wonder why possibly for the same reason that all the others arent the owner when he left the place didnt take the trouble to unlock it i twisted and turned the knob trying to force an entrance but the lock held in spite of its age and rustiness alan laughed at my efforts then he pushed open the door to his right which was slightly ajar his exclamation of sur prise called my attention from the bolt ed door what is it i gasped by george nell look here ii i followed him into the room my surprise equalled his own at what i saw in direct contrast to the barrenness of the rooms below this one was beauti fully furnished with rich draperies cov ering the crumbling walls and rugs upon the floor the furniture was evi dently new and though a trifle gaudy not without taste a table in the centre of the room cov ered with a damask cloth china and silver was spread as though for a meal there was a halfemptied bottle of wine and two glasses one glass still contained the liquor even a loaf of bread and some cold cuts and salad re mained an open lunch kit rested in a chair near the table i looked at alan in amazement he gave me a glance of equal astonishment i dont quite understand it he mur mured do you suppose it is possible that some one lives here i shook my head with the whole lower floor going to rack and ruin and overrun with rats no it isnt pos sible nell this bread is soft he lifted the loaf and thrust his finger into the crust then he glanced half appre hensively over his shoulder at some velvet draperies which covered the double doors i dont know why but i shivered judging from their juxtaposition those doors led into the room which was bolt ed from the hallway alan lowered his voice as he spoke someone is either in this house or has been here but a short time ago he said this food is fresh for some reason it has not been eaten i gave a little cry half of protest half of fear as he parted the draperies and drew back the heavypaneled doors behind them then i cried out in horror lying across a canopied bed was a man in evening clothes it needed no second glance even in the small light alans spot afforded to show us he was dead that either suicide or murder had caused his death for on the white bosom of his shirt was a hideous red spot and the blue satin and lace of the bedspread was stained with blood my god alan whispered hoarsely as if to accentuate the gruesomeness of the picture and its surroundings a streak of lightning flashed directly upon that supine figure on the bed the burst of thunder which followed seemed to rend the sky in two the wind careening madly around the house rocked and banged the shutters of the one window letslets try to go on i sobbed this is awful i cant stand it here like this it looks like murder he muttered the abandoned house seemingly compelled against his will he advanced toward the bed i watched him in fascination as he let his light play upon the features of the man lying there then more fearful of the shadows behind me and the blackness of the room we had left than of the dead i crept close to him almost of one accord we exclaimed judge macpherson a tall lean man with reddish grey hair a trifle long a sandy beard and no mustache keen cruel eyes with criss cross wrinkles about them macpher son in life was a man not easily for gotten if once known and not to be mis taken for anyone else even in leath the man stretched out before us was unquestionably judge macpherson then too i recognized an unusual sap phire and diamond ring on his finger which i had admired at a dinner party not a month before it is murder alan said he hasnt been robbed either i wonder if there is a telephone here why to call up the police of course there isnt any im sure of it i was right though the two rooms we had just entered were furnished and appeared to have been recently occupied all the others were in the same state of decay as the lower floor there was no telephone in any of them after a while alan closed the double doors and drew the velvet hangings then silently dazed and horrorstricken we retraced our steps to the kitchen the fire we had built at least had life and a certain cheerfulness and the horror of the thing we had discovered made it impossible for us to stay in the furnished rooms upstairs we cant go on tonight he said with daylight we may find a detour but we cant risk it in the dark we dont know how close the road is to the edge of the ravine i could not banish the picture of the dead man lying upstairs weltering in his own blood amidst all the garish luxury of velvets and satin with the uneaten meal spread so near to him such a short time ago he had sat at the same table with us a genial host though a bit scardonic in his humor knowing him to have been a hard cruel adminis trator of justice i never doubted for an instant that he had been murdered alan i whispered half fearful of being overheard by ears forever deaf ened who do you suppose killed him he shook his head any one of a hundred people might desire his death revenge is unquestionably the motive behind it as he spoke his eyes widened and i noted a quick intake of his breath then i saw what had caused this my motor coat which i had left to dry was gone though his still remained where he had placed it some one is in this house i cried hoarsely yes the person who killed mac pherson is still here what are you going to do t i wailed as he turned abruptly and started to leave the kitchen search for him he answered grimly but you are unarmed a man des perate enough to commit murder wouldnt hesitate to kill you then a peculiar sound came to us above the roaring of the wind and the drip of the rain unquestionably it was the buzz of a motor we ran to the window and regard less of the drenching we received the in stant it was opened we peered out into the darkness at first we saw nothing then darker against the dark sky we distinguished the outline of another building not so large as the house we were in but beyond a doubt a big barn our man is in there said alan the abandoned house he was in the house when we arrived and beat it to the barn while we were upstairs he has a car out there thats the engine we heard dont go out alan dont go out there but my protests were in vain a door opened from the kitchen to a summer porch and a path which led to the barn almost before the words were out of my mouth he darted through this door and out into the storm there was nothing for me to do but to follow i felt i would rather face a live mur derer than stay alone in that great house with his dead victim before we reached the barn a car which by its long low outlines was just distinguishable in the darkness swung out into the road before us its lamps were unlighted and we could not see its occupant alan called out commandingly with a bravery which was foolhardy to an extreme stop stop where you are the car came towards us the en gine sputtered the machine swerved a little as though driven by a drunken person or some one unused to handling a wheel alan gave his command again then deliberately stepped into the pathway the car came to an abrupt stop you cant go on tonight alan said the road is blocked and whoever you are youd be a fool to aftempt it in this storm the person at the wheel did not reply but instead swung the car around and returned to the barn we followed as we reached a doorway a sudden gleam of light illuminated the passage it came from a kerosene lantern held by a figure in a motor coat which i recog nized as my own a small unquestion ably feminine figure ill go back to the house with you she said after all what difference does it make the woman who stood there holding the lantern above her head was the most tragically beautiful creature i had ever seen she did not appear to be very young possibly she was in her later thirties but her small almost childish stature gave her the appearance of ex treme youth great dark eyes burnt in a small ashen pale face whose pallor was accentuated by her vivid scarlet mouth masses of blueblack hair tumbled about her shoulders and on to the leather collar of my coat evidently the coat had been hastily donned for it wasnt fastened and exposed to view the shimmery satin of an evening gown she wore in a brief glance i noted her sodden silver shoes and the mudstained hem of her gown the silver lace which bordered it was mudstained and spat tered with blood a pongee cloak which she had evidently used to motor in lay a drenched and soggy mass on the seat of the roadster for a strained moment we stared at each other the fragile infinitely pa thetic woman facing alan and myself then she swayed as if about to fall i started toward her but she straightened up bravely and gave a little laugh itit isnt very pleasant out here she said in a musical voice the house is a trifle better silently we trudged back through the overgrown grass and weeds our feet sinking deep into the spongy ground alan relieved her of the lantern and lighted us into the house iill return your coat to you she said in a halfapologetic tone going to wards the stove which still glowed red and cheerful from the fire alan had built i shant need it now i really didnt mean to steal it i hoped to re turn it somehowsome way i was desperate the abandoned house as we were silent she choked and then with an air of bravado continued i am sorry i cannot offer you any better hospitality but a wave of a very thin white hand expressed more than words could have done offer us any better hospitality alan repeated dumbly after her yes this is my home but it isnt the same as it was when i lived here ii dont quite understand i stammered hi a thin white line settled about alans rigid mouth i knew he was wondering what connection the beauti ful pallid woman had with the dead man lying upstairs if she had herself killed himor if she even knew of his exist ence she seemed to sense what i did for the halfborn smile on her lips faded the dark eyes became darker if possible as they widened her hands fluttered upward then dropped help lessly to the side of her orchidcolored gown yes she said dully as if in reply to a questioni killed him i was in the tloset upstairs when you went into the other room while you were in there i stole out through the door i had locked on the inside and down the stairs i took your cloak and ran out to the stable i was going to drive away when you called me back perhaps it is just as well you did it doesnt matter much one way or another you killed judge macpherson i gasped why you knew him very well an enigmatical smile played about her lips full and softly rounded like a childs that smile held a world of wisdom and tragedy in a moments flicker it made her face strangely old and careworn in the light of the oil lamp i suddenly seemed to be looking at the remnants of a once beautiful wo man at a battered and bruised soul not at the woman herself i wonder just how well you knew him she said as though to herself not as well as i did at any rate he was your lover alan asked we lowered our voices as if taking our key from her curiously i felt more of an interest in the woman her self thfin the fact that she had killed judge macpherson she shook her head in reply to alans question and her lips curled scornfully after a little she said would you like to have me tell you all about it somehow i feel as if i should be relieved if i did so im really very unnerved and shaken after all its a terrible thing to take a human life to watch a soul leave a mans body even though you know that man to be a reptile and deserving of more than one death i shant speak when i am arrested they can do as they like with me but ill not have the newspapers and their ravenous readers gloating over my miserable downfall you do not know who i am nor do i know you we shall never meet againand some thing tells me that when morning comes you will allow me to go my way and you will go another soi should like you to know the truth she was strangely calm only the pallid whiteness of her face and a glit ter to her dark eyes showed any of the tumult seething within her alan and i both hung upon her words somehow it seemed unnecessary for us to talk she shivered without a word alan pulled the box on which he had flung his coat nearer the fire and half assisted her to sit upon it shall i go upstairs and fetch you a chair he said no no oh no for one instant she lost control of herself the next the abandoned house moment she was as calm and restrained as a society matron serving tea alan and i seated ourselves on the floor at her feet the thunder and lightning had ceased and but for the steady drip drip of the rain the night was placid and quiet for a long time it seemed to my over wrought nerves the woman sat there with her hands clasped loosely in her lap her great eyes staring at a red glowing spot on the old stove once or twice she glanced apprehensively over her shoulder as though she expected the man she had slain to appear in the door way behind her i was born here reared here and married in this house she said at last my little boy was born here it was a beautiful old house then seeing it now you can scarcely realize what it was in those days when i was a girl it used to be full of young people laugh ing dancing and enjoying life we had husking bees in the barn halloween parties dances in the winter sleigh rides and christmas trees manys the time ive coasted down that long hill and landed in a heap at the bottom then i married a man i adored he worshipped me he placed me on a pedestal as something just a little more than mortal he was an intensely religious man perhaps a trifle austere but because i loved so ciety young company we continued to fill the home with guests there was never a shadowy corner in the house like there is nowthe lights were always bright there were always laughing voices to be heard and mu sic she spoke very slowly in an almost pedantic fashion as though choosing her words and a bit uncertain of them it was as though she were speaking a tongue not quite familiar to her when my little boy was born both my husband and myself were over joyed even the fact that he was a fragile little fellow did not drown our happiness for a year we battled to keep him alivethen he began to grow sturdy and rosy like the other children who came with their parents to visit us about that time my husband became very absorbed in his profession he was compiling a historical volume of in tense interest to himself because i was lonesome i used to go into the city quite often to the theatre generally to matineesand come back at dinner time several times went later in the day and remained overnight i did not realize then that he was jealous of methat he was suspicious if only he had said something to me but he never diduntil too late i was very innocent in those days principally because i did not wish to disturb him or impose upon my friends the few times i remained over night in the city i stayed in a small hotel walking to and from the theatre alone imagine my horror when one night as i turned the corner to go to the hotel which was in a side street a man put his hand on my shoulder and before i could make any protest informed me i was under arrest too dazed and bewildered to de mand the reason for this outrage i did nothing but declare my innocence i was dragged downtown to the police court and put upon the stand before a grinning gaping crowd of spectators i was asked obscene questions by that man lying upstairs sneered at because of my protestations of virtue then thrown in a cell with two drunken prostitutes and a halfinsane old wo man i was so ashamed so horror stricken yet so certain of my release in the morning that i did not telephone my husband of what had happened it never occurred to me that i would be branded as a woman of the streets and sentenced to prison but i was i the abandoned house was judge macphersona man of the world who should be able to distin guish between womenlaughed at me and with one wave of his smug hand with one word sentenced me to six months confinement and a lifetime of hell never so long as i live will i for get his face that same night my baby was taken ill my husband tried to find mehis search discovered to him the fact that i was in jail for soliciting on the street then the jealousythe suspicions he had felt for me burst into flame making him ready to believe the worst of me i never saw him but once after that that one time he denounced me as a woman unfit to liveas a thing too vile to breathe the same air as my child then he told me the boy was dead of course he secured my release but it was too late when i came out of prison i went to judge macphersons home i re member he was sitting at dinner he was very annoyed at having his meal disturbed by a pale bedraggled sloven lylooking woman he was at no pains to hide his annoyance i told him what he had done to me an innocent woman and i demanded that he right this wrong there was the same smiling sneer on his face as when he sentenced me just how can i do this my dear lady he said go to my husband i cried wildly i had not learned to restrain myself thentell him that i am innocent absolutely innocent my baby is gone but there is still a chance for me if he will take meyou must explain to him you must make him understand he laughedlaughed at me old stuff my dear he sneered old stuff why cant you women think of something original of course you are all innocent none of you will even admit to a first offense im sorry if your child is dead that is if you had one but i certainly wont help to hoodwink a manwho evidently is a person of principle if you dont want to suffer behave yourself thats all i have to say good evening then he showed me the door i think i went insane i remember stand ing outside and pounding on it scream ing maledictions on him shrieking to him that he must clear me that he must give me back my good name then some one seized me and i was dragged away to the stationhouse again i left it under a six months sentence for dis orderly conduct when i got out this time dazed broken aged i realized that nothing i could ever do or say would reinstate me this second arrest caused by the man who had ruined me had branded me forever and forever i learned my hus band had divorced me disposed of everything in our home and sailed to france those who had been my friends passed me on the street without recog nition there was no one in the world i could turn to i was practically with out means to be sure i owned this house but i did not have the money to keep it in repair and i could not live in it the memories it recalled were maddening then too i felt everyone knew my story and i could not face their scornful glances time and again i was tempted to kill myself but one thing always held me back my undying souleating hatred for the man who had passed judgment on me one day i realized why this mon strous thing had happened to me i was to be the instrument with which to save innumerable women from a fate similar tomine it was to be my task to rid the world of the viper who de stroyed innocence and laughed at his the abandoned house handiwork i almost became happy in contemplation of what i would do what did it matter to me that to accom plish his destruction i must accomplish my own the thing he had branded me i became in reality i was beauti ful soon i learned i was desirable and i could be fascinating i studied all the arts and wiles of the oldest profession in the world and determined to sell myself to the highest bidder my education my knowledge of society my culture all stood me in good stead understand i always stayed within the law i was never crude i took no chances of another arrest my new name the one i adopt ed when i became of the demimonde i kept unsmirched if you could call it that i became a leader in the set where mistresses laughed at wives and where lovers were more popular than hus bands i discovered to my intense delight that although austere and apparently religious judge macphersons besetting sin was women that he used the time worn excuse of an invalid wife to cover his indiscretions you dont know it of course as he kept the scandal quiet but it was i who brought about his divorce it took me three years to secure an introduction to him but it took less than three hours to hopelessly ensnare him it was not strange that in the smiling elegantly blase woman of the world he did not recognize the halfcrazed be draggled woman of the police courts he was just at that most susceptible age when he felt that youth was slip ping from him and old age waiting to claim him had put a taboo on affairs of the heart with a desperate desire to remain young he flung himself headlong into my hands never doubting that i was what i appeareda divorcee whose misplaced affections had made her a trifle bitter toward men yet who was longing and looking for a loving pro tector i played my cards well i used all the coyness of the ingenue with the blandishments of the courtesan to keep him on tenterhooks before he became that protector after that it was easier he did not realize why i suggested weekend parties gradually making this house their setting i had from the first determined that as this was the home he had destroyed so here he should be destroyed it was his money which furnished those rooms upstairs rather grim humor isnt it can you conceive of the loathing i felt at that mans touch how i cringed as he embraced me how i laughed and anticipated the climax of it all he called me a charming child with quaint ideas when he first saw this place abandoned and decayed the unusual ness of our rendezvous appealed to him as unique early i learned unwhole some things intrigued him tonight was our third visit we arrived just before the storm broke as usual we brought a lunch kit with our dinner in it that meal was never eaten i had drugged the wine just enough to befog his brain and make him like wax in my hands then as he sat there stupid dazed and inert i told him who i was and why he was here and i laughed laughed at him as he had laughed at me when he had me taken away kicking and screaming by the police you would have laughed too had you seen his face when i showed him the revolver and told him i was going to kill him he cringed like a sick animal whimpering and begging for mercythe kind of mercy he hadnt shown me still i laughed he staggered drunkenly to his feet and came toward me i dont think he felt certain that i meant what i said i whirled on him and backed the abandoned house him into the bedroom then when he made a lurch toward me trying to se cure the pistol and stumbled against the bed i firedhe fell across it dead where is the pistol alan asked drily the womans eyes narrowed i flung it under the bed his blood smeared my gown see after a little i went out to drive the car to town but it was raining so hard i became drenched before i reached the barn i came back to the house then i heard you come in at the front door i was frightened i had fancied myself abso lutely alone out here i locked the bed room door when i heard you climb the stairsyou know the rest we were silent for a few moments then alan said abruptly id like to take a look at him again the woman rose slowly and we all filed up the stairs again at the bed room door she laid a feverish hand on mine and i felt a shudder go through her but when we stood staring at the cold dark figure before us her face was unexpressive emotionless half entangled in the lace of the bed spread where it had fallen or been thrown as macpherson stumbled against the bed was the revolver the light from the lantern though not bril liant illuminated more space than alans spot had done hence it had been hidden from our view before alan looked steadily at her a mo ment i could not read what was pass ing through his thoughts then he mo tioned for us to follow him downstairs the steady drip drip of the rain made me drowsy we huddled in si lence on the floor before the stove the woman staring off in space presently i dozed leaning against alans shoulder when i awakened it was breaking dayshe was gone alan i cried shaking him a little to waken him shes gone yes i know i saw her when she left but who are we to judge he asked slowly iv two days later picking up a new york newspaper i read the headlines judson macpherson wellknown jus tice of the criminal court commits sui cide in abandoned house in the catskill mountains then followed a half column account of the act in detail macpherson having gotten into finan cial difficulties had chosen the cowards way out so said the paper a letter an nounced his intention of dying and gave the location where to find his body the paper also stated that the knowl edge he had recently married a young and beautiful actress came as a distinct surprise to his friends a picture of his bride accompanied the article the wistful almost tragic face pic tured was unquestionably that of the woman who said she had killed him i stared at alan as i handed him the newspaper was she lying i gasped he shook his head if so she was a clever actress he answered but one thing is certain well never know the truth either way he brought about his own death the face that stared back at blaisdell by edwin carty ranck these are the facts in blaisdells queer case taken from a com munication addressed to his best friend dr maynard hamilton dr hamilton vouchsafes no explana tion nor do i indeed there are phe nomena in this old world that cannot be explained as hamlet pointed out to horatio in a muchquoted speech the statements given here were contained in a carefully written paper in blaisdells handwriting that was found in blais dells desk by dr hamilton several days after the mans death from this paper he has pieced together the extraordinary narrative that follows i blaisdell thinks it must have been shortly after midnight that he fell asleep horrible nightmares racked him as he tossed upon his bed and one of them was so frightful that he woke up with a screamor thought he did at any rate he suddenly found himself in the centre of his bedchamber dressing with feverish haste and here is the queer part of the narrative for he affirms that while he was dressing another man lay in his bedan exact counter part of himself this other ego lay quietly asleep his head on his arm blaisdell studied him carefully and said he felt as a locust must feel when he looks at his outworn shell all the time he was dressing blais dell says he seemed to be impelled to haste by queer promptings that were as insistent as if some person were at his elbow saying hurry hurry he finished his dressing in mad excitement and then hurried out of the room cast ing a backward glance over his shoulder at his sleeping counterpart once outside his apartment house in gramercy park blaisdell hurried along his persistent mentor seeming to walk at his elbow a puzzling feature of this nocturnal prowl was that he felt a sense of familiarity a feeling that he was on his way to keep an appointment that could not be postponed the streets were deserted except for an occasional prowler or a patrolman who made the night echo with sharp blows from his club as he struck a metal post occasion ally to remind the unlawful that the law was abroad on on hurried blaisdell by this time he had lost all sense of location but he was aware that he was in a down town section of new yorka section that he had never visited during his waking moments but although he knew that he had never been in this neighborhood during his conscious mo ments he felt that he was on familiar territory finally he paused in front of an old threestory brownstone front residence in washington squarepaused with the air of one who has reached his destination he walked up the steps and let himself into the house with a passkey nor did it seem strange to him that he had a passkey for a house that he had never visited during his the face that stared back at blaisdell waking moments it all seemed ordi nary and commonplace blaisdell quietly mounted the stairs until he reached the second floor and there he paused before a closed door overcome by a suffocating sense of fear and repugnance he half turned away and then retraced his steps as if fasci nated something seemed to warn him away from that ominous door behind which lay a mystery that the everyday blaisdell millionaire and bon vivant did not care to penetrate but which this nocturnal prowling blaisdell seemed to insist upon then without any con scious volition on his part blaisdell placed his hand on the knob and the door opened noiselessly he found himself in a large square livingroom tastefully furnished and lined with builtin bookcases full of handsomely bound volumes every where he looked he saw bizarre weapons of defense and men in chinese and japanese armor looked threaten ingly at him from dim corners of the room it was either the apartment of an art connoisseur or a globetrotter with a propensity for the unusual from this room he stepped into a bedchamber and then started back with a little gasp it was a luxuriously fur nished room that appeared to have been transplanted by aladdins wonderful lamp straight from the perfumescented orient blaisdell advanced further into the room and his feet sank into a won derful mosslike carpet to one side of the room was an oldfashioned four poster bed topped by a crimson canopy in the exact centre of this bed lay a man asleep with his mouth open there was something strangely fa miliar about the sleeper and blaisdell drew closer and gazed at him steadily he was an oldish man with a sallow complexion and a wisp of a beard that was slightly tinged with grey the ghost of a smile lingered upon his lips a cruel smile that sleep could not make gentle nor mirthful and as he gazed upon the sleeper rage grew in blaisdells heart a rage so furious that it almost suffocated him without a moments hesitation he seized the sleeper by the throat and began throttling him the man struggled furiously his eyes popped open and gazed up into blaisdelfs with a look of freezing despair a slight froth gath ered upon his purpling lips and he squirmed and writhed like a snake in blaisdells unrelenting grasp god how he struggled blaisdelfs fingers sank into the throat as if it were satin and then suddenly there were no more struggles the body fell back inertly as the steellike fingers relaxed blaisdell pulled the bedclothes over the mask of horror and stole quietly from the room he felt that his errand had been accomplished as he went back over the route that he had just pursued he felt again that weird sense of unfamiliarity that had at first possessed him and this feeling of strangeness increased as he neared his own apartment house he walked in and hurried past the sleeping hallboy without waking him once inside his apartment he rushed into the bedroom but his counterpart was gone blaisdell undressed with trembling fingers but his head had scarcely touched the pillow before he was sound asleep ii a shaft of sunlight fell across blais dells face and he awoke with a shudder ugh what a horrible nightmare he said aloud i feel as if i actually did kill that man then he yawned and rang for his valet after a casual breakfast he was glancing through the newspaper when he received the shock that changed him the face that stared back at blaisdell from a careless clubman into a nervous wreck queer murder in washing ton square that was the headline he read and then followed an account of the crime a private policeman while going his rounds had found the front door of an old brownstone residence open and had investigated on the second floor he had found another door ajar and going in had found a man lying in a queer bed that was overhung by a red canopy he was about to steal quietly out when something in the huddled attitude of the sleeper attracted his attention and he then discovered that the man had been strangled the marks of fingers being plainly visible upon his throat the police investigation had established the fact that the mans name was stephen r rollins a famous traveller and au thority on spiritualism he had lived for years in the orient and a mono graph of his on occult phenomena had attracted much attention in scientific circles my god said blaisdell as the pa per fell from his trembling hands my god did i go to that mans apartment while i was in the grip of that night mare and murder him did i these qestions nearly drove him fran tic what should he do what course of action was there for him to pursue if he went to the police and told them that he herman blaisdell descendant of a fine old new york family had gone forth into the night and killed a man he had never seen beforein his sleep what would they think of him they would probably shrug their shoulders and advise him to consult an alienist and yet this man this stephen r rollins was dead and his description and that of his apartment coincided in every detail with the place that blaisdell had visited in his dream but was it a dream and who was the other man that lay in his bed as he went out these questions revolved in his mind like a vicious circle almost driving him insane blaisdell aged after that he looked ten years older and his friends were alarmed about him dr hamilton ad vised a change of environment and rig orous physical exercise otherwise he would not be responsible for the conse quences the man jumped at every sound and had a mortal terror of the night he would put off going to bed until the latest possible moment and then always slept with a light in his room sometimes his valet would come quavering to his bedside in the night frightened out of his wits by frightful screams from blaisdell i didnt do it i didnt do it i couldnt have done it he would scream his eyes staring the thing is impos sible the thing is impossible when these spells were upon him he would shake and it would finally be nec essary for his valet to give him a sleep ing powder these things became noised abroad and he resigned from his clubs went nowhere and declined all invitations he was a broken man a hopeless hypochondriac just a morbid victim of nervesor drink said his friendsand dropped him things went on like this for months and then one day blaisdell read another item in a newspaper that dumfounded him it detailed the arrest of a man named franklin sears who was charged with the murder of stephen r rollins but he couldnt have murdered him i murdered himmurdered him in my sleep mumbled blaisdell that afternoon one of the sensational riewspapers published a picture of franklin searsand blaisdell cried aloud in new fright the face that stared back at blaisdell his valet found him with the news paper in his hand mouthing and trem blinghis nerves vibrating like a taut piano wire for the face that stared back at blais dell from the front page was his own face yet franklin sears name was under it iii later sears confessed to the murder he told the police that he and rollins had been chums and college mates rollins had fallen madly in love with sears beautiful sister and had per suaded her to go away with him under promise of marriage they had gone to south america where rollins had amassed a fortune and had then visited the orient she begged rollins to make her his wife but he refused and finally deserted her a serious illness followed and she sent for her brother who promised her that he would not rest until her betrayer had been brought to book she died as sured that he would avenge her and he had kept his word although he had to trail rollins all over the world before he finally ran him down in washington square blaisdell followed the developments in the sears case with absorbed atten tion he read the newspapers fever ishly and finally decided that he could stand the suspense no longer he de termined to go to the tombs confront his counterpart and tell him the story of the nightmare surely there was an explanation of it all there must be an explanation he had decided to visit sears the next day when the last queer thing happened in the tragic series of happenings on the morning of blaisdells intend ed visit dr hamilton read in his morn ing paper that franklin sears the mur derer of stephen r rollins had com mitted suicide in the tombs by hanging himself to one of the bars by his sus penders the paper commented upon the some what unusual fact that the prisoners watch was found on his body and that it had stopped at three oclock it was just a few minutes past three when the body was discoveredstill warm dr hamilton had scarcely finished reading this account when his telephone bell rang the excited voice of blais dell s valet asked him to come at once to his masters apartment as something terrible had happened he responded at once and when he was ushered into blaisdells bedroom by the whitefaced valet he saw at once that he could do nothing further for his friend blaisdell was dead and it was very evident from the stiffness of his body that he had been dead for many hours it aint his bein dead thats so ter rible said the trembling valet its itswell look there he pointed to the throat of the dead man there was the distinct mark of a rope upon it and this mark extended clear around his neck hehe couldnt have hung him self quavered the valet because i was the first person who saw himand there aint any rope some unaccountable impulse made dr hamilton pick up blaisdells watch from the dresser it had stopped running the hands re cording the hour of three oclock more deadly than the viper by harry c hervey jr i that face clung to tremaines mind three hours ago when he and his caravan had ridden into tsagandhuntsa he had seen it framed in the doorway of the low swarth building that flew the russian flag a white womanhere on the fringe of the world for four dreary months he had seen only the faces of brown and yellow women had heard only their tongues and the longing for the sight of a white woman for the sound of a white womans voice had become a terrible thirst that threat ened to wither his soul so now after that journey through the white hell from urga across the north gobi and the tchuchunshan range into tibetthe glimpse of that pal lid face in the doorway of the rus sian consulate in this desert village inspired in him a profound reverence for its owner a white woman that face haunted him she too haunted him for as she paused there in the winter twi light glancing over her shoulder he found something pathetically young something almost tragic about her he wondered vaguely at her pres ence in the consulate doorway won dered too if she were connected in any manner with the consul he shivered involuntarily and bent lower over the argussun fire since nightfall the cold of the tibet winter had crept into the room in the rest house where he sat wrapped in his sheepskin coat and it bit through his heavy clothing with the savageness of a fanged beast following the evening meal of tsamba talkancakes and tea he had retreated to his bedchamber one of the three private rooms off the main hall of the caravanserai the pallid face of the first white woman that he had seen in four months burning in his brain as he sat there the flames painting his tanned skin a ruddy glow he heard footsteps in the hall and a moment later the burlap in the door was thrust aside by shagdur his cara vanbashi i have a message for you master announced the highcheeked mongol youth halting just within the bare dimlit room for me echoed tremaine yes masterfrom the lady at the russian consulate at his words tremaines muscles grew rigid you must be mistaken shagdur the boy shook his head the lady called to me as i was walking along the main street saying go to your master and ask him if he will come to the consulate tell him it is urgent who else could she mean but youfor are not you my master with a word of thanks to the b maug more deadly than the viper bashi tremaine got up and strode rapidly out of the room passing through the hall into the deserted courtyard a stiff wind was stirring it bore with it from the rear of the khan the reek of a camel and yak playing a melancholy dirge on the unseen harpstrings of the night an excellent view of the mountains that encircled the tsagandhuntsa valley could be gained from the gate of the rest house and here tre maine paused a moment not how ever to observe the dreary landscape but to assure himself that she this girl of the consulate doorway had really sent for him involuntarily his eyes rose to the giant ridges that painted themselves in huge smears of duncolor on the dark sky below them the pass opened wolfish jaws on the caravan road and above near the snow tipped peaks and crags the faint out line of the whitewashed lamaserie was sketched upon the rocks a single light peering from its sullen portals into the night leaving the courtyard of the cara vanserai tremaine moved at a swift pace along the winding dwelling lined main street to the consulate at the gate where a lanthorn on one side of the doorway stuck a lurid tongue of light across the courtyard he was halted by a huge bearded cossack with a berdan rifle slung over one shoulder and a balalaika dangling from his waist are you from the rest house barin asked the russian yes the cossack saluted then come with me across the courtyard and into the consulate building he followed the muscovite within it was dark but as they entered a door opposite the one through which they had just passed opened admitting a shaft of light in the entranceway silhouetted upon the yellow glow tremaine saw a slim form heard a voice speaking to him wont you come in he advanced into the light alone for the cossack had retreated passed through the door and once within he felt that he had left tibet behind felt that he had shaken from him the dust of tsagandhuntsa it was rather bold of me to send for you in this manner she said in a low sweet voice but desperation knows no conventions what tremaine saw made him catch his breath skin of lustrous white wide set eyes of night blue hair of reddish gold parted in the center and twisted in a knot on the back of her pallid neck a figure at once quaint etherealyet intensely human she wore but he did not see what she woreexcept that it was dark my name is miriam amber she told him in that low sweet voice offering her hand mine is tremaine he returned accepting the hand which was like china silk under his callous touch travis tremaine she smiled at himand for a rea son that was to him inexplicable he felt a holy dread of her the fear of one who looks for the first time upon the face of a madonna felt too that the bonds of a new thralldom were being fastened about him i will have lotuseye take your coat and hat she said and struck a gong that rang silvrn in the room a room that was small and filled with a fragrant warmth with shadows of deep amethyst a brazier at one end of a divan sent more deadly than the viper out waves of scented heat and a candle on an ebony table burned like a trembling ruby a moment after the sound of the gong a little chinese girl clad in green silk slipped through a door taking tremaines coat and hat then she melted into the amethyst shadows wontwont you sit down the girl faltered her face seemed suddenly swept free of all color the eyes of nightblue swam starlike in a mist of tears you are ill he exclaimed mov ing to her side at his words she sank on the cara vancloth cushions of the divan her eyes dropping to the khotan rug at her feet yes ill in soul he heard her murmur for a moment she was silent then lifted her eyes to him and spoke you must overlook my queer ac tions for you dont know what ive suffered here in this terrible village in the solitude with only lotus eye and yashka as companions it has seemed a million hours but the consul he queried puzzled surely she made a gesture that expressed absolute futility gonehis secretary gone and my brother tooall three in the last forty days forty days he echoed youve been in this godforsaken place for forty days a shudder swept her forty days and the only white woman living in a house with three drink crazed men two cossacks and a chi nese girl ah god if you only knew very gently with a tenderness that came to him suddenly he took her small hands in his looking deep into the eyes of nightblue but i want to know miriam am ber he said she summoned a smile the way you said that sounded like home i live in richmond virginia he too smiled richmond he repeated i live in fredericksburg so near youyetwe came to tibet to meet strange these tricks that chance playsor is it chance but you are in trouble and i want to hear about it once more she smiled sit down ill tell you over the teatable again the silvern gongagain the greenclad lotuseye this time bear ing a tray which she placed on the little ebony table and retreated i sent for you to ask you to help me announced miriam amber after they were seated when you rode in this afternoon i felt that aid had come and i resolved to send for you knowing that you could suggest some plan now that youre here i hard ly know where to begin she poured his tea for him and passed it to him he accepted it awkwardly but she seemed not to notice this my brother was a writer she began we left the united states a year ago to travel in the east after egypt we visited the holy lands went from damascus through per sia across turkestan and ancient dsungaria into tibet we were to end up in chinapekin hongkong and then home my brother had an unfortunate habitthat of drinkingand after we left damas cus a new passion for it seized him and he drank all he could obtain clouds settled in her eyes dim ming the nightblue the incidents of our journey in tibet would make up a book of hard more deadly than the viper ships one late evening our little caravan rode into tsagandhuntsa and the russian consul and his sec retary the only two white men in this village of sartang mongols in vited us to stay at the consulate that very night m grebin the con sul told us the story of the valley of vanishing menrather as the chi nese inhabitants call it tsu chu ti fangfor that is the name by which tsagandhuntsa is known to the desert tribes the clouds in her eyes darkened for a brief instant the shadow of dread lay upon her then the fear was mas tered twentyfour years ago a russian merchant and his wife from kiachta traveling toward dsungaria took refuge from a storm in the lamaserie at the head of the pass in those days the monastery was not forbid den the following morning the mer chants wife was found wounded having been attacked during the night by a vampire bat the story goes that a week later she diedand it is believed by the chinese and sartang mongols that her soul twas reincarnated in the form of a ghoul and returns to feast upon men its only a horrid tale butshe shudderedbut the facts remain that once every two weeks a man of tsagandhuntsa vanishes and no trace of him is ever found she leaned across the table look ing earnestly into his face do you think im mad perhaps i amfor sometimes i believe so but to go on with my story every consul sent here within the past five years has disappearedand they are supposed to be victims of the ghoulsoul of the russian woman unfortunately for my brother lance m grebin the late consul was a drinkerand so was his secre tary during our stay which ran into many days the three of them were often intoxicatedso intoxi cated that they were unconscious whenever this occurred i was alone with lotuseye the consuls servant and the two cossack guards yashka and alexis but they were always very kind to me the second week we were here m grebins secretary disappeared went for a walk down by the lake and did not come back then two weeks later m grebin vanished in the same manner after that alexis the cossack volunteered to go to kurruk and appeal to the con sul thereand he left lance my brother did not drink any after m grebin disappeared we were only remaining at the consulate unth alexis returned from kurruk thenthen came the night when lance wentthree nights ago it was snowing about midnight i awakened and prompted by a pecul iar psychic feeling i got up as i did i could have sworn that i heard someone singing or wailing out in the snow i went into lances room which was next to mine and as i enteredhe sprang up from his kang and jumped through the window i ran and leaned outand as i did i heard an eerie uncanny laugh i called yashka immediately and he searchedbut it was useless for the snow destroyed all footprints as she ended he thought he saw tears glistening in the nightblue eyes that is all she said alexis who went to kurruk is overdue and i am afraid he encountered tangut robbersor dugpas now you can understand why i sent for you but listen once more she leaned across the table to him more deadly than the viper i think i have a solution for the mystery of the valley of vanishing men the lamaserie at the head of the pass is like some few in the north gobiin that a living repre sentative of the divine is reputed to dwell therein it is called the mon astery of the shining one whether this shining one is a man or a wom an none knowexcept the monks and only a comparatively few lamas are cloistered therea hundred or less they say the shining one has never tasted food but lives by divine substance in many of the lama series of tibet and the gobi devilish rituals are practicedand in some it is rumored human sacrifice is en acted she halted significantly and their eyes met then you think he began i dont know it merely occurred to me i told yashka but he be lieves it would be impossible to get into the lamaserieunless by force and that can not be done he said until alexis returns but oh i am afraid to wait for if the lamaserie isnt accessible tremaine questioned it is forbidden to all who are not of the faith no white man has been known to enter since the death of the russian woman and you believe your brother is theredead or alive again she made that gesture of futility god knows dont you see the idea was something tangible and in my grief i grasped it hoping pray ing that she swallowed hard i understand he told her and i will try to think of a plan to get in the lamaserie and but i couldnt let you take that riskthe odds would be against you tremaine smiledan expression that lighted his frank open face and his wide gray eyes there is little or no danger he assured herwhich was not what he thought but you wont try it tonight darkness is betterand a minute lost might mean much her hands closed over his he felt them trembling her eyes too seemed to tremblelike deep blue stars no i couldnt allow you to do that i couldnt you have only known me for a few minutes and but were both from virginia he interposed smiling yet solemn and you are alonein trouble per haps your solution of the mystery is correct andand you see for four months traveling from urga with forbidden lhassa as the objective ive journeyedsuffering the thirst and cold listening to jackals and wolves by night seeing only brown and yellow women with never the sight of a white womans faceall these hardships on a gamble to try and penetrate the secret city im a gambler through and through and now for the sight of your face the face of a white woman in all this loneliness and desolation im willing to play another game to do any thingto repay you for the sight of you they had both risen were stand ing face to face in the candleglow and the fragrant heat from the brazier hung like a spirithand between them i think i understand she re turned slowly but isnt that a one sided bargain but i want to pay that price he bent swiftly caught her hand and lifted it to his lips it was an impulsive boyish act and afterward he felt embarrassed his face burned more deadly than the viper ii had better go now he stam mered miriam amber struck the gong and when the greenclad chinese girl appeared instructed her to bring his coat and hat goodnight travis tremaine she said in that low sweet voice i shall be waiting herewhen you come back the next he knew he was taking his coat and hat from lotuseye was leaving the room with the amethyst shadows the face of miriam amber burning before him like a white flame in front of the building he encoun tered the huge cossack yashka standing under the lanthorn smok ing the balalaika tucked under one arm v looks as if one night is going to pass without snow observed the american his eyes upon the moon that was creeping up from behind the ghostlike mountains the cossack shrugged his big shoulders it may snow and it may not nie snayu i dont know tremaine moved off good night tovarishtchi he said over his shoulder good night barin returned the muscovite ii upon reaching the caravanserai tremaine went immediately to his room where he found shagdur warm ing himself over the argussun fire bring one of the camels with full equipment to the front immediately he instructed no food necessary ill be back before morningper haps shagdur stared you are not go ing to travel alone at night master there are tangut robbers in this re gion i can take care of myself he assured him as shagdur left the room tremaine went to his camelbags in one cor ner removing a box of matches a dagger and an automatic all of which he placed in the inside pocket of his coat and quitted the barren bed chamber making his way to the front of the khan to await the caravan bashi for some little time he paced the courtyard his eyes frequently seek ing the whitewashed lamaserie its spectral bulk now crowned by the rising moon the solitary light still gleamed from its sullen portals malevolently crimson at length shagdur appeared lead ing a tall white bughra or hecamel you may occupy my room in the rest house tonight tremaine told him as the camel knelt ill hardly be back before daylight when the shaggy hecamel had re gained his feet tremaine guided him past the shadowwrapped dwellings of the winding main street around the icecrusted lake with its kamish plants and across the broad plain that spread like a carpet before the ridges here the caravanroad entered the fearsome jaws of tsagandhuntsa pass thrusting a narrow crooked passage between lofty towering walls of solid stone until near the snowcrowned peaks it skirted the lamaserie for the descent on the other side of the mountain and tre maine urged his ungainly mount to a trot leaving the sentinelcrags of the lower pass behind and beginning the steep climb to the whitewashed mon astery with its leering eye of crim son by the time he reached the stone terraces of the lamaserie the moon had abandoned its post above the peaks swinging hawklike into the more deadly than the viper clear cold sky and pouring its na creous flood upon the ghostly sprawling monastery not many yards from the main portal tremaines journey ended and he forced the bughra to kneel slip ping from his back to the ground he patted the gaunt shaggy beast upon the neckwhile with the other hand he withdrew the dagger from his inside pocket im damned sorry old fellow he said but its for herand youre willing to play the game for a white woman arent you then with a quick movement he jerked the beasts head back and at the same instant the blade of the dag ger flashed there followed a queer sucking gurgling sound and something warm rushed over his hands fighting against a terrible nausea looking away from the dark liquid that stained his hands he deliberate ly slashed open the sleeve of his sheepskin coat and when the flesh was bare the dagger flashed again his teeth ground together but it was over now with trembling hands he cleaned the knife on his coat returned the weapon to his pocket and walked with unsteady steps to the nearby portal of the lamaserie at the door he halted pounding upon the heavy nailstudded panels after several minutes had passed without a reply he again knocked this time louder at last an answerpatience brother patience the voice came from behind the portal the words being spoken in the sartang mongol dialect a tongue with which tremaine was familiar presently there was the sound of a bolt being lifted and the door opened revealing outlined upon a warmth of light the form of an ema ciated yellowrobed lama a white silk scarve of the order about his neck peace be with thee was the yel low monks greeting what wouldst thou have of amgon lama of the monastery of the shining one tremaine fell against the door frame in a position that would ex hibit his bloody arm to the lama peace be with thee he returned i seek aid and shelter brother he felt the monks eyes searching him i perceive thee to be wounded brother he announced yet i have not the authority to admit thee to the cloisterunless perchance thou art of some other monastery the world is my monastery re turned tremaine but i am hurt brother and can not reach the vil lage below for seehe waved his hand towards the camels carcass my beast is dead and i can walk no further above the pass tangut robbers fell upon my caravan and killed my comrades my camel car ried me this far before he went down surely thou wilt not turn me away the priest hesitated theneven though i perceive thee to be insore need of succor i can not allow thee to enter without the permission of the grand lama stay here brother and perchance he will have compas sion upon thee after the door closed behind the shavenpated priest tremaine slipped to the cold ground before the en trance feigning unconsciousness presently the door opened again following that tremaine heard voices and from beneath lowered lids he saw the lama with the white silk scarf emerge accompanied by three more deadly than the viper others the latter number wearing mitreshaped hats his pains have caused him to swoon reported one of the lamas having bent over tremaine look ye his camel lies yonder after a moment of whispered con sultation the four lamas lifted tre maine and carried him inside the monastery following the harsh clang of the closing portal he was borne some distanceup flights of stairs and through dark incense laden corridorsand at length placed upon something cold and hard a kang he imagined three of the lamas retreated leav ing the fourth the one with the scarf to light a candle and examine the american and during this per formance it required great control on the part of tremaine for a single twitch of a muscle might have betrayed him presently one of the monks re turned bearing ointment a cloth and a bowl of water the latter he passed to the other lama and whilst the priest of the white scarve held the receptacle he bathed and dressed the cut in tre maine s arm when this was done they departed in silence taking the candle and clos ing the door easily behind them tremaine opened wide his eyes instead of the darkness that he ex pected as the natural result of the withdrawal of the light a long iron barred window allowed the stream of moonlight to crust the floor beneath the casement with pearl and bring into vague outline the walls and ceiling of a small celllike room there was no furniture other than the kang upon which he lay a raw chill pervaded the atmos phere making him shiver and shake too the ordeal through which he had just passed had left him with a feel ing of physical weakness he won dered if he would ever forget the piteous whine of the camel a shudder swept him rising from the stone bed he crept to the door his hand closing over the knob to his surprise the door was not bolted but swung inward with a mild whine of hinges disclosing a gloomstrictured corridor as he started to step over the threshold his ears caught a faint pat patpata sound that suggested the padded footfalls of a feline animal coming from somewhere in the dark passage he drew back into the room hesi tated closed the door and returned to the kang he had scarcely stretched himself out upon the cold stone when from beneath lowered lids he saw the door open slowlysaw a misty figure take birth in the maw of darkness his sensation as the person entered was not unlike an electric shock for he perceived it was a woman she wore something that corus cated in the moonlight and her hair the shade of a tibetian night was unbound in a black flood about her shoulders and the face in the moonlight it was clearcut like a piece of marblean alluring mani festation of a hundred voices a face more wickedly lovely than any he had ever beheld the lips were full smears of dark in the wan light and flames of jet burned in the heavy lidded eyes she moved across the crusting of pearly light her garments shimmer ing sinisterly and bent over him her body radiating a warmth that was sweet like bruised sandalwood she laughed the musical peals suggesting shattered crystals my white mummy he heard her murmur in the sartang mongol dia more deadly than the viper lect her voice held a lureprom ised paradise and a sweet hell she bent lower over him lower until the fragrance of bruised sandal wood dulled his senses into a lassi tude my mummy then she allowed her hand to caress his forehead and at the touch a thousand electric volts sent a charge through his whole body o white mummy she crooned thy brow is crowned with the pal lor of flaming snows i long to love thee to smother thee with kisses to let thee perish in my embrace but not tonight o white mummy an other time her face sank lower until her lips met his and in that terrible moment he was possessed of a desire to reach up and crush her to him to return the pressure of that mouth suddenly she sprang back retreat ing intothe full clarity of the moon the flames of jet in her eyes leaped high her body grew rigid tense she flung back her arms the shining draperies spread as wings of woven stars and thus she stood for a brief instant like a huge scintillating bat above the throat of prey redred like burning rubies fell from her lips a look of hellish exultation swept her facea typhoon of emotion she took a single step toward him her eyes upon his arm where the skin was slashed then conquered herself by sheer force of willa battle that was evident in her face he heard her teeth snap together the typhoon was spent she whirled he saw the flash of her draperies dust in the wake of a silver tempest and the door clanged shut once more he was alone in the cell of the lamaserie iii cold perspiration stood out on tremaines body how he had been able to master himself while she fawned over him he did not know but he did realize that he could not endure another such ordeal for a long time he lay there his body quivering with reaction and at length he rose determined upon a course of action moving to the door he lifted the latch the ponderous portal swung inward revealing the blackness of the corridora sable flood that swam visibly before his eyes the black dark suggested frightful things hidden horrors his jaw tightened he ground his teeth together another step a whine of unoiled hinges and it was donethe door closed and he adrift in the fluid dark ness he still wore the sheepskin coat the dagger and the automatic rested in his inside pocket and his hand crept beneath the heavy garment closing over the cold steel of the re volver thus armed his unengaged hand extended to avoid a collision with any objects that might lurk in his path he started forward he had advanced not more than five yards when instinct warned him to halt his unengaged hand slipped into the pocket where the box of matches lay a mere instantand following a splutter a tiny blaze was born in the cimmerian blackness what he saw caused a vacant sen sation in the pit of his stomach he was at the top of a flight of stairs that wound down into a well of darkest night he shuddered and the match expired one hand slipping over the smooth wall the other gripping the pistol he began the descent and after what more deadly than the viper seemed to him a deathless aeon of downward steps he emerged from the winding stairs into a corridor that was halflit by a flickering oil lamp in a niche in the wall upon reaching the end of the hall he found on one side huge iron hinged doubledoors and opposite them another stair that sank into deep oblivion here he halted un decided which course to choose stairway or doors the fearsome aspect of the former promised dark revelations the doubledoors could come later he stepped into the mouth of the stair the descent was steep straight as a flame and when he reached the bottom he found himself again in a flood of sable the atmosphere was foulsmelled of freshly turned earth once more he removed the match box from his pocket and ignited one with the small flare a mere spark in a great void he strained his eyes at first he could make out only vague shapes formless shadows but soon his vision became accustomed to the poor light and he beheld what was evidently an unused chapel of the lamaseriea chapel that was fast surrendering to ruin the walls being broken and seamed and grown in places with a loathsome fungi the floor was strewn with rubbish and broken stones and along the center of the chapel placed at regu lar intervals were twelve oblong boxes all this he glimpsed before the match went out he lit another immediately this time the twelve wooden boxes claimed his attention they were all the same size and shape and built like coffins to the nearest he moved aware of a pregnant dread within him the lid was half off thus revealing only a portion of the interior and its con tents but that was enough to make him fall back a step nauseated god the word left his tongue involun tarily again he lookedto verify what he had first seen hoping that some sorcery of the shadows had fashioned in ironic jest the thing that he had beheld but no it was there the match died burning his finger tips god again the word was wrung from his lips he struck another match and moved to the next box peering in he repeated this performance until he had examined the entire twelve and the contents of each proved the same tsu chii ti fang the valley of vanishing men he understood now and the terrible truth spread like a deadly poison through his brain miriam ambers words came back to him they say the shining one has never tasted food the shining one and who could the shining one be but that dark eyed priestess of hell who had bent over him in the room above the match expired as darkness shut down upon him he resolved to continue his explorations to pene trate the mysteries beyond the doubledoors opposite the mouth of the stairway and if possible exter minate this monstrous menace to the world the valley of vanishing men the full horror of it sent his soul reeling with nausea that such a thing existed on this earth he would not have believed before he groped his way past the oblong the woman in the chinese gold tissue backed down the stairs step by step never removing her eyes from those of the manpage more deadly than the viper boxes to the stairs ascended to the corridor where the oil lamp flickered in the niche in the wall and paused before the massive doubledoors suppose there were persons with in suppose he steeled himself lifted the bolt and the doors swung open under the pressure of his weight a single glance showed the cham ber to be without occupantsa vast rectangular hall it was from its ap pearance a place of worship such as he had seen in some of the lama series of the gobi and northeastern tibet its four walls ornamental with yakhorns and grotesque devilmasks and hung with cloths woven of the hair of the yellow camel in the shadowsunken corners outside the intimate radiance of a globular lamp that burned on a reed table in the center of the room were prayer wheels and drums made of human skullsmyriad lamist devices on one side of the grim apartment stood a black screen with the form of the destroying god varchuk em broidered in gold upon it and oppo site on the left of an iron door a large lacquered chest was pushed against the wall at the extreme end of the hall low steps rose between files of gray urns relics of the shunlai imperialists to the foot of crimson silver threaded tapestries tremaine first moved to the iron door it opened readily and he stepped out on asmall balcony high on the walls of the monastery over hanging a dreadful chasm in the mountainsan abyss so deep so shuddersome that the moonlight failed to penetrate its fearful depths he withdrew from the balcony closing the door behind him and crossed the hall of worship to the urnlined steps at the top he faced the crimson silverthreaded tapes tries without hesitancy he gripped the heavy cloths and jerked them aside the movement rattling the rings from which they hung at his touch they seemed to spring apart a broad band of light cast from the gobular lamp fell over his shoulders stretching to the side of a stone sarcophagus and here shattering to bits of argent and into the illumination he moved reaching the side of the sarcophagus and bending over the form therein as he looked he throttled a cry for the face paler older than when he had last seen it was the face ofmiriam amber his whole body went numbbut the following instant he realized that it was not she that the body lying in the sarcophagus belonged to a man clad in a long black robe his thin hands clasped across his breast such a likeness the face was the same but for a suggestion of more maturity was he knew the face of her brother lance amber instinct prompted him to feel the heart to his surprise for the body lay as one dead it was throbbing he was alivebut that thin haggard face something about it tragically young wrung his soul amber he called amber can you hear me can you speak he returned the revolver to his pocket and began to chafe the cold hands for fully ten minutes he em ployed various means to awaken the man but he remained in the repose of the dead silent motionless tremaine was at loss what to do next several minutes passed as he stood above the sarcophagus his gaze wandering helplessly about the hall a faint sound aroused him to action a sound that he identified with the bolt outside the doubledoorsand more deadly than the viper his eyes quickly searched the vast chamber for a hiding place finally alighting upon the black screen em broidered with the likeness of var chuk hastily drawing the curtains to gether behind him he moved down the steps and attained the temporary security of the screen just as the ponderous doubledoors swung open a lone figure entereda figure in a gown of chinese gold tissue tre maine caught his breath voluntarily for it was the creature who had bent over him while he lay in the cell her gilded form seemed to swim in the glow of the globular lamp as she drifted toward the crimson tapes tries reaching the top of the steps she thrust apart the curtains and stood for an instant with her draper ies spread wingfashion looking down upon the man in the sarco phagus then she bent over him her dark hair cascading about her white neck a laugh rippling from her lips my king tremaine heard her murmur in liquid tones then she moved back shoulders against the crimson tapestries her eyes upon the face in the sarco phagus come forth o moonbrow she commanded tremaine watched breathlessly slowly very slowly the black clad figure in the sarcophagus sat up his face burning with an unearthly pal lor in the shadowy alcove come o my king continued the caressing voice with a dreamlike movement lance amber abandoned the stone sarcophagus and stood erect between the crimson tapestries his eyes open glassy his black robe dragging on the floor about his feet the woman in the chinese gold tissue backed down the stairs step by step never removing her eyes from those of the man and with a slow tread he followed across the hall to the lacquered chest be seated she commanded he obeyed and as he sank on the chest she bent lowlower yetuntil her jetblack eyes were on a level with his tremaine watching the strange performance from behind the screen was beginning to grasp a tangible so lution for ambers condition hyp nosis this goldrobed woman ex erted that power over her victims he understood now the lassitude that he had felt when she bent over him in the cell gt she was speaking againnow awaken at her evocation the eyes of lance amber lost the glassy expression be came almost normal and he lifted one thin white hand passing it over his browas if to wipe away the re maining tangles of a nightmare the woman laughed again allur ingly and low he got to his feet staring at her you you again he said in the half drowsy voice of the recently awakened sleeper good god and why should not i be here beloved amber dropped on the chest his haggard face falling in his hands and the woman knelt locking her white arms about him art thou not glad to see me o moonbrow she purred am not i fair to look upon does not the sight of me stir in thee some flame of love a sob broke from the man love you he echoed fiercely thrusting her away knowing you to be what you are slie only laughedthat siren laugh more deadly than the viper i am white like thee o moon brow she went on my mother was whitewas from a great country be yond tibet called russia this i know for the lamas have told me of her of her death here in the monas tery just after my birth o be loved when i could have sent thee below with my white mummies i let thee remain herefor i knew that we were made for one another ah moonbrow thou shalt be a king here i am called the shining one i talk with the gods neither the dalai lama or the tashi lama nor that spineless fool at urga has so much power as i and i offer to share this glory with thee to be the consort of the shining orie does that not tempt thee again the man pushed her roughly away leave me alone to die he en treated piteously my godlove you the touch of you is like that of a leper you are unclean foul accursed a creature damned the fires of jet in her eyes rose she laughed sharply her hands went to her throat and unclasped a necklace of pigeonblood rubiesa thing that shone like threaded drops of fire ah beloved behold these she cried extending the jewels to him in the treasure vaults of the lama serie there are gems more costly than these jewels such as are rarely seen and all are thine if stop he fairly shrieked with a spring he got to his feet and snatched the necklace from her hand hurling it to the floor where it broke scattering in tiny pools of flame god in heaven leave me alone he shrilled you have undermined my life murdered my soul kept me here in this damnable place un til my vitality is sucked up now for ghrists sake let me die in peace with that he struck her full in the face she fell back clutched at the wall and lay panting against the cloth of camelhair thou hast struck me she hissed whereas before thou couldst have had my love now thou shalt know the anger of the shining one thou art mine body and soul mine dost thou hear and i will take thee break thee and fling thy body to a death worse than the horrors of the nethermost hell amber lunged at her but she caught his arm twisted it and sent him to his knees her eyes burned emeraldlike thou hast no strength to resist me for i am the shining one the soul of tibet as beautiful as the moons as fierce as a shewdf my voice is like melted honey and when i call men come from the furthest ends of the earth and i crush them as i will crush thee she was forcing the whitefaced amber slowly to the floor her eyes close to hisand tremaine watch ing hypnotized for the time unable to act imagined he could feel the hot contamination of her breath upon his cheek iamtibetj she panted in that sweet voice thou hast resisted me and i shall have thy blood with a desperate wrench amber broke free staggering back against the reed table whereon the lamp burned the impact of his body sent the fragile affair crashing to the floor shattering the globular lamp in a burst of flame a shriek terrible inhuman rent the air congealing tremaines blood ah god no not that more deadly than the viper followed a groanan animal snarl tremaine knocked aside the screen drawing his revolver and moving for ward in the darkness after a mo ment of blind groping his hand touched somethingthe doorknob and with a jerk he swung the door wide a sword of moonlight leaped through the oblong aperture smiting the sable shadows and falling in steely clarity across two figures amber and the goldrobed woman as the light touched the creature she reeled away from the man throwing her shoulders against the wall arms outflung eyes blazing staring at tremaine who was out lined in the doorway he lifted his revolverfired with a scream of pain she hurled herself upon him the jar of her body knocked the revolver from his graspsent him upon his back on the floor of the balcony and locked to gether they rolled over and over her hot breath scorching his cheek by a sudden twist of his armthe same twist that she had employed to down ambershe forced his shoul ders to the floor her eyes aflame lips parted baring the white teeth her face sank lowlower the touch of her was to him more revolting than contact with the most loathsome viper yet a sort of deadly lassitude was beginning to lock its tentacles about him he felt a sharp pain in his throat that stung him to greater effort and with a powerful wrench he freed one arm locking his fingers in her hair she shrieked loosened the vise upon him he sprang to his feet bent caught her about the waist lifted her and swung her body through the air out over the balcony another shriek he clung to the railing trembling violently watching the thing as it shot straight down into the bowels of the awful chasm he turned stumbled into the hall as he entered a great cjamor came from the doubledoors through a blurr he saw them burst open ad mitting a flood of human beings they were so indistinct in the semi dark that he could make out no de tails but he understood the la mas he staggered out on the balcony gripping the railing and trying to steel himself for the encounter but weakness drove home to him his bones seemed to melt within him he slipped to the floor and before un consciousness closed its opaque doors upon him he beheld a huge birdlike creature winging its way out of the abyss rising high in the air and crossing the face of the moon it was an enormous bat iv life came back to tremaine slow ly with a faint roaring and crackling as he opened his eyes he saw a vast blaze not far away tongues of fire that lapped hungrily at a dark cur tain saw the moon too above the flames seeming wreathed in smoke voices near him were talking he struggled to a sitting position looking about dazedly ah barin at last you are awake following that the tangles in his vision were wiped away and he recognized the speakeryashka the cossack at the same time he under stood the flames and the voices a large group of men all mounted on tartar ponies and armed with balalaikas and cossack whips were gathered around him and above for they were near the foot of tsa more deadly than the viper gandhuntsa passstood the white washed lamaserie swathed in smoke and flames alexis arrived from kurruk a short while ago with a detachment of soldiers he heard yashka telling him the consul at kurruk sent them the barishnya told us whither you had gone and we followedand broke in the lamaserie nearly all the lamas fled some were shot we found the barishnyas brother in a large room and you on a balcony then we set torches to the accursed monastery and what of amber queried tremaine bad wound in the throat re turned the cossack the holy vir gin alone knows what could have made such a nasty tear but i think he will recover seehe indicated a form that tremaine had hitherto not observed lying several feet away there he is tremaine got up still weak and unsteady and moved to the out stretched amber wed better remove him to the consulate he suggested miss am ber will be waiting yashka spoke to one of his com rades and the two russians strapped the body of lance amber upon the back of a tartar pony vperyed advance cried the leader of the cossacks and the troops moved down upon the plain tremaine and yashka followed on foot the former leading the tartar pony that walk across the valley seemed a dream to the americana dream that ended as they reached the consulate in the courtyard she was waiting white with the stain of the dying moon the trembling stars re flected in her nightblue eyes arms outstretched to greet him i wanted to go with them he heard her saying but yashka made me remain behind it is always so the woman behind tell me then she saw the form strapped to the saddle of the tartar pony darted to it in a moment she turned back to tremaine in her eyes he glimpsed a light such as he had rarely seen even in the risen evening star travis tremaine she said in that low sweet voice god sent youto meall the way from fredericksburg jim dickinsons head by harold ward jim dickinsons head pickled in a jar of alcohol reposes in the dis honored fastness of a dusty closet in doctor wrights office it has been all of a half century since i assisted the doctors father old doc wright in separating it from its trunk that dark stormy night out in the weedgrown potters field yet last night when i looked at the grisly relic the face wore the same wolfish grin that it had borne in life the fangs were skinned back fero ciously like the tusks of an angry boar and the one good eyethe other had been gouged out in a fight years beforeglared malevolently insolent ly leeringly as if even in death the owner found a certain grim pleasure in cheating the law which had de clared that head and body must re main intact jim dickinsons body has in the natural course of events long been incorporated with the black earth slime from which it came over it the loathsome worms have long since ceased to hold their ghoulish revelry his filthy soul is without doubt in the hell it created for itself as for his headthe head he lost to doc wright in a poker game and which the whiskysodden old physic dis penser claimed from the grave rather than brave the unspeakable wrath of the dead outlawthat is another story doc wanted the head because of the thickness of the skull which had withstood without cracking a tattoo from the butt end of a revolver in the hands of a frenzied man and dickinson wanted him to have it be cause it had been fairly won and the only point of honor he ever observed was the payment of his gambling debts it is of jim dickinsons mal formed headland the black cat with the devils tempers and creole may the outcast that this story is written i where jim dickinson was spawned or whelpedor whatever the inception of an anomaly like him can be calledis a question my personal opinion is that he was never bornthat he was created from the slimy green frog spit that gathers in a scum on stagnant muckbut the preachers will probably take issue with me on that point at any rate i know of my own knowledge that there were more maggots of deviltry squirming inside the black ness of his skull than could ever exist in the same space in hell jim dickinson made his first bid for our attention by appearing in black peters saloon one dark stormy nighta big hulking figure of a man with a broken hooked nose and a black tangled thatch of whis kers his huge misshapen head stuck out turtlewise on a thick bull neck his thin cruel lips were drawn back in a snarl of vindictive hatred of the world in general over yellowed fangs so large as to almost appear artificial one socket was empty from the other blazed an orb so badly twisted out of shape by b maug jim dickinsons head the scar from the wound that had destroyed the other that it looked to be almost in the center of his fore head giving him a horrible ogrelike appearance there was nothing human about him he was an ani mal black peters den was crowded that night finding no open space at the bar dickinson made one for himself by shooting in cold blood a poor swede whose place he coveted before the murmur of anger and astonishment had fairly started he stepped across his victims twitch ing body to the blood bespattered bar and downed the liquor which the latter had just poured out his bale ful eye gleamed from under his mop of hair challenging the world to dis pute his right the swede was a stranger in the camp and the fero cious cruelty and simianlike appear ance of the slayer was such as to make the average man think twice before taking up a dead mans quar rel where he had come from no one knew nor did his attitude towards the world at large tend to encourage familiarity by that one venomous deed he became the bully of the camp from then until his death he held his sway over the scum of the earth that had gathered there by sheer devilishness and wanton cruel ties he was a thief a crook a gambler and a red handed killera beasta thing of evil the only sense of decency he had was in the payment of his gambling debts he would murder a man in cold blood without a pang of remorse in order to filch from his pocket the money with which to pay a debt of honor his philosophy of life was as warped and crooked as his twisted soul and yet we allowed him to live because we feared him take the affair with the gang from devils gulch originally there had been six of them pitted against him as a result of some mixup with one of the partners by shooting straight dickinson whittled the number down to three before they caught him at the edge of camp with a bullet through his leg and a horse that dropped dead in its tracks he had no friends he expected no assistance those of us who were at leisure gathered around to enjoy the spectacle and to see that the strangers handled the affair in a strictly ethical manner the only tree in that part of the state was a stunted cottonwood the lower limbs of which were but a few feet above his head as he stood erect his gun was empty and he was apparently exhausted hence they attempted to send him into the presence of his maker without going to the trouble of binding him thinking no doubt that he would die game and save them any unnecessary trouble they were not as well informed on the general cussedness of the man how ever as they should have beena fact which resulted disastrously for the visitors for dickinson instead of giving up the ghost without a fight made a mighty leap and seized the lower limb with both hands tak ing the strain off his neck doc wright drunker and more vitriolic than usual was among the spectators the dissipated old repro bate chuckled gleefully and hammered the outlaw smartly over the knuckles with his cane leggo that tree he yelled why the hell cant you die like a man you yellow dog youre trying to cheat me out of your head with the speed of a panther dick inson hung by one hand slipped the noose over his head with the other there being no place at the bar he quickly made one for himself by shooting in cold blood a poor swede whose place he covetedpage jim dickinsons head kicked one of his captors in the face as he hung there and vanquished the other two in a fair fight fists against gun and when he had completed the job he humbly apologized to doc wright for not allowing them to hang him so that the bonesetter could claim his honest winnings ii to cave men like jim dickinson love comes but onceand in ways that are peculiar and dark that he loved creole may in his own fashion there is not a doubt and like his aboriginal ancestors he demon strated his affection by beating the lady of his choice whenever oppor tunity offered and she recognizing in the subtle way that women have that his display of brutality was only a cover for the flame of love that smoldered in his heart took her beat ings whimpering but uncomplain ingly and seeking an outlet for her feelings lavished her affections on michael michael was an ugly brute of a cat black of fur and short of temperin short a feline double of dickinson dickinson hated him with a deep jealous hatredhated him because creole may loved him with the peculiarity of a woman she treated her lord with humbleness and humil ity fighting his battles and cooking his meals in a true wifely wayuntil he laid hands on the cat that she would not allow and dickinson loving the swarthy strumpet who shared his bed and board feared to vent his feelings on the animal lest he drive the female creature from his side cheeta the squaw who was re puted to be a witch had warned him against black catswarned him as she cursed him for the killing of her husband dickinson sought to close her mouth by knocking her down but she refused to be silenced itll get ye curse ye itll get ye she howled shaking her skinny fist at the oneeyed man a black catll be the death of ye a black catll send ye to hell andll spit at ye while yer roastin damn ye ye spawn of the devil in selfdefense he was compelled to choke her into unconsciousness but her screams still echoed in his ears nor could he drown them in drink for the maggots in his head were the kind that alcohol stimulates rather than deadens we had our priest father olaughlin a warmhearted little chap who sought with every means at his command to regenerate the place and bring its inhabitants into the fold he met with scant success to say the most but he persisted and because he was a man among men measured by mens standards he gained our respect and love even though we refused to follow the cross in some mysterious manner father olaughlin learned that cre ole may had once been baptized in his faith immediately he set about seeking a way to win her back to the church but she had slipped too far down the scale of righteousness and virtue she gave no heed to the mes sages the good padre sent her time after time begging her presence at the little church in the valley with its cross of spotless white of two evils she had been taught to fear jim dickinson worse than the threat of hell and dickinson his soul al ready forfeited to the devil and his head honestly lost in a poker game waiting only his death to be claimed forbade her responding to the priests appeal but to the latter she was jim dickinsons head a brand to be plucked from the burn ing and after several weeks had elapsed he determined to visit her in person and appeal to her better nature for father olaughlin loved humanity and to him none had dropped so low that he could not be saved on the evening selected by father olaughlin for his visit dickinson who was violently jealous having been called away on some expedition outside the law had taken precau tions tending to keep any of mays admirers away from the cabin by planting a bear trap in the dirt just outside the door to this may sub mitted dumbly and without bitter ness she was a woman and her philosophy taught her that a woman is the rightful prey of the man strong enough to take her the method of taking did not enter into her thoughts they lived in a tumbledown shack far up the mountain side and ap proached by a single narrow path nicked high in the cliff for dickin son was a bit of a strategist and in building looked forward to a possible siege following some new outrage when she saw the little priest slowly puffing up the path she real ized for the first time that something of evil might result from dickinsons efficient though brutal attempt to capture his rivals she was willing to stand his abuse but sight of the priest brought remembrances of her better days and over her swept a sense of shame she rebelled against the man of god seeing her in her squalor and misery there was no way to flee for the path over which he was approaching was the only way from the place and that path would bring him directly into the jaws of the trap creole may for the first time in her long career of shame and sorrow was panic stricken there was but one door to the shack to dodge out of it even in the dusk of the swiftly falling twilight would betray her presence to the visitor nor was there a bush or a rock in the vicinity behind which she could take refuge yet she could not remain she was not given to analyzing her senti ments she had a vague feeling that she was not fit to meet the man who represented in that wild territory the church of her innocent youthnot for the punishment he might bringfor she knew that he brought only a message of lovebut as an erring child fears the parent who governs by kindness physical pain she could endure but she knew that father olaughlin ruled his flock by love and love except the love she lavished on michael was missing from her strange life so like a child caught in some mischievous prank she peeped around the doorway and watched the head of the priest just appearing over the little knoll her foot rested on the chain which fastened to the bed and dragging across the floor was attached to the bear trap to leave the snare in its present location meant injury to the priest even if the jaws did not break his leg dick inson might return ere she could free him and dickinson in a jealous rage cared nothing for god man nor devil he might even kill the good father in spite of her fear of dickinsons vengeance over the removal of his snare the religion of her girlhood surged forward in her thoughts father olaughlin must be saved to think was to act hastily grasp ing the chain she gave a mighty heave and pulled the trap out of the dirt and dragged it into the house jim dickinsons head pulling down the blanket on the battered bed she laid the trap on the mattress and laid the covering over it again then she dived hastily under the bed just as she heard the priests step outside the door father olaughlin receiving no answer to his repeated rappings turned sadly and wended his way back again down the mountain path with fear and trembling creole may listened to the padres retreat ing footsteps then as they died away in the distance she arose and seating herself in one of the two broken chairs the cabin afforded she gave way to meditation and tears sharing her troubles with black michael her only friend dickinson returning earlier than usual found the cabin in darkness and may in tears the moon shining brightly on the front of the shack showed him that the trap had been removed ere he reached the spot with a bellow of rage he leaped through the open doorway he stood for a second his single bloodshot eye accustoming itself to the darkness of the interior then with a snarl he turned upon the woman where is he he demanded shaking her as a terrier shakes a rat damn you tell me wheres the man you had in here she attempted to answerto ex plain he refused to listen the words were choked off in her throat by the pressure of his huge muscular fingers then holding her at arms length with his left hand he smashed blow after blow into her face with his right until tiring he hurled her into the corner a dying battered unconscious heap the cat true to its nature spit angrily at the invader roaring like a maddened bull dickinson aimed a kick at the animal michael at tempting to dodge out of the crazed mans way became tangled between his legs in the darkness dickinson stumbled and fell sprawling across the bed his huge head struck the trigger of the bear trap hidden beneath the blanket squarely and with the force of a battering ram the jaws flew together with a snap closing about the thick neck with a grip that had been made to hold a grizzly king dickinson threshed about spasmod ically for a second his eye bulging out of its socket his finger worked convulsively then twitch ing slightly he lay quiet on the foot of the bed michael his greenishyellow eyes gleaming like twin fires humped his back and spit in accordance with the prophecy of cheeta while jim dickinsons worthless soul entered into hell two nights later i helped doc wright claim the head he had won and which jim dickinson was ready to pay the triple murder in mulberry bend by christopher hawthorne i you will find three dead men in molspinis cellar in mulberry bend the single typewritten line was un dated and unsigned but on the lower righthand corner of the paper were three distinct fingerprints made with such precision that obviously they were placed there with a purpose silent cass lieutenant of detec tives read the note without visible ex citement or interest looks like the real thing he grunt ed tossing it across the desk what do you think gatty sergeant gatty glanced stolidly at the writing arose slowly and put on his hat cass also stood up shifting a small automatic from his hip to an out side coat pocket lets walk he said mulberry beflfd was only ten minutes from head quarters anonymous letters belonged to the routine but they rarely yielded anything worth while sometimes they came from revengeful crooks bent on getting even often they were of the poison pen variety written out of sheer malice and more frequently they could readily be identified as the fulminations of half cracked persons moved by morbid obsessions but this letter which had been left at the outside rail at headquarters ad dressed to the police did not fall within any of these categories not that it appealed to a trained sixth sense or any such nonsense the sim ple fact was that mike molspinis place was known to both men in the shadowy past when as lusty young cops on the lower eastside they had pounded the pave together it had been the resort of such picturesque criminals as the wolf and the ox and had achieved a malodorous celebrity as the scene of a barrel murder lat terly however its evil repute had waned and molspini was conducting the place as a provision shop falling in line with the growing respectability of the quarter as the detectives turned into the bend from centre street a policeman placidly saluted them with one hand while he jingled a handful of coins in the other anything doing ohara asked cass bunch of crap shooters took it on the run when they saw me coming chuckled the uniformed man exhibit ing the spoils sergeant gatty looked appraisingly into the open palm hardly the price of a drink these days he sighed get busy thrust in cass curtly ohara you just mope along behind us and keep an eye on molspinis place while we go inside a bronzed sturdy man of about thirty with a suggestion of the military in his garb and carriage sauntered past them halting for an instant as the lieutenant spoke the triple murder in mulberry bend molspini was standing in the door of his shop he greeted the detectives with an overcordial grin what a you got in the cellar mike cass asked the question cas ually not a drop chief not a drop the revenue men got me a month ago with ten gallons of claret i was let off with a fine but the next timewhew cass and gatty laughed with him the revenue men enjoyed no great popularity with the local detectives you dont mind if we go downstairs and look do you asked cass good naturedly hell no come right in as the detective followed molspini into the store ohara slouched past the front door his eyes roving over the cindercovered playground that lay di rectly in front of the bend any show of interest in the shop would have col lected a crowd in no time if there is anything that a good policeman hates it is an assemblage of curious citizens mixed with the inevitable small boys and peering old ladies whom one cannot very well wallop with a nightstick the bronzed young man who over heard the lieutenants orders to the patrolman had crossed the street and was standing at the curb directly oppo site the shop as ohara eyed him the man drew the makins from a pocket rolled a cigarette and walked lazily away in the direction of worth street ii with carefree alacrity molspini led the detectives into the rear room and lifted a trap door a faint flood of light came up from the cellar must have left that lamp burnin all night muttered the shopkeeper fret fully as though estimating the cost of his carelessness silent cass walked half way down the steps gatty started to follow but his superior jerked a thumb over his shoulder and the sergeant remained up stairs if you find any booze down there save a drink for me called molspini jocularly as cass reached the bottom of the stairs the detective looked around the dimlylit cellar a vaultlike chamber of masonry extending the full length and width of the building two small square windows closed now afforded the only means of ventilation the place was stuffy to a point of suffoca tion the rear half was filled with pro vision cases and the usual litter of a grocery storeroom in a clear space well forward three men were seated at a large round table over which hung a single dustcovered electric lamp the tip is half true anyway nlut tered the detective whimsically the three men are here all right but theyre not dead kicking over an empty egg crate he yelled hey you fellows stir your stumps what are you doing here the men at the table did not move or utter a sound silent cass walked over and jarred roughly against the one nearest him the man rolled from the chair fell to his back and remained motionless one arm covering his face with a grotesque crook the detective reached down and grasped the upturned wrist it felt like a piece of damp rub ber hose he released it quickly and the arm oscillated stiffly without alteration of its original position dead the word followed in the wake of the detectives surprised whistle the two men remaining at the table showed no interest cass gripped his automatic and glared at them jerking the hat off the second man the head the triple murder in mulberry bend swayed slightly and a wavering glint came from the staring opalescent eyes dead this time the word was uttered in a tense staccato an echo seemed to come from the dim recesses in the rear silent cass wheeled and backed slowly against the masonry his eyes darting about the cellar the third man was seated in the most natural position possible his chin rested within his hands and he seemed to be asleep cass moved toward him cautiously and with the broadside of his left arm swept the hands from under the chin the man lurched forward his head striking the table with a bang a couple of playing cards fluttered from under him and fell to the floor face up deadthe three of them cass glanced down at the cards buried aces hey gun or knife play i sup pose again molspinis laugh sounded through the open hatch the detective wheeled in sudden wrath hey gatty he shouted truss that fellow up and throw him under the pool table a swift scuffle a snarl and a thud as from the impact of a billy on a skull came to the ears of the listener below then a bleating protest from molspini dont sergeant dontill be quiet cass heard the snap of handcuffs and a heavy sound as though a sack of po tatoes had been tossed to the floor a moment later gattys head ap peared at the top of the stairs whats up chief he asked eagerly lock the door and fetch the wop down answered cass somewhere in the back of his head lurked the thought that the presence of the three dead men in the cellar would be a surprise to molspini spanish joe and louie the lawyer he muttered gazing into the faces of two of the dead men he was about to lift the head of the third when molspini stepped gingerly down the steps followed by gatty the shopkeeper gazed in stupid be wilderment at the three inanimate fig ures cass watched him keenly if the man was acting he certainly was a master of dissimulation lifting his manacled hands above his head he yelled arrest those guysthey aint got no business in my place he had started toward the table when gatty seized him and threw him back into a pile of crates under the steps stay there till your number is called snarled the sergeant leaping toward the table like his superior he instantly recognized the two whose faces were revealed there must have been a hell of a time in hell when those birds flew in he said grimly silent cass laid his hands on the third mans shoulders as he drew back the head the light reflected from the oilcloth on the table cast a ghastly green shadow across the face both men looked long and earnestly at the rigid features i dont get that bird do you said gatty finally cass shook his head and beckoned to molspini the shopkeeper sprang to his feet and ran to the tagtle for a single instant his frightened eyes rested upon the dead face of the man at the table a shriek womanish in its in tensity and shrillness broke from him he strained vainly for a moment at the irons then with incoherent gibberings slithered around the table and kissed the dead mans forehead a look of loathing passed between the detectives neither made any effort to sustain the man as he swayed for a mo ment and crashed to the floor without uttering a word the triple murder in mulberry bend cass drew the anonymous note from his pocket glanced at the fingerprints then at gatty the sergeant seized the right hand of the man on the floor and examined the index finger a faint smudge appeared upon it similar smudges were discernible on the corre sponding fingers of the other two signed their own death warrants surmised gatty silent cass shook his head sealed them after death more likely he said the person who left the note at head quarters probably did the job the lieutenant had taken the pendant lamp from the hook uncoiled the loops and was holding the light close to the face of spanish joe the counte nance wore a look such as might be possible to one which in life bore the marks of all evil passions the black patentleathery hair was banked smoothly down over the fore head the clothing was undisturbed and the whole attitude of the body that of some poisonous thing suddenly bereft of life by being sealed in a vacuum in whatever guise death had come to him it had borne no message of terror to spanish joe with deft fingers gatty ran over the upper part of the body and under the clothing there was no sign of blood from a secret pocket in the vest under the left armpit he drew a poniard it glinted in the light as he held it up clean as a hounds tooth said cass gatty turned to examine the other two the search revealed no outward sign of physical violencenothing in fact but the usual pocket miscellany a bill folder taken from the body of louie the lawyer contained nearly five hun dred dollars nothing unusual as louies wealth was a matter of common knowl edge on the lower east side if the source thereof was not in mulberry bend silent cass stooped and moved the lamp slowly along the floor gatty with face close to the cement followed the light until he came to the cards buried aces explained cass they fell out from under one of these fellows when i shook him this didnt happen in a crooked game said gatty sagelynot if the cards were still buried when he died he picked up a broken chianti flask near the table faugh he sputtered thrusting it out at arms length whatever was in that bottle had an awful kick in it cass also thrust his nose into the broken flask then set it gingerly down on the table kick he echoed why this bot tle seems to be dry inside yet its got a kick like a south african jackass one whiff made me dizzywonder if its wood alcohol the detectives were erect now and gazing at molspinis silent figure so much like the others that he too seemed dead gatty went to the rear drew a bucket of water from the spigot and returning threw it over the prostrate mans face molspini spluttered and sat up gatty dragged him to his feet and faced him toward the dead man whom the shopkeeper had kissed on the forehead who is he demanded the sergeant molspini gave a frightened whimper but did not answer who is he repeated gatty relent lessly drawing back his billy cass thrust out an intervening hand the man was handcuffed besides the lieutenant well knew the futility of con fessions made under duress when a case came to trial gatty dropped the billy back into his coat pocket with a snarling laugh hell change his mind after a night in the old slipwell give him the best the triple murder in mulberry bend room in the housenice quiet place where nobody can hear him squawk when we throw the boots into him cass turned away to conceal a grin from the prisoner he did not like gattys coarse thirddegree work there were grits in it wheeling suddenly upon the shop keeper he demanded when did your brother come from italy mike the long finger of conjecture touched the point its my brother tony he admitted brokenly but i dont know these other fellows or how they came by their death tony had a key to the shop he was a deserter from the other side and had to keep under cover so i let him use the cellar once in a while for card games with his friends you lie snorted gatty neverthe less he turned to cass and said glee fully we cleared up that point any way did we there was a sarcastic note in the lieutenants voice take this fellow over to headquarters bet ter remove the irons and slip out the back way if you dont want to play drum major in front of an east side procession gatty and molspini both trying to look unconcerned walked rapidly across the playgrounds toward headquarters just as three police wagons came clang into the bend by way of worth street the bronzed young man who had observed the detectives enter the provision shop jumped from a bench as the two men passed him whats the matter over therepull ing a raid he asked beat it snapped gatty pushing molspini roughly ahead the young man smiled but did not resume his seat gatty moved along a few yards then paused uneasily wonder if i overlooked a bet in not putting the basket over that guy he muttered hes the same fellow who passed us on our way to the shop when he turned however the bronzed young man had disappeared in the crowd that was flocking toward the police wagons ohara in the meantime had relin quished the task of handling the mob to the reserves and resumed his post the young man who had been rebuffed by gatty paused at his elbow the po liceman looked into the open smiling face and relieved his chest of a weight that had been lying there since the mean ing of the whole affair began to dawn upon him what chance has a harness bull got in a case like this he asked bitterly you might as well hang a red lantern on him and send him out with a fife and drum corps the bronzed young man smiled as ohara moved disconsolately away stone blindboth of em he chuckled the right way to escape the cops is to keep on their heels or hide in the grillroom of the waldorf ill little that was new was discovered at headquarters the fingerprints of spanish joe and louie the lawyer tallied with those in the archives which also contained the records of both men there were no prints or history of the third man whom molspini had admitted to be his brother spanish joes record was such as must have assured him a warm welcome beyond the styx listed as an agent for burlesque shows he had been twice convicted as a white slaver and once for felonious assault it was note worthy however that he had never served a full term in prison his birth place was given as havana cuba and his origin mixed spanish and carib indian the triple murder in mulberry bend the record and antecedents of louie the lawyer were hardly more savory from a shyster practice in essex market court he had branched out to the du bious distinction of being considered the chief lawyer and gobetween in the neth erworld it was his dark and secret op erations that were responsible for the immunity from prison that spanish joe had so long enjoyed although he had a fine home in riverside drive it was in the purlieus of the lower east side that he found his true atmosphere his horizon not having widened apace with his increasing wealth in that sti fling dirty cellar in mulberry bend the hog had returned to his wallow and had been smothered in it one thing was evident from the be ginning the triple murder if such it was did not have its origin in a ven detta all the fantastic earmarks usual to a southern european feud were ab sent there was no hideous marring of the bodies indeed no mark of any kind was found upon them nor did the coroner find a trace of poison after the autopsies a chemical analysis of the organs revealed nothing the men apparently had died of natural causes and simultaneously brooding like three black crows over the sinister mystery the fingerprints on the mysterious note to the police seemed to afford the only clew who had placed them with such care upon the clean white paper what practiced hand had written the note itself it was not the work of a bunglesome amateurthe nicety of spacing and general evenness of the work precluded such a conclu sion silent cass and sergeant gatty went over the back trails of the three dead men encountering nothing but blank walls everywhere and emerging from blind alleys with empty hands from the very first cass had been satis fied that molspini had told the truth when he came out of his faint in the cellar gatty though he did not admit it to his superior had beaten the shopkeeper almost to a pulp avoiding only the bruising of his face without getting any additional information nor did the sergeant say a word about his en counter with the bronzed young man in the playground somehow through his turgid reasoning the thought persisted that this smiling openfaced stranger had not thrust himself into the case by accident the hope grew in him that some subtle influence would draw this man to the tombs or perhaps into the courtroom when molspini was ar raigned but in this he was disap pointed although the cooperation of the en tire detective and uniformed forces of the city was enlisted the case techni cally was in the hands of silent cass eager reporters sought him for news of the latest developments but as one star remarked in his story lieu tenant cass continues to have brilliant flashes of silence another in the un harnessed freedom of the editorial rooms complained gloomily that he could get nothing out of cass but si lenceand damn little of that in view of all this it is not strange that the record of the lieutenant should have become an object of curious in quiry nothing of outstanding bril liance was found in it from the day he had joined the force he had been taci turn to a point of eccentricity it was his own fellows in the clubhouse un der the green lamp who first dubbed him silent cass in the days of the old redlight district on the lower east ide he had been known as a relentless pursuer of cadets but he had never shared in the public glory of having cleaned out these worst of human vermin his pri vate life was found to be equally drab the triple murder in mulberry bend and uninteresting he owned a little home in the far reached of the bronx his wife was dead and his daughter now about eighteenkept house for him all this was water on gattys wheel while cass had been silent and color less the sergeant had always been gar rulous and spectacular now he was playing true to form hardly a day passed without some new development from this energetic and ambitious offi cer he combed the underworld for i suspects and dragged bloodied and di sheveled prisoners into headquarters for the lineup he was always on the eve of an important arrest the commissioner looked with toler ant if skeptical eye upon these activ ities and with growing impatience at the lieutenants failure to produce re sults in the midst of all this a reporter journeyed to the bronx with the dimly burning hope that he might be able to smoke cass out right in his own home he found the lieutenant in overalls spading the garden and young miss cass pruning the vines around the porch an ironic description of this bucolic scene was duly printed the next morning coupled with the news of an other important arrest by sergeant gatty then things began to happen around headquarters in a special order by the commis sioner lieutenant cass was reduced to the rank of patrolman and assigned to duty in the bronxwith a post at the zoological park this play to the gallery met with instant applause one smart paragrapher remarked that cass would find congenial companionship among his simian brethren in the zoo a few days later the promotion of sergeant gatty to the rank of lieutenant was announced molspini and a few other mysterious prisoners were transferred to the de tention house as material witnesses and the triple murder in mulberry bend began to wear down in public interest cass accepted his reduction without protest the day he had been caught in the garden was the first one he had taken off in a month but he did not urge the point instead he left his measure for a new uniform and soon was pounding the pavement around the buffalo entrance of the zoo the larger measure of leisure he enjoyed in his humbler task was spent in the garden with his daughter so things went on for another week one morning when silent cass was putting down his radishes a bronzed young man swung from the rear plat form of a trolley car directly in front of the house and walked briskly over to the fence cass looked up and nodded pleasantly is this lieutenant cass asked the stranger abruptly patrolman cass corrected the gar dener i want to give myself up said the stranger cass made a trench with his stick and sowed a handful of seed come in he said standing erect and looking squarely at the newcomer what have you been up to im the man who killed those three rats in mulberry bend explained the bronzed young man coolly cass bent down on one knee made another shallow little trench and sprin kled it with seed oh yes the mulberry bend case he said reflectively ive been expect ing you turning to his daughter he contin ued you dont mind leaving us alone for a few minutes do you nellie the girl smiled at the stranger and walked to the porch the triple murder in mulberry bend the policeman nodded toward a bench under a magnolia that was just bursting into blossom tell me about it he said as the two were seated if the newcomer found anything strange in this reception he made no sign i read in the papers that you had been broken for not finding the mur derer he said quietly and ive been off my feed and sleep since theni couldnt stand it any longer i want you to lock me up silent cass glanced at him swiftly the newcomer spoke up quickly no the ghosts of the dead men were not roosting on my pillowdamn them they were not the kind that come back to haunt honest men although they seem to have done it to youthat is in a way cass nodded i knew themtheyre snug at home in hell he looked toward the porch and nel lie smiled back at him im a service man myself resumed the stranger medical corpsi was on the other side for two years and it was during that time these three dogs earned their death over here the record of spanish louie the white slaver flashed through the mind of the listener girl he queried casually yes a girl the words snapped brokenly from the strangers lips it was the first sign of emotion that he had shown sweetheart i suppose murmured cass pityingly the young mans face had dropped into his hands and he was shaking vio lently worse than that he groaneda sister cass looked again toward the porch and laid his hand gently on the mans shoulder go on he said iv the tale came out in a torrent of an guished broken words the girl was an only sister and both had been or phaned since childhood out of his earnings as a chemist he had been able to support and educate her until he en tered the service and went abroad she was prettyhad a sweet soprano voice and a turn for the stage she had smothered his misgivings with the as surance that she was able to care for herself and so they had parted after he had been in france six months her letters always regular theretofore ceased abruptly again casss mind reverted to span ish joe the man on the bench had grown calm a gentle breeze swept through the tree overhead and a few blossoms fluttered downward if she had only died before it hap pened he said gazing at the broken petals cass patted him on the shoulder and he resumed it was a long time after i came back before i was able to trace herit was down in new orleansin a place that was worse than the deepest gulf of hell her mind and soul were gonegone completely with whisky and cocaine that and he pressed his hands over his eyes dad called the girl on the porch its time for you to go on post cass stood up mechanically and pulled off his overalls wait here until i get into uniform he said walking into the house he was gone fully five minutes but when he returned the young man was still seated on the bench the police the triple murder in mulberry bend man dropped to a place beside him with a trace of disappointment in his manner the young man had not seemed to notice the long absence i was able to get the story out of her before she finally broke away from me he continued then she ran up stairs and drank poison it was the i only thing left i brought her back here and buried her beside her mother there was a postcard picture taken at coney island in her trunk she was sitting in an automobile with spanish joe and tony molspini she was smiling in all the innocence that i had known before i left her his jaws came together with a snap it was on that day she got the theatri cal engagement with louie the lawyer posing as a producer of musical com edy how did you get them into the cel lar and what did you use to kill them asked cass prosily enough i palled with them for a month and let them win a months salary from me one night right down there in that hole they had it all arranged to trim me again when he paused and there was a sudden ferocity in his tone when he burst forth again the death i gave them was too easy i was watching across the street when they entered the store together when i saw a light in the cellar i knew i had them it was just a matter of walking in lifting the trapdoor and tossing down the flask of gas gas shouted cass jumping to his feet there was no trace of gas poi soning found in the examination of the organs it was a formula of my ownthe answer came with a touch of pridei had been working on it in france but the armistice came before the use of it became necessary the action is nega tiveabsorbs the oxygen from the air you know he chuckled grimly i simply sealed the three of them up with ita horned toad a centipede and a tarantula all in one bottle why did you make the finger prints the question seemed natural enough but the answer came in a tone of surprise i wanted to let the authorities know i had done the world a favorwhy not cass smiled approvingly and stood up the bronzed young man also got to his feet im ready he said on the way to the gate he drew an envelope from his pocket and handed it to the policeman cass read the con tents curiously under the caption army orders appeared a brief para graph captain franklin hines med ical corps is hereby relieved from duty at camp merritt and transferred to panama silent cass carefully folded the of ficial order put it back in the envelope and handed it to the army man assignment in the yellow fever squad eh he remarked when are you going to sail captain hines stared at him arent you going to arrest me he demanded stupidly dont you want to make good and get your old job back cass shook his head not at that price he said his hand was on the gatelatch and his eyes roaming down the street toward an ap proaching trolley car wait father called nellie from the porch she ran down into the gar den plucked a white crocus and pinned it to his coat against regulations he laughed but ive earned the right to wear it today in a moment he had bounded across the pavement and boarded the the triple murder in mulberry bend car leaving the army man and the girl together captain hines glanced down the street another car was coming wont you have a flower too asked the girl stooping to pluck a red blossom from the garden yes thank you he said huskily wont you give me a white onethe same as you gave to your dad she fastened a white flower in his coat and in a moment he was scrambling aboard the second car as the rear door slammed on him gatty swung off from the front and walked over to the fence nellie greeted him familiarly you just missed dad she said hes gone out on post oh has he said gatty i just came out here to tell him that i got an other promotion todayim captain gatty now in the next number of the black mask daughter of the pigeon by harry

before i left sourdoughs place on the nineteenth the professor sat silent for a sec ond there is something wrong with your story blake the nearest route over the mountains from here is by way of chicahoochie pass which would make the distance from this point to sourdough jamisons cabin a matter of over a hundred and fifty miles this is the twentyfifth of june a well man couldnt do it it is an impossibility for you to have made it in five days in your weakened condition not that i wish to dispute your word but the sick man smiled wanly dont you see professor that your own state ment helps to support my story i tell you that i wandered into an undiscov ered route through the mountains you say that you picked me up half an hour ago lying exhausted and unconscious a few rods from your camp that being the case the entrance to the valley where dead men live on this side of the range must be near at hand youll say im crazy when i tell you that i have seen living dead men dead men who do not know that they are dead can you imagine it no nei ther could i if i had not seen it myself ive been through the valley of the living dead and came out alive ive seen themliving dead menby the millions and millions fighting stab bing shootingtearing at each others throats like maddened beasts and beasts they are maddened by blood blood flows in rivers in the valley where the dead men live its the rage they were in when they died they carried it on with them beyond the grave and theyre fighting it out in there cant you hear the rumble of can non listen you think that its thunder but its not and those flashes that you notice just over the brow of the mountain the flashes of the big guns manspirit guns no no its not lightning im telling you the truth i know that you think im insane i dont blame you he stopped suddenly his nostrils di lating take a whiff of that breeze b maug the valley where dead men live professor dont you smell anything parmalee sniffed the air from the mountains does have a peculiar acrid odor its reminiscent of something gunpowder by george thats what it is somebody must have fired a weapon close at hand and yet why didnt we hear the report the scientist gazed out of the tent door it was none of my party they are all accounted for yet i could have sworn that there was not another hu man being within fifty miles blake smiled again i merely called it to your attention professor so that you would give more credence to my story it is so strangethis story of the living deadthat it will stretch your imagination to the utmost i am a sick man i doubt if i survive the day you as a scientific man may be able to discover the solution of the puzzle perhaps you may even be able to do something to help release those poor devils in there from the tie of ha tred that is binding them to this earth at any rate i would like to tell you my yarn if you care to listen just give me another sip of that moose broth will you raising the sick mans head profes sor parmalee fed him a small quantity of the warm soup then he sat down again beside the cot in an attitude of attention ii you are going to put me down as the greatest liar since the world began blake said wearily yet every word that i tell you is the absolute truth my mind was never clearer than at the present time so dont think that what i say to you is the raving of a disor dered brain either you have heard the theory advanced by believers in spiritualism that some people who die suddenly persist in keeping in touch with the earth while others go directly on to their reward i have seen enough to provebut i di gress my time is short let me start at the beginning when the war broke out i at tempted to enlist but was rejected on account of my physical condition nerves but i finally succeeded in hooking up with the red cross and got over i was gassed and later got a dose of shell shock you know what that means nerves pure and simple it is needless to tell you that i suffered all of the torments of hell so well pass that up and go on i landed in the states a physical wreck the doctors sent me to the mountains i am a wealthy man but it suited my mood to travel light and alone i wandered here and there un til i finally reached this north country i studied geology once and while i dont need the money i decided to do a little prospecting a week or so ago i reached the cabin of sourdough jamison having canoed up the river nearly two hundred miles i remained with the old man three days resting up then announced my inten tion of striking out directly into the mountains jamison tried his best to dissuade me he claimed that the in dians had a legend that there was a val ley located somewhere in the middle of the range which was the abiding place of spiritsthe valley where dead men live they called itand that no body who entered it ever came back alive ive been through it and im out of it but im no better than a dead man so the old legend holds good but i hope when i do pass out that my soul can rest in peace god i dont want to spend an eternity in that hell hole back yonder i will not bore you with the details of my trip up the mountainsfor i started early next morning in spite of was i dead i raised myself on my elbows and looked about me for an instant i imagined that i was back in flanderspage the valley where dead men live jamisons objections that night i camped half way up the side of the range next morningthat would be four days agoi chanced upon a little canyon that wound in and out among the rocks there were signs of gold and i determined to explore it thor oughly before going further as i continued the air grew colder from somewhere ahead came a dull in describable roar i put it down to a waterfall somewhere in the distance suddenly after a two hours tramp i reached the end of the narrow path way and found myself on the edge of a steep decline ice covered slipperya veritable man trapwhich seemed to surround a huge deep basin the en tire place was buried under a pall of smoke which hid everything from view on all sides rose the mountains rugged their peaks covered with snow offering an impassable barrier the path by which i had entered seemed to be the only means of getting in or out up out of the basin there came to my ears a steady rumbling booming the air was filled with it the earth seemed to tremble under my feet at fre quent intervals sometimes the noise would die out for a second only to start again with renewed violence there was nothing to be frightened at yet i confess that the goose pimples came to the surface and i felt the icy chills run up and down my spine my hair stood up like the quills of a porcupine the very atmosphere seemed filled with despairwith a vague something the human mind could not grasp suddenly the wind brought to my ears a shout then came the shrill piercing agonized scream of a woman a shriek that was filled with terror and helplessness again and again it assailed my ears shouting in answer i ran along the edge of the precipice looking for a pathway that would lead me to the rescue of her who called as i ran along the narrow shelf of ice i threw off my heavy pack and car ried only my rifle then i slipped and lost my footing my gun flew from my grasp i struggled to save myself but without avail over the slippery edge i sliddowndowndown it seemed to me that i rolled for miles there was absolutely nothing which i could grasp to stop my wild plunge nothing but iceiceicecold and smooth as glass faster and faster i went until my speed was that of an express train i almost lost consciousness i could not think suddenly i struck the bottom with a force that knocked me sense less iii i was awakened from my stupor by a peculiar rattattat that sounded like the rattle of a drum i opened my eyes the air was filled with acrid smoke it hung over me like a great gray blanket was i dead i raised myself on my elbows and looked about me for an instant i imagined that i was back in flanders then i remem bered my fall but where was i the ground was covered with bod ies heaped up in grotesque attitudes lying in oddshaped piles it was a ver itable charnel housea page torn from dantes inferno and such bodies peculiar transparent crystalline i could see through them as one looks through a heavy plateglass heavens it was horriblehideous and blood blood everywhere the air rang with shrieks and groans and laughterwild haunting laughter that froze the mar row in my bones close beside me a machinegun was rattling served by a sergeant and two privates wearing the olive drab all three were of the same peculiar grayish cast of pellucidness as were the bodies lying around on all sides guns were the valley where dead men live booming the ground rocked beneath them was i dreaming was i the victim of a horrible nightmare in which my subconscious mind was again living the scenes i had gone through across the seas i pinched myself to make sure i was at a loss for an explanation i shook like an aspen leaf i was filled with supernatural terror then something happened that gave me a better light on the matter just at my right was a small knoll scarred and pitted with machinegun nests through the drab smoky haze i could see the illfitting german uniforms on the men who manned them across the gap which separated them from me a man was crawlingdragging himself along on hands and knees he turned his head toward me for an instant i recognized howard prestin an old frienda captain of infantry who had been killed in the argonne after silen cing a number of german guns which had stopped the american advance did he still live but no i had seen his body the day it was buried was i crazy my head whirled i was unable to move so transfixed was i by what was going on around me suddenly i saw prestin leap for ward a dozen guns opened on him yet they failed to stop him i saw him fire from the hip then he leaped among the germans with the buttend of his rifle a second later he hurled the weapon aside and drawing his au tomatic from its holster he sprang into a second nest the man seemed to bear a charmed life the germans swarmed over him time after time but after each effort he emerged trium phant his clothes hung on him in tat ters he was bleeding from a dozen wounds his face was a red smear through which his eyes gleamed like burning coals a german officera great hulking blond manfired a pistol pointblank at him it failed to stop his rush both reached for their trench knives they came together locked in a death struggle their weapons plying like mad slowly the german dropped to the ground a peculiar dazed look on his flat round face prestin turned wear ily away and beckoned as if waving for his men to move forward then he crumpled up and fell forward across his victims body then i knew the truththe horrible truth the legend of the indians was not fiction this was the valley where dead men lived here men who could not break their earthly ties came back to fight on and on until their berserker rage had expended itself here they were enacting over and over again the final tragedy of their lives god it was the most diabolical thing that the human mind could imagine think of it all over that vast plain in the midst of that icebound valley similar tragedies were being enacted by mendead men wraiths were grap pling here there and everywhere the peculiar feature of it all was that i seemed to be able to see each individual feat of valor at the same time although they were transpiring over miles of ter ritory it was like looking at an im mense moving picture which unreeled itself before me i can liken it to noth ing better than one of the huge old fashioned panoramas that were in vogue a few years after the civil war some few of which still remain in southern cities i seemed to be floating over the entire basin the guns seemed to be real guns shooting real bullets the cannon were the monsters of steel that i had seen in france yet i swear that several times i pissed directly through barrages unscathed the weapons like the men who served them were only phantoms god in heaven it was the most the valley where dead men live horrible scene of carnage i have ever witnessedmore awful than the hell of france and belgium for every detail was the result of the terrible ire under which the combatants labored when they met their death as fast as they had played their parts they started in at the beginning and went through it again and again over and over like automa tonsheld to their posts by a divine decree of some kind words fail me it was so unspeak ably ghastly weirda futurist night marea bedlam of noise and confusion a kaleidoscopic phantasmagoria of light and color death walked every where remember professor on a battlefield the men do not die in great numbers and lie around in heaps hours dayssometimes weekspass without carnage even in the heat of conflict only a small percentage of those engaged meet death here it was dif ferent for miles in every direction there was deathdeathdeath noth ing but cold stark deathdeath and blood explain i cant my idea is as i stated before that man must work out his own salvationthat those who died in the heat of anger must work that hatred off before their spirits can quit this earth god in his infinity wis dom did not care to inflict the horror upon the entire world so he set aside this barren hole as a place where dead men might sever the ties which bind them here and with their passion cooled pass on to a better life no the man never lived who could describe itthat cold icebound hell the air tingled with madness and the look of awful malignancy on the faces of those poor souls as they went on and on and on through the same monoto nous performance of killing and being killed it was butchery the place was a slaughterhouse ah the deeds of valor that i saw performed wonder ful magnificent history will never be able to record the actual happenings the coldblooded bravery through the hazy heavens phantom aeroplanes manned by ghostly pilots dipped and maneuvered dodgingfall ing to the earth in tangled masses often burning gigantic balloons in flames tossed amidst the clouds among a heap of stonesthe re mains of what had once been a tiny church located in the center of an an cient graveyarda sniper carried on his nefarious trade his hidingplace a tomb from which the bodies had been hurled aside i saw a group approach the place grim determination written on their faces their beloved colonel had been a victim of the snipers bullets they found him after a long search a youngsterhe had been the colonels orderlyleaped upon him a knife plunged updownupdown slowly monotonously while the screams of him into whose body it was sinking made the night hideous and when he had completed his work on that dead thing with the glassy eyes that gazed upward unseeingly the youngster calmly wiped his weapon upon the tunic of the vanquished foe oh the look of vengeance that was upon the countenances of that little group a shell came screaming through the heavens they attempted to dodge to cover but too late and so the awful drama went on and on and on there is no rest for those who dwell in the valley where dead men live men fought with the ferocity of wild beasts they were blood mad frenzied a little detachment of eng lishmen were laboring with automatic rifles just at the edge of a woods in front of them was a tiny vale through which wound a sunken road on the opposite side of the valley was another thicket in which were a seemingly equal number of germans it was a duel the valley where dead men live to the death between the two groups both seemed to exhaust their ammuni tion at the same time by what ap peared to be mutual consent they left their guns and charged at each other meeting in the middle of that once peaceful little dell there were not over twenty men on either side grappling they fought hand to hand using knives clubs stones their revolvers their bare hands they were like cavedwellers giving no quarter and asking none at the end there was no one left on either side only a heap of dead and dying when it was all over the dead arose and again went through the monoto nous performance iv i was hypnotized held by a spell i could not break try as i would i seemed unable to drag myself away from the ghastly sights i dont know how long i remained in the valley of horrors you say it was four days look at my hairsnow white when i left sourdoughs cabin my locks were dark i am just past thirty years of age yet from my appearance one would swear that i had passed the three score years and ten allotted to man i have not slept for the hellish panorama continued on and on and on only at night a different group of actors filled the stage the darkness was hideous with the roar of the big guns the screech of shells signal rockets filled the air as if by magic trenches appeared here and therelit tle sectors each with its own melan choly drama of life and death here was a stretch of no mans land with its grisly tenants men hung on barbed wire entanglements their clothes in tat ters swaying to and fro in the breeze like scarecrows in a farmers field often i lost consciousnessfainted i suppose much of the time i wan dered about in a daze i knew not which way to turn dead menliving dead meneverywhere i dragged myself into a tiny house that seemed to stand in the center of the valley it was empty i threw myself on the floor thinking to gain a minutes respite from the horrors around me i dropped into a deep sleep i was awakened by the sound of voices i crouched farther back in the darkness of the corner frightened not daring to make a move what was i afraid of i do not know one need not fear spectres need he there was a sound of a match being scratched and then a candle flared up by its uncertain light i made out the figures of two men wearing the german uni form they groped about until they found a trap door cut in the floor raising it they lowered themselves through the opening seized by some impulse which even now i am unable to explain i de termined to follow them the events that transpired are inexplicable to me the only solution that i have for the puzzle is that for the time being i was someone elsesome poor devil who lost his life in the attempt to avert a german surprise on verdun for i swear that i was propelled by some force stronger than my own will cautiously i waited until i heard their voices trailing off in the distance then i sprang to the trap and a sec ond later dropped through into the darkness of the cellar i stumbled about until i found the wall following it with my hands i came to an opening far ahead in the darkness i saw a tiny speck of light bobbing up and down it was the candle carried by the men i was follow ing without thought of the future i followed in their wake the valley where dead men live on on on they went then sud denly the passageway widened out into a huge cavern relying on the dark ness i crept closer until i was only a few yards away from them hiding behind a huge pile of boxes and barrels heaped up at one side i listened to their conversation at first i was un able to understand what they were about to do then with a muttered shhh one of them cautiously drew aside a small block of what appeared to be solid rock and peeping out over my hidingplace i gazed through the little opening into a brilliantlylighted passageway i caught a glimpse of uniforms through the opening came scraps of conversation in french the truth flashed over me i was looking into the underground defenses of verdun the germans had tun neled up to them and were waiting only for the minute that the defenders were the fewest to break down the thin bar rier which held them back and throw their hordes into the very vitals of the french defense even as the thought came to me the watcher closed the opening softly and with a muttered word to his companion lighted a lantern and waved it across his body like a signal torch and a signal it was for instantly a distant whistle sounded then lights leaped up as far as the eye could see and from the distance came the tramp tramp tramp of marching feet i forgot that i was dealing with phantoms the thing was too horribly real i searched about me for a weapon for some way to warn the unsuspecting men on the other side of that frail par tition in the semidarkness to which i was rapidly growing accustomed my eyes fell upon an open box it was heaped up with hand grenades i made out the markings of other boxes i almost shouted for joy for the pile was a huge ammunition dump placed there by the invaders in readiness for the crucial moment seizing a grenade in either hand i pulled the pins with my teeth and held them in readiness closer and closer came the german hordes the whole cavern and passageway was filled with them there were thousands it seemed the air was thick and heavy with the odor of their sweat thep just as the head of the column reached me i hurled the bombsnot at the advancing en emy but straight into the big pile of ammunition the leaders heard me saw me they came at me with a rush the ground trembled a con cussion i felt myself being hurled through the air around me rang screams and cries of mortal agony then came oblivion there is nothing more that i can tell you how i came here i have no recollection evidently my mind a blank i found some exit on this side of the valley i only know that you found me here outside my secret is yours as a man of science you will probably try to find the way into the place from which i have come take my advice and stay away now i am tired pro fessor i must rest v extract from the report of pro fessor phineas parmalee ab lld etc mr blake passed away shortly after com pleting his strange narrative the members of the parmalee scientific expedition spent nearly a week searching the vicinity in the hope of discovering the opening through which he came from the valley but our efforts were fruitless i would be tempted to put his story of the valley where dead men live down as an hallucination resulting from his terrible experiences during the war but for one thing i sent a courier by way of chicahoochie pass to interview jamison the letter says that the date given by blake was correct he crossed the mountains as he stated in five days i confess myself puzzled we buried poor blake where we found him requiescat in pace the strange story of martin colby by ward sterling this is martin colbys story not mine three of us heard him tell itwilloughby the eminent english clergyman who is now filling a number of lec ture engagements in this country mosby the attorney and myself and we are all firmly convinced that he spoke the truth i write it just as he gave it to us we were spending a few days in early spring at mosbys country place possibly the weather had some thing to do with the way the story impressed us it was a dark stormy night with drizzling gusts of rain and a shrieking howling wind that shook the window panes and whistled and moaned through the leafless treesone of those nights that make the shivers run up and down your backbone in pleasurable anticipation of the scare that never comesa night created especially for tales of yawning graves and spiritual mani festations seated in front of the huge open fireplace in mosbys big living room a room so large that there were shadows in every cornerit was only natural that the talk should drift onto haunted houses life after death and the supernatural in all its varying phases mosby who is something of an amateur psychologist had been read ing sir oliver lodge sir arthur doyle and other writers on spiritual lines and was filled with enthusiasm and a working idea of ouija boards spirit rappings and table tipping on the other hand willoughby like most clergyman was an opgn scoffer the argument continued for an hour or two without result finally colby who had been listening and saying nothing was ap pealed to there is no question in my mind he answered weighing his words carefully as he always does when he speaks seriously that our departed friends watch over us and given half a chance will offer us a helping hand bosh shouted the clergyman give us proofs man dont deal in generalities offer us something tangible colby hesitated before answering what i am about to tell you he said finally is a true story i have never repeated it to anyone before because i do not care to have people doubt my wordand the average man is prone to scoff at what he can not understand to me there is only one explanationthat of spirit inter vention perhaps you as a clergy man with a supposedly better knowl edge of the hereafter than is given us ordinary mortals can offer a solution to the puzzle and this is the story that martin colby told the strange story of martin colby ii i was suffering from brain fag the novel on which i was at workmy latest by the waythreatened to be a dismal failure as a result for weeks i had not touched the type writer lacking ideas to put on paper my publishers were clamoring for the manuscript the book had been announced through the press and the advance royalties were already banked to my credit i owed it to them as well as myself to bring my work to a close but i was dissatisfied the plot itself wasthe best thing that i had ever done but the story lacked that indescribable something that marks the really finished product from the machinemade drivel it sounded forced and strained in other words it had no punch and my heroine heavens what a woman she had as much life as a wilted rag doll anyone who is familiar with my work knows that i write of the wilds the prairies the forests the icy bar rens but this story was to be a de parture it was to be a tale of human emotionsa drama seething with passion and depicting the under side of life among the dwellers of the great city but my heroine was to be a woman of the northland trans planted from her native snows and ice hedged in on all sides by wicked ness yet keeping herself clean and pure in spite of her surroundings i wanted to make her a girl of un usual strength of character one who dominated every page of the book and held the readers undivided love rather than the insipid whitelivered anaemic who wandered through the story like an automaton but in spite of everything i was unable to concentrate on herto inject any life into her every writer has such ex periences at times i have had them before and i expect to have them again and then one afternoon like a bolt of lightning out of a clear sky came a working streak i tackled the story with renewed vim and enthusi asm for hours i wrote and rewrote hacked and edited from somewhere in the hidden recesses of my brain evolved a new heroineedith mor leya sweetfaced golden haired fullbreasted redblooded womana lovable girl and a true daughter of the vikings i love so well far into the night i worked under my flying thoughts edith morley grew developing with every change blossoming forth into radiant womanhood i tell you i was ob sessed with her and gentlemen without egotism i say frankly that she became so real to me that she walks through the pages of my book a living pulsating character instead of a creature of my imagination but as for that you can judge for your selves when the story comes out next month i forgot dinner everything in the enthusiasm of my work i have no idea how long i worked it was far into the night and sometime during the evening i had automatically switched on the lights but finally flesh and blood could stand it no longer i fell across the table my head pillowed in my arms whether i fainted or whether it was the sleep following exhaustion i do not pre tend to say was i really asleep i do not know ill swear that i could hear the clock ticking in the adjoining room and the thousandandone other odd mysterious little sounds that come in the middle of the night yet i must have been asleep there is no other explanation then suddenly he launched himself at her what a fight she put up to keep him from herpage the strange story of martin colby suddenly i heard a screama piercing terrorstricken shriek coming out of the darkness of the night edith morley stood before me have you ever seen a poor hunted creature at bay she was panting desperately her arms were out stretched towards me her fingers working convulsively her dress was torn so that a glimpse of the round white shoulder showed in her eyes was a look of despair of helpless appeal her long golden hair hung about her waist in tangled disarray i knew that she was asking me for help i attempted to arouse myself from the horrible paralyzing constriction that held me to my chair but i was helpless bound down by invisible bands and then into the focus leaped a mana human beasta thicklipped coarsefeatured creature with snap ping black eyes that glowered and blazed between red swollen lids and a bluishdark growth of whisker that only served to emphasize the brutal viciousness of his undershot lower jaw i tell you he was a creature straight from the inferno at sight of the girl the bestial lips parted showing a glimpse of de caying tobaccostained teeth he raised one black hairy hand and beckoned the girl drew back a trifle further the look of desperation kindled anew in her eyes one white slender hand pressed against her pal pitating breast as heaven is my witness i saw that tragedy unfold itself in front of my eyes with all the vividness of a motion picture thrown upon the screen i struggled with every bit of strength at my command to tear my self loose from the invisible hands that glued me to my chair but in vain i watched the beast slowly drawing himself forward like a snake about to strike i could not move nearer and nearer he came passing so close to me that i could smell his whiskeyandtobaccoladen breath moving with catlike stealth and as he approached her she drew farther and farther away until she found her back against the wall her wild blue eyes looked into mine tense with fear desperateand i was helpless god the sweat poured from every pore in my body then sud denly he launched himself at her what a fight she put up to keep him from her striking clawing biting she was like a wounded tigress at bay her waist was torn into shreds on the white flesh of her arms the bruises stood out with startling vividness with an almost superhuman effort she twisted herself from his grasp and leaped away once more he drove her into a corner again that look of piteous appeal to me then be fore he could seize her again her con vulsive fingers reached into the bosom of her dress and returned with a tiny bottle on which the deaths head showed a brilliant scarlet under the electric lamp before she could convey it to her mouth the beast was upon her his talons tightened about her wrist she battled now with the energy of de spair backward he bent her arm un til i listened for the snap that tells of the agony of broken bones but again through some strange twist of fate she tore herself from his grasp her freedom was but for an instant yet it was long enough for her to carry the tiny vial to her lips then she crumpled up in a little heap on the floor and gentlemen i will swear that there was a smile of happiness on her face the strange story of martin colby i awoke with a start for a second i gazed about me wideeyed trying to collect myself even in the midst of my own apartments then with every nerve tingling in response to some psychic force i rushed out of the building into the blackness of the night of course up to this point you will simply say that i had been dreamingthat so strong an impres sion had the character of my brain made upon me that it was a case of selfhypnosis wait until you have heard my story to the end it will prove to you if your minds are open that there is some unknown subtle force at work in our behalf of which we know nothing to me the only explanation is that our loved ones who have gone before us are con stantly seeking to serve us if we will but give them the opportunity that edith morley was a real woman of flesh and blood i am wil ling to testify i never saw her until i met her in my dream vision or whatever you care to call it yet i had described her accurately even to her little traits of character hours be fore when my sudden working streak had brought her into my story it may have been telepathy but to me it was the work of the unseen forces i have just mentioned i will show you that she had been thinking of me at the very minute i was writing of heror at least there is no doubt of it in my mind and too my mind was open to suggestion but i digress drawn by unseen hands i walked on and on through the blackness of the night until i reached an un familiar part of the city i swear that i had never been in that vicinity before yet i knew exact ly where to turn and what streets to take i am not a sleep walker i have a perfect recollection of making that long trip across the town and on foot mind you yet i am certain that i was not fully awake i was more in the condition of a man in a daze my feet carried me to the door of a battered old brick tenement house i climbed up four flights of stairs rickety and dirty lighted by smoky kerosene lamps i had no idea where i was going yet unseen hands were guiding me pulling me along when ever i seemed to hesitate before one of the doors on the fourth floor i stopped i rapped receiving no answer i opened the door and entered sheedith morleythe girl of my dreamlay in a crumpled heap on the floor every detail even to the torn dress and the dark bruises on her white flesh was just as it had appeared in my dream scattered about near where she had fallen were the pieces of glass from the broken bottle on one of them the deaths head grinned up at me as if chuckling at the grimness of it all the pungent odor of bitter almonds filled the air in the corner stood a battered old dresser tucked in the cracked mir ror was my picture clipped from a newspaper review of one f my books below it was spread a letter face upwards it read i have done everything pos sible to fight off the inevitable death is all that remains i am without money and without friends if twiggs comes again tonight i will kill myself please notify mr martin colby the nov elist he knows the northmy north he does not know me but i would like him to know that i died like a true daughter of gods countrythe land we both love so well the strange story of martin colby iii colby arose and stretched his long arms above his head if you care for further proof i have the letter that she left behind for a second there was silence then willoughby broke the strain was she colby nodded and said we never learned her name i paid the expenses of her funeral and for the headstone over her grave on it i had carved the only name i knew her by edith morley and beneath it i had these words engraved she left the world as clean as she came into it in the next number black shadows by j c kofoed where the span splits by sam heilman i tomorrow at a m i shall have reached the end of my thirtyfifth year i have prepared a program for the morning that i have well considered for fifteen years at i shall arise and breakfast with good appetite from to i shall occupy myself in filling the bathtub and regulating the temperature of the water it will take at least fourteen minutes to get the exact warmth desired something between and degrees fahrenheit having completed this task to my satisfaction i shall go into the liv ing room place a

required tem perature i shall climb into the tub with a razor i shall cut the arteries in both wrists this will be done at exactly the hour of my birth and the end of my thirtyfifth year i shall lie back contentedly and laugh my body and the water be ing in caloric harmony there will be no pain this i have learned of the romans who of all men know best how to live splendidly and die luxuriously to the compassionate music of the elegy i shall glide and melt into the infinite with the quiet smile of a victor for i shall have defeated the law of compensation beaten it as it never has been

when i was twelve years old my where the span splits father died he was in the thirty sixth year at the time he had been ill for many months with a malady that must have been extremely pain ful his groans broke into my sleep at all hours of the night i often heard him plead with the doctor for morphine if i only could die he moaned in his agony i remember the sufferings of my mother as she nursed him she had been a pretty and joyous creature birt in those dreadful months the pink in her cheeks fled before a dead sallowness the eyes that had once laughed and sparkled with the joy of living lay drearily deep be hind dark circles the lustre de parted from her hair a hopeless stoop came into her shoulders and the shuffle of despond into her feet i think i was glad when my father died i cried at the funeral not because of his passing but be cause of her he had left behind that broken crushed mother of mine at twelve one is not given much to speculation or introspection yet i wondered why had my father been tormented so his death i understood clearly that was mere ly the end and i knew that all things had to end but why the torture of his last hours he had been a kindhearted gentle soul considerate and self sacrificing he had worked hard for mother and me he had given of his substance to the needy and bent a shoulder to the feeble his life had been clean and wholesome yet he had been smitten with flaming darts i could think of no reason six months afterwards my mother died she too suffered greatly i know but so weak was she in spirit and body that no voice was left loud enough to cry her agony my wonder increased why had she been smitten so i went to live with my fathers brother uncle john was thin and inclined to irritability yet he treated me with much kindness unsmiling but very real i remember one evening when aunt susan had sharply called me in from play to my neglected studies he had said let the boy alone with his fun later on he will have troubles enough dont rob him of his blessed childhood and he had sighed there were two other members of the family one a boy about my age goodnatured and full of ani mal spirits the other an older sister of aunt susan a sweettempered selfeffacing little woman who had been born a cripple one leg was shorter than the other congenital hipdisease they called it i grew very fond of aunt stella uncle john was troubled with dyspepsia after each cautious meal he took pills they didnt seem to help him much for i still recall his distress on the few oc casions when he grew reckless and tasted of forbidden things i re member the halfsorrowful half envious look in his eyes as he watched george and me romp around the place slide down the balustrades and in other boyish ways give ear to the call of strident vitality within us the wistful eyes that observed us as we gorged at meal times come vividly before me even now one winters day when the side walks were icily slick aunt stella fell on the sidewalk and hurt her bad hip there was an operation where the span splits gangrene and finally the great emancipation uncle i said three days after the funeral why did aunt stella suffer so he seemed startled for a moment then he answered my boy when you are about twice as old as you are now you will understand it is the law of com pensation we all must pay for wrhat we take out of life i questioned him further but he would not pursue the subject i didnt sleep much that night my mind was racing with the problem of compensation but making little headway in the course of a rest less doze i dreamed that angels and demons were fighting for the pos session of my body the angels seemed to be hopelessly outnum bered and were getting the worst of it when suddenly they came over to the side of the demons and joined them sticking knives and pitchforks into me ii life at uncle johns soon re turned to its normal gait george and i again romped all over the place although i felt myself a bit subdued and prone to spells of puzzled re flection my uncles attacks of dyspepsia continued and aunt susan complained almost constant ly of feeling poorly without any definite ailment as far as i could learn we had many visitors mostly they were men and women in the late thirties and forties although much of the conversation was be yond me i liked to sit quietly in the large living room and listen to the callers i believe it was during this period that my views relative to the law of compensation took coherent shape while my fosterparents friends discussed every subject under the sun there was one topic upon which each and all spoke fluently and often their ailments everybody seemed to have something the matter with him or her mrs austin had neu ralgia mr hawkins had a heart lesion mr swift suffered from con stant inexplicable pains in the back mrs steffens brooded about an in cipient goitre mr holliday was wor ried with a tenacious cough and mrs taylors stoutness preyed on her mind of all the visitors my favorite was john shelton a school principal he had no particular malady except that his eyes gave him trouble he com plained that they hurt when he read at night mr shelton i said to him one evening when we happened to be alone in the living room do all people get sick when they get to be thirty or thereabouts he laughed goodnaturedly thats a funny question of course not why is it then i asked that people of that age are always talk ing about their ailments or look ing worried theres you for ex ample why arent you happy all the time like i am oh youre young he replied you have no cares no responsibili ties theres nothing to keep you from being contented twentyfour hours in the day thats what i thought re plied as you grow older you get the things that make you unhappy thats the way of life he an swered soberly take my advice young man and get all the pleasure you can out of your boyhood the b maug where the span splits sweetness of living is now yours suddenly he turned with a laugh and said paul do you know where your heart is certainly and i struck my left side with the hand youre wrong he smiled its here he pointed to a spot three inches to the right of the place i had indicated and two inches lower know where your stomach is i showed him where i thought it was apparently i knew less about the stomach than i did about the heart i was somewhat ashamed and told shelton that we had just started the study of anatomy at high school books will never tell you just where your vital organs are he said and the longer you remain in ignorance the better off you will be when you do learn exactly where your stomach is it will be the finger of pain pointing it out suffering is the perfect instructor in anatomy just at that time other callers arrived and the questions trembling on the point of my tongue went un asked afterward he avoided the sub ject of anatomy iii the next three years passed rapid ly happy joyous unrestrained years my plan of life was rapidly develop ing i was determined to squeeze out of existence every drop of happi ness it contained before the location of my heart was known to me with exactness when i was not playing i ob served men and women along novel lines i read faces for signs of con tent and unhappiness i fell into the habit of checking up the number of times i had seen this or that in dividual in a month how many times he had been smiling how many times he had been frowning how often he had appeared at ease how often worried i did not let these studies interfere with my main program i sought enjoyment with almost hysterical insistence i would permit nothing to depress me nothing to divert me from my pur pose at eighteen i was sent to college because knowledge came easily i was a good student had it been otherwise i would have quit the pursuit of learning and sought less strenuous occupation i had a roommate arthur gates a jolly harumscarum rich mans son who worshipped at the shrine of play as feverishly as i although he was not lacking in serious mo ments he was dumfounded i know when i told him my secret we had been in the history lec ture class together that afternoon when the instructor suddenly turned pale clutched his coat lapel and fell at the foot of his desk he was a man of about forty and seemingly had been in good health we helped take him home i learned that he was a sufferer from angina pectoris an unusually painful affliction of the heart in our room that evening gates mentioned the instructors illness that could never happen to me i remarked why he asked have you a guarantee on your heart no i answered slowly but i shall not live that long what are you talking about duckworth isnt over fortyfive when my fortyfifth birthday comes around i replied calmly i know i will have been dead ten years where the span splits gates laughed been to see a fortune teller he jeered no but on the day that i finish my thirtyfifth year i shall kill my self how do you know asked my roommate that you wont get angina before youre thirtyfive i dont but its hardly likely the percentage is in my favor gates was beginning to be im pressed with the fact that i was serious he gazed at me with puzzled eyes arthur i said i want you to listen to me for a few moments what i am about to tell you i have told to no other person and will tell to no other person i feel that i must unbosom myself to someone will you listen seriously he nodded i went on i am now twentyone years old i have excellent health plenty of money no troubles domestic or otherwise and what are regarded as excellent prospects yet i tell you in cold blood that at a m on april th i shall end my life that will be the exact hour of my birth thirtyfive years before just how i shall do it i do not yet know naturally i shall take the least pain ful and least unpleasant way but why interrupted gates who had been watching me with strange fascination that i replied will develop in the course of what i am about to tell you understand i am not try ing to influence you in any way i know that you will not agree with me when i was a boy my father and mother both died in great agony i can see them now gray with torture their pallid features furrowed with the lines of suffering and the per spiration of pain on their foreheads i can still hear my father pleading for deathdeath that stood outside the door leeringly biding its time afterwards i lived for many years at the home of an uncle there i saw more suffering i began ask ing myself these questionsis life worth living if so how long should one live when do the tears of existence begin to outweigh the smiles at what point in the span do the joys of carrying on no longer balance the sorrows in seeking answers to my inter rogations i made a close and de tailed study of scores of men and women i watched their faces and searched their souls i have con tinued the researches at college coldly scientifically i have tables and charts and masses of statistics and the conclusions i reached by ob servation have been borne out by analysis and precise data and my conclusion is this the average life after thirtyfive is not worth living i saw a why trembling on gates lips and went on the span of human life is seventy years in the first thirtyfive we sow in the other thirtyfive we reap it is the law of compensation the pleasures and enjoyment of existence are freely bestowed in the first half of the span but the bills begin com ing in with the thirtysixth year i have made up my mind not to pay when the collector comes i will be out my roommate shook his head thats certainly a bizarre theory he said its not theory i returned its a fact a grim irresistible fact as i told you i have reached my con elusions by way of scientific re search but how asked gates i dont understand where the span splits for example i replied i have gone to a man of thirtyseven night aftet night for a month and reviewed the entire day with him i have tabu lated the whole of his waking hours under three headsjoy sorrow neutral under the first caption i have listed everything no matter how trivial that afforded the subject content or satisfaction under sor row i have scheduled every disap pointment every ache every annoy ance no matterjaow pettyevery thing he had hoped would not hap pen and so on under neutral i have put these things that could not properly be classed under either of the other headings and the result in the particular case i am speak ing of there were twie as many no tations under sorrow as there were under joy i conducted my inquiries with a great number of men and women over a long period and the results were about the same with younger persons it was just the re verse the dividing line seemed to be just at thirtyfive between thirty and thirtyfive the joys and sorrows about balanced with a great number of notations in the neutral column under thirty the joys and neutrals seemed to have the field pretty well to themselves often of course the law of compensation begins operating lightly and years may elapse before the victim notices that he is being dunned for payment but settlement must be made and it is made through the body through those held dear through ambition pride vanity through everything that is cherished and clung to but i am going to dance and leave without paying the piper gates listened quietly to my con clusion and with serious expression after a moment of silence he said the ordinary person would laugh at you paul and call you crazy but i believe that i understand you boyhood sorrows have merely dis torted your views of life i have no doubt of your sincerity and i do not question that right now you believe that you will kill yourself when you are thirtysix permit me as a friend to doubt it i venture to say that you will be married in be the father of several children and would blush and stammer like a schoolgirl if i should happen along and repeat what you have just told me you are young and in the next fifteen years your conception of life will undergo a radical series of changes no arthur i returned i shall not change my mind i propose to enjoy the time i have allowed myself to the utmost at the end of that period you will read of my deathif you havent forgotten all about me thats all lets go down town have a few drinks and see a show gates was glad to go i never mentioned the subject of my plans to him again during some of our boisterous celebrations i often caught a queer smile in his eyes but he said nothing after graduation we separated gates went to his home in california while i moved to new york for a few years we corresponded in a loose fashion and then lost touch i lived up to my set program with a generous income i was able to do about what i pleased i went where i wished ate and drank what and where i wanted and did little work except that connected with looking after my property i re mained free of serious love entangle ments my health continued excel where the span splits lent and i had no worries i do not recall an ache or a pain or a severe disappointment in fifteen years there was a girlher name is of no momenta girl of wondrous beauty and celestial character who did stagger my resolution for a brief spell when i felt myself weaken ing i went to bellevue hospital where i knew a house surgeon and walked through the wards the law of compensation was operating on high gear that evening i finished my tour had a good laugh and never saw her again so this is the last night i feel strangely happy for my final re past i have ordered a royal gorge i shall dine heartily at midnight and drink many a glass of rare vintage to the vanquished law of compen sation then to bed for a few hours of calm rest after that tomorrow morning and iv the following letter was received in the coroners office from dr j p sypes dear sir the enclosed communication or man uscript was found on a table in the room where paul traverse died last night his death was entirely natural and was due as stated in the burial certificate to acute gastritis the attack followed upon an unusually heavy meal he had eaten before retiring the matter i am send ing you was i presume a literary effort on his part for a moment her white lips quivered iitheres a dead man out there by the greenhousespage after midnight by marthe neville good night mr lannen louise willoughby ex tended her hand we breakfast at nine she said ill see you then i hope you sleep well thank you im sure i shall she gathered the folds of an em broidered chiffon gown about her and slowly mounted the stairs lan nen stood leaning against the newel post and watched her ascend as he turned away he faced his host the cold metallic glitter in the older mans black eyes gave him a strange uncomfortable feeling well said willoughby shes charming andrew you should be proud of her she has im proved wonderfully in the three years since i saw her a slow smile crept about the drawn lips of the physician it did not extend to his eyes but became lost in the heavy mustache and van dyke beard he wore lannen again shivered the snaky glitter in his physicianfriends eyes fascinated him he wondered if it could be true that the woman who had just left him with purity written on every curve and line of her could be the wanton thing her husband fancied that she had so forgotten herself and her social position as to stoop to an intrigue with her gar dener it seemed impossible of louise wil loughby yet many changes had taken place during the three years he had been abroad he had not known her well before his departure per haps he did not know her at all now come up into my laboratory willoughby said suddenly he closed the windows and switched off all the lights with the exception of one held in a bronze venus at the foot of the stairs andy lannen said as they en tered the heavily odorous room id rather you said nothing more about this to me some day you will be sorry for having taken me into your confidence and then our friendship will end there are some things a man has no right to discuss with an other i dont need to remind you of that this is one of them ive got to talk to some or go mad you think its my imagina tion you think im a jealous fool i tell you i know from the day that man came here she hs been different ive watched themive seen his arm around her ive heard him call her louise he broke and buried his head on his arms he had flung on the table before him lannen gripped his shoulder and shook him why dont you send him away willoughby raised his bloodshot eyes and admit defeat give him the pleasure of saying he was fired because andrew willoughbys wife fell in love with himnever be sides he sprang to his feet and paced the little room nervously his long hands with their gnarled after midnight crooked fingers stained with chemi cals twitching and pulling at his coat as he walked how do i know that she wont go with him if i send him away lannen remembered the brief glimpse he had had of the gardener a slim tall fellow little more than a boy with close cropped dark hair a pale almost ethereal face a quiet un assuming manner how long has he been here allering six weeks willoughby hit the glasstopped table nervously as he did so a tiny vial of amber covered liquid fell over knocking the stopper out of it a pungent sickish odor filled the room the doctor gave a startled cry flinging a small rubber blanket over the table he lifted the vial gingerly he placed the stopper back in it carefully keeping it away from his face then he covered it with the rubber he had become ashen colored as though unable to speak he motioned to lannen to throw up the windows damn careless of me he mut tered a moment later he placed the bottle high up in a cabinet above him then he locked the door of the chest damn care less its an experiment of mine ar thur dye feel alright lannen laughed uneasily i shouldnt care to remain in here long with that odor its heady to say the least willoughby poured some liquid from another bottle into a small glass and handed it to him then he took a draught of it himself drink this it will overcome the effects of the other suddenly he became tense the glitter in his eyes became more pro nounced he seemed to be listening to some thing the warm salt air blowing through the window brought a hint of the distant seaand something else what is it lannen gasped the quivering of willoughbys wide nostrils the sudden snapping of the glasss stem intrigued him listen a long sort of growlthen a long drawn howl from a dog some place not far off was all lannen heard there was another howl then silence the color came back to the phy sicians face he smiled apologeti cally lannen stared at him in bewilder ment what is it he asked again ii thought i heard her come down the stairs i was listening to hear if he met her the mans tongue seemed to be thick he spoke with difficulty buck up old man buck up lannen gave him a reassuring slap on the shoulder but at the same time he glanced apprehensively over his shoulder out of the window toward the gardens beyond again the long rumbling howl of the dog penetrated the night air the older man suddenly lurched forward into a chair and began to sob in a broken hearted way at that moment lannen fancied he saw a face at the open window but before he could ascertain whether it was his imagina tion or not it had vanished but to him it seemed he had seen a young pale face with smouldering dark eyes and close cropped hair whew he exclaimed whats wrong with me ii the sudden clamor of a clock strik ing three startled him out of a sound after midnight sleep at least he thought it was the striking of the hour which did it but as he raised himself on one elbow in the darkness the doubled beat of his heart the damp chill of his flesh told him it was something else which had awakened him stealthy footsteps outside his room the cautious open ing and closing of a door down the hall the rustle of garments as of someone moving in the corridor were registered with dark significance on his brain poor old andrew he muttered he sank back to his pillow but he could not sleep though his pulse became normal he found himself striving to make out the objects in his room one by one out of the hazy grey of the blackness they be came outlined and visible to his straining eyes in an irritating fashion the drawn blind flapped for ward and back with the wind which had arisen since nightfall unable at last to stand the sound of the flap ping he rose and went to the window to raise it the moon was high unobscured by any clouds and shone down with a dazzling white brilliance which made the grounds and surrounding territory almost as light as day the long row of glass topped green houses gleamed as through covered with snow off in the distance far behind the high stone wall which en closed dr willoughbys long island estate shone the water near at hand the wind whistled in a singsong manner through the trees from the darkening shelter of the stone wall emerged two figures the watching man knew instantly who they were even before the moon outlined the slender figure of willoughbys wife and the broader silhouette of the gardener aller ing a feeling of nausea swept over him he turned away from the window crossing to his bed he switched on a light just over it determined to while away the time until daylight with a current magazine but the face of the woman outside in the garden seemed to mock him from the printed page her dark shadowladen eyes seemed to plead with him be tween the lines of printing as though she begged him not to judge her too harshly the magazine slipped from his hand he closed his eyes and lay inert a moment later the cry of some one in mortal agony penetrated the night air then a woman shrieked in terror for a moment lannen lay panic striken then springing out of bed he snatched up a dressing gown and rushed into the hall he came face to face with wil loughby his host was pallid willoughbys hands trembled as he held a tattered silk gown about his emaciated figure a moment later another door down the hall was thrown open and the cor pulent kimonoclad housekeeper burst into their presence you heard it willoughby cried in a harsh whisper clutching lan nens arm his eyes were glassy the lids swol len as though from heavy sleep and being suddenly awakened his chin shook my gawd my gawd wailed the woman trying to pull the kimono about her ample bosomwhat was it doctor did you hear it a woman screamed lannen said grimly the cry came from some place near the greenhouses some one must be injured i heard a man too this from the after midnight butler who had joined them even partially clad he retained some of the dignity of his position oh what dye spose has hap pened doctor dear what dye think it is the housekeeper caught her masters arm and clung desperately to him he did not seem conscious of her presence he was looking into the lighted corridor below at his wife as she stumbled blindly through the outer door into the illuminated passage way she was sobbing convulsively she started to climb the stairs slowly dragging herself upward with an ef fort her shimmery evening gown was torn and draggled about her her face was grey a death color and her eyes terror stricken at the head of the stairs she col lapsed in a heap when willoughby started to lift her she gave a shud dering cry and warded off his touch her husband gave a sucking breath he looked at lannen mrs willoughby cried the latter dropping on his knees beside her subconsciously he wondered what had become of the man who had been with her if it were he who had given that cry of terrible torture mrs willoughby what is it what has happened for a moment her white lips quivered iitheres a dead man out there by the greenhouses i stumbled over him i touched his cold face i a dead man yes she suddenly straight ened and stared with a fixity into her husbands face a strange expression came over her own then she allowed lannen to as sist her to rise and in a quiet manner though with obvious effort she re quested the butler to bring her some wine a dead man come said lannen abruptly his legal training coming to the fore groundshe may be mistaken the man may still be alive he was cold she answered the little procession filed out toward the greenhouses a motley weird looking crowd in bath robes smoking jackets and kimonos louise willoughby walked with lannen and her husband her hand lightly rested on lannens all the way he felt the nervous tremors that shook her as they neared the spot where she had discovered the dead man there are lights in the green house willoughby said abruptly ill turn them on he left them for a moment then the glass enclosure became illumi nated an exclamation of horror burst from the group mrs willoughby clung to lannens arm in a feverish manner huddled up chest and chin meet ing lay the body of a man unques tionably dead he was roughly dressed his shoes in tatters his bare feet showing through the gaping soles while several days growth of beard added to the gruesomeness of his appearance long yellow teeth were bared in a distortion of agony bleary eyes stared upward there was no sign of a wound no indica tions of foul play but the man had unquestionably died suddenly and in great torture evidently it had been his death cry they had heard willoughby knelt beside him then after a seconds examination rose ab ruptly dead heart failure i think but it will be best to notify the police know him lannen asked after midnight no he looks like a hobo are you going to leave him cried his wife hysterically it seems so awful to leave a dead man out here on the ground alone its so heart less he cant be moved until the police arrive lannen answered wil loughby take your wife inside ill stay here until they come and see that nothing happens louise willoughby suddenly gave a cry of terror the police must you call the police hes a tramp he died of heart failure dont call the police it will create a scandal i couldnt stand thatpleaseplease do something else my dear my dear remonstrated her husband quietly this is very un fortunate im sorry the poor devil chose to die here but it may not be heart failure you know he may have been murdered murdered she sobbed the word as though it burst from her against her will willoughby ignored her exclama tion he continued suavely as though he enjoyed her hysterical anguish if the man has been murdered and we placed an obstacle in the way of his murderer being appre hended we would be putting our selves liable for more than a scan dal she suddenly swayed willoughby placed his hand on her shoulder but she turned on him in almost insane fury dont touch me she cried dont you dare to touch me the doctor shrugged his shoulders turning quietly to his friend you take her inside lannen shes wrought up no wonder poor child ill remain here call headquarters please iii when they reached the house the woman dropped wearily into a great chair the intense pain in her face the tremulous quiver of her mouth caused a wave of pity to sweep over lannen areare you going to call the po lice she whispered i must her white hands gripped tighter in spite of the things he had seen lannen again had a doubt as to her perfidy strangely enough he now felt no sympathy for her husband he lifted the receiver from the hook as he did so she touched him mr lannen yes are you my friend yeswhyyes of course mrs willoughby i mean really trulymy friend or his andrews yes i trust i am a friend to you both he evaded she shook her head impatiently you cant be that cant you see he hates me and ii loathe himi despise himoh my god how i hate himand yet mrs willoughby oh i know i horrify you she laughed and began to pace the length of the roomif only i had someone i could turn too someone to aid me someone in all the world i could trust you seem to be a good man if only i dared she paused abruptly then in a sudden change do you think im a bad womando you think i am what he thinks why my dear lady i i see he has lied to you too poisoned you against meas he has after midnight othersand she covered her face with her hands ireally i for once he could not find words mrs willoughby i saw you tonight you saw meand her eyes opened wide and him as she said nothing he turned from her and called up the police headquarters making his request for their presence in a quiet professional manner when he hung up the receiver he turned to her mrs willoughby you found the body who was with you at the time she did not reply after waiting a moment for her to speak he con tinued you realize that the police will ask questions of you when they arrive as a lawyer and your friend i am advising you to tell me everything before they come i may make things easier for you easier for me she repeated dully ive done nothing nothing wrong i think it is murder lannen said slowly she wet her dry lips with the tip of her tongue yes it is murder i know that she whispered how do you know he said sharply she shivered ii she gave a little hysteri cal laugh just as a woman intui tively knows many things some thing heretells me it is did you know the man no no of course not i never saw him before didnt you hear what andrew said he is a trampa hobo probably probably her voice trailed off and her dark eyes widened probably what lannen leaned forward and laid his hand on hers her skin was damp and ice cold probably hehe stopped in the grounds to sleep or for a drink of water andmr lannen i cant talk imimyoull excuse mei must go upstairs iv she rose unsteadily and for a moment seemed about to faint you can call me when the they arrive perhaps ill feel better then he assisted her to the stairs watched her slowly mount them then turned back into the room more puzzled than before as he sank into a deep cushioned chair before the window heavy satin draperies behind him were pushed aside a young man wearing mud stained overalls and a dark blue shirt stepped into the room he held one finger up to caution lannen to si lence then motioned him to draw the blinds so that their figures could not be seen by the men outside who waited by the greenhouses well said lannen the other slumped into a chair op posite to him he suddenly seemed overcome and unable to speak lan nen noted the way his hands trem bled his nostrils quivered after a moments silence the lawyer asked youre allering the gardener arent you yes sir he leaned forward al most touching lannen his eyes glowed in his eagerness youve sent for the police yes lannen reached for a cigar and lighted it before he answered the boy in that brief moments survey of the gardener he felt an instinctive liking for him it might be murder you know he added i put my hand over her mouth for fear she would cry outpage after midnight it was murder mr lannen that poor fellow out there died the death that was intended for me what do you mean by that lannen dropped his cigar and quickly rescued it from the carpet im not going to hide anything sir onlyonly ii cant face the po licenot yetivei cant tell you but cant you tell them what i say and keep me out of their way isnt it possible his white face worked convulsively he spoke as though compelled to do so against his will i dont understand you said the other man coldly you say someone desired your death yet you dont want to inform the police yourself dont you realize that you will have to testify you were with mrs wil loughby when she stumbled over the body yes sir im a lawyer allering perhaps you didnt know that yesyes i knew it thats why im asking you to help me to help louisei lannen winced as he used the christian name of his friends wife but the gardener did not see the movement you didnt kill the man did you snapped lannen suddenly no no good god no well then will you be kind enough to explain just what is it all about he hates me allering con tinued who andrew andrew willoughby he hates me as much as he fears me lannen started angrily to his feet willoughby is my friend the younger man laughed strident ly friend hes no mans friend theres only one thing in the world of any value to him thats science didnt you see how he took the death of that poor dog out there i was be hind a clump of shrub i heard and saw him he gloated over his body he was glad glad that a man had died and proven another one of his damnable poisons efficacious by god are you insinuating thatthat andrew willoughby killed the man out there i am a man he had never seen a stray tramp it was intended for me aller ing returned wearily he failed in his purpose so far as i was concerned but he made a sure test and it proved successful youre making an astounding statement young man said lannen straining to keep his voice calm and uninterestedyou are accusing a man of murder your employer the husband of the woman with whom allering sprang to his feet the veins stood out in great welts on his high thin forehead his nostrils quivered when he again sank into his chair he was panting from the struggle mr lannen he said abruptly i i met louise mrs willoughby outside in the groundswhy i did so is our affairbut she is a good womanyou must know she is her husband is more than a scoundrel he is the vilest lowest lannens gesture interrupted him he con tinued in a quieter tone we met by an arbor near the greenhouses it is very dark there and in spite of its being moonlight we werent seen but we saw the figure of a man as he came out of the house it was andrew willoughby at first we thought he had seen louise leave and was following us after midnight but he passed the arbor and went on toward the greenhouses in the moonlight which made everything perfectly visible in the open i could see he was carrying something a little case his medi cine case he uses when visiting a patient i was afraid he could hear louises breathing he passed so close to us but he was too intent on his wicked thoughts to notice anything else at the greenhouses he hesi tated and looked stealthily around then he laughed that laugh made louise grip my arm i put my hand over her mouth for fear she would cry out there is a hydrant beside one of the houses i use it every morning to attach the hose to my knowledge no one else ever touches it no one has occasion too willoughby was aware of this it is an old fashioned arrangement and i have protested against it but the thing has remained as it is several times i have been drenched by the nozzle slipping as we watched willoughby went to this hydrant he carefully unfastened the hose then he opened the little case he carried he took out some thing which was evidently a piece of cloth and wiped all the damp off the rusty metal then he put the cloth back into the case next he took a small vial out of it and with great caution poured it all over the metal then as quietly as he had come he whirled around and went back to the house allering paused thenwe both stood there in the darkness unable afcfirst to speak or move he went on then louise whispered charlie what was it what was he doing i didnt tell heri knew he had con trived some diabolical way to get rid of me though just how a liquid poison on a piece of metal could do it i didnt know i resolved under no conditions to touch it louise be came frightened and started to cry she was pent up and nervous before now she became hysterical i tried to reassure her and told her she had best go back to the house though she tried to control her feelings i felt she knew instinctively what i did that her husband had planned my murder just as she braced up and started to leave mea man vaulted the stone wall and lurched into view a pool of moonlight outlining him distinctly i think he was a tramp or a thief i had never seen him before he wan dered about aimlessly until he came to the hydrant almost before i knew what he was doing he had put his mouth to the socket and turned on the water the next moment he gave that cry you heard we saw him stagger backwards fling up his arms waving them wildly then fall over doubling up and writhing as though in horrible pain it only lasted a moment then he was dead louise screamed she started to run she fell twice i was going to follow her then i knew i mustnt i crept further back into the shadow of the arbor after you all came back into the house i stole out the other way climbed the wall and returned through the servants entrance why should andrew wish to kill you lannen asked abruptly allering rose again he crossed to the lawyer and stood under a stand lamp allowing its light to shine directly on his pallid face the skin over his cheek bones was drawn and tight there was a fever ish gleam in his eyes his young mouth was hard and grim but in spite of everything there was a look of candor and manliness about him which impressed lannen after midnight arthur lannen dont you know me whywhy the vague some thing which had disturbed lannen resolved itself into a memory the memory of a pinkcheeked redhaired lad with a sunny smile an almost cherubic cast of countenance he gave a gasp charlie moore notcharlie moore yes louises brother but why an automobile came into the drive way stopped with a noisy purr of the engine some men alighted then the door bell gave a metallic clatter the boy clutched lannens arm for gods sake keep me out of this he cried ill explain later before the lawyer could answer he had disappeared behind the satin draperies iv lannen opened the door before the servant reached it the inspector followed by his medical examiner and a couple of officers strode into the hallway well whats the dope the in spector asked abruptly he was a large man with a twenty four hours crop of blue black beard his eyes were dark and very keen he wore horn rimmed spectacles which he kept constantly removing and polishing lannen knew that in that brief seconds survey of the room he had noticed the almost imperceptible swaying of the curtains as they fell together behind charlie moore you called me the inspector continued not waiting for his ques tion to be answered yes wheres willoughby the doc tor was well known on the island outside a dead man was found on the grounds some sneak thief or hobo evidently we thought it best to send for you it may be heart failure it may be murder alright take me to him as they stepped outside lannen realized that morning had arrived in the hazy light he saw dr wil loughby seated on a stone bench his shaggy bearded chin cupped in his hand as he stared with evident inter est at the huddled splotch on the ground before him the servants had grouped themselves some little dis tance away evidently discussing the gruesome event but at the sight of the officers they hushed abruptly lannen glanced quickly at the hy drant it was open a slow trickle of water resolved itself into a little rivulet below it and wended away into a tiny stream toward the green houses a trifle below it willoughby rose leisurely at their appearance and extended his hand to the inspector mr dwyer he said im dr willoughby this is my homeits unfortunate yes i know doctor dwyer interrupted the mans dead al right you dont know him do you willoughby shook his head no seems to be a hobo doesnt he i fancy he died of heart failure but id rather your examiner passed upon the case i dont think it advisable for you to depend solely upon my de cision its awkward happening on my grounds you know he spoke easily all traces of the strain of the evening before seemed to have vanished the examiner knelt on the damp ground and took a brief survey of the body no indication of foul play he said after midnight he scowled uncertainly then looked from willoughbys face to the inspectors he seems to have died suddenly with acute agony rather an unusual attitude for a heart fail ure to assume dont you think so dr willoughby i do that is why i hesitated to diagnose it as such and yet the physician leaned closer iiim not prepared to say it isnt look him over riley said dwy er abruptly to a younger man in plain clothessee if theres anything to identify him on his clothes plain hobo said the other after a moments survey there were no cards letters nor marks of any kind on the body or clothing to lead to any knowledge of the man heart failure it is i take it said dwyer grimly must a caught the poor devil suddenly probably dropped in here to steal a nights lodging and having a bum heart keeled over lannen started to speak hesitated then turned abruptly to dr wil loughby there was an enigmatical look on the physicians bearded face lan nen almost fancied that triumph gleamed through his black eyes youyouarent going to have an inquest the lawyer queried not necessary dwyer replied thing seems pretty clear to me he turned deferentially to wil loughby you passed it as heart failure also didnt you doctor willoughby bowed his head in as sent well have the body removed at once the inspector continued ri ley you can stay here until the wagon comes if theres nothing fur ther well bid you goodmorning something seemed to snap in lan nens brain the story the young gardener had told him the scream the dead man had given had made too deep an impression on the law yers mind to be dismissed lightly doctor he exclaimed touching the medical assistants arm do per sons dying suddenly of heart failure give a cry of mortal agony hey lannen repeated the question nono i think not it would be unusual quite unusual but not im possible for them to cry out death comes too suddenly as a rule for them to make any sounddeath so painful as this why do you ask this man gave a scream i heard it so did mrs willoughby who found the body the inspector dug the blunt toe of his shoe into the grass at his feet he coughed then looked at willoughby back to lannens expressive face then to his assistant a slow flush mounted to his forehead this puts another complexion on the matter he said quietly where is mrs willoughby in the house her husband re plied she was badly upset about the matter and has gone in stay here riley come on with me the rest of you an air of alert ness had taken hold of dwyer as though he suddenly sensed some thing of interest as the servants huddled together did not move he gave a peremptory gesture toward them and repeated the command for them to return to the house with him v once inside the house willoughby became a genial host inquiring of the officers if they desired anything to drink and when dwyer accepted b maug after midnight with alacrity he ordered the butler to serve all present dwyer wandered about the room for a few moments touching a bit of furniture here a drapery there and puffing viciously on a strong and vile smelling cigar after he had swallowed a large drink of old whis key wiped his mouth with the back of his hand he asked that mrs wil loughby be called you heard this fellow scream he said turning to lannen while they waited for her appearance yes wake you up no i was awake hows that insomnia what time did he scream about halfpast four i should judge no i dont suffer with in somnia im usually a heavy sleeper something else wakened you then yes what thats hard to say possibly being in a strange room and bed im a guest here you know possibly the quiet of the country after the city ori fancied i heard footsteps out side my door willoughby leaned forward his black eyes lightened the pu pils became mere pin points what kind of footsteps in quired dwyer that i cant state im not pre pared to say that i heard any i may have fancied i did if i did hear them they were very softcautious i should say a mans or a womans i dont knowbut i think a mans willoughby sank back in the chair gripping the arms of it with long stained fingers how long after you heard these footsteps was it that you heard this scream i should judge thirty minutes i lay in bed some little time then un able to sleep i got up and sat by the window does your window face those greenhouses yes did you see this man enter the grounds no i had left the window when he screamed and you saw nothing suspicious out there lannen hesitated he caught the glance his host directed toward him and coughed something impelled him to say no louise willoughby came into the room she had removed her be draggled evening gown and had re placed it with a tea gown of lavender satin and lace her face was ghastly pale in the morning light her eyes wide and very dark lannen suddenly felt a great pity for her her heavy mass of dark red hair she had let down and braided in to a great rope which hung over one shoulder it made her look younger almost girlish at her entrance willoughby mere ly raised his head looked at her a second then back toward the in spector she accepted the chair lannen offered her you wished to see me she said yes mrs willoughby im sorry to disturb you but this unfortunate death on your grounds makes it necessary dwyers voice uncon sciously softened xas he addressed her i understand please pardon my appearance i had gone to bed you were the first to find the dead after midnight mans body werent you mrs wil loughby yes you were alone no her gaze did not falter nor did she look at her husband who was with you a young man mr allering did this young manmr aller ingsee she interrupted him we both saw him fall fall the man wasnt dead when you first saw him the woman bit her lip then she shook her head no mr allering and i were in the arbor near the greenhouses we saw a man climb over the fence he staggered then then her eyes shifted and rested on the face of her husband willoughby was yellow his black eyes like beads stared at her with all the fascination of a snake coiled to spring she shivered thenhe gave a terrible cry flung up his arms and fell over writhing i think he died instantly i screamed too it was horrible to see a man die then i started to run he lay in my path way it was darkthe moon went under a cloud right after it happened i felli touched his cold face she paused staring straight ahead of her as if visualizing what had taken place that is all said dwyer yes lannen wondered if dwyer realized the woman was lying where is this allering now the officer inquired looking about the servants who had come into the room on returning to the house shook their heads i dont know mrs willoughby answered probably in his room snapped her husband speaking for the first time he is the gardener employed here dwyer mereiy raised his eyebrows he studied the pale patrician face of the woman then turned to one of his assistants riley go with a servant to get him vi dwyer and his medical adviser again traversed the lawn to the greenhouses lannen went with them the operator whom dwyer had left in charge of the body grinned a sickly welcome as they approached again lannen noted the dripping hy drant dwyer stalked about the grounds crossing to the green houses he opened a door and stepped inside he was gone but a moment when he returned he made a survey of the arbor and the stone wall which sur rounded the grounds the grass was trampled and crushed but no definite footprints were discernible stevens go back to the house and see whats the matter that riley hasnt found that gardener he said abruptly the medical examiner whose atten tion had been centered on the dead man looked up quickly its heart failure alright dwyer he said dwyer merely grunted the man who had been with the body hitched his trousers and passed the back of a hairy hand across his mouth he started briskly toward the house paused abruptly and whirling around crossed to the hy drant as he stopped to drink from the faucet lannen cried out in an unnatural voice dont do that the young officer straightened ab ruptly speaking to me he asked after midnight yes whats the matter dont touch that hydrant stevens came closer i dont understand he said wondering if he were making a fool of himself or if what allering had said were true lannen hesitated the inspector looked at him in quiringly lannen laughed nerv ously well said dwyer he removed his horn rimmed glasses and polished them vigorous ly his keen eyes squinted lannen inwardly squirmed under the scru tiny i may be mistaken the lawyer said uneasily but im under the im pression that the man died after drinking from that faucet stevens whistled lannen realized he had told too much to withhold any more and con tinued quietly allering came to me after mrs willoughby retired he said the dead man took a drink then fell writhing to the ground he may have imagined it i dont knowbut its well to take no chances mrs willoughby did not mention this no where did allering go why hasnt riley found him i dont know well mused the inspectorits damned queer well get a glass and test this water heres a tin cup said the younger officer reaching for one which hung on a nail just below the hydrant lannen suddenly remembered the gardeners words when he mentioned the caution willoughby had exer cised in wiping the moisture from the faucet he stepped forward quietly and drawing his handkerchief from his pocket he wrapped it about his hand before turning the spicket then he drew some water and handed it to the medical examiner it was clear as crystal willoughby has a laboratory where he makes tests in chemistry the lawyer said stay here dwyer said to the operator he had left with the body before then he turned to the others with a curt nod of his head toward the house well use the laboratory though ive a hunch theres nothing to this water business but you never can tell and weve got to locate this fellow allering vii as they entered the house wil loughby rose abruptly lannen sensed a tension in the air as though the physician and his wife had been quarreling the womans face was bloodless the great purple shadows under her eyes and her white lips gave her an almost ethereal beauty she smiled a wan greeting as though welcoming the interruption of an un pleasant scene dr willoughby said the in spector abruptly dr graves here would like to use your laboratory for a little test if you dont mind test smiled willoughby suave ly yes of the hydrant water mr lannen is under the impression that the dead hobo took a drink from your hydrant and keeled over water looks alright but wed like to make sure the smile never left willoughbys face though lannen fancied it grew tighter ill be very glad to assist you in any way the physician said though im positive the water had nothing after midnight to do with the poor chaps death we dont use it for drinking purposes but its pure however as you say its best to make sure come this way if you please my laboratory is on the top floor he led the way to the odorous room that was the scene of his many chemical tests as they reached the door for a second he hesitated he drew a deep breath and inserted a key in the lock it did not turn the physician looked puzzled thats strange he muttered he rattled the knob maybe the lock has sprung said the inspector grimly willoughby shook his head it seems to be locked from the in side he said the smile left his facehe became yellower if possible there came to them the rustle of papers inside the room the sound of someone moving the men stared at each other willoughby swayed a trifle and lurched against the door dwyer thrust a huge fist forward and gave the panel a resounding kick open this door he called open it or well break it down there was silencethen a sound of footsteps and the door was flung open the gardener stood just inside the room he had discarded his over alls and looked very much the gentle man in a dark well fitting suit though he was ghastly pale there was a triumphant gleam in his dark eyes and an air of success in his bear ing the room was in absolute disorder papers were thrown everywhere bottles lay at random on glass topped tables paper baskets were over thrown everything indicated a hur ried but thorough search one instant willoughby glared at his ransacked laboratory then into the glowing eyes of the boy whom he seemed to recognize for the first time then he flung himself at the younger man with an almost animal like snarl damn you allering stepped aside at the same moment dwyer laid a heavy hand on his shoulder well he smiled but the menace in his cool tones made lannen shiver i presume you are the gardener allering no wonder you didnt care to give your testimony to us we came out here to look into the matter of a heart failure we hardly expected to be so fortunate as to lay our hands on charlie mooreno the boy flung back his head and looked bravely into the cool hard face of the inspector no gasped stevens sure the escaped con sent up two years ago for manslaughter escaped six weeks ago they say a society woman helped him bust out but i never dreamed it was mrs wil loughby shes my sister said the boy proudly sure dwyer bit off the end of a cigar and stuck it in his mouth but he didnt light it he looked steadily at the young man then toward willoughby the latters eyes were bloodshot he seemed to be controlling himself with difficulty what did you know about this dwyer asked him nothing snapped the doctor you didnt recognize him no young moore laughed unpleasant ly thats a lie he said he knew me the moment louise brought me into this house she knew he did and so did ibut he didnt dare admit it after midnight if he had he would have notified you in a minute he wanted me out of the way but he was afraid so he chose the cowardly way he made everyone think i was her lover and poisoned them against her then stop it was willoughby who exclaimed the boy shrugged his shoulders youve made some strange state ments young man said dwyer quietly and i must say for a man under arrestan escaped convict youre damned cool a frank smile curled the others lips im not going back inspector he said and dont you think it for one minute is that so you bet your life it is i spent two years in that hellhole i was clever enough to make my escape you can rest assured ill be clever enough to keep out of it what do you think i came here for thats what im wondering said dwyer drily you might have known that sooner or later we would have run you down that we would be certain to come to your sisters for you not so certain if that poor devil hadnt died out there id still be safe here ive had six weeks start of you inspector that was all i needed six weeks too much for you andrew but you see you didnt get me after all dwyer flung his cigar from him impatiently and stepped over the threshold into the disordered labo ratory he closed the door behind him with a snap willoughby sud denly swayed and dropped into the nearest chair now moore said the inspector no funny business get me youre going back with me and youre going back to stay you were sent up on a poison charge young man theres a dead man out there on those groundswhat did you have to do with his death the boy shrugged his shoulders again then his eyes clouded a note of pathos crept into his voice everything he said quietly i suppose if it werent for me the poor devil would be alive at this minute willoughby gave an inarticulate cry dwyer stared at the exgardener striving to digest his astounding words let me get you right he said slowly are you confessing that you killed that bum out there no said young moore but im saying that my brotherinlaw andrew willoughby did viii there was a dead silence then willoughby laughed he laughed until he shook then he staggered to his feet and waved a long bony fin ger at his accuser you tried to implicate me before you whelp you tried to shift john gordons murder on my shoulders by god dont you try it again i never saw that man out there before i just a minute the dignity the note of authority in the boys voice seemed to impress even dwyer hard ened officer of the law that he was two years ago when i came out of college i came here to study chemis try with dr willoughby my brother inlaw i was interested in science he had gone farther into some phases of it than any other teacher i could secure i became his assistant in nu merous tests john gordon was an other assistant after midnight why rake all that up snapped dwyer impatiently all that detail came out at the trial because you are going to know the truth because i am going to prove my statements i dont know if andrew willoughby is insane or not but i do know that in the interest of science he will stop at nothing not even murder please he continued raising a silencing hand as they would have interrupted him he was making some tests of a new very strange and interesting eastern poi sonit left no trace of any kind a touch of it on a mucous membrane would produce instant death this was not enough for dr willoughby he was searching for a poison whose mere contact would be deadly at last he hit upon one a harmless enough liquid until combined with metal and moisture lannen gave an exclamation of surprise willoughby had seated himself and now sat staring at the speaker with beaded fascinated eyes he wet his lips with the tip of his tongue but otherwise made no move ment the trouble with this poison continued moore was that the vic tim died in convulsionsthe death being of several moments duration consequently willoughby was still dissatisfied i dont know what his desire was in making of poisoning a fine art i dont think that at that time murder was his object he sacrificed numerous animals in his experiments even louises pet airedale and a per sian cat belonging to the house keeper were destroyed the brutal ity of their death the horrible agony they suffered was getting on my nerves i wanted to get away he did not let john gordon into the se cret of these poisons so gordon was in total ignorance of willoughbys ambition i began to fear my brotherinlaw there was an insane glitter in his eyes when at work it dawned upon me that he would not endure any ob stacle being placed in his way and that because of my knowledge of his tests he hated me although he needed me then john gordon was found dead his attitude the tor tured expression on his face proved conclusively he had been poisoned though if willoughby had not so painstakingly explained the nature of that poison no one would have de tected it in his system whether my brotherinlaw deliberately killed him as a testor it was an accident i am not prepared to statebut i had nothing to do with it the metal cup which contained the coffee which gordon drank i never saw before so help me god willoughby swore in court to my carelessnesthat i had deliberately left that cup which had been used on a tea tableand young gordon had poured coffee in to it and drank it it was a lie dr willoughby himself did it i had nothing to support my statement then i was working for a reputable famous scientist what was my word against his with every proof in the world against me but i made up my mind that the instant those prison doors closed behind me and i was again a free man i would not only prove my innocencebut an drew willoughbys guilt and i have done so he paused abruptly i escaped the papers gave the details i took a chance in coming herebut as louises gardener i was safe from you if willoughby did not recognize me for a long time he never noticed me one servant was the same as another to him his wife after midnight always engaged them then he noted our friendship louises and mine and he became jealous too late we recognized our mistake for the in stant he took a good look at me he knew who i was as i said he was cowardly he knew i had something more than my liberty at stake he feared me he was afraid of what i knew of him he instantly sensed that my presence in his household meant i was spying upon him he could not send me away he determined to do away with me cleverly he planted the idea in the mind of all his wifes friends that she was unfaithful to him that i wa her lover he did this so that if he were discovered as my murderer he would be exoner ated for protecting his honor then he began to study my habits knowing what he intended i ate all my meals at a nearby roadhouse everything suspicious i handled with glovesbut in spite of all my precautions if that poor devil had not appeared last night this morning i would be a dead man an enigmatical smile curled up the corners of willoughbys eyes he shifted his position he glanced in an almost disinterested fashion at the pa pers tossed about the room he had contrived my murder in the cleverest most diabolical fashion con ceived of by man continued moore knowing that to water the plants i must attach the hose every morning he carefully saw to it that it was unat tachedthen using this poison which he had perfected he placed it on the faucetso that the instant it came into contact with moisture and metal it be came deadly so deadly that the touch of it on my bare hand was enough to kill me very pretty said dwyer with something like a snortbut it strikes me like some sort of a fairy tale you cant get away with that stuff young man moore smiled i saw him place the poison on the hydrant faucet so did his wife i saw the tramp touch it and fall over dead so did she i have found the formulathe thing ive been hunt ing forand his diary dwyer sniffed again though he took the book moore extended toward him and turned over its pages curiously were always getting dope on mys terious poisons that leave no trace he saidbut its going a little too far to believe in the existence of one that kills by the mere touch of flesh which has no abrasion or scratch of any kind willoughby suddenly stiffened his nostrils quivered you dont doubt its existence he exclaimed in a highpitched excited voice i do you dont believe what he says is true i do not well it is true every word of it the professional pride in the doctors voice showed he had clearly forgotten that such a statement meant an admis sion of murder are you confessing that you at tempted your brotherinlaws life and killed that hobo exclaimed dwyer whirling on him i am making a statement that i have discovered the greatest existing poison that i have proven its potency you doubt my word watch before any of the startled spectators could stop him he had reached for the little vial of ambercolored liquid lan nen so vividly recalled as spilling the night before and pouring a little of it in a metal measuringcup half filled with water he rubbed his hand over the surface of the cup for a second he smiled whimsically at the men who stared in bewilderment at himthen he after midnight suddenly stiffened his muscles gave a convulsive movement and he rolled off the chair onto the floor dead exclaimed the other physi cian bending over him almost in stantaneous well im damned ejaculated dwyer my sister gasped young moore there was a horrified expression in his dark eyes i must go to heryou dont want me do you nobut dont try to get away re plied dwyer grimly still staring in blank astonishment at the stark figure of their late host youll find everything in his diary said the boy in the doorway his vain glory prompted him to write it up it prompted his death said lan nen turning away heartsick at the thought then the knowledge that louise wil loughby was free sent him down into the drawingroom where she sat hands clasped in those of her brother in the next number i bulling the bulls by walter scott story ii devils choiee by paul everman iii in the shadows of the jungle by eric a darling brothersofthecoast by j g kofoed i dropped over the side of the mary rose when she steamed out of port royal and swam back to the wharf it was a foolish thing to do for the harbor was full of ground sharks but the heat and rather too much rumandsugar had made me reckless probably too i had imbibed some of the devilmaycare spirit of this ancient nesting place of the buccaneers when i reached the dock i was dizzy and blown from my exertions it was terribly hot something seemed drag ging at the nape of my neck and the winking lights in port royal harbor looked like the blazing eyes of mam moth animals i sat down on a cask and watched the red lantern on the mary roses stack disappear into the night i couldnt quite recall why i had come back to port royal it was be cause of something someone had told medamn that rum my head was like an empty barrel i could not re member a thing after a bit i lit my pipe having to bacco and matches safe in a waterproof bag as all sailormen should gradually the fog in my brain started to shred out i began to remember first it was mary logan she had promised to marry me back in new bedford she had laid her little hands in my great horny ones and pressed her lips against my cheeks murmuring words of endearment and promising to wed me in a fortnight all the time she knew she was lying for her plans had been laid to run away with benjy harrison that very night something snapped inside of me then the world went black before my eyes later i shipped on the mary rose bound for port royal but it wasnt marys treachery that had made me leave the old tramp what was it i pressed my fists against my aching temples and tried to think ah i had it it was on account of what hong fat showed methat and the sugared rum i guess the filthy sliteyed china man was a magician in his own coun try he said and ill give it to him that he was clever for two dollars he went through his whole bag of tricks but it didnt satisfy me im a deep water sailor and i come from a long line of bluenosed psalmsinging puritans but theres a streak of the mystic in me i always wanted to look behind the veil and hong fat said he could lift it for me so i gave him five dollars to do it he brought out a little bronze bowl from under his robe and made some passes over it with his ean longnailed fingers a thick oily smoke curled up from it and almost hid his emaciated yellow face and beady eyes then he asked me in his crooked shantung dialect if i could understand chinese i told him yes rather sourly for the smoke was making me drowsy sailor man he said in his singsong way you are a brave onea brave man but you have done enough wrong to offend the gods wrongs that you must atone for wrongs i said ive led a pretty rough life but a square one and i cant call to mind anyone in particular that brothersofthecoast ive wronged id like to kill benjy harrison but i havent done it so you cant call that a wrong as for mary logan no i cant call any to mind i said what of the smoke there was a tight ening around my throat and my arms and legs had lost all feeling hurry uptell mewhat was itwhen not in this life droned hong fat long long ago the smoke flattened out like a gray screen there were pictures on it but so jumbled and twisted at first that i could not make head or tail of them i seemed to see marys face peep out but i couldnt be sure then the pictures began to take shape familiar things flashed up i seemed to be going back into the pastcenturies ago suddenly there sprang into view the old city of panama with its houses of aromatic rosewood and the tower of the great cathedral of st anastasius i could see the slave markets where black men were being sold while their buyers sat at tables sipping peruvian wine beyond the city rolled the green savannahs and on one side an arm of the sea crept inland it was the panama of the old days before sir henry morgan sacked it i dont know why i recognized it for the ancient city was gone long before i was born there is left only a tangle of weeds and suncracked limestone the slavemarket is a swamp the haven a stretch of surfbeaten mud inhabited by pelicans quarreling over the stinking remains of fish but in spite of that i saw old panama there in the smoke and felt as a man does when he comes upon a forgotten nook except for this at sight of all that beauty a crawl ing horror whelmed up in my throat and i would have screamed and beat the air but it was as though only my brain was present i had no consciousness of a physical body men came into the picture they were muscular and bronzed with the rolling gait of sailors they wore hats wide of brim and running into a peak dirty linen shirts and knickerbockers around their waists were sashes bris tling with knives and they carried guns of a make that would seem strange to modern eyes they were morgans buccaneers on their way to the sack of panamato pillage and burn and tor ture and rape i recognized them dubose with his swagger and black mustachios squat sawkins oneeyed peter harris ringrose and thengod pity mei saw myself running with the rest sweat stained ragged but with the lust of battle flushing my cheeks at the head of the troop was a tall man with a face framed by lank gray curls as cruel and evil and ruthless a face as this old world has ever seen his clothes of silks and satin and lace were as weatherworn as those of his men no need to ask myself who it was i knew him as i had known the others morgan the damnedthe man i had followed in a forgotten century across the bloodsmeared waters of the carib bean i knew then why hong fat had said my wrong was a great one none could fight under the black flag of this arch brotherofthecoast without loading his soul with crime sitting there in a dazed trance i watched the capture and sack of pana maliving over again the wild excite ment of that day the clash of swords on steel casques and breastplates the priests and nuns whipped before the ad vance to place scaling ladders against the walls hatetwisted spanish faces in the desperate struggle on the ramparts the final capitulation of the town the smoke cloud grew darker the pictures that followed faded as though the scene of torture and outrage were too terrible for the black art of hong brothersofthecoast fat to compass through the haze i saw the chinamans yellow face and beady eyes watching me with a sort of sardonic leer i tried to speak i fought the air with my numbed arms but the words would not come to my lips that is not all croaked hong fat in his weird dialect there is more the smoke screen flattened again as though his clawlike hand had stroked it into a semblance of gray velvet the figures grew lifelike on the cursed chart this time it showed the guardroom of the fort at panamaa room piled high with plunder torn from the rav ished town through the open case ments i could see the fires of the burn ing houses and memory brought back the shouts of the pirates and the shrieks of tortured citizens there were two men in the room morgan with his fierce wrinkled face andand i was there you might think it a trick of the chinamans but as each scene flashed on i recalled it oh yes i had been thereas vile as any of those bloodstained brothers of the coast and my punishment was stretching through the ages i hung on each succeeding step my breath whistling through my nostrils like a foundered horse morgan waved his hand and a wo man was led in between two buccaneers at sight of her the whole tale came back to me her face was the face of mary logan dark and proud and beautiful she wore the dress of a spanish gentle woman and i remembered that back in those fading days of the seventeenth century she bore the name of donna isabella de guayraand that i loved her then as i loved her reincarnation named mary logan i had saved her life in panama be fore i joined morgans crew and had killed her spanish lover when he found me in her garden they outlawed me of course and i became a pirate to come back to herthe only way that was open for me she swore that she loved me and would wait when they led her in myheart blazed at last the hour of my triumph had come there on the smoke screen morgan leaned back in his chair and over the ages i heard his voice ringing in my ears this man says he loves you sdeath youre worth loving madame but why throw yourself away on him when there are better men around i looked at her my lips moving it is not harry morgans way to stand back when there are women or gold to get the pirate said you can have him if your love is so strong that it will face death for him so sure as you take him ill burn you both at the stake my hand went to the knife at my hip but i was helpless the muskets of the two pirates were leveled at me andand if i do not choose him senor the girl asked morgans face wreathed itself in a terrible smile if you choose me ill cover you with diamonds by my faith not a ship on the spanish main but will contribute to your wealth so there you have it holyoak and death or sir henry morgan and wealth the girls dark eyes flamed into little golden points he killed the man who loved me she said he took a life for his own selfish pleasure senor is it not pos sible that he will also take mine if i cleave unto you the buccaneers pistol was in his hand stay with me and holyoak dies said he donna isabellawho in this century betrayed me again looked me full in the eyes her own were hard brothersofthecoast i will stay with you senor mor gan she whispered then i saw in the smoke morgans pistol flame it was the end for me ii i came to myself with a nervous jerk the lights of port royal twinkled at my back the mary rose had disappeared how long i had been sitting there on the cask pondering on the strange things hong fat had shown me i do not know my head felt queer the dragging sensation at the nape of my neck was stronger i staggered a little as i walked off the wharf for how many aeons would marys treachery be repeated in reparation for my murder of the spanish grandee as the donna isabella she had betrayed me to morgan as mary logan she had cast me aside for benjy harrison and as surely as we died and were born again she would repeat that treachery unlessunless i knew port royal as well as anyone but tonight it seemed strange to my eyessomehow smaller and older and more cramped why this should be i could not tell unless hong fats cursed smoke still twisted my senses i followed the crooked street until i came to the blue anchor inn a tavern huddled under the lee of the old spanish fortthe very tavern too where sir henry morgan had planned the sack of panama the night was warm the doors wide flung and i heard half a hundred rollicking voices roaring out that melody by the poet of london town so popular among the buccaneers in frolic dispose your pounds shil lings and pence well be damnably mouldy a hundred years hence
