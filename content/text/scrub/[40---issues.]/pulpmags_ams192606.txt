sloane ma phd managing editor editorial and general offices park place new york n y extravagant fiction today cold fact tomorrow the lure of scientifiction by hugo gernsback frs scientifiction is not a new thing on this planet while edgar allan poe probably was one of the first to conceive the idea of a scientific story there are suspicions that there were other scien tifiction authors before him perhaps they were not such outstanding figures in literature and perhaps they did not write what we understand today as spientifiction at all leonardo da vinci a great geniuswhile he was not really an author of scientifiction nevertheless had enough prophetic vision to create a number of machines in his own mind that were only to materialize centuries later he described a number of machines seeming ly fantastic in those days which wouldhave done credit to a jules verne there may have been other scientific prophets if not scientifiction writers before his time but the past centuries are so beclouded and there are so few manuscripts of such literature in existence today that we cannot really be sure who was the real in ventor of scientifiction in the eleventh century there also lived a francis can monk the amazing as well as famous roger bacon he had a most astounding and prolific imagination with which he foresaw many of our presentday wonders but as an author of scientifiction he had to be extremely careful be cause in those days it was not healthy to predict new and startling inventions it was necessary to disguise the manuscriptâto use cypherâas a mat ter of fact so that it has taken many great modern minds to unravel the astonishing scientific prophe cies of roger bacon the scientifiction writer of today is somewhat da vinciâthe edison of the middle agesâis credited with hav ing first imagined the printing press the breechloading gun the mitrailleuse gun the steam engine the chain drive a manpropelled airplane the parachute and many othersâan amazing array of scien tifictionâbecause he admittedly only imagined these inventions in his famous opus majus he accurately prophesied the telescope he gave excellent descriptions of the camera obscura and of the burning glassâeven the invention of gun powder is accredited to him he forecast an age of industry and invention with all prominence given to experiment as a reward for his immortal work he was incarcerated for a number of years more fortunateâbut not so very much more it is true that we do not behead him or throw him into a dungeon when he dares to blaze forth with what seems to us an impossible tale but in our inner minds we are just as intolerant today as were the contemporaries of roger bacon we have not learned much in the interval even such a comparatively tame invention as the submarine which was pre dicted by jules verne was greeted with derisive laughter and he was denounced in many quarters still only forty years after the prediction of the modern submarine by verne it has become a reality there are few things written by our scientifiction writers frankly impossible today that may not be come a reality tomorrow frequently the author himself does not realize that his very fantastic yarn may come true in the future and often he himself does not take his prediction seriously but the seriouslyminded scientifiction reader ab sorbs the knowledge contained in such stories with avidity with the result that such stories prove an incentive in starting some one to work on a device or invention suggested by some author of scienti fiction one of our great surprises since we started publishing amazing stories is the tremendous amount of mail we receive fromâshall we call them scientifiction fansâwho seem to be pretty well orientated in this sort of literature from the sug gestions for reprints that are coming in these fans seem to have a hobby all their own of hunt ing up scientifiction stories not only in english but in many other languages there is not a day now that passes but we get from a dozen to fifty sugges tions as to stories of which frankly we have no record although we have a list of some or scientifiction stories some of these fans are con stantly visiting the book stores jvith the express purpose of buying new or old scientifiction tales and they even go to the troubleof advertising for some volumes that have long ago gone out of print scientifiction in other words furnishes a tremend ous amount of scientific education and fires the readers imagination more perhaps than anything else of which we know a trip to the center of the earth by jules verne authorâaround the world in days off on a comet etc etc we found ourselves close to a lofty forest it consisted of straight trunks with tufted tops in shape like parasols the air seemed to have no effect upon these treesâwhich in spite of a tolerable breeze remained as still and motionless as if they had been petrified my uncle unhesitatingly called them by their real names it is only he said in his coolest manner a forest of mushrooms a trip to the center of the earth what went before professor harwigg chemist philosopher mineralogist etc while delighting in a rare old edition by a famous icelandic author un expectedly comes upon a mysterious parchment ap parently containing a secret message both the pro fessor and harryâhis nephew and pupil who also lives with himâset to work and finally stumble on the key to the secret code and read the following message descend into the crater of yokul of sneffels which the shade of scdrtaris covers be fore the kalends of july audacious traveler and you will reach the center of the earth i did itâarne saknussem the professor decides that they will make the trip and also reach the center of the earth three days later theyâharry much against his will and better judgmentâstart for iceland and mount sneffels with the good wishes of gretchem the professors ward and harrys fiance when they get to iceland they are fortunate enough to obtain the services of hans a true ice landic guideâcalm stolid and dependable after numerous adventures and interesting encounters and difficult climbing they reach the top of mt sneffels and then descend into its craterâand thus following correctly the directions of the message so far the party is elated with the wonders of their surroundings as they descend deeper and deeper in to the boivels of the earth lowering themselves into the deeper wells by means of sturdy ropes doubled over the rocks above at least once so far they were reassured of the truth of the mysterious message when they noticed a rock below the crater bearing the inscription arne saknussem a trip to the center of the earth by jules verne part ii chapter xvi the eastern tunnel the next day was tuesday the d of july âand at six oclock in the morning we resumed our journey we still con tinued to follow the gallery of lava a perfect natuial pathway as easy of descent as some of those inclined planes which in very old german houses serve the purpose of stair cases this went on until seventeen minutes past twelve the precise instant at which we rejoined hans who having been somewhat in advance had suddenly stopped at last cried my uncle we have reached the end of the shaft i looked wonderingly about me we were in the center of four cross paths â somber and narrow tunnels the question now arose as to which it was wise to take and this of itself was no small diffi culty my uncle who did not wish to appear to have any hesitation about the matter before either me or the guide at once made up his mind he pointed quietly to the eastern tunnel and without delay we entered within its gloomy recesses besides had he entertained any feeling of hesita tion it might have been prolonged indefinitely for there was no indication by which to determine on a choice it was absolutely necessary to trust to chance and good fortune the descent of this obscure and narrow gallery was very gradual and winding sometimes we gazed through a succession of arches its course very like in the first installment we got our travelers well started on their way to the internal cavities of the globe they have reached iceland have climbed mount sneffels and with a stolid icelander for a guideâor rather com panionâhave penetrated down through the crater of the volcano and have started their adventurous and exciting trip but now wonders really begin to happenâstrange forms of prehistoric life are encountered ami dangers are met with but our travelers gel through all their troubles in the end and come back to tell us all about it jules vernes astonishing scientific knowledge combined with his talents as a narrator gives the novel great value from a scientific as well as from a literary standpoint few authors could write so vivid a description of adven ture fewer yet could fill it with such correct science follow our travelers through these exciting chapters the aisles of a gothic cathedral the great artistic sculptors and builders of the middle ages might have here completed their studies with advantage many most beautiful and suggestive ideas of archi tectural beauty would have been discovered by them after passing through this phase of the cavernous way we suddenly came about a mile farther on upon a square system of arch such as that adopted by the early romans projecting from the solid rock and keeping up the weight of the roof suddenly we came upon a series of low subterranean tunnels which looked like beaver holes or the work of foxes through these nar row and winding ways we had literally to crawl the heat still remained at quite a supportable degree with an involun tary shudder i reflected oil what the heat must have been when the vol cano of sneffels was pour ing its smoke flames and streams of melted lavaâ all of which must have come up by the road we were now following i could imagine the torrents of hot seething stone darting on bubbling up with accompaniments of smoke steam and sulphurous stench only to think of the consequences i mused if the old volcano were once more to get to work i did not communicate these rather unpleasant reflections to my uncle his only idea was to go ahead he walked he slid he clambered over piles of fragments he rolled down heaps of broken lava with an earnestness and conviction it was impossi ble not to admire amazing stories at six oclock in the evening after a very weari some journey but one not so tiring as before we had made six miles towards the southward but had not gone more than a mile downwards my uncle as usual gave the signal to halt we ate our meal in thoughtful silence and then retired to sleep our arrangements for the night were very primitive and simple a traveling rug in which each rolled himself was all our bedding we had no necessity to fear cold or any unpleasant visit travelers who bury themselves in the wilds and depths of the african desert who seek profit and pleasure in the forests of the new world are com pelled to take it in turn to watch during the hours of sleep but in this region of the earth absolute soli tude and complete security reigned supreme after a nights sweet repose we awoke fresh and ready for action there being nothing to detain us we started on our journey we continued to burrow through the lava tunnel as before it was impossi ble to make out through what soil we were making way the tunnel moreover instead of going down into the bowels of the earth became absolutely hori zontal i even thought after some examination that we were actually tending upwards about ten oclock in the day this state of things became so clear that finding the change very fatiguing i was obliged to slacken my pace and finally to come to a halt well said the professor quickly what is the matter the fact is i am dreadfully tired was my earnest reply what cried my uncle tired after a three hours walk and by so easy a road easy enough i dare say but very fatiguing but how can that be when all we have to do is to go downwards i beg your pardon sir for some time i have noticed that we are going upwards upwards cried my uncle shrugging his shoulders how can that be there can be no doubt about it for the last half hour the slopes have been upwardâand if we go on in this way much longer we shall find ourselves back in iceland my uncle shook his head with the air of a man who does not want to be convinced i tried to con tinue the conversation he would not answer me but once more gave the signal of departure his silence i thought was only caused by concentrated illtemper however this might be i once more took up my load and resolutely followed hans who was now in advance of my uncle i did not like to be beaten or even distanced the very idea of being left behind lost in that terrible labyrinth made me shiver as with the ague besides if the ascending path was more arduous and painful to clamber i had one source of secret consolation and delight it was to all appearance taking us back to the surface of the earth that in itself was hopeful every step i took confirmed me in my belief and i began already to build castles in the air in relation to my marriage with my pretty little cousin about twelve oclock there was a great and sudden change in the aspect of the rocky sides of the gal lery i first noticed it from the diminution of the rays of light which cast back the reflection of the lamp from being coated with shining and re splendent lava it became living rock the sides were sloping walls which sometimes became almost vertical we were now in what the geological pro fessors call a state of transition in the period of silurian rocks i can see clearly now i cried the sediment from the waters which once covered the whole earth formed during the second period of its existence these schists and these calcareous rocks we are turning our backs on the granite rocks i might just as well have kept my observations to myself my geological enthusiasm got the better of my cooler judgment however and professor ilardwigg heard my observations what is the matter now he said in a tone of great gravity well cried i do you not see these different layers of calcareous rocks and the first indication of slate strata well what then we have arrived at that period of the worlds existence when the first plants and the first animals made their appearance you think so yes look examine and judge for yourself i induced the professor with some difficulty to cast the light of his lamp on the sides of the long wind ing gallery i expected some exclamation to burst from his lips i was very much mistaken the worthy professor never spoke a word it was impossible to say whether he understood me or not perhaps it was possible that in his pride âmy uncle and a learned professorâhe did not like to own that he was wrong in having chosen the eastern tunnel or was he determined at any price to go to the end of it it was quite evident we had left the region of lava and that the road by which we were going could not take us back to the great crater of mount sneffels at all events if i am right i thought to myself i must certainly find some remains of primitive plants and it will be absolutely necessary to give way to such indubita ble evidence let us have a good search i accordingly lost opportunity of searching and had not gone more than about a hundred yards when the evidence i sought for cropped up in the most incontestable manner before my eyes it was quite natural that i should expect to find these signs for during the silurian period the seas contained no fewer than fifteen hundred different animal and veg etable species my feet so long accustomed to the hard and arid lava soil suddenly found themselves treading on a kind of soft dust the remains of plants and shells upon the walls themselves i could clearly make out the outline as plain as a sun picture of the fucus and the lycopods the worthy and excellent professor hardwigg could not of course make any mistake about the matter but i believe he deliberately closed his eyes as he con tinued on his way with a firm and unalterable step i began to think he was carrying his obstinacy a great deal too far i could no longer act with prudence or composure i stooped on a sudden and picked up an almost perfect shell which had un doubtedly belonged to some animalvery much re sembling some of the present day having secured the prize i followed in the wake of my uncle do you see this i said a trip to the center of the earth well said the professor with the most im perturbable tranquility it is the shell of a crus taceous animal of the extinct order of the trilobites nothing more i assure you but cried i much troubled at his coolness do you draw no conclusion from it well if i may ask what conclusion do you draw from it yourself well i thought i know my boy what you would say and you are right perfectly and incontestably right we have finally abandoned the crust of lava and the road by which the lava ascended it is quite possi ble that i may have been mistaken but i shall be unable to discover my error until i get to the end of this gallery you are quite right as far as that is concerned i replied and i should highly approve of your decision if we had not to fear the greatest of all dangers and what is that want of water well my dear harry it cant be helped we must put ourselves on rations and on he went chapter xvii deeper and deeperâthe coal mine in truth we were compelled to put ourselves upon rations our supply would certainly last not more than three days i found this out about supper time the worst part of the matter was that in what is called the transition rocks it was hardly to be expected that we should meet with water i had read of the horrors of thirst and i knew that where we were a brief trial of its suffer ings would put an end to our adventuresâand our lives but it was utterly useless to discuss the mat ter with my uncle he would have answered by some axiom from plato during the whole of the next day we proceeded on our journey through this interminable gallery arch after arch tunnel after tunnel we journeyed without exchanging a word we had become as mute and reticent as hans our guide the road had no longer an upward tendency at all events if it had it was not to be made out very clearly sometimes there could be no doubt that we were going downwards but this inclination was scarcely to be distinguished and was by no means reassur ing to the professor because the character of the strata was in no wise modified and the transition character of the rocks became more and more marked it was a glorious sight to see how the electric light brought out the sparkles in the walls of the calcareous rocks and the old red sandstone one might have fancied himself in one of those deep cut tings in devonshire which have given their name to this kind of soil some magnificent specimens of marble projected from the sides of the gallery some of an agate gray with white veins of variegated character others of a yellow spotted color with red veins farther off might be seen samples of color in which cherrytinted seams were to be found in all their brightest shades the greater number of these marbles were stamped with the marks of primitive animals since the previous evening nature and creation had made considerable progress instead of the rudimentary trilobites i perceived the remains of a more per fect order among others the fish in which the eye of a geologist has been able to discover the first form of the reptile it was quite evident to me that we were ascending the scale of animal life of which man forms the summit my excellent uncle the professor appeared not to take notice of these warnings he was determined at any risk to pro ceed he must have been in expectation of one of two things either that a vertical well was about to open under his feet and thus allow him to continue his descent or that some insurmountable obstacle would compel us to stop and go back by the road we had so long traveled but evening came again and to my horror neither hope was destined to be realized on friday after a night when i began to feel the gnawing agony of thirst and when in consequence appetite decreased our little band rose arid once more followed the turnings and windings the as cents and descents of this interminable gallery all were silent and gloomy i could see that even my uncle felt that we had adventured too far after about ten hours of further progressâa progress dull and monotonous to the last degreeâi remarked that the reverberation and reflection oigt our lamps upon the sides of the tunnel had singu larly diminished the marble the schist the cal careous rocks the red sandstone had disappeared leaving in their places a dark and gloomy wall som bre and without brightness when we reached a remarkably narrow part of the tunnel i leaned my left hand against the rock when i took my hand away and happened to glance at it it was guite black we had reached the coal strata of the cen tral earth a coal mine i cried a coal mine without miners responded my uncle a little severely how can we tell i can tell replied my uncle in a sharp and doctorial tone i am perfectly certain that this gal lery through successive layers of coal was not cut by the hand of man but whether it is the work of nature or not is of little concern to us the hour for our evening meal has comeâlet us sup hans the guide occupied himself in preparing food i had come to that point where i could no longer eat all i cared about were the few drops of water which fell to my share what i suffered it is useless to record the guides gourd not guite half full was all that was left for us three hav ing finished their repast my two companions laid themselves down upon their rugs and found in sleep a remedy for their fatigue and sufferings as for me i could not sleep i lay counting the hours until morning the next morning saturday at oclock we start ed again twenty minutes later we suddenly came upon a vast excavation from its mighty extent i saw at once that the hand of man could have had nothing to do with this coal mine the vault above would have fallen in even now it was only held to gether by some miracle of nature this mighty natural cavern was about a hundred feet wide by amazing stories about a hundred and fifty high the earth had evi dently been forced apart by some violent subter ranean commotion the mass giving way to a pro digious upheaving of nature had split in two leav ing the vast gap into which we inhabitants of the earth had penetrated for the first time the whole singular history of the coal period was written on those dark and gloomy walls a geolo gist would have been able easily to follow the differ ent phases of its formation the seams of coal were separated by strata of sandstone and by a compact clay which appeared to be crushed down by the weight from above while we still continued our journey i forgot the length of the road by giving myself up wholly to these geological considerations the temperature continued to be very much the same as while we were traveling amid the lava and the schists on the other hand my sense of smell was much affected by a very powerful odor i immediately knew that the gallery was filled to overflowing with that dan gerous gas the miners call firedamp the explosion of which has caused such fearful and terrible acci dents making a hundred widows and hundreds of orphans in a single hour happily we could illuminate our progress by means of the ruhmkorf apparatus if we had been so rash and imprudent as to explore this gallery torch in hand a terrible explosion would have put an end to our travels simply because no travelers would be left our excursion through this wondrous coal mine in the very bowels of the earth lasted until evening my uncle was scarcely able to conceal his impatience and dissatisfaction at the road continuing still to advance in a horizontal direction the darkness dense and opaque a few yards in advance and in the rear rendered it impossible to make out what was the length of the gallery for myself i began to believe that it was simply interminable and would go on in the same manner for months suddenly however at six oclock we stood in front of a wall to the right to the left above be low nowhere was there any passage we had reach ed a spot where the rocks said in unmistakable ac centsâno thoroughfare i stood stupefied the guide simply folded his arms my uncle was silent well well so much the better cried my uncle at last i now know what we are about we are decidedly not upon the road followed by saknussem all we have to do is to go back let us take one nights good rest and before three days are over i promise you we shall have regained the point where the galleries divided yes we may if our strength lasts as long i cried in a lamentable voice and why not tomorrow among us three there will not be a drop of water it is just gone and your courage with it said my uncle speak ing in a severe tone what could i say i turned round on my side and from sheer exhaustion fell into a heavy but troubled sleep dreams of water and i awoke unrefreshed i would have bartered a diamond mine for a glass of pure spring water chapter xviii the wrong road next day our departure took place at a very early hour there was no time for the least delay according to my account we had five days hard work to get back to the place where the galleries divided i can never tell all the sufferings we endured upon our return my uncle bore them like a man who has been in the wrongâthat is with concen trated and suppressed anger hans with all the resignation of his pacific character and iâi con fess that i did nothing but complain and despair i had no heart for this bad fortune but there was one consolation defeat at the outset would probably upset the whole journey as i had expected from the first our supply of water gave out completely on our first days march our provision of liquids was reduced to our supply of schiedam but this horribleânay i will say itâthis infernal liquor burnt the throat and i could not even bear the sight of it i found the temperature to be stifling i was paralyzed with fatigue more than once i was about to fall insensible to the ground the whole party then halted and the worthy icelander and my excellent uncle did their best to console and comfort me i could however plainly see that my uncle was con tending painfully against the extreme fatigues of our journey and the awful torture generated by the absence of water then a time came when i ceased to recollect anythingâwhen all was one awful hideous fantastic dream at last on tuesday the eighth of the month of july after crawling on our hands and knees for many hours more dead than alive we reached the point of junction between the galleries i lay like a log an inert mass of human flesh on the arid lava soil it was then ten in the morning hans and my uncle leaning against the wall tried to nibble away at some pieces of biscuit while deep groans and sighs escaped from my scorched and swollen lips then i fell off into a kind of deep lethargy presently i felt my uncle approach and lift me up tenderly in his arms poor boy i heard him say in a tone of deep commiseration i was profoundly touched by these words being by no means accustomed to signs of womanly weak ness in the professor i caught his trembling hands in mine and gave them a gentle pressure he allowed me to do so without resistance look ing at me kindly all the time his eyes were wet with tears i then saw him take the gourd which he wore at his side to my surprise or rather to my stupefaction he placed it to my lips drink my boy he said was it possible my ears had not deceived me was my uncle mad i looked at him with i am sure quite an idiotic expression i would not understand him i too much feared the counter action of disappointment drink he said again had i heard aright before i could ask myself the question a second time a mouthful of water cooled my parched lips and throatâone mouthful but i do believe it brought me back to life i a trip to the center of the earth thanked my uncle by clasping his hands my heart was too full to speak yes said he one mouthful of water the very lastâdo you hear my boyâthe very last i have guarded it at the bottom of my bottle as the apple of my eye twenty times a hundred times i have resisted the fearful desire to drink it butânoâ no harry i saved it for you my dear uncle i exclaimed and the big tears rolled down my hot and feverish cheeks yes my poor boy i knew that when you reached this place this cross road in the earth you would fall down half dead and i saved my last drop of water in order to restore you thanks i cried thanks from my heart as little as my thirst was really quenched i had nevertheless partially recovered my strength the contracted muscles of my throat relaxedâand the inflammation of my lips in some measure subsided at all events i was able to speak well i said there can be no doubt now as to what we have to do water has utterly failed us our journey is therefore at an end let us return while i spoke thus my uncle evidently avoided my face he held down his head his eyes were turned in every possible direction but the right one yes i continued getting excited by my own words we must go back to sneffels may heaven give us strength to enable us once more to revisit the light of day would that we now stood on the summit of the crater go back said my uncle speaking to himselfâ and must it be so go backâyes and without losing a single mo ment i vehemently cried for some moments there was silence under that dark and gloomy vault so my dear harry said the professor in a very singular tone of voice those few drops of water have not sufficed to restore your energy and courage courage i cried i see that you are quite as downcast as beforeâ and still give way to discouragement and despair what then was the man made of and what other projects were entering his fertile and audacious brain you are not discouraged sir what give up just as we are on the verge of success he cried never never shall it be said that professor hardwigg retreated then we must make up our minds to perish i cried with a helpless sigh no harry my boy certainly not go leave me i am very far from desiring your death take hans with you i will go on alone you ask us to leave you leave me i say i have undertaken this danger ous and perilous adventure i will carry it to the endâorâi will never return to the surface of mother earth goâharryâonce more i say to you fâgo my uncle as he spoke was terribly excited his voice which before had been tender almost woman ly became harsh and menacing he appeared to be struggling with desperate energy against the im possible i did not wish to abandon him at the bot tom of that abyss while on the other hand the in stinct of preservation told me to fly meanwhile our guide was looking on with pro found calmness and indifference he appeared to be an unconcerned party and yet he perfectly well knew what was going on between us our gestures sufficiently indicated the different roads each wished to followâand which each tried to influence the other to undertake but hans appeared not to take the slightest interest in what was really a question of life and death for us all but waited quite ready to obey the signal which should say go aloft or to resume his desperate journey to the interior of the earth how i wished then with all my heart and soul that i could make him understand my words my repre sentations my sighs and groans the earnest accents in which i should have spoken would have convinced that cold hard nature those fearful dangers and perils of which the stolid guide had no idea i would have pointed them out to himâi would as it were have made him see and feel between us we might have convinced the obstinate professor if the worst had come to the worst we could have compel led him to return to the summit of sneffels i ap proached hans i caught his hand in mine he never moved a muscle i indicated to him the road to the top of the crater he remained motionless my panting form my haggard countenance must have indicated the extent of my sufferings the icelander gently shook his head and pointed to my uncle master he said the master i cried beside myself with furyâ madman noâi tell you he is not the master of our lives we must fly we must drag him with us do you hear me do you understand me i say i have already explained that i held hans by the arm i tried to make him rise from his seat i struggled with him and tried to force him away my uncle now interposed my good harry be calm he said you will obtain nothing from my devoted follower therefore listen to what i have to say i folded my arms as well as i could and looked my uncle in the face this wretched want of water he said is the sole obstacle to the success of my project in the entire gallery composed of lava schist and coal it is true we found not one liquid molecule it is quite possible that we may be more fortunate in the western tunnel my sole reply was to shake my head with an air of incredulity listen to me to the end said the professor in his well known lecturing voice while you lay yon der without life or nation i undertook a recon noitering journey into the conformation of this other gallery i have discovered that it goes direct ly downwards into the bowels of the earth and in a few hours will take us to the old granitic formation in this we shall undoubtedly find innumerable springs the nature of the rock makes this a mathe matical certainty and instinct agrees with logic to say that it is so now this is the serious proposi tion which i have to make to you when christo pher columbus asked of his men three days to dis cover the land of promise his men ill terrified and hopeless yet gave him three daysâand the new world was discovered now i the christopher columbus of this subterranean region only ask of you one more day if when that time is expired i amazing stories have not found the water of which we are in search i swear to you i will give up my mighty enterprise and return to the earths surface despite my irritation and despair i knew how much it cost my uncle to make this proposition and to hold such conciliatory language under the cir cumstances what could i do but yield well i cried let it be as you wish and may heaven reward your superhuman energy but as our hours are numbered unless we discover water let us lose no time but go ahead chapter xix the western galleryâa new route our descent was now resumed by means of the second gallery hans took up his post in front as usual we had not gone more than a hundred yards when the professor carefully examined the walls this is the primitive forma tionâwe are on the right roadâonwards is our hope when the whole earth got cool in the first hours of the worlds morning the diminution of the vol ume of the earth produced a state of dislocation in its upper crust followed by ruptures crevasses and fissures the passage was a fissure of this kind through which ages ago had flowed the eruptive granite the thousand windings and turnings formed an inextricable labyrinth through the an cient soil as we descended successions of layers composing the primitive soil appeared with the ut most fidelity of detail no mineralogists had ever found themselves placed in such a marvelous position to study nature in all her real and naked beauty the sounding rod a mere machine could not bring to the surface of the earth the objects of value for the study of its internal structure which we were about to see with our own eyes to touch with our own hands remem ber that i am writing this after the journey across the streak of the rocks colored by beauti ful green tints wound metallic threads of copper of manganese with traces of platinum and gold i could not help gazing at these riches buried in the entrails of mother earth of which no man would have the enjoyment to the end of time these treas uresâmighty and inexhaustible were buried in the morning of the earths history at such awful depths that no crowbar or pickax will ever drag them from their tomb the light of our ruhmkorfs coil in creased tenfold by the myriad of prismatic masses of rock sent their jets of fire in every direction and i could fancy myself traveling through a huge hol low diamond the rays of which produced myriads of extraordinary effects towards six oclock this fes tival of light began sensibly and visibly to decrease and soon almost ceased the sides of the gallery as sumed a crystallized tint with a somber hue white mica began to commingle more freely with feldspar and quartz to form what may be called the true rock âthe stone which is hard above all that supports without being crushed the four stories of the earths soil we were walled in by an immense prison of granite it was now eight oclock and still there was no sign of water the sufferings i endured were hor rible my uncle now kept at the head of our little column nothing could induce him to stop i mean while had but one real thought my ear was keenly on the watch to catch the sound of a spring but no pleasant sound of falling water fell upon my listen ing ear at last the time came when my limbs refused to longer carry me i contended heroically against the terrible tortures i endured because i did not wish to compel my uncle to halt to him i knew this would be the last fatal stroke suddenly i felt a deadly faintness come over me my eyes could no longer see my knees shook i gave one despairing cryâand fell help help i am dying my uncle turned and slowly retraced his steps he looked at me with folded arms and then allowed one sentence to escape in hollow accents from his lipsâall is over the last thing i saw was a face fearfully dis torted with pain and sorrow and then my eyes closed when i again opened them i saw my companions lying near me motionless wrapped in their travel ing rugs were they alseep or dead for myself sleep was wholly out of the question my fainting fit over i was wakeful as the lark i suffered too much for sleep to visit my eyelidsâthe more that i thought myself sick unto deathâdying the last words spoken by my uncle seemed to be buzzing in my earsâall is over it was probable that he was right in the state of prostration to which i was re duced it was madness to think of ever again seeing the light of day above were miles upon miles of the earths crust as i thought of it i could fancy the whole weight resting on my shoulders i was crushed annihilated and i exhausted myself in vain attempts to turn in my granite bed hours upon hours passed away a profound and terrible silence reigned around usâa silence of the tomb nothing could make itself heard through these gigantic walls of granite the very thought was stupendous presently despite my apathy despite the kind of deadly calm into which i was cast something aroused me it was a slight but peculiar noise while i was watching intently i observed that the tunnel was becoming dark then gazing through the dim light that remained i thought i saw the ice lander taking his departure lamp in hand why had he acted thus did hans the guide mean to abandon us my uncle lay fast asleepâor dead i tried to cry out and arouse him my voice feebly issuing from my parched and fevered lips found no echo in that fearful place my throat was dry my tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth the ob scurity had by this time become intense and at last even the faint sound of the guides footsteps was lost in the blank distance my soul seemed filled with anguish and death appeared welcome only let it come quickly hans is leaving us i cried hansâhans if you are a man come back these words were spoken to myself they could not be heard aloud moreover a moments reflection reassured me hans departure could not be a flight instead of ascending the gallery he was going deeper down into the gulf had he had any bad design his way would have been upwards a trip to the center of the earth this reasoning calmed me a little and i began to hope the good and peaceful and imperturbable hans would certainly not have arisen from his sleep without some serious and grave motive was he bent on a voyage of discovery during the deep still silence of the night had he at last heard that sweet murmur about which we were all so anxious chapter xx water where is it a bitter disappointment during a long long weary hour there crossed my wildly delirious brain all sorts of reasons as to what could have aroused our quiet and faithful guide the most absurd and ridiculous ideas passed through ray head each more impossible than the other i believe i was either half or wholly mad suddenly there arose as it were from the depths of the earth a voice of comfort it was the sound of footsteps hans was returning presently the uncertain light began to shine upon the walls of the passage and then it came in view far down the sloping tunnel at length hans him self appeared he approached my uncle placed his hand upon his shoulder and gently awakened him my uncle as soon as he saw who it was instantly rose well exclaimed the professor vatten said the hunter i did not know a single word of the danish lang uage and yet by a sort of mysterious instinct i un derstood what the guide had said water water i cried in a wild and frantic tone clapping my hands and gesticulating like a madman water murmured my uncle in a voice of deep emotion and gratitude hvar nedat where below i understood every word i had caught the hunter by the hands and i shook them heartily while he looked on with perfect calm ness the preparations for our departure did not take long and we were soon making a rapid descent into the tunnel an hour later we had advanced a thou sand yards and descended two thousand feet at this moment i heard an accustomed and wellknown sound running along the floors of the granite rockâ a kind of dull and sullen roar like that of a distant waterfall during the first halfhour of our advance not finding the discovered spring my feelings of in tense suffering returned once more i began to lose all hope my uncle however observing how down hearted i was again becoming took up the conver sation hans was right he exclaimed enthusi astically that is the dull roaring of a torrent a torrent i cried delighted at even hearing the welcome words theres not the slightest doubt about it he replied a subterranean river is flowing beside us i made no reply but hastened on once more ani mated by hope i did not even feel the deep fatigue which hitherto had overpowered me the very sound of this glorious murmuring water already re freshed me we could hear it increasing in volume every moment the torrent which for a long time could be heard flowing over our heads now ran dis tinctly along the left wall roaring rushing splut tering and still falling several times i passed my hand across the rock hoping to find some trace of humidityâof the slightest percolation alas in vain again a half hour passed in the same weary toil again we ad vanced it now became evident that the hunter during his absence had not been able to carry his researches any farther guided by an instinct peculiar to the dwellers in mountain regions and waterfinders he smelt the living spring through the rock still he had not seen the precious liquid he had neither quenched his own thirst nor brought us one drop in his gourd moreover we soon made the disastrous discov ery that if our progress continued we should sooii be moving away from the torrent the sound of which gradually diminished we turned back hans halted at the precise spot where the sound of the torrent appeared nearest i could bear the suspense and suffering no long er and seated myself against the wall behind which i could hear the water seething and effervescing not two feet away but a solid wall of granite still sep arated us from it hans looked keenly at me and strange enough for once i thought i saw a smile on his imperturb able face he rose from a stone on which he had been seated and took up the lamp i could not help rising and following he moved slowly along the firm and solid granite wall i watched him with mingled curiosity and eagerness presently he halted and placed his ear against the dry stone mov ing slowly along and listening with the most ex treme care and attention i understood at once that he was searching for the exact spot where the tor rents roar was most plainly heard this point he soon found in the lateral wall on the left side about three feet above the level of the tunnel floor i was in a state of intense excitement i scarcely dared believe what the eiderduck hunter was about to do it was however impossible in a moment more not to both understand and applaud and even to smother him in my embraces when i saw him raise the heavy crowbar and commence an attack upon the rock itself saved i cried yes cried my uncle even more excited and de lighted than myself hans is quite right oh the worthy excellent man we should never have thought of such an idea and nobody else i think would have thought of it such a process simple as it seemed would most certainly not have entered our heads nothing could be more dangerous than to begin to work with pickaxes in that particular part of the globe sup posing while he was at work a breakup were to take place and supposing the torrent once having gained an inch were to take an ell and come pour ing bodily through the brokein rock not one of these dangers was chimerical they were only too real but at that moment no fear of falling in of roof or even of inundation was cap able of stopping us our thirst was so intense that to quench it we would have dug below the bed of old ocean itself hans went quietly to workâa work which neither amazing stories my uncle nor i could have undertaken our impa tience was so great that if we had once begun with pickax and crowbar the rock would soon have split into a hundred fragments the guide on the con trary calm ready moderate wore away the hard rock by little steady blows of his instrument mak ing no attempt at a larger hole than about six inches as i stood i heard or thought i heard the roar of the torrent momentarily increasing in loud ness and at times i almost felt the pleasant sensa tion of water upon my parched lips at the end of what appeared an age hans had made a hole which enabled his crowbar to enter two feet into the solid rock he had been at work ex actly an hour it appeared a dozen i was getting wild with impatience my uncle began to think of using more violent measures i had the greatest difficulty in checking him he had indeed just got hold of his crowbar when a loud and welcome hiss was heard then a stream or rather a jet of water burst through the wall and came out with such force as to hit the opposite side hans the guide who was half upset by the shock was scarcely able to keep down a cry of pain and grief i understood his meaning when plung ing my hands into the sparkling jet i myself gave a wild and frantic cry the water was scalding hot boiling i cried in bitter disappointment well never mind said my uncle it will soon get cool the tunnel began to be filled by clouds of vapor while a small stream ran away into the interior of the earth in a short time we had some sufficiently cool to drink we swallowed it in huge mouthfuls oh what exalted delightâwhat rich and incom parable luxury what was this water whence did it come to us what was that the simple fact wasâ it was water and though still with a tinge of warmth about it it brought back to the heat that life which but for it must surely have faded away i drank greedily almost without tasting it fâť when i had almost quenched by ravenous thirst i made a discovery why it is ferruginous water most excellent stomachic replied my uncle and highly mineralized here is a journey worth twenty to spa its very good i replied i should think so water found six miles under ground there is a peculiarly inky flavor about it which is by no means disagreeable hans may con gratulate himself on having made a rare discovery what do you say nephew according to the usual custom of travelers to name the stream after him good said i and the name of hansbach was at once agreed upon hans was not a bit more proud after hearing our determination than he was before after having taken a very small modicum of the welcome refresh ment he had seated himself in a corner with his usual imperturable gravity now said i it is not worth while letting this water run to waste what is the use replied my uncle the source from which this river rises is inexhaustible never mind i continued let us fill our goat skin and gourds and then try to stop the opening up my plan after some hesitation was followed or attempted hans picked up all the broken pieces of granite he had knocked out and using some tow he happened to have about him tried to shut up the fissure he had made in the wall all he did was tc scald his hands the pressure was too great and ali our attempts were utter failures it is evident i remarked that the upper sur face of these springs is situated at a very great height aboveâas we may fairly infer from the great pressure of the jet that is by no means doubtful replied my uncle if this column of water is about thirtyiwo thous and feet high the pressure per square inch must be something enormous but a new idea has just struck me and what is that why be at so much trouble to close this aper ture because i hesitated and stammered having no real reason when our water bottles are empty we are not at all sure that we shall be able to fill them ob served my uncle i think that is very probable well then let this water run it will of course naturally follow in our track and will serve to guide and refresh us i think the idea a good one i cried in reply and with this rivulet as a companion there is no further reason why we should not succeed in our marvellous project ah my boy said the professor laughing after all you are coming round more than that i am now confident of ultimate success forward one moment nephew mine let us begin by taking some hours of repose i had utterly forgotten that it was night the chronometer however informed me of the fact soon we were sufficiently restored and refreshed and had all fallen into a profound sleep chapter xxi under the ocean by the next day we had nearly forgotten our past sufferings the first sensation i ex perienced was surprise at not being thirsty and i actually asked myself the reason the run ning stream which flowed in rippling wavelets at my feet was the satisfactory reply we breakfasted with a good appetite and then drank our fill of the excellent water i felt myself quite a new man ready to go anywhere my uncle chose to lead i began to think why should not a man as seriously convinced as my uncle succeed with so excellent a guide as worthy hans and so devoted a nephew as myself these were the bril liant ideas which invaded my brain had the prop osition now been made to go back to the summit of mount sneffels i should have declined the offer in a most indignant manner but unfortunately there was no question of going up we were about to descend farther into the interior of the earth let us be moving i cried awakening the echoes of the old world we resumed our march on thursday at eight oclock in the morning the great granite tunnel went round by sinuous and winding ways present a trip to the center of the earth ing every now and then sharp turns in fact it had all the appearance of a labyrinth its direction however was in general towards the southwest my uncle made several pauses in order to consult his compass the gallery now began to trend down wards in a horizontal direction with about two inches of fall in every furlong the murmuring stream flowed quietly at our feet i could not but compare it to some familiar spirit guiding us through the earth and i dabbled my fingers in its tepid water which sang like a naiad as we pro gressed my good humor began to assume a myth ological character as for my uncle he began to complain of the horizontal character of the road his route he found began to be indefinitely prolonged instead of sliding down the celestial ray according to his expression but we had no choice and as long as our road led towards the centerâhowever little progress we made there was no reason to complain moreover from time to time the slopes were much greater the naiad sang more loudly and we began to dip downwards in earnest i felt no further painful sen sation i had not yet recovered from the excitement of thediscovery of water that day and the next we did a considerable amount of horizontal and relatively very little ver tical traveling on friday evening the tenth of july according to our estimation we ought to have been thirty leagues to the southeast of reykjawik and about two leagues and a half deep we now re ceived a rather startling surprise under our feet there opened a horrible well my uncle was so delighted that he actually clapped his handsâas he saw how steep and sharp was the de scent ah ah he cried in rapturous delight this will take us a long way look at the projec tions of the rock hah he exclaimed its a fear ful staircase hans however who in all our troubles had neves given up the ropes took care so to dispose of thm as to prevent any accidents our descent thene gan i dare not call it a perilous descent fpr i was already too familiar with that sort of work to lookx upon it as anything but a very ordinary affair this well was a kind of narrow opening in the massive granite of the kind known as a fissure the con traction of the terrestrial scaffolding when it sud denly cooled had been evidently the cause if it had ever served in former times as a kind of fun nel through which passed the eruptive masses vom ited by sneffels i was at a loss to explain how it showed no mark we were in fact descending a spiral something like those winding staircases in use in modern houses we were compelled every quarter of an hour or thereabouts to sit down in order to rest our legs our calves ached we then seated ourselves on some projecting rock with our legs hanging over and gossiped while we ate a mouthfulâdrinking still from the pleasantly warm running stream which had not deserted us it is scarcely necessary to say that in this curi ously shaped fissure the hansbach had become a cascade to the detriment of its size but it was still sufficient and more than sufficient for our wants besides we knew that as soon as the declivity ceased to be so abrupt the stream must resume itrâť peaceful course at this moment it reminded me of my uncle his impatience and rage while when it flowed more peacefully i pictured to myself the placidity of the icelandic guide during the whole of two days the sixth and seventh of july we followed the extraordinary spiral staircase of the fissure penetrating two leagues farther into the crust of the earth which placed us five leagues below the level of the sea on the eighth however at twelve oclock in the day the fissure suddenly assumed a much more gentle slope still trending in a southeast direction the road now became comparatively easy and at the same time dreadfully monotonous it would have been difficult for matters to have turned out other wise our peculiar journey had no chance of being diversified by landscape and scenery at all events such was then my idea at length on wednesday the fifteenth we were actually seven leagues twentyone miles below the surface of the earth and fifty leagues distant from the mountain of sneffels though if the truth be told we were very tired our health had resisted all suffering and was most satisfactory our travelers box of medicaments had not even been opened my uncle was careful to note every hour the indica tions of the compass of the manometer and of the thermometer all of which he afterwards published in his elaborate philosophical and scientific account of our remarkable voyage he was therefore able to give an exact relation of the situation therefore when he informed me that we were fifty leagues in a horizontal direction distant from our starting point i couldnt suppress a loud exclamation what is the matter now cried my uncle nothing very important only an idea has en tered my head was my reply well out with it my boy it is my opinion that if your calculations are correct we are no longer under iceland do you think so we can very easily find out i replied pulling out the map and compasses you see i said after careful measurement that i am not mistaken we are far beyond cape portland and those fifty leagues to the southeast will take us into the open sea under the open sea cried my uncle rubbing his hands with a delighted air yes i cried no doubt the old ocean flows over our heads well my dear boy what can be more natural do you not know that in the neighborhood of new castle there are coal mines which have been worked far out under the sea now my worthy uncle the professor no doubt regarded this discovery as a simple fact but to me the idea was by no means a pleasant one and yet when one came to think the matter over seriously what mattered it whether the plains and mountains of iceland were suspended over our devoted heads or the mighty billows of the atlantic ocean the whole question rested on the solidity of the granite roof above us however i soon got used to the idea for the passage now level now running down and still always to the southeast kept going deeper amazing stories and deeper into the profound abysses of mother earth three days later on the eighteenth day of july on a saturday we reached a kind of vast grotto my uncle here paid hans his usual rixdollars and it was decided that the next day should be a day of rest chapter xxii sunday below ground i awoke on sunday morning without any sense of hurry and bustle attendant on an immediate departure though the day to be devoted to repose and reflection was spent under such strange circumstances and in so wonderful a place the idea was a pleasant one besides we all began to get used to this kind of existence i had almost ceased to think of the sun of the moon of the stars of the trees houses and towns in fact about any ter restrial necessities in our peculiar position we were far above such reflections the grotto was a vast and magnificent hall along its granitic soil the stream flowed placidly and pleasantly so great a distance was it now from its fiery source that its water was scarcely lukewarm and could be drunk without delay or difficulty after a frugal breakfast the professor made up his mind to devote some hours to putting his notes and calculations in order in the first place he said i have a good many to verify and prove in order that we may know our exact position i wish to be able on our return to the upper regions to make a map of our journey a kind of vertical section of the globe which will be as it were the profile of the expedition that would indeed be a curious work uncle but can you make your observations with anything like certainty and precision i can i have never on one occasion failed to note with great care the angles and slopes i am certain as to having made no mistake take the compass and examine how she points i looked at the instrument with care east one quarter southeast very good resumed the professor noting the observation and going through some rapid calcula tions i make out that we have journeyed two hundred and fifty miles from the point of our de parture then the mighty waves of the atlantic are roll ing over our heads certainly and at this very moment it is possible that fierce tempests are raging above and that men and ships are battling against the angry blasts just over our heads it is quite within the range of possibility re joined my uncle smiling and that whales are playing in shoals thrash ing the bottom of the sea the roof of our adaman tine prison be quite at rest on that point there is no dan ger of their breaking through but to return to our calculations we are to the southeast two hun dred and fifty miles from the base of sneffels and according to my preceding notes i think we have gone sixteen leagues in a downward direction sixteen leaguesâfifty miles i cried i am sure of it but that is the extreme limit allowed by science for the thickness of the earths crust i replied re ferring to my geological studies i do not contravene that assertion was his quiet answer and at this stage of our journey according to all known laws on the increase of heat there should be here a temperature of fifteen hundred degrees of reaumur there should beâyou say my boy in which case this granite would not exist but be in a state of fusion but you perceive my boy that it is not so and that facts as usual are very stubborn things over ruling all theories i am forced to yield to the evidence of my senses but i am nevertheless very much surprised what heat does the thermometer really indi cate continued the philosopher twentyseven sixtenths so that science is wrong by fourteen hundred and seventyfour degrees and fourtenths accord ing to which it is demonstrated that the propor tional increase in temperature is an exploded error humphrey davy here shines forth in all his glory he is right and i have acted wisely to believe him have you any answer to make to this statement had i chosen to speak i might have said a great deal i in no way admitted the theory of humphrey davyâi still held out for the theory of propor tional increase of heat though i did not feel it i was far more willing to allow that this chimney of an extinct volcano was covered by lava of a kind refractory to heatâin fact a bad conductorâwhich did not allow the great increase of temperature to percolate through its sides the hot water jet sup ported my view of the matter but without entering on a long and useless dis cussion or seeking for new arguments to contro vert my uncle i contented myself with taking up facts as they were well sir i take for granted that all your calculations are correct but allow me to draw from them a rigorous and definite conclusion go on my boyâhave your say cried my uncle goodhumoredly at the place where we now are under the lati tude of iceland the terrestrial depth is about fifteen hundred and eightythree leagues fifteen hundred eightythree and a quarter well suppose we say sixteen hundred in round numbers now out of a voyage of sixteen hundred leagues we have completed sixteen as you say what then at the expense of a diagonal journey of no less than eightyfive leagues exactly we have been twenty days about it exactly twenty days now sixteen is the hundredth part of our con templated expedition if we go on in this way we shall be two thousand days that is about five years and a half going down the professor folded his arms listened but did not speak without counting that if a vertical descent of a trip to the center of the earth sixteen leagues costs us a horizontal of eightyfive we shall have to go about eight thousand leagues to the southeast and we must therefore come out somewhere in the circumference long before ve can hope to reach the center bother your calculations cried my uncle in one of his old rages on what basis do they rest how do you know that this passage does not take us di rect to the end we require moreover i have in my favor fortunately a precedent what i have undertaken to do another has dons and he having succeeded why should i not be equally successful i hope indeed you will but still i suppose i may be allowed to you are allowed to hold your tongue cried pro fessor hardwigg when you talk so unreasonably as this i saw at once that the old doctorial professor was still alive in my uncleâand fearful to rouse his angry passions i dropped the unpleasant subject now then he explained consult the mano meter what does that indicate a considerable amount of pressure very good you see then that by descending slowly and by gradually accustoming ourselves to the density of this lower atmosphere we shall not suffer well i suppose not except it may be a certain amount of pain in the ears was my rather grim reply that my dear boy is nothing and you will easily get rid of that source of discomfort by bring ing the exterior air in communication with the air contained in your lungs perfectly said i for i had quite made up my mind in no wise to contradict my uncle i should fancy almost that i should experience a certain amount of satisfaction in making a plunge into this dense atmosphere have you taken note of how wonderfully sound is propagated of course i have there can be no doubt that a journey into the interior of the earth would be an excellent cure for deafness but then uncle i ventured mildly to observe this density will continue to increase yesâaccording to a law which however is scarcely defined it is true that the intensity of weight will diminish just in proportion to the depth to which we go you know very well that it is on the surface of the earth that its action is most powerfully felt while on the contrary in the very center of the earth bodies cease to have any weight at all i know that is the case but as we progress will not the atmosphere finally assume the density of water i know it when placed under the pressure of seven hundred and ten atmospheres cried my uncle with imperturbable gravity and when we are still lower down i asked with natural anxiety well lower down the density will become even greater still then how shall we be able to make our way through this atmospheric fog well my worthy nephew we must ballast our selves by filling our pockets with stones said pro fessor hardwigg faith uncle you have an answer for every thing was my own reply i began to feel that it was unwise in me to go any farther into the wide field of hypotheses for i should certainly have re vived some difficulty or rather impossibility that would have enraged the professor it was evident nevertheless that the air under a pressure which might be multiplied by thousands of atmospheres would end by becoming perfectly solid and that then admitting our bodies resisted the pressure we should have to stop in spite of all the reasoning in the world facts overcome all ar guments but i thought it best not to urge this argument my uncle would simply have quoted the example of saknussem supposing the learned icelanders journey ever really to have taken placeâthere was one simple answer to be madeâin the sixteenth century neither the barometer nor the manometer had been inventedâhow then could saknussem have been able to discover when he did reach the center of the earth this unanswerable and learned objection i kept to myself and bracing up my cour age awaited the course of eventsâlittle aware of how adventurous the incidents of our remarkable journey were yet to be the rest of this day of leisure and repose was spent in calculation and conversation i made it a point to agree with the professor in everything but i envied the perfect indifference of hans who with out taking any such trouble about the cause and ef fect went blindly onwards wherever destiny chose to lead chapter xxiii alone it must in all truth be confessed things as yet had gone on welland i should have acted in bad taste to have complained if our difficul ties did not increase it was within the range of possibility that we might ultimately reach the end of our journey then what glory would be ours i began in the newly aroused ardor of my soul to speak enthusiastically to the professor was i serious the whole state in which we existed was a mysteryâand it was impossible to know whether or not i was in earnest for several days after our memorable halt the slopes became more rapidâsome were even of a most frightful characterâalmost vertical so that we were forever going down into the solid interior mass during some days we actually descended a league and a half even two leagues towards the center of the earth the descents were sufficiently perilous and while we were engaged in them we learned fully to appreciate the marvelous coolness of our guide hans without him we should have been wholly lost the grave and impassible icelander de voted himself to us with the most incomprehensible sang froid and ease and thanks to him many a dangerous pass was got over where but for him we should inevitably have stuck fast his silence increased every day i think that we began to be influenced by this peculiar trait in his character it is certain that the inanimate objects by which you are surrounded have a direct action on the brain it must be that a man who shuts himself up between four walls must lose the faculty amazing stories of associating ideas and words how many persons condemned to the horrors of solitary confinement have gone madâsimply because the thinking fac ulties have lain dormant during the two weeks that followed our last inter esting conversation there occurred nothing worthy of being especially recorded i have while writing these memoirs taxed my memory in vain for one incident of travel during this particular period but the next event to be related is terrible in deed its very memory even now makes my soul shudder and my blood run cold it was on the seventh of august our constant and successive descents had taken us quite thirty leagues into the interior of the earth that is to say that there were above us thirty leagues nearly a hundred miles of rocks and oceans and continents and towns to say nothing of living inhabitants we were in a southeasterly direction about two hundred leagues from iceland on that memorable day the tunnel had begun to assume an almost horizontal course i was on this occasion walking on in front my uncle had charge of one of the ruhmkorf coils i had possession of the other by means of its light i was busy exam ining the different layers of granite i was com pletely absorbed in my work suddenly halting and turning round i found that i was alone well thought i to myself i have certainly been walking too fastâor else hans and my uncle have stopped to rest the best thing i can do is to go back and find them luckily there is very little ascent to tire me i accordingly retraced my steps and while doing so walked for at least a quarter of an hour rather uneasy i paused and looked eagerly around not a living soul i called aloud no reply my voice was lost amid the myriad cavernous echoes it aroused i began for the first time to feel seriously un easy a cold shiver shook my whole body and per spiration chill and terrible burst upon my skin i must be calm i said speaking aloud as boys whistle to drive away fear there can be no doubt that i shall find my companions there cannot be two roads it is certain that i was considerably ahead all i have to do is to go back having come to this determination i ascended the tunnel for at least half an hour unable to decide if i had ever seen certain landmarks before every now and then i paused to discover if any loud appeal was made to me well knowing that in that dense and intensified atmosphere i should hear it a long way off but no the most extraordinary silence reigned in this immense gallery only the echoes of my own footsteps could be heard at last i stopped i could scarcely realize the fact of my isolation i was quite willing to think that i had made a mistake but not that i was lost if i had made a mistake i might find my way if lostâi shuddered to think of it come come said i to myself since there is only one road and they must come by it we shall at last meet all i have to do is still to go upwards perhaps however not seeing me and forgetting i was ahead they may have gone back in search of me still even in this case if i make haste i shall get up to them there can be no doubt about the matter but as i spoke these last words gloud it would have been quite clear to any listenerâhad there been oneâthat i was by no means convinced of the fact moreover to associate together these simple ideas andto reunite them under the form of reason ing required some time i could not all at once bring my brain to think then another dread doubt fell upon my soul after all was i ahead of course was hans was no doubt following behind preceded by my uncle i perfectly recollect his having stopped for a mo ment to strap his baggage on his shoulder i now remembered this trifling detail it was i believed just at that very moment that i had determined to continue my route again thought i reasoning as calmly as was possible there is another sure means of not los ing my way a thread to guide me through the laby rinthine subterraneous retreatâone which i had forgottenâmy faithful river this course of reasoning roused my drooping spirits and i resolved to resume my journey with out further delay no time was to be lost it was at this moment that i had reason to bless the thoughtfulness of my uncle when he refused to allow the eider hunter to close the orifices of the hot springâthat small fissure in the great mass of granite this beneficient spring after having saved us from thirst during so many days would now en able me to regain the right road having come to this mental decision i made up my mind before i started upwards that ablution would certainly do me a great deal of good i stopped to plunge my hands and forehead in the pleasant water of the hansbach stream blessing its presence as a certain consolation conceive my horror and stupefactionâi was treading a hard dusty shingly road of granite the stream on which i reckoned had wholly dis appeared chapter xxiv lost no words in any human language can depict my utter despair i was literally buried alive with no other expectation before me than to die in all the slow horrible torture of hun ger and thirst mechanically i crawled about feel ing the dry and arid rock never to my fancy had i ever felt anything so dry but i frantically asked myself how had i lost the course of the flowing stream there could be no doubt it had ceased to flow in the gallery in which i now was i began to understand the cause of the strange silence which prevailed when last i tried if any appeal from my companions might perchance reach my ear it so happened that when i first took ail impru dent step in the wrong direction i did not perceive the absence of the allimportant stream it was now quite evident that when we halted another tunnel must have received the waters of the little torrent and that i had unconsciously entered a different gallery to what unknown depths had my compan ions gone where was i how to get back clue or landmark there was absolutely none my feet left no signs on the granite and shingle my brain throbbed with agony as i tried to discover the solution of this terrible a trip to the center of the earth problem my situation after all sophistry and re flection had finally to be summed up in three awful wordsâlost lost lost lost at a depth which to my infinite understand ing appeared to be immeasurable these thirty leagues of the crust of the earth weighed upon my shoulders like the globe on the shoulders of atlas i felt myself crushed by the awful weight it was in deed a position to drive the sanest man to madness i tried to bring my thoughts back to the things of the world so long forgotten it was with the great est difficulty that i succeeded in doing so ham burg the house on the konigstrasse my dear cousin gretchenâall that world which had before vanished like a shadow floated before my now vivid imagina tion there they were before me but how unreal under the influence of a terrible hallucination i saw the whole incidents of our journey pass before me like the scenes of a panorama the ship and its inmates iceland m fridriksson and the great summit of mount sneffels i said to myself that if in my position i retained the most faint and shadowy outline of a hope it would be a sure sign of approaching delirium it were better to give way wholly to despair in fact if i reasoned with calmness and philos ophy what human power was there in existence able to take me back to the surface of the earth and ready too to split asunder those huge and mighty vaults which stood above my head who could en able me to find my roadâand regain my compan ions insensate folly and madness to entertain even a shadow of hope oh uncle was my despairing cry this was the only word of reproach which came to my lips for i thoroughly understood how deeply and sor rowfully the worthy professor would regret my being lost and how in his turn he would patiently seek for me when i at last began to resign myself to the fact that no further aid was to be expected from mail and knowing that i was utterly powerless to do any thing for my own salvation i kneeled with earnest fervor and asked assistance from heaven the re membrance of my innocent childhood the memory of my mother known only in my infancy came well ing forth from my heart i had recourse to prayer and little as i had right to be remembered by him whom i had forgotten in the hour of prosperity and whom i so tardily invoked i prayed earnestly and sincerely this renewal of my youthful faith brought about a much greater amount of calm and i was en abled to concentrate all my strength and intelli gence on the terrible realities of my unprecedented situation i had about me that which i had at first wholly forgottenâthree days provisions more over my water bottle was quite full nevertheless the one thing which it was impossible to do was to remain alone try to find my companions i must at any price but which course should i take should i go upwards or again descend doubtless it was right to retrace my steps in an upward direc tion by doing this with care and coolness i must reach the point where i had turned away from the rippl ing stream i must find the fatal bifurcation or fork once at this spot once the river at my feet i could at all events regain the awful crater of mount sneffels why had i not thought of this be fore this at last was a reasonable hope of safety the most important thing then to be done was to discover the bed of the hansbach after a slight meal and a draught of water i rose like a giant refreshed leaning heavily on my pole i began the ascent of the gallery ttie slope was very steep and rather difficult but i advanced hopefully and carefully like a man who at last is making his way out of a forest and knows there is only one road to follow during one whole hour nothing happened to check my progress as i advanced i tried to recol lect the shape of the tunnelâto recall to my mem ory certain projections of rocksâto persuade my self that i had followed certain winding routes be fore but no one particular sign could i bring to mind and i was soon forced to allow that this gal lery would never take me back to the point at which i had separated myself from my companions it was absolutely without issueâa mere blind alley in the earth the moment at length came when facing the solid rock i knew my fate and fell inanimate on the arid floor to describe the horrible state of despair and fear into which i then fell would now be vain and im possible my last hope the courage which had sus tained me drooped before the sight ofthis pitiless granite rock lost in a vast labyrinth the sinuosi ties of which spread in every direction without guide clue or compass it was a vain and useless task to attempt flight all that remained to me was to lie down and die to lie down and die the most cruel and horrible of deaths in my state of mind the idea came into my head that one day perhaps when my fossil bones were found their discovery so far below the level of the earth might give rise to solemn and interesting scientific discussions i tried to cry aloud but hoarse hollow and inarticulate sounds alone could make themselves heard through my parched lips i literally panted for breath in the midst of all these horrible sources of an guish and despair a new horror took possession of my soul my lamp by falling down had gotten out of order i had no means of repairing it its light was already becoming paler and paler and soon would expire with a strange sense of resignation and despair i watched the luminous current in the coil getting less and less a procession of shadows moved flashing along the granite wall i scarcely dared to lower my eyelids fearing to lose the last spark of this fugutive light every instant it seemed to me that it was about to vanish and to leave me foreverâin utter darkness at last one final trembling flame remained in the lamp i followed it with all my power of vision i gasped for breath i concentrated upon it all the power of my soul as upon the last scintillation of light i was ever destined to see and then i was to be lost forever in cimmerian and tenebrous shades a wild and plaintive cry escaped my lips on earth during the most profound and comparatively complete darkness light never allows a complete destruction and extinction of its power light is so diffuse so subtle that it permeates everywhere amazing stories and whatever little may remain the retina of the eye will succeed in finding it in this place nothing ânot the faintest ray of light it mazed me my head was now wholly lost i raised my arms trying the effects of the feeling in getting against the cold stone wall it was painful in the extreme madness must have taken possession of me i knew not what i did i began to run to fly rushing at haphazard in this inextricable labyrinth always going downwards running wildly underneath the terrestrial crust like an inhabitant of the subter ranean furnaces screaming roaring howling un til bruised by the pointed rocks falling and picking myself up all covered with blood seeking madly to drink the blood which dripped from my torn fea tures mad because this blood trickled over my face and watching always for this horrid wall which ever presented to me the fearful obstacle against which i could but dash my head where was i going it was impossible to say several hours passed in this way after a long time having utterly exhausted my strength i fell a heavy inert mass along the side of the tunnel and lost all consciousness of existence chapter xxv the whispering gallery when at last i same back to a sense of life and being my face was wet but wet as i soon knewi with tears how long this state of insensibility lasted it is quite impossible for me to say i had no means left to me of taking any ac count of time never since the creation of the world had such a solitude as mine existed i was com pletely abandoned after my fall i had lost much blood i had felt myself flooded with the lifegiving liquid my first sensation was perhaps a natural one why was i not dead because i was alive there was something left to do i tried to make up my mind to think no longer as far as i was able i drove away all ideas and utterly oveicome by pain and grief crouched against the granite wall i commenced to feel the fainting coming on again with the sensation that this was the last struggle before complete annihilationâwhen on a sudden a violent uproar reached my ears it had some resemblance to the prolonged rumbling voice of thunder and i clearly distinguished sonorous voices lost one after the other in the distant depths of the gulf whence came this noise again i listened with deep attention i was extremely anxious to hear if the strange and inexplicable sound was likely to be renewed a whole quarter of an hour elapsed in painful expectation deep and solemn silence reigned in the tunnel so still that i could hear the beatings of my own heart i waited waited waited with a strange kind of hopefulness suddenly my ear which leaned accidentally against the wall appeared to catch the faintest echo of a sound i thought that i heard vague incoher ent and distant voices i quivered all over with ex citement and hope it must be hallucination i cried it cannot be it is not true but no by listening more attentively i really did convince myself that what i heard was the sound of human voices to make any meaning out of the sound however was beyond my power i was too weak even to hear distinctly still it was a positive fact that some one was speaking of that i was certain there was a moment of fear a dread fell upon my soul that it might be my own words brought back to me by a distant echo perhaps without knowing it i might have been crying aloud i res olutely closed my lips and once more placed my ear to the huge granite wall yes for certain it was in truth the sound of human voices i now by the exercise of great determination dragged myself along the sides of the cavern until i reached a point where i could hear more distinct ly but though i could detect the sound i could only make out uncertain strange and incompre hensible words they reached my ear as if they had been spoken in a low toneâmurmured as it were afar off at last i made out the word for lorad repeated several times in a tone betokening great mental anguish and sorrow what could this word mean and who was speak ing it it must be either my uncle or the guide hans if therefore i could hear them they must surely be able to hear me help i cried at the top of my voice help i am dying i then listened with scarcely a breath i panted for the slightest sound in the darknessâa cry a sigh a question but silence reigned supreme no answer came in this way some minutes passed a whole flood of ideas flashed through my mind i be gan to fear that my voice weakened by sickness and suffering could not reach my companions who were in search of me it must be they i cried what other men can by any possibility be buried a hundred miles below the level of the earth the mere supposition was preposterous i began therefore to listen again with the most breathless attention as i moved my ears along the side of the place i was in i found a mathematical point as it were where the voices ap peared to attain their maximum of intensity the word forlorad again distinctly reached my ear then came again that rolling noise like thunder which had awakened me out of torpor i begin to understand i said to myself after some little time devoted to reflection it is not through the solid mass that the sound reaches my ears the walls of my cavernous retreat are of solid granite and the most fearful explosion would not make uproar enough to penetrate them the sound must come along the gallery itself the place i was in must possess some peculiar acoustic prop erties of its own again i listened and this timeâyes this timeâ i heard my name distinctly pronounced cast as it were into space it was my uncle the professor who was speaking he was in conversation with the guide and the word which had so often reached my ears forlorad was a danish expression then i understood it all in order to make my self heard i too must speak as it were along the side of the gallery which would carry the sound of my voice just as the wire carries the electric fluid from point to point but there was no time to lose if my companions were only to remove a few feet from where they stood the acoustic effect a trip to the center of the earth would be over my whispering gallery would be de stroyed i again therefore crawled towards the wall and said as clearly and distinctly as i couldâ uncle hardwigg i then awaited a reply sound does not possess the property of traveling with such extreme rapidity besides the density of the air at that depth from light and motion was very far from adding to the rapidity of circulation several seconds elapsed which to my excited imag ination appeared ages and these words reached my eager ears and moved my wildly beating heartâ harry my boy is that you a short delay between question and answer yesâyes where are you lost and your lamp out but the guiding stream is lost keep your courage harry we will do our best one moment my uncle i cried i have no longer strength to answer your questions butâ for heavens sakeâdo youâcontinueâto speakâto me absolute silence i felt would be annihilation keep up your courage said my uncle as you are so weak do not speak we have been searching for you in all directions both by going upwards and downwards in the gallery my dear boy i had be gun to give up all hopeâand you can never know what bitter tears of sorrow and regret i have shed at last supposing you to be still on the road beside the hansbach we again descended firing off guns as signals now however that we have found you and that our voices reach each other it may be a long time before we actually meet we are convers ing by means of some extraordinary acoustic ar rangement of the labyrinth but do not despair my dear boy it is something gained even to hear each other while he was speaking my brain was at work re flecting a certain undefined hope vague and shape less as yet made by heart beat wildly in the first place it was absolutely necessary for me to know one thing i once more therefore leaned my head against the wall which i almost touched with my lips and again spoke uncle my boy was his ready answer it is of the utmost consequence that we should know how far we are asunder that is not difficult you have your chronometer at hand i asked certainly well take it into your hand pronounce my name noting exactly the second at which you speak i will reply as soon as i hear your wordsâ and you will then note exactly the moment at which my reply reaches you very good and the time between my question and your answer will be double the time occupied by my voice in reaching you that is exactly what i mean uncle was my eager reply are you ready yes well make ready i am about to pronounce your name said the professor i applied my ear close to the sides of the cavern ous gallery and as soon as the word harry reached my ear i turned round and placing my lips to the wall repeated the sound forty seconds said my uncle there has elapsed forty seconds between the two words the sound therefore takes twenty seconds to ascend now allowing a thousand and twenty feet for every secondâwe have twenty thousand and four hundred feetâa league and a half and oneeighth these words fell on my soul like a kind of death knell a league and ahalf i muttered in a low and despairing voice it shall be got over my boy cried my uncle in a cheery tone depend on us but do you know whether to ascend or descend i asked faintly enough you have to descend and i will tell you why we have reached a vast open space a kind of bare cross road from which galleries diverge in every direc tion that in which you are now lying must neces sarily bring you to this point for it appears that all these mighty fissures these fractures of the globes interior radiate from the vast cavern which we at this moment occupy rouse yourself then have courage and continue your route walk if you can if not drag yourself alongâslide if nothing else is possible the slope must be rather rapidâand you will find strong arms to receive you at the end of your journey make a start like a good fellow these words served to rouse some kind of cour age in my sinking frame farewell for the present good uncle i am about to take my departure as soon as i start our voices will cease to commingle farewell then until we meet again adieu harryâuntil we say welcome such were the last words which reached my anxious ears before i commenced my weary and almost hopeless journey this wonderful and surprising conversation which took place through the vast mass of the earths labyrinth these words exchanged the speak ers being about five miles apartâended with hope ful and pleasant expressions i breathed one more prayer to heaven i sent up words of thanksgiving âbelieving in my inmost heart that he had led me to the only place where the voices of my friends could reach my ears i accordingly rose to my feet but i soon found that i could not walk that i must drag myself along the slope as i expected was very rapid but i allowed myself to slip down soon the rapidity of the descent began to assume frightful proportions and menaced a fearful fall i clutched at the sides i grasped at projections of rocks i threw myself backwards all in vain my weakness was so great i could do nothing to save myself suddenly earth failed me i was first launched in to a dark and gloomy void i then struck against the projecting asperities of a vertical gallery a perfect well my head bounded against a pointed rock and i lost all knowledge of existence as far as i was concerned death had claimed me for his own amazing stories chapter xxvi a rapid recovery when i returned to the consciousness of ex istence i found myself surrounded by a kind of semiobscurity lying on thick and soft coverlids my uncle was watchingâhis eyes fixed intently on my countenance a grave expression on his face a tear in his eye at the first sigh which struggled from my bosom he took hold of my hand when he saw my eyes open and fix themselves upon his he uttered a loud cry of joy he lives he lives yes my good uncle i whispered my dear boy continued the grim professor clasping me to his heart you are saved i was deeply and unaffectedly touched by the tone in which these words were uttered and even more by the kindly care which accompanied them the professor was one of those men who must be severely tried in order to induce any display of af fection or gentle emotion at this moment our friend hans the guide joined us he saw my hand in that of my uncle and i venture to say that taci turn as he was his eyes beamed with lively satis faction god dag he said good day hans good day i replied in as hearty a tone as i could assume and now uncle that we are together tell me where we are i have lost all idea of our position as of everything else tomorrow harry tomorrow he replied to day you are far too weak your head is surrounded with bandages and poultices that must not be touched sleep my boy sleep and tomorrow you will know all that you require but i cried let me know what oclock it isâ what day it is it is now eleven oclock at night and this is once more sunday it is now the ninth of the month of august and i distinctly prohibit you from ask ing any more questions until the tenth of the same i was if the truth were told very weak indeed and my eyes soon closed involuntarily i did require a good nights rest and i went off reflecting at the last moment that my perilous adventure in the in terior of the earth in total darkness had lasted four days on the morning of the next day at my awaken ing i began to look around me my sleepingplace made of all our traveling bedding was in a charm ing grotto adorned with magnificent stalagmites glittering in all the colors of the rainbow the floor of soft and silvery sand a dim obscurity pre vailed no torch no lamp was lighted and yet cer tain unexplained beams of light penetrated from without and made their way through the opening of the beautiful grotto moreover i heard a vague and indefinite murmur like the ebb and flow of waves upon a strand and sometimes i verily believed i could hear the sighing of the wind i began to believe that instead of be ing awake i must be dreaming surely my brain had not been affected by my fall and all that oc curred during the last twentyfour hours was not the frenzied visions of madness and yet after some reflection a trial of my faculties i came to the conclusion that i could not be mistaken surely eyes and ears could not both deceive me it is a ray of the blessed daylight i said to my self which has penetrated through some mighty fissure in the rocks but what is the meaning of this murmur of waves this unmistakable moaning of the salt sea billows i can hear plainly enough the whistling of the wind but can i be altogether mis taken if my uncle during my illness has but car ried me back to the surface of the earth has he on my account given up his wondrous expedition or in some strange manner has it come to an end i was puzzling my brain over these and other questions when the professor joined me good day harry he cried in a joyous tone i fancy you are quite well i am very much better i replied actually sit ting up in my bed i knew that would be the result as you slept both soundly and tranquilly hans and i have each taken turn to watch and every hour we have seen visible signs of amelioration you must be right uncle was my reply for i feel as if i could do justice to any meal you could put before me i am really hungry you shall eat my boy you shall eat the fever has left you our excellent friend hans has rubbed your wounds and bruises with i know not what ointment of which the icelanders alone possess the secret and they have healed your bruises in the most marvelous manner ah hes a wise fellow is master hans while he was speaking my uncle was placing be fore me some articles of food which following his earnest injunctions i readily devoured as soon as the first rage of hunger was appeased i over whelmed him with questions to which he now no longer hesitated to give answers i then learned for the first time that my providential fall had brought me to the bottom of an almost perpendic ular gallery as i came down amidst a perfect shower of stones the last of which falling on mo would have crushed me to death they came to the conclusion that i had carried with me an entire dislocated rock riding as it were on this terrible chariot i was cast headlong into my uncles arms and into them i fell insensible and covered with blood it is indeed a miracle was the professors final remark that you were not killed a thousand times over but let us take care never to separate for surely we should risk never meeting again let us take care never again to separate these words fell with a sort of chill upon my heart the journey then was not over i looked at my uncle with surprise and astonishment my uncle after an instants examination of my countenance saidâwhat is the matter harry i want to ask you a very serious question you say that i am all right in health certainly you are and all my limbs are sound and capable of new exertions i asked most undoubtedly but what about my head was my next anxious question well your head except that you have one or two contusions is exactly where it ought to beâon your shoulder said my uncle laughing a trip to the center of the earth well my own opinion is that my head is not ex actly right in fact i believe myself slightly de lirious what makes you think so i will explain why i fancy i have lost my senses i cried have we not returned to the surface of mother earth certainly not then truly i must be mad for do i not see the light of day do i not hear the whistling of the wind and can i not distinguish the wash of a great sea and that is all that makes you uneasy said my uncle with a smile can you explain i will not make any attempt to explain for the whole matter is utterly inexplicable but you shall see and judge for yourself you will then find that geological science is as yet in its infancyâand that we are doomed to enlighten the world let us advance then i cried eagerly no longer able to restrain my curiosity wait a moment my dear harry he responded you must take precautions after your illness be bore going into the open air the open air yes my boy i have to warn you that the wind is rather violentâand i have no wish for you to ex pose yourself without necessary precautions but i beg to assure you that i am perfectly re covered from my illness have just a little patience my boy a relapse would be inconvenient to all parties we have no time to loseâas our approaching sea voyage may be of long duration sea voyage i cried more bewildered than ever yes you must take another days rest and we shall be ready to go on board by tomorrow re plied my uncle with a peculiar smile go on board the words utterly astonished me go on boardâwhat and how had we come upon a river a lake had we discovered some inland sea was a vessel lying at anchor in some part of the interior of the earth my curiosity was worked up to the very highest pitch my uncle made vain attempts to restrain me when at last however he discovered that my fever ish impatience would do more harm than goodâ and that the satisfaction of my wishes couldiftone restore me to a calm state of mind he gave way i dressed myself rapidlyâand then to please my uncle taking the precaution of wrapping myself in one of the coverlets i rushed out of the grotto chapter xxvii the central sea at first i saw absolutely nothing my eyes wholly unused to the effulgence of light could not bear the sudden brightness and i was compelled to close them when i was able to reopen them i stood still far more stupefied than aston ished not all the wildest effects of imagination could have conjured up such a scene the sea the sea i cried yes replied my uncle in a tone of pardonable pride the central sea no future navigator will deny the fact of my having discovered it and hence of acquiring a right of giving it a name it was quite true a vast limitless expanse of water the end of a lake if not of an ocean spread before us until it was lost in the distance the shore which was very much indented consisted of a beautiful soft golden sand mixed with small shells the long deserted homes of some of the crea tures of a past age the waves broke incessantly and with a peculiarly sonorous murmurâto be found in underground localities a slight frothy flake arose as the wind blew along the pellucid waters and many a dash of spray was blown into my face the mighty superstructure of rock which rose above to an inconceivable height left only a narrow marginâbutwhere we stood there was a long beach of strand on all sides were capes and promontories and enormous cliffs partially worn by the eternal breaking of the waves through countless ages and as i gazed from side to side the mighty rocks faded in the distance like a fleecy film of cloud it was in reality an ocean with all the usual characteristics of an inland sea only horribly wild âso rigid cold and savage one thing startled and puzzled me greatly how was it that i was able to look upon that vast sheet of water instead of being plunged in utter dark ness the vast landscape before me was lit up like day but there was wanting the dazzling brilliancy the splendid irradiation of the sun the pale cold illumination of the moon the brightness of the stars the illuminating power in this subterraneous region from its trembling and flickering character its clear dry whiteness the very slight elevation of its temperature its great superiority to that of the mpoh was evidently electric something in the na ture of the aurora borealis only that its phenomena were constant and able to light up the whole of the ocean cavern the tremendous vault above our heads the sky so to speak appeared to be composed of a conglom eration of nebulous vapors in constant motion i should originally have supposed that under such an atmospheric pressure as must exist in that place the evaporation of water could not really take place yet there were heavy and dense clouds rolling along that mighty vault partially concealing the roof electric currents produced astonishing play of light and shade in the distance especially around the heavier clouds deep shadows were cast beneath and then suddenly between two clouds there would come a ray of unusual beauty and remarkable in tensity yet it was not like the sun for it gave no heat the effect was sad and excruciatingly melancholy instead of a noble firmament of blue studded with stars there was above me a heavy roof of granite which seemed to crush me gazing around i began to think of the theory of the english captain who compared the earth to a vast hollow sphere in the interior of which the air is retained in a luminous state by means of atmospheric pressure while two stars pluto and proserpine circle there in their mysterious orbits after all suppose the old fellow was right in truth we were imprisonedâbound as it were in a vast excavation its width it was impossible to amazing stories make out the shore oil either hand widening rap idly until lost to sight while its length was equally uncertain a haze on the distant horizon bounded our view as to its height we could see that it must be many miles to the roof looking upward it was impossible to discover where the stupendous roof began the lowest of the clouds must have been floating at an elevation of two thousand yards a height greater than that of terrestrial vapors which circumstance was doubtless owing to the ex treme density of the air i use the word cavern in order to give an idea of the place i cannot describe its awful grandeur human language fails to convey an idea of its savage sublimity whether this singular vacuum had or had not been caused by the sudden cooling of the earth when in a state of fusion i could not say had read of most wonderful and gigantic cavernsâ but none in any way like this the great grotto of guachara in columbia visit ed by the learned humboldt the vast and partially explored mammoth cave in kentucky what were these holes in the earth compared to that in which i stood in speechless admiration with its vapory clouds its electric light and mighty ocean slumber ing in its bosom imagination not description can alone give an idea of the splendor and vastness of the cave i gazed at these marvels in profound silence words were utterly wanting to indicate the sensa tions of wonder i experienced i seemed as i stood upon that mysterious shore to be some wandering inhabitant of a distant planet present for the first time at the spectacle of some terrestrial phenomena belonging to another existence to give body and existence to such new sensations would have re quired the coinage of new wordsâand here my feeble brain found itself wholly inadequate i looked on thought i reflected i admired in a state of stupefaction not altogether unmingled with fear the unexpected spectacle restored some color to my pallid cheeks i seemed to be actually getting better under the influence of this novelty more over the vivacity of the dense atmosphere reani mated my body by inflating my lungs with unac customed oxygen it will be readily conceived that after an impri sonment of fortyseven days in a dark and miser able tunnel it was with infinite delight that i breathed this saline air it was like the genial reviving influence of the salt sea waves my uncle had already got over the first surprise with the latin poet horace his idea was thatâ not to admire is all the art i know to make man happy and to keep him so well he said after giving me time thoroughly to appreciate the marvels of this underground sea do you feel strong enough to walk up and down certainly was my ready answer nothing would give me greater pleasure well then my boy he said lean on my arm and we will stroll along the beach i accepted his offer eagerly and we began to walk along the shores of this extraordinary lake to our left were abrupt rocks piled one upon the otherâa stupendous titanic pile down their sidles leapt innumerable cascades which at last becom ing limpid and murmuring streams were lost in the waters of the lake light vapors which rose here and there and floated in fleecy clouds from rock to rock indicated hot springs which also poured their superfluity into the vast reservoir at our feet among them i recognized our old and faithful stream the hansbach which lost in that wild basin seemed as if it had been flowing since the creation of the world we shall miss our excellent friend i remarked with a deep sigh bah said my uncle testily what matters it that or another it ie all the same i thought the remark ungrateful and felt almost inclined to say so but i forbore at thismoment my attention was attracted by an unexpected spec tacle after we had gone about five hundred yards we suddenly turned a steep promontory and found ourselves close to a lofty forest it consisted of straight trunks with tufted tops in shape like para sols the air seemed to have no effect upon these treesâwhich in spite of a tolerable breeze remained as still and motionless as if they had been petrified i hastened forward i could find no name for these singular formations did they belong to the two thousand and more known treesâor were we to make the discovery of a new growth when we at last reached the forest and stood beneath the trees my surprise gave way to admiration in truth i was simply in the presence of a very ordinary prod uct of the earth of singular and gigantic propor tions my uncle unhesitatingly called them by their real names it is only he said in his coolest man ner a forest of mushrooms on close examination i found that he was not mistaken judge of the development attained by this product of damp hot soils i had heard that the lycoperdon giganteum reaches nine feet in cir cumference but here were white mushrooms nearly forty feet high and with tops of equal dimensions they grew in countless thousandsâthe light could not make its way through their massive substance and beneath them reigned a gloomy and mystic darkness still i wished to go forward the cold in the shades of this singular forest was intense for nearly an hour we wandered about in this dark ness visible at length i left the spot and once more returned to the shores of the lake to light and comparative warmth the amazing vegetation of this subterraneous region was not confined to gigantic mushrooms new wonders awaited us at every step we had not gone many hundred yards when we came upon a mighty group of other trees with discolored leaves âthe common humble trees of mother earth of an exorbitant and phenomenal size mosses a hundred feet high flowing ferns as tall as pines gigantic grasses astonishing magnificent splendid cried my uncle here we have before us the whole flora of the second period of the world that of transition behold the humble plants of our gardens which in the first ages of the world were mighty trees a trip to the center of the earth look around you my dear harry no botanist ever before gazed on such a sight my uncles enthusiasm usually a little more than was required was now excusable you are right uncle i remarked providence appears to have designed the preservation in this vast and mysteri ous hothouse of antediluvian plants to prove the sagacity of learned men in figuring them so mar velously on paper well said my boyâvery well said it is indeed a mighty hothouseâbut you would also be within the bounds of reason and common sense if you also addedâa vast menagerie i looked rather anxiously around if the animals were as exaggerated as the plants the matter would certainly be serious a menagerie doubtless look at the dust we are treading under footâbehold the bones with which the whole soil of the seashore is covered bones i replied yes certainly the bones of antediluvian animals i stooped down as i spoke and picked up one or two singular remains relics of a bygone age it was easy to give a name to these gigantic bones in some instances as big as trunks of trees here is clearly the lower jawbone of a masto don i cried almost as warmly and enthusiastically as my uncle here are the molars of the dinothe rium here is a legbone which belonged to the megatherium you are right uncle it is indeed a menagerie for the mighty animals to which these bones once belonged have lived and died on the shores of this subterranean sea under the shadow of these plants look yonder are whole skeletons âand yet and yet nephew said my uncle noticing that i suddenly came to a full stop i do not understand the presence of such beasts in granite caverns however vast and prodigious was my reply why not said my uncle with very much of his old professional impatience because it is well known that animal life only existed on earth during the second period when the sedimentary soil was formed by the alluviums and thus replaced the hot and burning rocks of the primitive age i have listened to you earnestly and with pa tience harry and i have a simple and clear answer to your objections and that is that this itself is a sedimentaiy soil how can that be at such enormous depth from the surface of the earth the fact can be explained both simply and geolo gically at a certain period the earth consisted only of an elastic crust liable to alternative up ward and downward movements in virtue of the law of attraction it is very probable that many a landslip took place in those days and that large portions of sedimentary soil were cast into huge and mighty chasms quite possible i dryly remarked but uncle if these antediluvian animals formerly lived in these subterranean regions what more likely than that one of these huge monsters may at this moment be concealed behind one of yonder mighty rocks as i spoke i looked keenly around examining with care every point of the horizon but nothing alive appeared to exist on these deserted shores i now felt rather fatigued and told my uncle so the walk and excitement were too much for me in my weak state i therefore seated myself at the end of a promontory at the foot of which the waves broke in incessant swells i looked around a bay formed by projections of vast granite rocks at the extreme end was a little port protected by huge pyramids of stones a brig and three or four schooners might have lain there with perfect ease so natural did it seem that every minute my imagi nation induced me to expect a vessel coming out under all sail and making for the open sea under the influence of a warm southerly breeze but the fantastic illusion never lasted more than a minute we were the only living creatures in this subterranean world during certain periods there was an utter cessa tion of wind when a silence deeper more terrible than the silence of the desert fell upon these soli tary and arid rocksâand seemed to hang like a leaden weight upon the waters of this singular ocean i sought amid the awful stillness to pene trate through the distant fog to tear down the veil which concealed the mysterious distance what unspoken words were murmured by my trembling lipsâwhat questions did i wish to ask and did not where did this sea endâto what did it lead should we ever be able to examine its distant shores but my uncle had no doubts about the matter he was convinced that our enterprise would in the end be successful for my part i was in a state of painful indecisionâi desired to embark on the journey and to succeed and still i feared the result after we had passed an hour or more in silent contemplation of the wondrous spectacle we rose and went down towards the bank on our way to the grotto which i was not sorry to gain after a slight repast i sought refuge in slumber and at length after many and tedious struggles sleep came over my weary eyes chapter xxviii launching the raft on the morning of the next day to my great surprise i awoke completely restored i thought a bath would be delightful after my long illness and sufferings so soon after ris ing i went and plunged into the waters of this new mediterranean the bath was cool fresh and in vigorating i came back to breakfast with an excellent appe tite hans our worthy guide thoroughly under stood how to cook such eatables as we were able to provide he had both fire and water at discre tion so that he was enabled slightly to vary the weary monotony of our ordinary repast our morn ing meal was like a capital english breakfast with coffee by way of a windup and never had this delicious beverage been so welcome and refreshing my uncle had sufficient regard for my state of health not to interrupt me in the enjoyment of the meal but he was evidently delighted when i had finished now then said he come with me it is the height of the tide and i am anxious to study its curious phenomena amazing stories what i cried rising in astonishment did you say the tide uncle certainly i did you do not mean to say i replied in a tone of respectful doubt that the influence of the sun and moon is felt here below and pray why not are not all bodies influ enced by the law of universal attraction why should this vast underground sea be exempt from the general law the rule of the universe be sides there is nothing like that which is proved and demonstrated despite the great atmospheric pressure down here you will notice that this in land sea rises and falls with as much regularity as the atlantic itself as my uncle spoke we reached the sandy shore and saw and heard the waves breaking monoton ously on the beach they were evidently rising this is truly the flood i cried looking at the water at my feet yes my excellent nephew replied my uncle rubbing his hands with the gusto of a philosopher and you see by these several streaks of foam that the tide rises at least ten or twelve feet it is indeed marvelous by no means he responded on the contrary it is quite natural it may appear so in your eyes my dear uncle was my reply but the whole group of phenomena of the place appear to me to partake of the mar velous it is almost impossible to believe that which i see who in his wildest dreams could have imagined that beneath the crust of our earth there cotld exist a real ocean with ebbing and flowing tides with its changes of winds and even its storms i for one should have laughed the suggestion to scorn but harry my boy why not inquired my uncle with a pitying smile is there any physical reason in opposition to it not if we give up the great theory of the cen tral heat of the earth that point once granted i certainly can see no reason for doubting the existence of seas and other wonders even coun tries in the interior of the globe that is soâbut of course these varied coun tries are uninhabited well i grant that it is more likely than not still i do not see why this sea should not have given shelter to some species of unknown fish hitherto we have not discovered any and the probabilities are rather against our ever doing so observed the professor i was losing my skepticism in the presence of these wonders well i am determined to solve the question it is my intention to try my luck with my fishing line and hook certainly make the experiment said my uncle pleased with my enthusiasm while we are about it it will certainly be only proper to discover all the secrets of this extraordinary region but after all where are we now i asked all this time i have quite forgotten to ask you a question which doubtless your philosophical in struments have long since answered well replied the professor examining the situation from only one point of view we are now distant three hundred and fifty leagues from ice land so much was my exclamation i have gone over the matter several times and am sure not to havo made a mistake of five hun dred yards replied my uncle positively and as to the directionâare we still going to the southeast yes with a western declination of nineteen degrees fortytwo minutes just as it is above as for the inclination i have discovered a very curious fact what may that be uncle your information interests me why that the needle instead of dipping towards the pole as it does on earth in the northern hemis phere has an upward tendency this proves i cried that the great point of magnetic attraction lies somewhere between the surface of the earth and the spot we have suc ceeded in reaching exactly my observant nephew exclaimed my uncle elated and delighted and it is quite prob able that if we succeed in getting toward the polar regionsâsomewhere near the seventythird degree of latitude where sir james ross discovered the magnetic pole we shall behold the needle point directly upward we have therefore discovered that this great center of attraction is not situated at a very great depth well said i rather surprised this discovery will astonish experimental philosophers it was never suspected science great mighty and in the end uner ring replied my uncle dogmatically science has fallen into many errorsâerrors which have been fortunate and useful rather than otherwise for they have been the steppingstones to truth after some further discussion i turned to an other matter have you any idea of the depth we have reached we are now continued the professor ex actly thirtyfive leaguesâabove a hundred milesâ down into the interior of the earth so said i after measuring the distance on the map we are now beneath the scottish highlands and have over our heads the lofty grampian hills you are quite right said the professor laugh ing it sounds very alarming the weight being heavyâbut the vault which supports this vast mass of earth and rock is solid and safeâthe mighty architect of the universe has constructed it of solid materials man even in his highest flights of vivid and poetic imagination never thought of such things what are the finest arches of our bridges what the vaulted roofs of our cathedrals to that mighty dome above us and beneath which floats an ocean with its storms and calms and tides i admire it all as much as you can uncle and have no fear that our granite sky will fall upon our heads but now that we have discussed mat ters of science and discovery what are your future intentions are you not thinking of getting back to the surface of our beautiful earth this was said more as a feeler than with any hope of suc cess go back nephew cried my uncle in a tone of a trip to the center of the earth alarm you are not surely thinking of anything so absurd or cowardly no my intention is to ad vance and continue our journey we have as yet been singularly fortunate and henceforth i hope we shall be more so but said i how are we to cross yonder liquid plain it is not my intention to leap into it head fore most or even to swim across it like leander over the hellespont but as oceans are after all only great lakes inasmuch as they are surrounded by land so does it stand to reason that this central sea is circumscribed by granite surroundings doubtless was my natural reply well then do you not think that when once we reach the other end we shall find some means of continuing our journey probably but what extent do you allow to this internal ocean i should fancy it to extend about forty or fifty leaguesâmore or less but even supposing this approximation to be a correct oneâwhat then i asked my dear boy we have no time for further dis cussion we shall embark tomorrow i looked around with surprise and incredulity i could see nothing in the shape of boat or vessel what i cried we are about to launch out upon an unknown sea and where if i may ask is the vessel to carry us well my dear boy it will not be exactly what you would call a vessel for the present we must be content with a good and solid raft a raft i cried incredulously but down here a raft is as impossible of construction as a vessel âand i am at a loss to imagine my good harryâif you were to listen instead of talking so much you would hear said my uncle waxing a little impatient i should hear yesâcertain knocks with the hammer which hans is now employing to make the raft he has been at work for many hours but where has he found trees suitable for such a construction he found the trees all ready to his hand come and you shall see our excellent guide at work more and more amazed at what i heard and saw i followed my uncle like one in a dream after a walk of about a quarter of an hour i saw hans at work on the other side of the promonotory which formed our natural port a few minutes more and i was beside him to my great surprise on the sandy shore lay a halffinished raft it was made from beams of a very peculiar wood and a great number of limbs joints boughs and pieces lay about sufficient to have constructed a fleet of ships and boats i turned to my uncle silent with astonishment and awe where did all this wood come from icried what wood is it well there is pinewood fir and the palms of the northern regions mineralized by the action of the sea he replied sententiously can it be possible yes said the learned professor what you see is called fossil wood but then cried i after reflecting for a moment like the agates it must be as hard and as heavy as stone and therefore will certainly not float sometimes that is the case many of these woods have become true anthracites but others again like those you see before you have only undergone one phase of fossil transformation but there is no proof like demonstration added my uncle picking one or two of these precious waifs and casting them into the sea the piece of wood after having disappeared for a moment came to the surface and floated about with the oscillation produced by wind and tide are you convinced said my uncle with a self satisfied smile i am convinced i cried that what i see is incredible the fact was that my journey into the interior of the earth was rapidly changing all preconceived notions and day by day preparing me for the mar velous i should not have been surprised to have seen a float of native canoes afloat upon that silent sea the very next evening thanks to the industry and ability of hans the raft was finished it was about ten feet long and five feet wide the beams bound together with stout ropes were solid and firm and once launched by our united efforts the improvised vessel floated tranquilly upon the waters of what the professor had well named the central sea chapter xxix on the watersâa raft voyage on the th of august we were up betimes there was no time to be lost we now had to inaugurate a new kind of locomotion which would have the advantage of being rapid and not fatiguing a mast made of two pieces of wood fastened together to give additional strength a yard made from another one the sail a linen sheet from our bed we were fortunately in no want of cordage and the whole on trial appeared solid and seaworthy at six oclock in the morning when the eager and enthusiastic professor gave the signal to em bark the victuals the luggage all our instruments our weapons and a goodly supply of sweet water which we had collected from springs in the rocks were placed on the raft hans had with consid erable ingenuity contrived a rudder which en abled him to guide the floating apparatus with ease he took the tiller as a matter of course the worthy man was as good a sailor as he was a guide and duckhunter i then let go the painter which held us to the shore the sail was brought to the wind and we made a rapid offing our sea voyage had at length commenced and once more we were making for distant and unknown regions just as we were about to leave the little port where the raft had been constructed my uncle who was very strong as to geographic nomenclature wanted to give it a name and among others sug gested mine well said i before you decide i have another to propose well out with it amazing stories i should like to call it gretchen port gretchen will sound very well on our future map well then port gretchen let it be said the professor and thus it was that the memory of my dear girl was attached to our adventurous and memorable expedition when we left the shore the wind was blowing from the northward and eastward we went di rectly before the wind at a much greater speed than might have been expected from a raft the dense layers of atmosphere at that depth had great propelling power and acted upon the sail with con siderable force at the end of an hour my uncle who had been making careful observations was enabled to estimate the rapidity with which we moved it was far beyond anything seen in the upper world if he said we continue to advance at our present rate we shall have traveled at least thirty leagues in twentyfour hours with a mere raft this is an almost incredible velocity i certainly was surprised and without making any reply went forward upon the raft already the northern shore was fading away on the edge of the horizon the two shores appeared to separate more and more leaving a wide and open space for our departure before me i could see nothing but the vast and apparently limitless seaâupon which we floatedâthe only living objects in sight huge and dark clouds cast their gray shadows belowâshadows which seemed to crush that color less and sullen water by theirweight anything more suggestive of gloom and of regions of nether darkness i never beheld silvery rays of electric light reflected here and there upon some small spots of water brought up luminous sparkles in the long wake of our cumbrous bark presently we were wholly out of sight of land not a vestige could be seen nor any indication of where we were going so still and motionless did we seem without any distant point to fix our eyes on tlat but for the phosphoric light at the wake of the raft i should have fancied that we were still and motionitfss but i knew that we were advancing at a very rapid rate about twelve oclock in the day vast collections of seaweed were discovered surrounding us on all sides i was aware of the extraordinary vegetative power of these plants which have been known to creep along the bottom of the great ocean and stop the advance of large ships but never were sea weeds ever seen so gigantic and wonderful as those of the central sea i could well imagine how seen at a distance tossing and heaving on the summit of the billows the long lines of algse have been taken for living things and thus have been the fertile sources of the belief in sea serpents our raft swept past great specimens of fucse or seawrack from three to four thousand feet in length immense incredibly long looking like snakes that stretched out far beyond our horizon it af forded me great amusement to gaze on their varie gated ribbonlike endless lengths hour after hour passed without our coming to the termination of these floating weeds if my astonishment increased my patience was wellnight exhausted what natural force could possibly have produced such abnormal and extraordinary plants what must have been the aspect of the globe during the first centuries of its formation when under the combined action of heat and humidity the vegetable kingdom occupied its vast surface to the exclusion of everything else these were considerations of neverending interest for the geologist and the philosopher all this while we were advancing on our journey and at length night came but as i had remarked the evening before the luminous state of the at mosphere was in nothing diminished whatever was the cause it was a phenomenon upon the du ration of which we could calculate with certainty as soon as our supper had been disposed of and some little speculative conversation indulged in i stretched myself at the foot of the mast and pres ently went to sleep hans remained motionless at the tiller allowing the raft to rise and fall on the waves the wind being aft and the sail square all he had to do was to keep his rudder amidships ever since we had taken our departure from the newly named port gretchen my worthy uncle had directed me to keep a regular log of our days navigation with instructions to put down even the most minute particulars every interesting and curious phenomenon the direction of the wind our rate of sailing the distance we went in a word every incident of our extraordinary voyage from our log therefore i tell the story of our voyage on the central sea friday august th a steady breeze from the northwest raft progressing with extreme ra pidity and going perfectly straight coast still dimly visible about thirty miles to leeward noth ing to be seen beyond the horizon in front the extraordinary intensity of the light neither in creases nor diminishes it is singularly stationary the weather remarkably fine that is to say the clouds have ascended very high and are light and fleecy and surrounded by an atmosphere resemb ling silver in fusion thermometer degrees centigrade about twelve oclock in the day our guide hans having prepared and baited a hook cast his line into the subterranean waters the bait he used was a small piece of meat by means of which he concealed his hook anxious as i was i was for a long time doomed to disappointment were these waters supplied with fish or not that was the im portant question noâwas my decided answer then there came a sudden and rather hard tug hans coolly drew it in and with it a fish which struggled violently to escape a fish cried my uncle putting on his spectacles to examine it it is a sturgeon i cried certainly a small sturgeon the professor examined the fish carefully not ing every characteristic and he did not coincide in my opinion the fish had a flat head round body and the lower extremities covered with bony scales its mouth was wholly without teeth the pec toral fins whieh were highly developed sprouted direct from the body which properly speaking had no tail the animal certainly belonged to the order in which naturalists class the sturgeon but it dif fered from that fish in many essential particulars my uncle after all was not mistaken after a long a trip to the center of the earth and patient examination he said this fish my dear boy belongs to a family which has been extinct for ages and of which no trace has ever been found on earth except fossil remains in the devonian strata you do not mean to say i cried that we have captured a live specimen of a fish belonging to the primitive stock that existed before the deluge we have said the professor who all this time was continuing his observations and you may see by careful examination that these fossil fish have no identity with existing species to hold in ones hand therefore a living specimen of the order is enough to make a naturalist happy for life more over this fish offers to our notice a remarkable peculiarity never known to exist in any other fish but those which are the natives of subterranean waters wells lakes in caverns and such like hid den pools and what may that be it is blind blind i cried much surprised not only blind continued the professor but absolutely without organs of sight i now examined our discovery for myself it was singular to be sure but it was really a fact this however might be a solitary instance i suggested the hook was baited again and once more thrown into the water this subterranean ocean must have been tolerably well supplied with fish for in two hours we took a large number of similar fish all without exception were blind this unexpected capture enabled us to renew our stock of provisions in a very satisfactory way we were now convinced that this subterranean sea contained only fish known to us as fossil speci mensâand fish and reptiles alike were all the more perfect the farther back they dated their origin we began to hope that we should find some of those saurians which science has succeeded in recon structing from bits of bone or cartilage i took up the telescope and carefully examined the horizonâ looked over the whole sea it was utterly and en tirely deserted doubtless we were still too near the coast after an examination of the ocean i looked up ward towards the strange and mysterious sky why should not one of the birds reconstructed by the immortal cuvier flap his stupendous wings aloft in the dull strata of subterranean air it would of course find quite sufficient food from the fish in the sea i gazed for some time upon the void above it was as silent and as deserted as the shores we had but lately left nevertheless though i could neither see nor dis cover anything my imagination carried me away into wild hypotheses i was in a kind of waking dream i thought i saw on the surface of the water those enormous antediluvian turtles as big as float ing islands upon those dull and somber shores passed a spectral row of the mammifers of early days the great leptotherium found in the cavern ous hollow of the brazilianhillsthe mesicotherium a native of the glacial regions of siberia farther on the pachydermatous lophrodon that gigantic tapir which concealed itself behind rocks ready to do battle for its prey with the anoplotherium a singular animal partaking of the nature of the rhin oceros the horse the hippopotamus and the camel i thoughtâsuch was the effect of my imagination âthat i saw this whole tribe of antediluvian crea tures i carried myself back to far ages long be fore man existedâwhen the earth was in too im perfect a state for him to live upon it the whole panorama of the worlds life before the historic period seemed to be born over again and mine was the only human heart that beat in this unpeopled world there were no more seasons there were no more climates the natural heat of the world in creased unceasingly and neutralized that of the great radiant sun next unrolled before me like a panorama came the great and wondrous series of terrestrial trans formations plants disappeared the granite rocks lost all trace of solidity the liquid state was sud denly substituted for that which had before ex isted this was caused by intense heat acting on the organic matter of the earth the waters flowed over the whole surface of the globe they boiled they were volatilized or turned into vapor a kind of steamcloud wrapped the whole earth the globe itself becoming at last nothing but one huge sphere of gas indescribable in color between white heat and red as big and as brilliant as the sun what an extraordinary dream where would it finally take me my feverish hand began to write down the marvelous detailsâdetails moie like the imaginings of a lunatic than anything sober and real i had during thiâ period of hallucination for gotten everythingâthe professor the guide and the raft on which we were floating my mind was in a state of semioblivion what is the matter harry said my uncle sud denly my eyes which were wide opened like those of a somnambulant were fixed upon him but i did not see him nor could i clearly make out anything around me take care my boy again cried my uncle you will fall into the sea as he uttered these words i felt myself seized on the other side by the firm hand of our devoted guide had it not been for the presence of mind of hans i must surely have fallen into the waves and been drowned have you gone mad cried my uncle shaking me on the other side whatâwhat is the matter i said at last com ing to myself are you ill harry continued the professor in an anxious tone noâno but i have had an extraordinary dream but it has passed away all now seems well i added looking around me with strangely puzzled eyes all right said my uncle a beautiful breeze a splendid sea we are going along at a rapid rate and if i amnot out in my calculations we shall soon see land i shall not be sorry to exchange the nar row limits of our raft for the mysterious strand of the subterranean ocean as my uncle uttered these words i rose and care fully scanned the horizon but the line of water was still confounded with the lowering clouds that hung aloft and in the distance appeared to touch the edge of the water amazing stories chapter xxx terrific saurian combat saturday august the sea still retains its uniform monotony the same leaden hue the same eternal glare from above no indi cation of land being in sight the horizon appears to retreat before us more and more as we advance my head is still dull and heavy from the effects of my extraordinary dream which i cannot as yet banish from my mind the professor who has not dreamed is however in one of his morose and un accountable humors spends his time in scanning the horizon at every point of the compass his telescope is raised every moment to his eyes and when be finds nothing to give any clew to our where abouts he assumes a napoleonic attitude and walks anxiously i remarked that my uncle the professor had a strong tendency to resume his old impatient char acter and i could not but make a note of this dis agreeable circumstance i saw clearly that it had required all the influence of my danger and suffer ing to extract from him one scintillation of hu mane feeling now that i was quite recovered his original nature had conquered and obtained the upper hand you seem uneasy uncle said i when for about the hundredth time he put down his telescope and walked up and down muttering to himself no i am not uneasy he replied in a dry harsh tone by no means perhaps i should have said impatient i replied softening the force of my remark enough to make me so i think and yet we are advancing at a rate seldom at tained by a raft i remarked what matters that cried my uncle i am not vexed at the rate we go at but i am annoyed to find the sea so much vaster than i expected i then recollected that the professor before our departure had estimated the length of this sub terranean ocean as at most about fifty leagues now we had traveled at least over thrice that dis tance without discovering any trace of the distant shore i began to understand my uncles anger we are not going down suddenly exclaimed the professor we are not progressing with our great discoveries all this is utter loss of time after all i did not come from home to undertake a party of pleasure this voyage on a raft over a pond annoys and wearies me he called this adventurous journey a party of pleasure and this great inland sea a pond but argued i if we have followed the route indicated by the great saknussem we cannot be going far wrong that is the question as the great the immor tal shakespeare has it are we following the route indicated by that wondrous sage did saknussem ever fall in with this great sheet of water if he did did he cross it i began to fear that the rivulet we adopted for a guide has led us wrong in any case we can never regret having come thus far it is worth the whole journey to have enjoyed this magnificent spectacleâit is something to have seen i care nothing about seeing nor about magni ficent spectacles i came down into the interior of the earth with an object and that object i mean to attain dont talk to me about admiring scenery or any other sentimental trash after this i thought it well to hold my tongue and allow the professor to bite his lips until the blood came without further remark at six oclock in the evening our matteroffact guide hans asked for his weeks salary and re ceiving his three rixdollars put them carefully in his pocket he was perfectly contented and satis fied sunday th august nothing new to record the same weather as before the wind has a slight tendency to freshen up with signs of an approach ing gale when i awoke my first observation was in regard to the intensity of the light i keep on fearing day after day that the extraordinary elec tric phenomenon should become first obscured and then go wholly out leaving us in total darkness nothing of this kind occurs however the shadow of the raft its mast and sails is clearly distinguish ed on the surface of the water this wondrous sea is after all immense in ex tent it must be quite as wide as the mediterra neanâor perhaps even as the great atlantic ocean why after all should it not be so my uncle has on more than one occasion tried deep sea soundings he tied one of our heaviest crowbars to the end of a cord which he allowed to run out to the extent of two hundred fathoms we had the greatest difficulty in hoisting in our novel kind of lead when the crowbar was finally dragged on board hans called my attention to some singular marks uponfits surface the piece of iron looked as if it had been crushed between two very hard substances i looked at our worthy guide with an inquiring glance taender said he of course i was at a loss to understand i turned round towards my uncle absorbed in gloomy re flections i had little wish to disturb him from his reverie accordingly turned once more toward our worthy icelander hans very quietly and signifi cantly opened his mouth once or twice as if in the act of biting and in this way made me understand his meaning teeth cried i with stupefaction as i examined the bar of iron with more attention yes there can be no doubt about the matter the indentations on the bar of iron are the marks of teeth what jaws must the owner of such molars be possessed of have we then come upon a mons ter of unknown species which still exists within the vast waste of watersâa monster more voracious than a shark more terrible and bulky than the whale i am unable to withdraw my eyes from the bar of iron actually halfcrushed is then my dream about to come trueâa dread and terrible reality all day my thoughts were bent upon these speculations and my imagination scarcely regained a degree of calmness and power of reflection until after a sleep of many hours this sunday as other sundays we observed as a day of rest and pious meditation monday august th i have been trying to realize from memory the particular instincts of tfiose antediluvian animals of the secondary period which succeeding to the mollusca to the crustacea a trip to the center of the earth and to the fish preceded the appearance of the race of manimifers the generation of reptiles then reigned supreme upon the earth these hideous monsters ruled everything in the seas of the sec ondary period which formed the strata of which the jura mountains are composed what a gigantic structure was theirs what vast and prodigious strength they possessed the existing saurians which include all such reptiles as lizards crocodiles and alligators even the largest and most formidable of their class are but feeble imitations of their mighty sires the animals of ages long ago if there were giants in the days of old there were also gigantic animals i shuddered as i evolved from my mind the idea and recollection of these awful monsters no eye of man had seen them in the flesh they took their walks abroad upon the face of the earth thousands of ages before man came into existence and their fpssil bones discovered in the limestone have al lowed us to reconstruct them anatomically and thus to get some faint idea of their colossal forma tion i recollect once seeing in the great museum of hamburg the skeleton of one of these wonderful saurians it measured no less than thirty feet from the nose to the tail am i then an inhabitant of the earth of the present day destined to find myself face to face with a representative of this ante diluvian family i can scarcely believe it possible can hardly believe it true and yet these marks of powerful teeth upon the bar of iron can there be a doubt from their shape that the bite is the bite of a crocodile my eyes stare wildly and with terror upon the subterranean sea every moment i expect one of these monsters to rise from its vast cavernous depths i fancy that the worthy professor in some measure shares my notions if not my fears for after an attentive examination of the crowbar he cast his eyes rapidly over the mighty and mysterious ocean what could possess him to leave the land i thought as if the depth of this water was of any importance to us no doubt he has disturbed some terrible monster in his watery home and perhaps we may pay dearly for our temerity anxious to be prepared for the worst i examined our weapons and saw that they were in a fit condition for use my uncle looked on at me and nodded his head ap provingly he too had noticed what we had to fear already the uplifting of the waters on the sur face indicates that something is in motion below the danger approaches it comes nearer and near er it behooves us to be on the watch tuesday august evening came at last the hour when the desire for sleep caused our eye lids to be heavy night there is not properly speak ing in this place any more than there is in sum mer in the arctic regions hans however is im movable at the rudder when he snatches a mo ment of rest i really cannot say i took advantage of his vigilance to take some little repose two hours after i was awakened from a heavy sleep by an awful shock the raft appeared to have struck upon a sunken rock it was lifted right out of the water by some wondrous and mysterious power and then started off twenty fathoms distant eh what is it cried my uncle starting up are we shipwrecked or what hans raised his hand and pointed to where about two hundred yards off a huge black mass was mov ing up and down i looked with awe my worst fears were realized it is a colossal monster i cried clasping my hands yes cried the agitated professor there yonder is a huge sea lizard of terrible size and shape and farther on behold a prodigious crocodile look at his hideous jaws and that row of monstrous teeth ha he has gone a whale a whale shouted the professor i can see his enormous fins see see how he blows air and water two liquid columns rose to a vast height above the level of the sea into which they fell with a ter rific crash waking up the echoes of that awful place we stood stillâsurprised stupefied terror stricken at the sight of what seemed a group of fearful marine monsters more hideous in the real ity than in my dream they were of supernatural dimensions the very smallest of the whole party could with ease have crushed our raft and ourselves with a single bite hans seizing the tiller which had flown out of his hand puts it hard aweather in order to escape from such dangerous vicinity butno sooner does he do so than he finds he is flying from scylla to charybdis to leeward is a turtle about forty feet wide and a serpent quite as long with an enormous and hideous head peering from out the waters look which way we will it is impossible for us to fly the fearful reptiles advanced upon us they turned and twisted about the raft with awful ra pidity they formed around our devoted vessel a series of concentric circles i took up my rifle in desperation but what effect can a rifleball pro duce upon the armor scales with which the bodies of these horrid monsters are covered we remain still and dumb from utter horror they advance upon us nearer and nearer our fate appears certain fearful and terrible on one side the mighty crocodile on the other the great sea serpent the rest of the fearful crowd of marine prodigies have plunged beneath the briny waves and disappeared i was about to risk all and fire to try the effect of a shot hans the guide however interfered by a sign to check me the two hideous and ravenous monsters passed within fifty fathoms of the raft and then made a rush at one anotherâtheir fury and rage preventing them from seeing us the combat commenced we distinctly made out every action of the two hideous monsters to my excited imagination the other animals appeared about to take part in the fierce and deadly struggle âthe monster the whale the lizard and the turtle i distinctly saw them every moment i pointed them out to the icelander but he only shook his head tva he said whatâtwo only does he say surely he is mis taken i cried in a tone of wonder he is quite right replied my uncle coolly and philosophically examining the terrible duel with his amazing stories telescope and speaking as if he were in a lecture room how can that be yes it is so the first of these hideous monsters has the snout of a porpoise the head of a lizard the teeth of a crocodile and it is this that has de ceived us it is the most fearful of all antediluvian reptiles the worldrenowned ichthyosaurus or great fish lizard and the other the other is a monstrous serpent concealed under the hard vaulted shell of the turtle the ter rible enemy of its fearful rival the plesiosaurus or sea crocodile hans was quite right the two monsters only disturbed the surface of the sea at last have mortal eyes gazed upon two reptiles of the great primitive ocean i saw the flaming red eyes of the ichthyosaurus each as big or bigger than a mans head nature in its infinite wisdom had gifted this wondrous marine animal with an optical apparatus of extreme power capable of resisting the pressure of heavy layers of water which rolled over him in the depth of the ocean where he usually fed it has by some authors truly been called the whale of the saurian race for it is as big and quick in its motions as our king of the seas this one measured not less than a hundred feet in length and i could form some idea of his girth when i saw him lift his prodigious tail out of the waters his jaw is of awful size and strength and according to the bestinformed naturalists it does not contain less than a hundred and eightytwo teeth the other was the mighty plesiosaurus a serpent with a cylindrical trunk a short stumpy tail and fins like a bank of oars in a roman galley its whole body was covered by a carapace or shell and its neck as flexible as that of a swan rose more than thirty feet above the waves a tower of ani mated flesh these animals attacked one another with incon ceivable fury such a combat was never seen be fore by mortal eyes and to us who did see it it ap peared more like the phantasmagoric creation of a dream than anything else they raised mountains of water which dashed in spray over the raft al ready tossed to and fro by the waves twenty times we seemed on the point of being upset and hurled headlong into the waves hideous hisses appeared to shake the gloomy granite roof of that mighty cavernâhisses which carried terror to our hearts the awful combatants held each other in a tight embrace i could not make out one from the other still the combat could not last for ever and woe unto us whichsoever became the victor one hour two hours three hours passed away without any decisive result the struggle continued with the same stark tenacity but without apparent result the deadly opponents now approached now drew away from the raft once or twice we fancied they were about to leave us altogether but instead of that they came nearer and nearer we crouched on the raft ready to fire at them at a moments notice poor as the prospect of hurting or terrifying them was still we were determined not to perish without a struggle suddenly the ichthyosaurus and the plesiosaurus disappeared beneath the waves leaving behind them a maelstrom in the midst of the sea we were very nearly drawn down by the indraught of the water several minutes elapsed before anything was again seen was this wonderful combat to end in the depths of the ocean was the last act of this terrible drama to take place without specta tors it was impossible for us to say suddenly at no great distance from us an enorm ous mass rose out of the watersâthe head of the great plesiosaurus the terrible monster was wounded unto death i could see nothing of his enormous body ah that could be distinguished was his serpentlike neck which he twisted and curled in all the agonies of death now he struck the waters with it as if it had been a gigantic whip and then again wriggled like a worm cut in two the water was spurted up to a great distance in all directions a great portion of it swept over our raft and nearly blinded us but soon the end of the beast approached nearer and neaxer his movements slackened visibly his contortions almost ceased and at last the body of the mighty snake lay an inert dead mass on the surface of the now calm and placid waters as for the ichthyosaurus has he gone down to his mighty cavern under the sea to rest or will he reappear to destroy us this question remained unanswered meanwhile we had breathing time chapter xxxi the sea monster ednesday august fortunately the wind which at the present blows with great violence allowed us to escape from the scene of the unparalleled and extraordinary struggle hans with his usual impertuibable calm remained at the helm my uncle who for a short time had been withdrawn from his absorbing reverie by the novel incidents of this seafight fell back appar ently into a brown study all this time however his eyes were fixed impatiently on the widespread ocean our voyage now became monotonous and uniform dull as it has become i have no desire to have it broken by any repetition of the perils and adven tures of yesterday thursday august the wind is now n n e and blows very irregularly it has changed to fitful gusts the temperature is exceedingly high we are now progressing at the average rate of about ten miles and a half per hour about twelve oclock a distant sound as of thunder fell upon our ears i make a note of the fact without even venturing a suggestion as to its cause it was one continuous roar as of a sea falling over mighty rocks far off in the distance said the professor dog matically there is some rock or some island against which the sea lashed to fury by the wind is break ing violently hans without saying a word clambered to the top of the mast but could make out nothing the ocean was level in every direction as far as the eye could reach three hours passed without any sign to indicate what might be before us the sound began to as sume that of a mighty cataract i expressed my a trip to the center of the earth opinion on this point strongly to my uncle he merely shook his head are we advancing towards some mighty waterfall which shall cast us into the abyss probably this mode of descending into the abyss may be agreeable to the professor because it would be something like a vertical descent he is so eager to make i entertain a very different view whatever be the truth it is certain that not many leagues distant there must be some very extraor dinary phenomenon for as we advance the roar becomes more mighty and stupendous is it in the water or in the air i cast hasty glances aloft at the suspended vapors and i seek to penetrate their mighty depths but the vault above is tranquil the clouds which are now elevated to the very summit appear utterly still and motionless and completely lost in the irradia tion of electric light it is necessary therefore to seek for the cause of this phenomenon elsewhere i examine the horizon now perfectly calm pure and free from all haze its aspect still remains un changed but if this awful noise proceeds from a cataractâif so to speak this vast interior ocean is precipitated into a lower basinâif these tremend ous roars are produced by the noise of falling waters the current would increase in activity and its increasing swiftness would give me some idea of the extent of the peril with which we are men aced i consult the current it simply does not exist there is no such thing an empty bottle cast into the water lies to leeward without motion about four oclock hans rises clambers up the mast and reaches the truck itself from this ele vated position his looks are cast around they take in a vast circumference of the ocean at last his eyes remain fixed his face expresses no astonish ment but his eyes slightly dilate he has seen something at last cried my uncle i think so i replied hans came down stood beside us and pointed with his right hand to the south der nere he said there replied my uncle and seizing his tele scope he looked at it with great attention for about a minute which to me appeared an age i knew not what to think or expect yes yes he cried in a tone of considerable sur prise there it is what i asked a tremendous spurt of water rising out of the waves some other marine monster i cried already alarmed perhaps then let us steer more to the westward for we know what we have to expect from antediluvian animals was my eager reply go ahead said my uncle i turned towards hans hans was at the tiller steering with his usual undisturbed calm never theless if from the distance which separated us from this creature a distance which must be esti mated at no less than a dozen leagues and this spurting of water proceeded from the pranks of some antediluvian animal his dimensions must be preternatural to fly is therefore the course to be suggested by ordinary prudence but we have not come into that part of the world to be prudent such is my uncles determination we accordingly continue to advance the nearer we come the loftier is the spouting water what monster can fill himself with such huge volumes of water and then unceasingly spout them out in such lofty jets at eight oclock in the evening reckoning as above ground where there is day and night we are not more than two leagues from the mighty beast its long black enormous mountainous body lies on the top of the water like an island but then sailors have been said to have gone ashore on sleeping whales mistaking them for land is it illusion or is it fear its length cannot be less than a thou sand fathoms what then is this cetaceous mon ster of which no cuvier ever thought it is quite motionless and presents the appearance of sleep the sea seems unable to lift him upwards it is rather the waves which break on his huge and gigantic frame the waterspout rising to a height of five hundred feet breaks in spray with a dull sullen roar we advance like senseless lunatics towards this mighty mass i honestly confess that i was abjectly afraid i declared that i would go no further i threatened in my terror to cut the sheet of the sail i attacked the professor with considerable acrimony calling him foolhardy mad i know not what he made no answer suddenly the imperturbable hans once more pointed his finger to the menacing object holme an island cried my uncle an island i replied shrugging my shoulders at this poor attempt at deception of course it is cried my uncle bursting into a loud and joyous laugh but the water spout geyser said hans yes of courseâa geyser replied my uncle still laughing a geyser like those common in iceland jets like this are the great wonders of the country at first i would not allow that i had been so grossly deceived what could be more ridiculous than to have taken an island for a marine monster but kick as one may one must yield to evidence and i was finally convinced of my error it was nothing after all but natural phenomenon as we approached nearer and nearer the dimen sions of the liquid sheaf of water became truly grand and stupendous the island had at a dis tance presented the appearance of an enormous whale whose head rose high above the waters the geyser a word which signifies fury rose majesti cally from its summit dull detonations are heard every now and then and the enormous jet taken as it were with sudden fury shakes its plume of vapor and bounds into the first layer of the clouds it is alone neither spurts of vapor nor hot springs surround it and the whole volcanic power of that region is concentrated in one sublime column the rays of electric light mix with this dazzling sheaf every drop as it falls assuming the prismatic colors of the rainbow let us go on shore said the professor after some minutes of silence it was necessary however to take great precaution in order to avoid the amazing stories weight of falling waters which would eause the raft to founder in an instant hans however steered admirably and brought us to the other extremity of the island i was the first to leap on the rock my uncle fol lowed while the eiderduck hunter remained still like a man above any childish sources of astonish ment we were now walking on granite mixed with silicious sandstone the soil shivered under our feet like the sides of boilers in which overheated steam is forcibly confined it was burning we soon came in sight of the little central basin from which rose the geyser i plunged a thermometer into the water which ran bubbling from the center and it marked a heat of a hundred and sixtythree de grees this water therefore came from some place where the heat was intense this was singu larly in contradiction with the theories of professor hardwigg i could not help telling him my opinion on the subject well said he sharply and what does this prove against my doctrine nothing replied i dryly seeing that i was run ning my head against a foregone conclusion i am compelled to confess that until now we have been most remarkably fortunate and that this voyage is being accomplished in most favorable conditions of temperature but it appears evident in fact certain that we shall sooner or later arrive at one of those regions where the central heat will reach its ut most limits and will go far beyond all the possible gradations of thermometers visions of the hades of the ancients believed to be in the center of the earth floated through my imagination however we shall see what we shall see that is the professors favorite phrase now having christened the volcanic island by the name of his nephew the leader of the expedition turned away and gave the signal for embarkation we were care fully round the projecting and rather dangerous rocks of the southern side hans had taken ad vantage of this brief halt to repair the raftânot before it was required before we took our final departure from the is land however i made some observations to calculate the distance we had gone over and i put them down in my journal since we left port gretchen we had traveled two hundred and seventy leaguesâmore than eight hundred milesâon this great inland sea we were therefore six hundred and twenty leagues from iceland and exactly under england chapter xxxii the battle of the elements friday august st this morning the mag nificent geyser had wholly disappeared the wind had freshened up and we were fast leaving the neighborhood of henrys island even the roaring sound of the mighty column was lost to the ear the weather if under the circumstances we may use such an expression is about to change very suddenly the atmosphere is being gradually load ed with vapors which carry with them the elec tricity formed by the constant evaporation of the saline waters the clouds are slowly but sensibly falling towards the sea and are assuming a dark olive texture the electric rays can scarcely pierce through the opaque curtain which has fallen like a dropscene before this wondrous theatre on the stage of which another and terrible drama was soon to be enacted this time it is no fight of animals it is the fearful battle of the elements in the distance the clouds have assumed the ap pearance of enormous balls of cotton or rather pods piled one above the other in picturesque con fusion by degrees they appear to swell out break and gain in number what they lose in gran deur their heaviness is so great that they are un able to lift themselves from the horizon but under the influence of the upper currents of air they are gradually broken up become much darker and then present the appearance of one single layer of a formidable character now and then a lighter cloud still lit up from above rebounds upon this gray carpet and is lost in the opaque mass there can be no doubt that the entire atmosphere is saturated with electric fluid i am myself wholly impregnated my hairs literally stand on end as if under the influence of a galvanic battery if one of my companions ventured to touch me i think he would receive rather a violent and unpleasant shock about ten oclock in the morning the symptoms of the storm became more thorough and decisive the wind appeared to soften down as if to take breath for a renewed attack the vast funereal pall above us looked like a huge bagâlike the cave of aeolus in which the storm was collecting its forces for the attack i tried all i could not to believe in the menacing signs of the sky and yet i could not avoid saying as it were involuntarilyâi be lieve we are going to have bad weather the professor made me no answer he was in a horrible in a detestable humorâto see the ocean stretching interminably before his eyes on hear ing my words he simply shrugged his shoulders we shall have a tremendous storm i said again pointing to the horizon these clouds are falling lower and lower upon the sea as if to crush it a great silence prevailed the wind wholly ceased nature assumed a dead calm and ceased to breathe upon the mast where i noticed a sort of slight ignis fatuus the sail hung in loose heavy folds the raft lay motionless in the midst of a dark heavy seaâwithout undulation without mo tion it was as still as glass let us lower the sail i said it is only an act of common prud ence noâno cried my uncle in an exasperated tone a hundred times no let the wind strike us and do its worst let the storm sweep us away where it willâonly let me see the glimmer of some coastâ of some rocky cliffs even if they dash our raft into a thousand pieces no keep up the sailâno mat ter what happens these words were scarcely uttered when the southern horizon underwent a sudden and violent change the long accumulated vapors were resolved into water and the air required to fill up the void produced became a wild and raging tempest it came from the most distant corners of the mighty cavern it raged from every point of the com a trip to the center of the earth pass it roared it yelled it shrieked with glee as of demons let loose the darkness increased and became indeed darkness visible the raft rose and fell with the storm and bound ed over the waves my uncle was cast headlong up on the deck with great difficulty i dragged my self towards him he was holding on with might and main to the end of a cable and appeared to gaze with pleasure and delight at the spectacle of the unchained elements hans never moved a muscle his long hair driv en hither and thither by the tempest and scattered wildly over his motionless face gave him a most extraordinary appearanceâfor every single hair was illuminated by little sparkling sprigs his countenance presented the extraordinary appear ance of an antediluvian man a true contemporary of the megatherium still the mast holds good against the storm the sail spreads out and fills like a soap bubble about to burst the raft rushes on at a pace impossible to estimate the sail the sail i cried making a trumpet of my hands and then endeavoring to lower it let it alone said my uncle more exasperated than ever nej said hans gently shaking his head the rain formed a roaring cataract before this horizon of which we were in search and to which we were rushing like madmen but before this wilderness of waters reached us the mighty veil of cloud was torn in twain the sea began to foam wildly to the fearful claps of thunder were added dazzling flashes of lightning such as i had never seen the flashes crossed one another hurled from every side while the thunder came pealing like an echo the mass of vapor becomes incandescent the hailstones which strike the metal of our boots and our weapons are actually luminous the waves they rise appear to be fireeating monsters be neath which seethes an intense fire their cnfcts surmounted by combs of flame my eyes are dazzled blinded by the intensity of light my ears are deaf ened by the awful roar of the elements i am com pelled to hold on to the mast which bends like a reed beneath the violence of the storm to which none ever before seen by mariners bore any re semblance here my traveling notes become very incomplete loose and vague i have only been able to make out one or two fugitive observations dotted down in a mere mechanical way but even their brevity even their obscurity show the emotions which overcame me sunday august d where have we got to in what region are we wandering we are still car ried forward with inconceivable rapidity the night has been fearful something not to be de scribed the storm shows no signs of cessation we exist in the midst of an uproar which has no name the detonations as of artillery are incessant our ears literally bleed we are unable to exchange a word or hear each other speak the light never ceases to flash for a single instant i can see the zigzags after a rapid dart strike the arched roof of this mightiest of mighty vaults if it were to give way and fall upon us other lightnings plunge their forked streaks in every direction and take the form of globes of fire which explode like bomb shells over a beleaguered city the general crash and roar do not apparently increase it has already gone far beyond what human ear can appreciate if all the powdermagazines in the world were to explode together it would be impossible for us to hear worse noise there is a constant emission of light from the stormclouds the electric matter is incessantly re leased innumerable columns of water rush up like waterspouts and fall back upon the surface of the ocean in foam whither are we going my uncle still lies at full length upon the raft without speak ingâwithout taking any note of time monday august this terrible storm will never end why should not this state of the at mosphere so dence and murky once modified be come permanent we are utterly broken and harassed by fatigue hans remains just as usual the raft runs to the southeast invariably we have already gone two hundred leagues from the newlydiscovered island about twelve oclock the storm becomes worse than ever we are obliged to fasten every bit of cargo tightly on the deck of the raft or everything would be swept away we tie ourselves to the mast each man lashing the other the waves drive over us so that several times we are actually under water we had been under the painful necessity of ab staining from speech for three days and three nights we opened our mouths we moved our lips but no sound came even when we placed our mouths to each others ears it was the same the wind carried the voice away my uncle once con trived to get his head close to mine after several alirrost vain endeavors he appeared to my nearly exhausted senses to articulate some word i had a jiotion more from intuition than anything else that he said to me we are lost i took out my note book from which under the most desperate circumstances i never parted and wyote a few words as legibly as i couldâtake in sail with a deep sigh he nodded his head and acquiesced his head had scarcely time to fall back in the position from which he had momentarily raised it when a disc or ball of fire appeared on the very edge of the raftâour devoted our doomed craft the mast and sail were carried away bodily and i saw them swept away to a prodigious height like a kite we were frozen actually shivering with terror the ball of fire haft white half azurecolored about the size of a teninch bombshell moved along turn ing with prodigious rapidity to leeward of the storm it ran about here there and everywhere it clambered up one of the bulwarks of the raft it leaped upon the sack of provisions and then finally descended lightly fell like a foot ball and landed on our powder barrel horrible situation an explosion now seemed inevitable the dazzling disc moved to one side it approached hans who looked at it with singular fixity then it approached my uncle who cast him self on his knees to avoid it it came towards me as amazing stories i stood pale and shuddering in the dazzling light and heat it pirouetted round my feet which i en deavored to withdraw an odor of nitrous gas filled the whole air it penetrated to the throat to the lungs i felt ready to choke why is it that i cannot withdraw my feet are they riveted to the flooring of the raft no the fall of the electric globe has turned all the iron on board into loadstonesâthe instruments the tools the arms are clanging together with awful and horrible noise the nails of my heavy boots ad here closely to the plate of iron imbedded in the wood i cannot withdraw my foot at last by a violent and almost superhuman ef fort i tear it away just as the ball which is still executing its gyratory motions is about to run round it and drag me with itâif what intense stupendous light the globe of fire burstsâwe are enveloped in cascades of living fire which flood the space around with luminous matter then all went out and darkness once more fell upon the deep i had just time to see my uncle once more cast apparently senseless on the flooring of the raft hans at the helm spitting fire under the influence of the electricity which seemed to have gone through him tuesday august i have just come out of a long fainting fit the awful and hideous storm still continues the lightning has increased in vividness and pours out its fiery wrath like a brook of ser pents let loose in the atmosphere are we still upon the sea yes and being car ried along with incredible velocity we have passed under england under the channel under france probably under the whole extent of europe another awful clamor in the distance this time it is certain that the sea is breaking upon the rocks at no great distance thenâ chapter xxxiii our route reversed here ends what i call my journal of our voyage on board the raft which journal was happily saved from the wreck i pro ceed with my narrative as i did before i commenced my daily notes what happened when the terrible shock took place when the raft was cast upon the rocky shore it would be impossible for me now to say i felt my self precipitated violently into the boiling waves and if i escaped from a certain and cruel death it was wholly owing to the determination of the faith ful hans who clutching me by the arm saved me from the yawning abyss the courageous icelander then carried me in his powerful arms far out of the reach of tne waves and laid me down upon a burning expanse of sand where i found myself some time afterwards in the company of my uncle the professor then hans quietly returned towards the fatal rocks against which the furious waves were beating in order to save any stray waifs from the wreck this man was always practical and thoughtful could not utter a word i was quite overcome with emotion my whole body was broken and bruised with fatigue it took hours before i was anything like myself meanwhile there fell a fear ful deluge of rain drenching us to the skin its very violence however proclaimed the approaching end of the storm some overhanging rocks afforded us a slight protection from the torrents under this shelter hans prepared some food which however i was unable to touch exhausted by the three weary days and nights of watching we fell into a deep and painful sleep my dreams were fearful but at last exhausted nature asserted her supremacy and i slumbered next day when i awoke the change was magical the weather was magnificent air and sea as if by mutual consent had regained their serenity every trace of the storm even the faintest had disap peared i was saluted on my awakening by the first joyous tones i had heard from the professor for many a day his gayety indeed was something terrible well my lad he cried rubbing his hands together have you slept soundly might it not have been supposed that we were in the old house on the konigstrasse that i had just come down quietly to my breakfast and that my marriage with gretchen was to take place that very day my uncles coolness was exasperating alas considering how the tempest had driven us in an easterly direction we we had passed under the whole of germany under the city of hamburg where i had been so happy under the very street which contained all i loved and cared for in the world it was a positive fact that i was only sepa rated from her by a distance of forty leagues but these forty leagues were of hard impenetrable gran ite all these dreary and miserable reflections passed through my mind before i attempted to answer my uncles question why what is the matter he cried cannot you say whether you have slept well or not i have slept very well was my reply but every bone in my body aches i suppose that will lead to nothing nothing at all my boy it is only the result of the fatigue of the last few daysâthat is all you appearâif i may be allowed to say soâto be very jolly this morning i said delighted my dear boy delighted was never happier in my life we have at last reached the wishedfor port the end of our expedition cried i in a tone of considerable surprise no but to the confines of that sea which i be gan to fear would never end but go round the whole world we will now tranquilly resume our journey by land and once again endeavor to dive into the center of the earth my dear uncle i began in a hesitating kind of way allow me to ask you one question certainly harry a dozen if you think proper one will suffice how about getting back i asked how about getting back what a question to ask we have not as yet reached the end of our journey i know that all i want to know is how you propose we shall manage the return voyage in the most simple manner in the world said a trip to the center of the earth the imperturbable professor once we reach the exact center of this sphere either we shall find a new road by which to ascend to the surface or we shall simply turn around and go back by the way we came i have every reason to believe that while we are traveling forward it will not close behind us then one of the first matters to see to will be to repair the raft was my rather melancholy re sponse of course we must attend to that above all things continued the professor then comes the allimportant question of pro visions i urged have we anything like enough left to enable us to accomplish such great such amazing designs as you contemplate carrying out i have seen into the matter and my answer is in the affirmative hans is a very clever fellow and has saved the greater part of the cargo but the best way to satisfy your scruples is to come and judge for yourself saying which he led the way out of the kind of open grotto in which we had taken shelter i had almost begun to hope that which i should rather have feared the impossi bility of such a shipwreck leaving even the slightest signs of what it had carried as freight as soon as i reached the shores of this inland sea i found hans standing gravely in the midst of a large number of things laid out in complete order my uncle wrung his hands with deep and silent gratitude his heart was too full for speech this man whose superhuman devotion to his employers i never saw surpassed nor even equaled had been hard at work all the time we slept and at the risk of his life had succeeded in saving the most precious articles of our cargo of course under the circumstances we necessar ily experienced several severe losses our weapons had wholly vanished but experience had taught us to do without them the provision of powder had however remained intact after nearly blowing us all to atoms in the storm well said the professor who was now ready to make the best of everything as we have no guns all we have to do is to give up all idea of hunting yes my dear sir we can do without them but yhat about all our instruments here is the manometer the most useful of all which i gladly accept in lieu of the rest with it alone i can calculate the depth as we proceed by its means alone i shall be able to decide when we have reached the center of the earth ha ha but for this little instrument we might make a mistake and run the risk of coming out at the antipodes all this was said amid bursts of unnatural laughter but the compass i cried without that what can we do here it is safe and sound he cried with real joy ah ah and here we have the chronometer and the thermometers hans the hunter was indeed an invaluable man it was impossible to deny this fact as far as the nautical and other instruments were concerned noth ing was wanting then on further examination i found ladders cords pickaxes crowbars and shovels all scattered about oh the shore but what are we to do for food i asked let us see to the commissariat department re plied my uncle gravely the boxes which contained our supply of food for the voyage were placed in a row along the strand and proved in a capital state of preservation the sea had in every case respected their contents taking into consideration biscuits salt meat schiedam and dried fish we could still cal culate on having about four months supply if used with prudence and caution four months cried the sanguine professor in high glee then we shall have plenty of time both to go and to come and with what remains i under take to give a grand dinner to my colleagues of the johanneum i sighed i should by this time have accustomed myself to the temperament of my uncle and yet this man astonished me more and more every day he was the greatest human enigma i had ever known now said he before we do anything else we must lay in a stock of fresh water the rain has fallen in abundance and filled the hollows of the granite there is a rich supply of water and we have no fear of suffering from thirst which in our circumstances is of the last importance as for the raft i shall recommend hans to repair it to the best of his abilities though i have every reason to believe we shall not require it again how is that i cried more amazed than ever at my uncles style of reasoning i have an idea my dear boy it is none other than this simple fact we shall not come out by the same opening as that by which we entered i began to look at my uncle with vague suspicion an idea had more than once taken possession of me and this was that he was going mad little did i know how true and prophetic his words were doomed to be and now he said having seen to all these matter of detail to breakfast i followed him to a sort of projecting cape after he had given his last instructions to our guide in this original posi tion with dried meat biscuit and a delicious cup of tea we made a satisfactory mealâi may say one of the most welcome and pleasant i ever remember exhaustion the keen atmosphere the state of calm after so much agitation all contributed to give me an excellent appetite indeed it contributed very much to producing a pleasant and cheerful state of mind while breakfast was in hand and between the sips of warm tea i asked my uncle if he had any idea of how we now stood in relation to the world above for my part i added i think it will be rather difficult to determine well if we were compelled to fix the exact spot said my uncle it might be difficult since during the three days of that awful tempest i could keep no account either of the quickness of our pace or of the direction in which the raft was going still we will endeavor to approximate to the truth we shall not i believe be so very far out well if i recollect rightly i replied our last observation was made at the geyser island harrys island my boy harrys island do not decline the honor of having named it having given your name to an island discovered by us the first human beings vho trod it since the creation of the world amazing stories let it be so then at harrys island we had already gone over two hundred and seventy leagues of sea and we were i believe about six hundred leagues more or less from iceland good i am glad to see that you remember so well let us start from that point ami let us count four days of storm during which our rate of traveling must have been very great i should say that our velocity must have been about eighty leagues to the twentyfour hours i agreed that i thought this a fair calculation there were then three hundred leagues to be ad did to the grand total yes and the central sea must extend aj least six hundred leagues from side to side do you know my boy harry that we have discovered an inland lake larger than the mediterranean certainly and we only know of its extent in one way it may be hundreds of miles in length very likely then said i after calculating for some min utes if your previsions are right ve are at this moment exactly umler the mediterranean itself do you think so yes i am almost certain of it are we not nine hundred leagues distant from reykjawik that is perfectly true and a famousbit of road we have traveled my boy but why we should be under the mediterranean more than under turkey or the atlantic ocean can only be known when we are sure of not having deviated from our course and of this we know nothing i do not think we were driven very far from our course the wind appears to me to have been always about the same my opinion is that this shore must be situated to the southeast of port gretchen goodâi hope so it will however be easy to decide the matter by taking the bearings from our departure by means of the compass come along and we will consult that invaluable invention the professor now walked eagerly in the direction of the rock where the indefatigable hans had placed the instruments in safety my uncle was gay and lighthearted he rubbed his hands and assumed all sorts of attitudes he was to all appearances once more a young man since i had known him never had he been so amiable and pleasant i followed him rather curious to know whether i had made any mistake in my estimation of our position as soon as we had reached the rock my uncle took the compass placed it horizontally before him and looked keenly at the needle as he had at first shaken it to give vivacity it oscillated considerably and then slowly assumed its right position under the influence of the magnetic power the professor bent his eyes curiously over the wondrous instrument a violent start immediately showed the extent of his emotion he closed his eyes rubbed them and took another and keener survey then he turned slowly round to me stupe faction depicted on his countenance what is the matter said i beginning to be alarmed he could not speak he was too overwhelmed for words he simply pointed to the instrument i examined it eagerly according to his mute direc tions and a loud cry of surprise escaped my lips the needle of the compass pointed due north in the direction we expected was the south it pointed to the shore instead of to the high seas i shook the compass examined it with a curious and anxious eye it was in a state of perfection no blemish in any way explained the phenomenon whatever position we forced the needle into it re turned invariably to the same unexpected point it was useless attempting to conceal from our selves the fatal truth there could be no doubt un welcome as was the fact that during the tempest there had been a sudden slant of wind of which we had been unable to take any account and thus the raft had carried us back to the shores we had left apparently for ever so many days before chapter xxxiv a voyage of discovery it would be altogether impossible for me to give any idea of the utter astonishment which over came the professor on making this extraordin ary discovery amazement incredulity and rage were blended in such a way as to alarm me during the whole course of my life i had never seen a man at first so chapfallen and then so furiously indig nant the terrible fatigues of our sea voyage the fear ful dangers we had passed through had all all gone for nothing we had to begin them all over again instead of progressing as we fondly expected dur ing a voyage of so many days we had retreated every hour of our expediton on the raft bad been so much lost time presently however the indomitable energy of my uncle overcame every other consideration so he said between set teeth fatality will play me these terrible tricks the elements themselves conspire to overwhelm me with mortification air fire and water combine their united efforts to oppose my pas sage well they shall see what the earnest will of a determined man can do i will not yield i will not retreat even one inch and we shall see who shall triumph in this great contestâman or nature standing upright on a rock irritated and menac ing professor hardwigg like the ferocious ajax seemed to defy the fates i however took upon my self to interfere and to impose some sort of check upon such insensate enthusiasm listen to me uncle i said in a firm but tem perate tone of voice there must be some limit to ambition here below it is utterly useless to struggle against the impossible pray listen to reason we are utterly unprepared for a sea voy age it is simple madness to think of performing a second journey of five hundred leagues upon a wretched pile of beams with a counterpane for a sail a paltry stick for a mast and a tempest to con tend with as we are totally incapable of steering our frail craft we shall become a mere plaything of the storm and it is acting the part of madmen if we a second time run any risk upon this dangerous and treacherous central sea these are only a few of the reasons and argu ments i put togetherâreasons and arguments which to me appeared unanswerable i was allowed to go on without interruption for about ten minutes the explanation to this i soon discovered the profes a trip to the center of the earth sor was not even listening and did not hear a word of all my eloquence to the raft he cried in a hoarse voice when i paused for a reply such was the result of my strenuous effort to resist his iron will i tried again i begged and im plored him i got into a passion but i had to deal with a will more determined than my own i seemed to feel like the waves which fought and battled against the huge mass of granite at our feet which had smiled grimly for so many ages at their puny efforts hans meanwhile without taking part in our dis cussion had been repairing the raft one would have supposed that he instinctively guessed at the further projects of my uncle by msars of some fragments of cordage he had again made the raft seaworthy while i had been speaking he had hoisted a new mast and sail the latter already flut tering and waving in the breeze the worthy professor spoke a few words to our imperturbable guide who immediately began to put our baggage on board and to prepare for our departure the atmosphere was now tolerably clear and pure and the northeast wind blew steadily and serenely it appeared likely to last for some time what then could i do could i undertake to resist the iron will of two men it was simply im possible if even i could have hoped for the support of hans this however was out of the question it appeared to me that the icelander had set aside all personal will and identity he was a picture of abnegation i could hope for nothing from one so infatuated with and devoted to his master all i could do therefore was to swim with the stream in a mood of stolid and sullen resignation i was about to take my accustomed place on the raft when my uncle placed his hand upon my shoulder there is no hurry my boy he said we shall not start un til tomorrow i looked the picture of resignation to the dire will of fate under the circumstances he said i ought to neglect no precautions as fate has cast me upon these shores i shall not leave without hav ing completely examined them in order to understand this remark i must ex plain that though we had been driven back to the northern shore we had landed at a very different spot from that which had been our starting point port gretchen must we calculated be very much to the westward nothing therefore was more natural and reasonable than that we should recon noitre this new shore upon which we had so unex pectedly landed let us go on a journey of discov ery i cried and leaving hans to his important operation we started on our expedition as we trudged along our feet crushed innumerable shells of every shape and sizeâonce the dwelling place of animals of every period of creation i particularly noticed some enormous shellsâcarapaces turtle and tortoise spe cies the diameter of which exceeded fifteen feet they had in past ages belonged to those gigantic glyptodons of the pliocene period of which the mod ern turtle is but a minute specimen in addition the whole soil was covered by a vast quantity of stony relics having the appearance of flints worn by the action of the waves and lying in successive layers one above the other it appeared clear that we were walking upon a kind of sediment formed like all the soils of that period so frequent on the surface of the globe by the subsidence of the waters the professor who was now in his element carefully examined every rocky fissure let him only find an opening and it directly became import ant to him to examine its depth for a whole mile we followed the windings of the central sea when suddenly an important change took place in the aspect of the soil it seemed to have been rudely cast up convuisionized as it were by a violent upheaving of the lower strata in many places hollows here and hillocks there attested great dislocations at some other period of the ter restrial mass we advanced with great difficulty over the broken masses of granite mixed with flint quartz and alluvial deposits when a large field more even than a field a plain of bones appeared sud denly before our eyes it looked like an immense cemetery where generation after generation had mingled their mortal dust lofty barrows of early remains rose at intervals they undulated away to the limits of the distant horizon and were lost in a thick and brown fog on that spot some three square miles in extent was accumulated the whole history of animal lifeâ scarcely one creature still a habitant of the com paratively modern soil of the upper and inhabited world had there existed we were drawn forward by an allabsorbing and impatient curiosity our feet crushed with a dry and crackling sound the remains of those prehis toric fossils for which the museums of great cities quarrel even when they obtain only rare and curious morsels i was utterly confounded my uncle stood for some minutes with his arms raised on high to wards the thick granite vault which served us for a sky his mouth was wide open his eyes sparkled wildly behind his spectacles which he had fortu nately saved his head bobbed up and down and from side to side while his whole attitude and mien expressed unbounded astonishment he stood in the presence of an endless wondrous and inexhaustibly rich collection of antediluvian monsters piled up for his own private and peculiar satisfaction fancy an enthusiastic lover of books carried suddenly into the very midst of the famous library of alexandria burned by the sacrilegious omar and which some miracle had restored to its pristine splendor such was the state of mind in which uncle hardwigg was now placed for some time he stood thus literally aghast at the magnitude of his discovery but it was even a greater excitement when dart ing wildly over this mass of organic dust he caught up a naked skull and addressed me in a quivering voiceâharry my boyâharryâthis is a human head chapter xxxv discovery upon discovery it will be easy to understand the professors mingled astonishment and joy when on advanc ing about twenty yards further he found him self in the presence of i may say face to face with amazing stories an entire fossil of the human race actually belong ing to the quarternary period the human skull was perfectly recognizable had a soil of very peculiar nature like that of the ceme tery of st michel at bordeaux preserved it during countless ages this was the question i asked my self but which i was wholly unable to answer this head with stretched and parchmenty skin with the teeth whole the hair abundant was before our eyes as in life i stood mute almost paralyzed with wonder and awe before this dread apparition of another age my uncle who on almost every occasion was a great talker remained for a time completely dumfounded he was too full of emotion for speech to be possible after a while however we raised up the body to which the skull belonged we stood it on end it seemed to our excited imaginations to look at us with its terrible hollow eyes after some minutes of silence the man was van quished by the professor human instincts suc cumbed to scientific pride and exultation profes sor hardwigg carried away by his enthusiasm for got all the circumstances of our journey the extra ordinary position in which we were plaeed the im mense cavern which stretched far away over our heads there can be no doubt that he thought him self at the institution addressing his attentive pu pils for he put on his most doctorial style waved his hand and beganâ gentlemen i have the honor on this auspicious occasion to present to you a man of the quarternary period of our globe many learned men have de nied his very existence while other able persons perhaps of even higher authority have affirmed their belief in the reality of his life if the st thomases of paleontology were present they would reverentially touch him with their fingers and be lieve in his existence thus acknowledging their ob stinate heresy i know that science should be care ful in relation to all discoveries of this nature i am not without having heard of the many barnums and other quacks who have made a trade of such like pretended discoveries i have of course heard of the discovery of the kneebones of ajax of the pre tended finding of the body of orestes by the spar tiates and of the body of asterius ten spans long fifteen feetâof which we read in pausanias i have read everything in relation to the skele ton of trapani discovered in the fourteenth cen tury which many persons chose to regard as that of polypheums and the history of the giant dug up during the sixteenth century in the environs of palmyra you are as well aware as i am gentle men of the existence of the celebrated analysis made near lucerne in of the great bones which the celebrated doctor felix plater declared belonged to a giant about nineteen feet high i have devoured all the treatises of cassanion and all those memoirs pamphlets speeches and replies pub lished in reference to the skeleton of teutobochus king of the cimbri the invader of gaul dug out of a gravel pit in dauphiny in in the eighteenth century i should have denied with peter campet the existence of the preadamites of scheuchzer i have had in my hands the writing called gigansâ here my uncle was afflicted by the natural infirm ity which prevented him from pronouncing difficult words in public it was not exactly stuttering but a strange sort of constitutional hesitation the writ ing named gigansâ he repeated he however could get no further giganteoâ impossible the unfortunate word would not come out there would have been great laughter at the institution had the mistake happened there gigantosteology at last exclaimed professor hardwigg between two savage growls yes gentlemen i am well acquainted with all these matters and know also that cuvier and blumenbach fully recognized in these bones the undeniable remains of mammoths of the quaternary period but after what we now see to allow a doubt is to insult scientific inquiry there is the body you can see it you can touch it it is not a skeleton it is a complete and uninjured body pre served with an anthropological object i did not attempt to controvert this singular and astounding assertion if i could but wash this corpse in a solution of sulphuric acid continued my uncle i would un dertake to remove all the earthly particles and these resplendent shells which are incrusted all over this body but i am without this precious dissolving medium nevertheless such as it is this body will tell its own history here the professor held up the fossil body and exhibited it with rare dexterity no professional showman could have shown more activity as on examination you will see my uncle con tinued it is only about six feet in length which is a long way from the pretended giants of early days as to the particular race to which it belonged it is incontestably caucasian it is of the white race that is of our own the skull of this fossil being is a perfect ovoid without any remarkable or promi nent development of the cheek bones and without any projection of the jaw but i will advance still farther on the road of inquiry and deduction and i dare venture to say that this human sample or specimen belongs to the japhetic family which spread over the world from india to the uttermost limits of western europe there is no occasion gentlemen to smile at my remarks of course nobody smiled but the excellent pro fessor was so accustomed to beaming countenances at his lectures that he believed he saw all his au dience laughing during the delivery of his learned dissertation yes he continued with renewed animation this is a fossil man a contemporary of the mas todons with the bones of which this whole amphi theatre is covered but if i am called on to explain how he came to this place how these various strata by which he is covered have fallen into this vast cavity i can undertake to give you no explanation but there is the man surrounded by the works of his hands his hatchets and his carved flints which belong to the stone period and the only rational supposition is that like myself he visited the cen ter of the earth as a traveling tourist a pioneer of science at all events there can be no doubt of his great age and of his being one of the oldest race of human beings the professor with these words ceased his ora tion and i burst forth into loud and unanimous applause besides after all my uncle was right a trip to the center of the earth much more learned men than his nephew would have found it rather hard to refute his facts and arguments another circumstance soon presented itself this fossilized body was not the only one in this vast plain of bonesâthe cemetery of an extinct world other bodies were found as we trod the dusty plain and my uncle was able to choose the most marvelous of these specimens in order to con vince the most incredulous in truth it was a surprising spectacle the suc cessive remains of generations and generations of men and animals confounded together in one vast cemetery eut a great question now presented it self to our notice and one we were actually afraid to contemplate in all its bearings had these once animated beings been buried so far beneath the soil by some tremendous convulsion of nature after they had been earth to earth and ashes to ashes or had they lived here below in this subterranean world under this factitious sky born married and given in marriage and dying at last just like ord inary inhabitants of the earth up to the present moment marine monsters fish and such like animals had alone been seen alive i the question which rendered us rather uneasy was a pertinent one were any of these men of the abyss wandering about the deserted shores of this wondrous sea of the center of the earth this was a question which rendered me very

by g peyton wertenbaker author of the man from the atom strange men these creatures of the hundredth century men with huge brains and tiny shrivelled bodies atrophied limbs and slow ponderous movements on their little conveyances it was then that i was forced to produce my tattered old papers proving my identity and my story the coming of the ice it is strange to be alone and so cold to be the last man on earth the snow drives silently about me ceaselessly drearily and i am iso lated in this tiny white indistinguish able corner of a blurred world surely the loneliest creature in the universe how many thousands of years is it since i last knew the true companion ship for a long time i have been lonely but there were people creatures of flesh and blood now they are gone now i have not even the stars to keep me company for they are all lost in an infinity of snow and twilight above as the earth is lost in its grey infinity here below if only i could know how long it has been since first i âťvvas imprisoned upon the earth it cannot matter now and yet some vague dissatisfaction some faint instinct asks over and over in my throbbing ears what year what year it was in the year that the great thing be gan in my life there was then a very great man who performed operations upon his fellows to com pose their vitalsâwe called such men surgeons john granden wore the title sir before his name dn indication of nobility by birth according to the prevailing standards in england but surgery was only a hobby of sir johns if i must be precise for while he had achieved an enormous reputation as a surgeon he always felt that his real work lay in the experimental end of his profession he was in a way a dreamer but a dreamer who could make his dreams come true i was a very close friend of sir johns in fact we shared the same apartments in london i have never forgotten that day when he first mentioned to me his momentous discovery i had just come in from a long sleighride in the country with alice and i was seated drowsily in the windowseat writ ing idly in my mind a des cription of the wind and the snow and the grey twi light of the evening it is strange is it not that my tale should begin and end with the snow and the twilight sir john opened sudden ly a door at one end of the room and came hurrying across to another door he looked at me grinning rather like a triumphant maniac its coming he cried without pausing ive almost got it i smiled at him he looked very ludicrous at that moment what have you got i asked good lord man the secretâthe secret and then he was gone again the door closing upon his victorious cry the secret i was of course amused but i was also very much interested i knew sir john well enough to realize that however amazing his appearance might be there would be nothing absurd about his secretâwhatever it was but it was useless to speculate i could only hope for enlightenment at dinner so i immersed myself in one of the sur this powerful and tragic story by the author of the man from the atom tells of a man who acquired ter restrial immortalityâtells of a world many centuries henceâa time when everything is changed this one man remains as a relic of the th century he is alone with strangely developed human beings the product of ages of evolution climatic changes are taking place the world begins to grow cold new york is almost in the arctic region and italy is covered with snow all the year around in spite of their enormous intellectual devel opment all human beings must perish our hero alone can withstand the intense cold he wanted eternal life and he got itâeternal life purely intellectual what does he do with all his years and how does lie enjoy them read this powerful story geons volumes from his fine library of imagina tion and waited i think the book was one of mr h g wells pro bably the sleeper awakes or some other of his brilliant fantasies and predictions for i was in a mood conducive to belief in almost anything when later we sat down together across the table i only wish i could give some idea of the atmosphere that permeated our apartments the reality it lent to whatever was vast and amazing and strange you could then whoever you are understand a little the ease with which i accepted sir johns new dis covery he began to explain it to me at once as though he could keep it to himself no longer did you think i had gone mad dennell he asked i quite wonder that i havent why i have been studying for many yearsâfor most of my life on this problem and suddenly i have solved it or rather i am afraid i have solved another one much greater tell me about it i suggested but for gods sake dont be technical he smiled right he said then he paused dennell its magnificent it will change the whole social order of the world it will change everything that is in the world his eyes held mine suddenly with the fatality of an hypnotists dennell it is the secret of eternal life he said good lord sir john i cried half inclined to laugh i mean it he said you know i have spent most of my life studying the processes of birth trying to find out precisely what went on in the whole history of conception you have found out no that is just what amuses me i have dis covered something else without knowing yet what causes either process i dont want to be tech nical and i know very little of what actually takes place myself but i can try to give you some idea of it it is thousands per haps millions of years since sir john explained to me what little i under stood at the time i may have forgotten since yet i try to reproduce what i can of his theory in my study of the pro cesses of birth he began i discovered the rudi ments of an action which takes place in the bodies of both men and women there are certain proper ties in the foods we eat that remain in the body for the reproduction of life two distinct essences so to speak of which one is retained by the woman another by the man it is the union of these two properties that of course creates the child now i made a slight mistake one day in experi menting with a guineapig and i rearranged cer tain organs which i need not describe so that i thought i had completely messed up the poor crea tures abdomen it lived however and i laid it aside amazing stories it was some years later that i happened to notice it again it had not given birth to any young but i was amazed to note that it had apparently grown no older it seemed precisely in the same state of growth in which i had left it from that i built up i reexamined the guinea pig and observed it carefully i need not detail my studies but in the end i found that my mistake had in reality been a momentous discovery i found that i had only to close certain organs to rearrange certain ducts and to open certain dormant organs and mirabile dictu the whole process of reproduc tion was changed you have heard of course that our bodies are continually changing hour by hour minute by min ute so that every few years we have been literally reborn some such principle as this seems to operate in reproduction except that instead of the old body being replaced by the new and in its form approximately the new body is created apart from it it is the creation of children that causes us to die it would seem because if this activity is so to speak dammed up or turned aside into new channels the reproduction operates on the old body renewing it continually it is very obscure and very absurd is it not but the most absurd part of it is that it is true whatever the true explanation may be the fact remains that the operation can be done that it actually prolongs life indefinitely and that i alone know the secret sir john told me a very great deal more but after all i think it amounted to little more than this it would be impossible for me to express the great hold his discovery took upon mymind the moment he recounted it from the very first under the spell of his personality i believed and i knew he was speaking the truth and it opened up before me new vistas i began to see myself become sud denly eternal never again to know the fear of death i could see myself storing up century after century an amplitude of wisdom and experience that would make me truly a god sir john i cried long before he was finished you must perform that operation on me i but dennell you are too hasty you must not put yourself so rashly into my hands you have perfected the operation havent you that is true he said you must try it out on somebody must you not yes of course and yetâsomehow dennell i am afraid i cannot help feeling that man is not yet preparedfor such a vast thing there are sac rifices one must give up love and all sensual pleasure this operation not only takes away the mere fact of reproduction but it deprives one of all the things that go with sex all love all sense of beauty all feeling for poetry and the arts it leaves only the few emotions selfish emotions that are necessary to selfpreservation do you not see one becomes an intellect nothing moreâa cold apotheosis of reason and i for one cannot face such a thing calmly but sir john like many fears it is largely hor rible in the foresight after you have changed your nature you cannot regret it what you are would be as horrible an idea to you afterwards as the thought of what you will be seems now true true i know it but it is hard to face nevertheless i am not afraid to face it i said a little boast fully you do not understand it dennell i am afraid and i wonder whether you or i or any of us on this earth are ready for such a step after all to make a race deathless one should be sure it is a perfect race sir john i said it is not you who have to face this nor any one else in the world till you are ready but i am firmly resolved and i demand it of you as my friend well we argued much further but in the end i won sir john promised to perform the operation three days later but do you perceive now what i had for gotten during all that discussion the one thing i had thought i could never forget so long as i lived not even for an instant it was my love for aliceâ i had forgotten that i cannot write here all the infinity of emotions i experienced later when with alice in my arms it suddenly came upon me what i had done ages agoâi have forgotten how to feel i could name now a thousand feelings i usedto have but i can no longer even understand them for only the heart can understand the heart and the intellect only the intellect with alice in my arms i told the whole story it was she who with her quick instinct grasped what i had never noticed but carl she cried dont you seeâit will mean that we can never be married and for the first time i understood if only i could recapture some conception of that love i have always known since the last shred of comprehension slipped from me that i lost something very wonderful when i lost love but what does it matter i lost alice too and i suppose i could not have kncwn love again without her we were very sad and very tragic that night for hours and hours we argued the question over but i felt somewhat that i was inextricably caught in my fate that i could not retreat now from my resolve i was perhaps very schoolboyish but i felt that it would be cowardice to back out now but it was alice again who perceived a final aspect of the matter carl she said to me her lips very close to mine it need not come between our love after all ours would be a poor sort of love if it were not more of the mind than of the flesh we shall remain lovers but we shall forget mere carnal desire i shall sub mit to that operation too and i could not shake her from her resolve i would speak of danger that i could not let her face but after the fashion of women she disarmed me with the accusation that i did not love her that i did not want her love that i was trying to escape from love what answer had i for that but that i loved her and would do anything in the world not to lose her i have wondered sometimes since whether we might have known the love of the mind is love something entirely of the flesh something created by an ironic god merely to propagate his race or can there be love without emotion love without the coming of the ice passionâlove between two cold intellects i do not know i did not ask then i accepted anything that would make our way more easy there is no need to draw out the tale already my hand wavers and my time grows short soon there will be no more of me no more of my taleâ no more of mankind there will be only the snow and the ice and the cold three days later i entered sir johns hospital with alice on my arm all my affairsâand they were few enoughâwere in order i had insisted that alice wait until i had come safely through the operation before she submitted to it i had been carefully starved for two days and i was lost in an unreal world of white walls and white clothes and white lights drunk with my dreams of the future when i was wheeled into the operating room on the long hard table for a moment it shone with bril liant distinctness a neat methodical white chamber tall and more or less circular then i was beneath the glare of soft white lights and the room faded into a misty vagueness from which little steel rays flashed and quivered from silvery cold instruments for a moment our hands sir johns and mine gripped and we were saying goodbyeâfor a little whileâin the way men say these things then i felt the warm touch of alices lips upon mine and i felt sudden painful things that i cannot describe that i could not have described then for a moment i felt that i must rise and cry out that i could not do it but the feeling passed and i was passive something was pressed about my mouth and nose something with an etherial smell staring eyes swam about me from behind their white masks i strug gled instinctively but in vainâi was held securely infinitesimal points of light began to wave back and forth on a pitchblack background a great hollow buzzing echoed in my head my head seemed sud denly to have become all throat a great cavernous empty throat in which sounds and lights were mingled together in a swift rhythm approaching receding eternally then i think there were dreams but i have forgotten them i began to emerge from the effect of the ether everything was dim but i could perceive alice be side me and sir john bravely done sir john was saying and alice too was saying something but i cannot remember what for a long while we talked i speaking the nonsense of those who are coming out from under ether they teasing me a little solemnly but after a little while i became aware of the fact that they were about to leave suddenly god knows why i knew that they must not leave something cried in the back of my head that they must stayâone cannot explain these things except by after events i began to press them to remain but they smiled and said they must get their dinner i commanded them not to go but they spoke kindly and said they would be back before long i think i even wept a little like a child but sir john said something to the nurse who began to reason with me firmly and then they were gone and somehow i was asleep when i awoke again my head was fairly clear but there was an abominable reek of ether all about jme the moment i opened my eyes i felt that some thing had happened i asked for sir john and for alice i saw a swift curious look that i could not interpret come over the face of the nurse then she was calm again her countenance impassive she re assured me in quick meaningless phrases and told me to sleep but i could not sleep i was absolutely sure that something had happened to them to my friend and to the woman i loved yet all my in sistence profited me nothing for the nurses were a silent lot finally i think they must have given me a sleeping potion of some sort for i fell asleep again for two days two endless chaotic days i saw nothing of either of them alice or sir john i be came more and more agitated the nurse more and more taciturn she would only say that they had gone away for a day or two and then on the third day i found out they thought i was asleep the night nurse had just come in to relieve the other has he been asking about tlem again she asked yes poor fellow i have hardly managed to keep him quiet it is going to be very hard to tell him we will have to keep it from him until he is recovered fully there was a long pause and i could hardly control my laboured breathing how sudden it was one of them said to be killed like thatâ i heard no more for i leapt sud denly up in bed crying out quick for gods sake tell me what has hap pened i jumped to the floor and seized one of them by the collar she was horrified i shook her with a superhuman strength tell me i shouted tell meâor illâ she told meâwhat else could she do they were killed in an accident she gasped in a taxiâa collisionâthe strandâ and at that moment a crowd of nurses and attendants arrived called by the other frantic woman and they put me to bed again i have no memory of the next few days i was in delirium and i was never told what i said during my ravings nor can i express the feelings i was saturated with when at last i regained my mind again between my old emotions and any attempt to put them into words or even to remember them lies always that insurmountable wall of my change i cannot understand what i must have felt i can not express it i only know that for weeks i was sunk in a misery beyond any misery i had ever imagined before the two only friends i had on earth were gone to me i was left alone and for the first time i began to see before me all these endless years that would be the same dull lonely yet i recovered i could feel each day the growth of a strange new vigour in my limbs a vast force that was something tangibly expressive of eternal life slowly my anguish began to die after a week more i began to understand how my emotions were leaving me how love and beauty and everything of which poetry was madeâhow all this was going i could not bear the thought at first i would look at the golden sunlight and the blue shadow of the wind and i would say god how beautiful and the words would echo meaninglessly in my ears or i would re member alices face that face i had once loved amazing stories so inextinguishably and i would weep and clutch my forehead and clench my fists crying god how can i live without her yet there would be a little strange fancy in my head at the same moment saying who is this alice you know no such person and truly i would wonder whether she had ever existed so slowly the old emotions were shed away from me and i began to joy in a corresponding growth of my mental perceptions i began to toy idly with mathematical formulae i had forgotten years ago in the same fashion that a poet toys with a word and its shades of meaning i would look at every thing with new seeing eyes new perception and i would understand things i had never understood before because formerly my emotions had always occupied me more than my thoughts and so the weeks went by until one day i was well what after all is the use of this chronicle surely there will never be men to read it i have heard them say that the snow will never go i will be buried it will be buried with me and it will be the end of us both yet somehow it eases my weary soul a little to write need i say that i lived thereafter many thou sands of thousands of years until this day i can not detail that life it is a long round of new fan tastic impressions coming dreamlike one after another melting into each other in looking back as in looking back upon dreams i seem to recall only a few isolated periods clearly and it seems that my imagination must have filled in the swift movement between episodes i think now of neces sity in terms of centuries and milleniums rather than days and months the snow blows ter ribly about my little fire and i know it will soon gather courage to quench us both years passed at first with a sort of clear wonder i watched things that took place everywhere in the world i studied the other students were much amazed to see me a man of thirty odd com ing back to college but judas dennel youve already got your phd what more do you want so they would all ask me and i would reply i want an md and an frcs i didnt tell them that i wanted degrees in law too and in biology and chemistry in architecture and engi neering in psychology and philosophy even so i believe they thought me mad but poor fools i would think they can hardly realize that i have all of eternity before me for study i went to school for many decades i would pass from university to university leisurely gathering all the fruits of every subject i took up revelling in study as no student revelled ever before there was no need of hurry in my life no fear of death too soon there was a magnificence of vigour in my body and a magnificence of vision and clarity in my brain i felt myself a superman i had only to go on storing up wisdom until the day should come when all knowledge of the world was mine and then i could command the world i had no need for hurry o vast life how i gloried in my eter nity and how little good it has ever done me by the irony of god for several centuries changing my name and passing from place to place i continued my studies i had no consciousness of monotony for to the in tellect monotony cannot exist it was one of those emotions i had left behind one day however in the year a great discovery was made by a man called zarentzov it had to do with the curvature of space quite changing the conceptions that we had all followed since einstein i had long ago mastered the last detail of einsteins theory as had in time the rest of the world i threw my self immediately into the study of this new epoch making conception to my amazement it all seemed to me curiously dim and elusive i could not quite grasp what zarentzov was trying to formulate why i cried the thing is a monstrous fraud i went to the professor of physics in the univer sity i then attended and i told him it was a fraud a huge book of mere nonsense he looked at me rather pityingly i am afraid modevski he said addressing me by the name i was at the time using i am afraid you do not understand it that is all when your mind has broadened you will you should apply yourself more carefully to your physics but that angered me for i had mastered my physics before he was ever born i challenged him to ex plain the theory and he did he put it obvious ly in the clearest language he could yet i under stood nothing i stared at him dumbly until he shook his head impatiently saying that it was use less that if i could not grasp it i would simply have to keep on studying i was stunned i wandered away in a daze for do you see what had happened during all those years i had studied ceaselessly and my mind had been clear and quick as the day i first had left the hospital but all that time i had been able only to remain what i wasâan extraordinarily intelli gent man of the twentieth century and the rest of the race had been progressing it had been swiftly gathering knowledge and power and ability all that time faster and faster while i had been only remaining still and now here was zarentzov and the teachers of the universities and probably a hundred intelligent men who had all outstripped me i was being left behind and that is what happened i need not dilate further upon it by the end of that century i had been left behind by all the students of the world and i never did understand zarentzov other men came with other theories and these theories were accepted by the world but i could not understand them my intellectual life was at an end i had nothing more to understand i knew everything i was capable of knowing and thenceforth i could only play wearily with the old ideas many things happened in the world a time came when the east and west two mighty unified hemis pheres rose up in arms the civil war of a planet i recall only chaotic visions of fire and thunder and hell it was all incomprehensible to me like a bizarre dream things happened people rushed about but i never knew what they were doing ij lurked during all that time in a tiny shuddering hole under the city of yokohama and by a miracle i survived and the east won but it seems tci the coming of the ice have mattered little who did win for all the world had become in all except its few remaining pre judices a single race and nothing was changed when it was all rebuilt again under a single gov ernment i saw the first of the strange creatures who appeared among us in the year men who were later known to be from the planet venus but they were repulsed for they were savages com pared with the earthmen although they were about equal to the people of my own century those of them who did not perish of the cold after the intense warmth of their world and those who were not killed by our hands those few returned silently home again and i have always regretted that i had not the courage to go with them i watched a time when the world reached perfec tion in mechanics when men could accomplish any thing with a touch of the finger strange men these creatures of the hundredth century men with huge brains and tiny shriveled bodies atrophied limbs and slow ponderous movements on their little conveyances it was i with my ancient compunc tions who shuddered when at last they put to death all the perverts the criminals and the insane ridding the world of the scum for which they had no more need it was then that i was forced to produce my tattered old papers proving my identity and my story they knew it was true in some strange fashion of theirs and thereafter i was kept on exhibition as an archaic survival i saw the world made immortal through the new invention of a man called kathol who used some what the same method legend decreed had been used upon me i observed the end of speech of all perceptions except one when men learned to communicate directly by thought and to receive directly into the brain all the myriad vibrations of the universe all these things i saw and more until that time when there was no more discovery but a perfect world in which there was no need for anything but memory men ceased to count time at last several hundred years after the th dynasty from the last war or as we would have counted in my time about ad official records of time were no longer kept carefully they fell into dis use men began to forget years to forget time at all of what significance was time when one was immortal after long long uncounted centuries a time came when the days grew noticeably colder slowly the winters became longer and the summers dimin ished to but a month or two fierce storms raged endlessly in winter and in summer sometimes there was severe frost sometimes there was only frost in the high places and in the north and the sub equatorial south the snow came and would not go men died by the thousands in the higher lati tudes new york became after awhile the furthest habitable city north an arctic city where warmth seldom penetrated and great fields of ice began to make their way southward grinding before them the brittle remains of civilizations covering over relentlessly all of mans proud work snow appeared in florida and italy one summer in the end snow was there always men left new york chicago paris yokohama and everywhere they traveled by the millions southward perishing as they went pursued by the snow and the cold and that inevitable field of ice they were feeble creatures when the cold first came upon them but i speak in terms of thousands of years and they turned every weapon of science to the recovery of their physical power for they foresaw that the only chance for survival lay in a hard strong body as for me at last i had found a use for my few powers for my physique was the finest in that world it was but little comfort however for we were all united in our awful fear of that cold and that grinding field of ice all the great cities were deserted we would catch silent fearful glimpses of them as we sped on in our machines over the snowâgreat hungry haggard skeletons of cities shrouded in banks of snow snow that the wind rustled through desolate streets where the cream of human life once had passed in calm security yet still the ice pursued for men had forgotten about that last ice age when they ceased to reckon time when they lost sight of the future and steeped themselves in memories they had not remembered that a time must come when ice would lie white and smooth over all the earth when the sun would shine bleakly between unending intervals of dim twilit snow and sleet slowly the ice pursued us down the earth until all the feeble remains of civilization were gathered in egypt and india and south america the deserts flowered again but the frost would come always to bite the tiny crops for still the ice came all the world now but for a narrow strip about the equator was one great silent desolate vista of stark ice plains ice that brooded above the hidden ruins of cities that had endured for hundreds of thousands of years it was terrible to imagine the awful solitude and the endless twilight that lay on these places and the grim snow sailing in silence over all and so we existed hoping still that the ice might go again until at last it closed in upon us from north and south it came from every side and the boundaries of east and west were the frozen oceans fathoms deep in ice it closed about us it surrounded us on all sides until life remained only in a few scattered clearings all about that equa tor of the globe with an eternal fire going to hold away the hungry ice perpetual winter reigned now and we were become terrorstricken beasts that preyed on each other for a life already doomed ah but i i the archaic survival i had my revenge then with my great physique and strong jawsâ god let me think of something else those men who lived upon each otherâit was horrible and i was one so inevitably the ice closed in one day the men of our tiny clearing were but a score we hud dled about our dying fire of bones and stray logs we said nothing we just sat in deep wordless thoughtless silence we were the last outpost of mankind i think suddenly something very noble must have transformed these creatures to a semblance of what they had been of old i saw in their eyes the question they sent from one to another and in every eye i saw that the answer was yes with continued on page the scientific adventdures of mrfosdick by jacque morgan mr fosdick invents the seidlitzmobile in seven of the nine towns it passed through it was reported as a comet the other two wired the weather bureau of the visitation of that most unusual phenomenon of nature a dry cloudburst seidlitzmobile pardon me mr hiram snodgrass did not look up from his desk it was saturday and nearly noon and the automobile was panting outside to take him out to the country club where he had a golf game on with his soninlaw pardon me the president of the ajax manufacturing com pany only dipped his pen again in the violet ink and scribbled the faster a half hundred letters still re mained to be signed and mr snodgrass figured that even with the simplest of luncheons he would be an hour late upon the green and this afternoon he purposed having his revenge for the saturday before the husband of his offspring had stung him to the tune of eight up pardon me mr snodgrass swung in his chair well what is it the inquiry came explosively and with a fierce sudden heat like the momentary opening of a furnace door it was mr snodgrass wayâa manner to which none in the office ever paid the slightest heed you are mr snodgrass yes i am snapped that individual what of it the stranger a man with mild blue eyes and vague rambling whiskers seated himself did you ever he began take first the blue and then the white of a common ordinary seidlitz powder mr snodgrass threw his head back aghast at the query no i have not he bellowed the stranger was unperturbed well then try it and drawing from his pocket one of the powders in question walked coolly over to the water filter and filling the glass drop ped in the blue powder which he stirred with a long index finger the result will surprise you ill do nothing of the dashed kind roared mr snodgrass and say he demanded as he caught the stenographer tittering behind her note book who the devil are you and how did you get in here for answer the strang er laid upon the presidents desk a card jason q fosdick inventor mr snodgrass features experienced a sudden transformation the belligerent expression faded away and a smile of genuine pleasure suffuses all of the countenance visible above and in front of the muttonchop whiskers my dear mr fosdick i am delighted to meet you i he ejaculated i suppose you dropped in to see how the nutcrackers the artist elihu vedder in telling some incidents of his younger life describes feeding a little negro boy with seidlitz powders separately administered with a cor responding alarming result in this excruciatingly funny story mr fosdickâwe hesitate to call him a heroâgives himself the expanding dose and thus succeeds in his de sire to interest a capitalist friend in an automobile to be driven by the gas from seidlitz powder try to imagine for yourself what happened when a heavy charge of sodium carbonate and sulphuric acid were substituted for the comparatively mild seidlits powder but read the story through and you will agree that baron munchhau sen in the wildest flights of his imagination takes a sec ond place to this presentation of mr fosdicks invention see how humor can be evolved even from what so many people call the dryness of chemistry a capital story which you wont forget soon are getting along the device was an utter failure as a curling ironâbut as a nutcracker it has been an unqualified success it is going to make you a rich man mr fosdick your royalties are now amounting to over a hundred dollars a week mr fosdick shook his head no i am not herei on that account i have a new invention that want to interest you in and the nature of it is what inquired mr snodgrass an automobile run by these and the inventor held up a seidlitz powder there is a wonderful lot of power in a seidlitz powder mr snodgrass just take first the blue and then the white he said offering the glass and at the same time unfolding the white paper containing the other half of the powder mr snodgrass drew back in some alarm no ill take your word for it please take it insisted mr fosdick its a beautiful experiment it gives a pressure of ten atmospheresâone hundred and fifty pounds damn it man im not built for a hundred and fifty pounds i couldnt stand itâid blow upâi havent any safety valve the inventor shook his head solemnly in that mr snodgrass you are mistaken the human diaphragm will stand one hundred and sixty pounds you see there is a margin of safety of ten poundsâ the experiment is perfectly safe i tell you i wont cried mr snodgrass over come by a sudden fear that he might be persuaded into such a rash adventure i wont i tell you then i will said mr fosdick calmly lifting the glass just watch here stop that cried the horrified mr snod grass dont do that in here go down into the engine room where we have boiler insurance but the inventor was not to be thwarted with cool deliberation he quaf fed off first the one powder and then the other right here he said after a minutes wait there is power enough to run my seidlitzmobilc eleven and twotenths miles if my cal culations are not wrong and he placed his hand upon the pit of his stomach just feel the pres sure mr snodgrass extended his arm and gingerly prodded the compelling stranger under the ribs nots hard said the inventor warningly re member the margin of safety is only ten pounds mr snodgrass withdrew his hand with lightning like rapidity and the perspiration broke out upori his forehead couldnt you go outside and sit around for awhile he inquired with some trepida tion our building is not very strong and an acci dent would doubtlessly maim many of our clerks i usually dont stir replied mr fosdick solemn ly if i should walk about and stumbleâor if i should even cough or sneeze why then amazing stories yes yes interrupted mr snodgrass just sit perfectly still he said turning off the electric fan keep out of all draughts and please try not to cough ill telephone the fire department and the police as a precaution not necessary said the inventor the pres sure will sink to forty pounds in ten minutes it was a harrowing ten minutes for the president of the ajax manufacturing company when one has reached the mature age of sixty years and has a large family even to grandchildren the staking of ones life against the mere sneeze or cough of an utter stranger is an unnerving thing and the shock and suspense of it all is more than apt to leave the faculties in a numb and dazed condition at any rate when mr fosdick left the office a few minutes after the ordeal he had in his pocket mr snodgrass check of one thousand dollars for the building of the first seidlitzmobile one month later a team drew a queer look ing vehicle in front of the ajax manufacturing company and were unhitched i brought it over here from the shop by mule power explained mr fosdick as i wanted you to take the very first ride in the seidlitzmobile under its own steamâor gas rather mr snodgrass looked the machine over dubiously it looks like a fire extinguisher he ventured thats the very principle that it works on said the inventor you see this reservoir and he pointed to a large burnished brass cylinder under the hood is the mixing chamberâthe stomach of the machine as it were into it the powders are dropped and the carbonic acid gas actuates the two cylinder engine geared to the back axle this link motion controls the cutoff and the reverse and the throttle here permits you to give the engine any head of gas but climb in he added and well be off mr snodgrass with some reluctance stepped into the machine and seated himself mr fosdick fol lowed him and then fishing out of his pocket a seid litz powder he unscrewed a brass cap from a tube that protruded from the floor of the machine dropped the powder through tooted the horn re leased the brakes and they were off it was a down hill road and for two milesâin fact for the entiie length of the hill â the seidlitzmobile behaved splendidly mr snodgrass became enthusiastic its the most silent machine i ever rode in he ejaculated its as quiet as an electric and just think put in mr fosdick the ma chine can be retailed at two hundred dollars it will make us millions all there is to it is a ten dollar engine a brass cylinder four wheels and a seidlitz powder the horse is bound to become as extinct as the dodo every family in the land will possess one it will be a convenience to the rich a blessing to the poor a they had reached the bottom of the hill and the machine stopped whats the matter demanded mr snodgrass his vision of riches suddenly fading away mr fosdick got out and looked the machine over wisely i think the engine has slipped an ec centric he remarked after a few moments of pro found study why man youve no pressure exclaimed the passenger look at the gauge it was true the gauge registered not a single pound mr fosdick fumbled in his pockets but could not find another powder i guess that last powder must have been a weak one he said but see there is a drug storeâand every drug store carries seidlitz powders as long as you keep near the drug stores you need never run out of power mr snodgrass spirits rose we can turn that remark into profit he said we will copyright it the very first thing we will do will he to spend one million dollars in advertising this sentence through out the entire world the seidlitzmobileâthe ma chine that can get its power at any drug store together the two men walked into the drug shop a seidlitz powder if you please said mr fos dick laying ten cents upon the soda counter the apothecary dived back into the mysterious region behind the prescription case and hibernated an hour later he emerged and pleasantly inquired what was wanted a seidlitz powder please reiterated mr fos dick pointing to the dime the druggist rubbed his hands unctuously im sorry that were out of seidlitz powders he said but we have something just as good we haveâ nothing but seidlitz roared mr snodgrass giving way to one of his sudden outbursts the druggist smiled blandly how old is the patient he asked its a machine cried mr snodgrass ah indeed remarked the druggist looking at mr snodgrass queerly and may i ask what is the matter with it it wont go bellowed mr snodgrass yes yes agreed the druggist it wont go and he backed behind the counter and reached for the telephone ill have a nice man in a pretty blue suit with bright brass buttons here in just a few minutes and he will make your head stop ach ing he promised them soothingly you think we are crazy accused mr snodgrass oh not at all reassured the clerk you are just merely overheated mr fosdick intervened the machine is an auto mobile run by carbonic acid gas he explained and thats why we wanted the seidlitz powder a sigh of relief escaped the druggist why didnt you say sq at first he said i havent had such a scare in years mr fosdick explained the principle of the ma chine mr snodgrass bought a handful of cigars and gave the druggist one who immediately put it back in stock and abstracted a dime out of the cash register and good feeling was restored as i understand it said the druggist your machine generates gas in the same manner as a fire extinguisher or a sodawater charger precisely agreed mr fosdick in that case said the druggist you should use bicarbonate of soda and sulphuric acid mr fosdick with the invariable reluctance of all inventors to adopt the suggestions of outsiders demurred it spoils the name of the machine he said and the name is worth a million in itself seidlitzmobile but the druggist had caught the contagion of his own idea diving back again behind the prescrip tion case he emerged with a bottle of acid and a large sack of bicarbonate come on he said enthusiastically well give it a good dose before mr fosdick could remonstrate further the druggist had emptied a peck of the alkali into the mixing chamber and stood ready with the bottle of acid get in the machine and get all ready to pull out he said cheerfully for when i pour in the sulphuric acid the pressure will generate very quickly mr snodgrass looked at mr fosdick and mr fosdick looked at mr snodgrass hurry said the druggist there was a compelling ring in the apothecarys voice and slowly and with the greatest of reluctance the men climbed into the machine i hope nothing happens groaned mr snod grass mr fosdick made no reply although his face was pale there was a set to his jaw that expressed a determination to stay with his machine to the end no sooner were they seated than the druggist eagerly poured in five gallons of acid and then quickly screwed down the cap there was a sudden click of the pressure gauge and the hand flew around to the extreme limit my god ejaculated mr snodgrass the in dex shows the limit of the gaugeâsix hundred pounds at what point is your safety set there is no safety valve confessed mr fos dick weakly i didnt think it would be necessary the pressure is fine exclaimed the druggist as his eye caught the gauge and agitating the reservoir always increases the action of the acid and catching hold of the wheel he gave the machine a vigorous shaking back and forth stop that screamed mr fosdick do you want to blow us up the druggist suddenly stopped and scratched his chin i forgot something he said cheerfully it is this the acid will eat out your brass reser voir in a few minutes and will probably blow you iinto the next county here yelled mr snodgrass let me out and he made a desperate effort to climb out of the ma chine but the frightened mr fosdick knew there was but one thing to do and that was to reduce the pressure of the reservoir by exhausting the gas through the engine with a sudden movement he threw the throttle wide open and then with the roar of a mogul engine the seidlitzmobile took down the dusty road at better than a hundredmilean hour clip never has there been such a ride chronicled in the annals of automobiling as the maiden effort of the seidlitzmobile it made the ninetythree miles between jonesboro and smiths corner in twenty seven minutes and in seven of the nine towns it passed through it was reported as a comet the other two wired the weather bureau of the visita j tion of that most unusual phenomenon of nature a dry cloudburst as the machine tore its way across the state spouting carbonic acid gas from its exhaust pipes it asphyxiated thirtyseven dogs that endeavored to pursue it and killed all vegetation on both sides of the road for a distance of two hundred yards goose creek which paralleled the road for forty miles ran pure sodawater for two weeks afterwards and it cost mr snodgrass seven thou sand dollars to have the oxygen replaced in forty three townships which he did only after suit had been filed how far the machine would have traveled is diffi cult to determine although old prof snooks mr fosdicks implacable enemy calculated that the seidlitzmobile would have gone three and a fraction times around the earth before becoming winded but as a matter of history it did not go this dis tance it made one hundred and eleven miles before the druggists prediction came true at smithers junction the reservoir exploded it changed the course of wild cat run the concussion was felt in nine states and the seismograph at the university of tokio reported an earthquake somewhere in the aleutian islands mr snodgrass and mr fosdick finally came to earth on a haystack in an adjoining township after having made an ascent of two hours and fifteen minutes missing luncheon en route the aero club of france which sent a special representative to the spot calculated their flight at something over two million kilometers and presented both men with a pilots license and an honorary membership in the club which it must be told they both refused say ing that their flight was unpremeditated and that they could not honorably accept the licenses when mr snodgrass alighted upon the haystack he found that mr fosdick had preceded him by some minutes there was a dazed dreamy look upon mr fosdicks face that somewhat alarmed his companion whats the matter fosdick he inquired shak ing him are you unconscious no replied the genius coming out of his mus ing with an appreciable effort i have just thought of a new invention well you can leave me out retorted mr snod grass sourly the end the star by hg wells author of the war of the worlds the time machine etc above were the lava hot gases and ash and below the seething floods and the whole earth swayed and rumbled with the earthquake the star it was on the first day of the new year that the announcement was made al most simultaneously from three obser vatories that the motion of the planet neptune the outermost of all the planets that wheeled about the sun had become er ratic ogilvy had already called attention to a sus pected retardation in its velocity in december such a piece of news was scarcely calculated to interest the world the greater portion of whose inhabitants were unaware of the existence of the planet neptune nor outside the astronomical profession did the sub sequent discovery of a faint remote speck of light in the region of the perturbed planet cause any great excitement scientific people however found the intelligence remarkable enough even before it became known that the new body was rapidly growing larger and brighter that its motion was quite different from the orderly progress of the planets and that the deflection of neptune and its satellite was becoming now of an unprecedented kind few people without training in science can real ize the huge isolation of the solar system the sun with its specks of planets its dust of plane toids and its impalpable comets swims in vacant immensity that almost defeats the imagination beyond the orbit of neptune there is space vacant so far as human observation has penetrated without warmth or light or sound blank emptiness for twenty billion times a million miles that is the smallest estimate of the distance to be traversed before the nearest of the stars is attained and saving a few comets more unsubstantial than the thinnest flame no matter had ever to human knowl edge crossed the gulf of space until early in the twentieth century this wanderer appeared a vast mass of matter it was bulky heavy rush ing without warning out of the black mystery of the sky into the radiance of the sun by the sec ond day it was clearly vis ible to any decent instru ment as a speck with a barely sensible diameter in the constellation leo near regulus in a little while an opera glass could attain it on the third day of the new year the newspaper readers of two hemispheres were made aware for the first time of the real importance of this unusual apparition in the heavens a planetary collision one london paper headed the news and proclaimed duchines opinion that this strange new planet would probably collide with neptune the leader writers enlarged upon the topic so that in most of the capitals of the world on jan there was an expectation however vague of some eminent phe nomenon in the sky and as the night followed the sunset round the globe thousands of men turned their eyes skyward to seeâthe old familiar stars just as they had always been pj ere is an impressive story based on the intcraclion of planetary bodies and of the sun upon them a great star is seen approaching the earth at first it is only an object of interest to the general public but there is an astronomer on the earth zvho is watching each phase and making mathematical calculations for lie knows the intimate relation of gravitation between bodies and the effect on rotating bodies of the same force from an out side source he fears all sorts of wreckage on our earth he warns the people but they as usual discount all he says and label him mad but he was not mad ii g wells in his own way gives us a picturesque description of the approach of the new body through long days ami nightsâhe tells hozv the earth and natural phenomena of the earth will react though this star never touches our sphere the devastation and destruction wrought by it are complete and horrible the story is correct in its astronomical aspects until it was dawn in london and pollux setting and the stars overhead grown pale the winters dawn it was a sickly filtering accumulation of day light and the light of gas and candles shone yellow in the windows to show where people were astir but the yawning policeman saw the thing the busy crowds in the market stopped agape workmen going to their work betimes milkmen the drivers of news carts dissipation going home jaded and pale home less wanderers sentinels on their beats and in the country laborers trudging afield poachers slinking home all over the dusky quickening country it would be seenâand out at sea by seamen watching for the dayâa great white star come suddenly into the westward sky brighter it was than any star in our skies brighter than the evening star at its brightest it still glowed out white and large no mere twinkling spot of light but a small round clear shining disk an hour after the day had come and where science has not reached men stared and feared telling one another of the wars and pestilences that are fore shadowed by these fiery signs in the heavens sturdy boers dusky hottentots gold coast ne groes frenchmen spaniards portuguese stood in the glow of the sunrise watching the setting of this strange new star and in a hundred observatories there had been suppressed excitement rising almost to shouting pitch as the two remote bodies had rushed together there had been a hurrying to and fro to gather photographic apparatus and spectroscope to gather this appliance and that to record the novel as tonishing sight the destruction of a worldâfor it was a world a sister planet of our earth far greater than our earth in deed that had so sudden ly flashed into flaming death neptune it was which had been struck fairly and squarely by the planet from outer space and the heat of con cussion had incontinently turned two solid globes into one vast mass of in candescence round the world that day two hours before the dawn went the pallid great white star fading only as it sank westward and thg sun mounted above it everywhere man marveled at it but of all those who saw it none could have marveled more than those sailors habitual watchers of the stars who far away at sea had heard nothing of its advent and saw it now rise like a pigmy moon and climb zenithward and hang overhead and sink westward with the passing of the night and when next it rose over europe everywhere were crowds of watchers on hilly slopes on house roofs in open spaces staring eastward waiting for the rising of the new star it rose with a white glow in front like the glare of a white fire and those who had seen it come into existence the night before cried out at the sight of it it is larger amazing stories they cried it is brighter and indeed the moon a quarter full and sinking in the west was in its apparent size beyond comparison but scarcely in all its breadth had it as much brightness now as the little circle of the strange new star it is brighter cried the people clustering in the streets but in the dim observatories the watchers held their breath and peered at one an other it is nearer they said nearer and voice after voice repeated it is nearer and the clicking telegraph took that up and it trembled along telephone wires and in a thousand cities grimy compositors fingered the type it is nearer men writing in offices struck with strange realization flung down their pens men talking in a thousand places suddenly came upon a grotesque possibility in those words it is nearer it hurried along awakening streets it was shouted down the froststilled ways of quiet villages men who had read these things from the throbbing tape stood in yellowlit doorways shouting the news to the passersby it is nearer pretty women flushed and glittering heard the news told jestingly be tween dances and feigned an intelligent interest they did not feel nearer indeed how curious how clever people must be to find out things like that lonely tramps faring through the wintry night murmured those words to comfort themselvesâlook ing skyward it has need to be nearer for the nights as cold as charity dont seem much warmth from it if it is nearer all the same what is a new star to me cried the weeping woman kneeling beside her dead the schoolboy rising early for his examination work puzzled it out for himselfâwith the great white star shining broad and bright through the frostflowers of his window centrifugal centri petal he said with his chin on his fist stop a planet in its flight rob it of its centrifugal force what then centripetal has it and down it falls into the sun and thisâ do we come in the way i wonderâ the light of that day went the way of its brethren and with the later watches of the frosty darkness rose the strange star again and it was now so bright that the waxing moon seemed but a pale yel low ghost of itself rising huge in the sunset hour in a south african city a great man had married and the streets were alight to welcome his return with his bride even the skies have illuminated said the flatterer under capricorn two negro lov ers daring the wild beasts and evil spirits for love of one another crouched together in a cane brake where the fireflies hovered that is our star they whispered and felt strangely comforted by the sweet brilliancy of its light the master mathematician sat in his private room and pushed the papers from him his calculations were already finished in a small white phial there still remained a little of the drug that had kept him awake and active for four long nights each day serene explicit patient as ever he had given his lecture to his students and then had come back at once to this momentous calculation his face was grave a little drawn i and hectic from his drugged activity for some time he seemed lost in thought then he went to the window and the blind went up with a click half way up the sky over the cluster ing roofs chimneys and steeples of the city hung the star he looked at it as one might look into the eye of a brave enemy you may kill me he said after a si lence but i can hold youâand all the universe for that matterâin the grip of this little brain i would not change even now he looked at the little phial there will be no need of sleep again he said the next day at noon punctual to the minute he entered his lecture thea ter put his hat on the end of the table as his habit was and carefully selected a large piece of chalk it was a joke among his students that he could not lecture without that piece of chalk to fumble in his fingers and once he had been stricken to impotence by their hiding his supply he came and looked un der his gray eyebrows at the rising tiers of young fresh faces and spoke with his accustomed studied commonness of phrasing circumstances have ari senâcircumstances beyond my control he said and paused which will debar me from completing the course i had designed it would seem gentlemen if i may put the thing clearly and briefly thatâman has lived in vain the students glanced at one another had they heard aright mad raised eyebrows and grin ning lips there were but one or two faces remained intent upon his calm grayfringed face it will be interesting he was saying to devote this morning to an exposition so far as i can make it clear to you of the calculations that have led me to this conclu sion let us assumeâ he turned toward the blackboard meditating a diagram in the way that was usual to him what was that about lived in vain whispered one stu dent to another listen said the other nodding toward the lecturer and presently they began to understand that night the star rose later for its proper east ward motion had carried it some way across leo toward virgo and its brightness was so great that the sky became a luminous blue as it rose and every star and planet was hidden save only jupiter near the zenith capella aldebaran sirius and the poin ters of the bear it was white and beautiful in many parts of the world that night a pallid halo en circled it about it was perceptibly larger in the clear refractive sky of the tropics it seemed as if it were nearly a quarter of the size of the moon the frost was still on the ground in england but the world was as brightly lit as if it were midsummer moonlight one could see to read quite ordinary print by that cold clear light and in the cities the lamps burnt yellow and wan and everywhere the world was awake that night ind throughout christendom a somber murmur hung in the keen air over the countryside like the buzzing of the bees in the heather and this murmurous tum ult grew to a clangor in the cities it was the tolling of the bells in a million belfry towers and steeples summoning the people to sleep no more to sin no more but to gather in their churches and pray and overhead growing larger and brighter as the earth rolled on its way and the night passed rose the dazzling star and the streets and houses were alight in all the cities the shipyards glared and whatever roads led the star to high country were lit and crowded all night long and in all the seas about the civilized lands ships with throbbing engines and ships with bellying sails crowded with men and living creatures were standing out to ocean and the north for already the warning of the master mathematician had been telegraphed over the world and translated into a hundred tongues the new planet and neptune locked in a fiery embrace were whirling headlong ever faster and faster toward the sun already every second this blazing mass flew a hundred miles and every second its terrific velocity increased as it flew its course it must pass a hundred million of miles wide of the earth and scarcely affect it but near its destined path as yet only slightly perturbed spun the mighty planet jupiter and his moons sweeping splendid around the sun every moment now the attraction between the fiery star and the greatest of the planets grew stronger and the result of that attraction inevitably jupiter would be deflected from its orbit to a new elliptical path and the burning star swung by his attraction wide of its sunward rush would describe a curved path and perhaps collide with and certainly pass close to our earth earthquakes volcanic out breaks cyclones sea waves floods and a steady rise in temperature to i know not what limitâso pro phesied the master mathematician and overhead to carry out his words lonely and cold and livid blazed the star of the coming doom to many who stared at it that night until their eyes ached it seemed that it was visibly approach ing and that night too the weather changed and the frost that had gripped all central europe and france and england softened towards a thaw but you must not imagine because i have spoken of people praying through the night and people go ing aboard ships and people fleeing towards moun tainous country that the whole world was already in a terror because of the star as a matter of fact use and wont still ruled the world and save for the talk of idle moments and the splendor of the night nine human beings out of ten were still busy at their common occupations in all the cities the shops save one here and there opened and closed at their proper hours the doctor and the undertaker plied their trades and workers gathered in the factories soldiers drilled scholars studied lovers sought one another thieves lurked and fled politicians planned their schemes the presses of the newspapers roared through the nights and many a priest of this church and that would not open his holy building to further what he considered a foolish panic the newspapers insisted on the lesson of the year âfor then too people had anticipated the end the star was no starâmere gasâa comet and were it a star it could not possibly strike the earth there was no precedent for such a thing common sense was sturdy everywhere scornful jesting a little inclined to persecute the obdurate fearful that night at by greenwich time the star would be at its nearest to jupiter then the world would see the turn things would take the master mathema ticians grim warnings were treated by many as so much mere elaborate selfadvertisement common sense at last a little heated by argument signified its unalterable convictions by going to bed so too barbarism and savagery already tired of the novel ty went about their nightly business and save for a howling dog here and there the beastworld left the star unheeded and yet when at last the watchers in the euro pean states saw the star rise an hour later it is true but no larger than ithad been the night be fore there were still plenty awake to laugh at the master mathematicianâto take the danger as if it had passed but hereafter the laughter ceased the star grew âit grew with a terrible steadiness hour after hour a little larger each hour a little nearer the midnight zenith and brighter and brighter until it had turned night into day had it come straight to the earth instead of in a curved path had it lost no velocity to jupiter it must have leapt the intervening gulf in a day but as it was it took five days altogether to come by our planet the next night it had become a third the size of the moon before it set to english eyes and the thaw was assured it rose over america nearly the size of the moon but blinding white to look at and hot and a breath of hot wind blew now with its rising and gathering strength and in virginia and brazil and down the st lawrence valley it shone intermittently through a driving reek of thunder clouds flickering violet lightning and hail unprecedented in manitoba were a thaw and devastating floods and upon all the mountains of the earth the snow and ice began to melt that night and all the rivers coming out of high country flowed thick and turbid and soonâin their upper reachesâwith swirling trees and the bodies of beasts and men they rose steadily stead ily in the ghostly brilliance and came trickling over their banks at last behind the flying population of their valleys and along the coast of argentina and up the south atlantic tides were higher than they had ever been in the memory of man and the storms drove the waters in many cases scores of miles inland drowning whole cities and so great grew the heat during the night that the rising of the sun was like the coming of a shadow the earthquakes began and grew until all down america from the arctic circle to cape horn hillsides were sliding fissures were opening and houses and walls crumbling to destruction china was lit glowing white but over japan and java and all the islands of eastern asia the great star was a ball of dull red fire because of the steam and smoke and ashes the volcanoes were spouting forth to salute its coming above were the lava hot gases and ash and below the seething floods and the whole earth swayed and rumbled with the earth quake shocks soon the immemorial snows of tibet and the himalayas were melting and pouring down by ten million deepening converging channels upon the plains of burma and hindustan the tangled summits of the indian jungles were aflame in a thousand places and below the hurrying waters around the stems were dark objects that struggled feebly and reflected the blood red tongues of fire and in ungovernable confusion a multitude of men and women fled down the broad riverways to that one last hope of menâthe open sea larger grew the star and larger hotter and brighter with a terrible swiftness now the tropi cal ocean had lost its phosphorescence and the whir amazing stories ling steam rose in ghostly wreaths from the black waves that plunged incessantly speckled with storm tossed ships and then came a wonder it seemed to those who in europe watched for the rising of the star that the world must have ceased its rotation in a thousand open spaces of down and upland the people who had fled thither from the floods and the falling houses and sliding slopes of hill watched for that rising in vain hour followed hour through a terrible sus pense and the star rose not once again men set their eyes upon the old constellations they had coun ted lost to them forever in england it was hot and clear overhead though the ground quivered perpetu ally but in the tropics sirius and capella and alde baran showed through a veil of steam and when at last the great star rose near ten hours late the sun rose close upon it and in the center of its white heart was a disk of black over asia the star had begun to fall behind the movement of the sky and then suddenly as it hung over india its light had been veiled all the plain of india from the mouth of the indus to the mouths of the ganges was a shallow waste of shining water that night out of which rose temples and palaces mounds and hills black with people every minaret was a clustering mass of people who fell one by one into the turbid waters as heat and terror overcame them the whole land seemed awailing and sud denly there swept a shadow across that furnace of despair and a breath of cold wind and a gathering of clouds out of the cooling air men looking up nearly blinded at the star and sav that black disk creeping across the light it was the moon coming between the star and the earth and even as men cried to god at this respite out of the east with a strange inexplicable swiftness sprang the sun and then star sun and moon rushed together across the heavens so it was that presently to the european watch ers star and sun rose close upon each other drove headlong for a space and then slower and at last came to rest star and sun merged into one glare of flame at the zenith of the sky the moon no longer eclipsed the star but was lost to sight in the brilli ance of the sky and though those who were still alive regarded it for the most part with that dull stupidity that hunger fatigue heat and despair engender there were still men who could perceive the meaning of these signs star and earth had been at their nearest had swung about one another and the star had passed already it was receding swifter and swifter in the last stage of its head long journey downward into the sun and then the clouds gathered blotting out the vision of the sky the thunder and lightning wove a garment around the world all over the earth was such a downpour of rain as men had never seen before and where the volcanoes flared red against the cloud canopy there descended torrents of mud everywhere the waters were pouring off the land leaving mud stilted ruins and the earth littered like a stormworn beach with all that had floated and the dead bodies of the men and brutes its children for days the water streamed off the land sweep ing away soil and trees and houses in the way and piling huge dikes and scooping out titanic gullies over the countryside those were the days of dark ness that followed the star and the heat all through them and for many weeks and months the earthquakes continued but the star had passed and men hungerdriven and gathering courage only slowly might creep back to their ruined cities buried granaries and sodden fields such few ships as had escaped the storms of that time came stunned and shattered and sound ing their way cautiously through the new marks and shoals of once familiar ports and as the storms subsided men perceived that everywhere the days were hotter than of yore and the sun larger and the moon shrunk to a third of its former size took now fourscore days between its new and new but of the new brotherhood that grew presently among men of the saving of laws and books and machines of the strange change that had come over iceland and greenland the shores of baffins bay so that the sailors coming there presently found them green and gracious and could scarce believe their eyes this story does not tell nor of the movement of mankind now that the earth was hotter north ward and southward towards the poles of the earth it concerns itself only with the coming and the passing of the star the martian astronomersâfor there are astrono mers on mars although they are different beings from menâwere naturally profoundly interested by these things they saw them from their own standpoint of course considering the mass and temperature of the missile that was flung through our solar system into the sun one wrote it is astonishing what little damage the earth which it missed so narrowly has sustained all the familiar continental markings and the masses of the seas remain intact and indeed the only difference seems to be a shrinkage of the white discoloration sup posed to be frozen water round either pole which only shows how small the vastest of human catastrophies may seem at a distance of a few mil lion miles the end next month two fascinating new stories which you wont forget for a long time blasphemers plateau by alexander snyder the telepathic pickup by samuel m sargent jr also these wellknown reprints the moon metal by professor garrett p serviss the magnetic storm by hugo gernsback frs whispering ether by charles s wolfe i point it right at his head and makin my voice as hard as i can i says tenselike you speak one word and youll eat your breakfast in hell and proctor smiles get that with my gat aimed at his head he smiles and fellow when proctor smiles it gives you the creeps im not a scientist cans is my line safes you know soup nitrogly cerine that kind of thing get me shoemaker stick to your last them is my sentiments and i stick to my own trade but now that they got me tied up in this con founded jail and i aint got much to do with my spare time i got a notion to jot down what i know about that proctor affair that you maybe read about in the papers reporters was after me thick when it hap pened but i was the silent kid it pays to keep your mouth shut in the circles i move in proctors in the bug house three alienists or an amazing story by that versatile author mr wolfe the ether is something ive know nothing about but its action and its waves give a basis for the strange mys tery we are told of here it touches on the world of ether waves to which our radio fans arc appealing and while this of course is in the realm of abstruce science we have again in this story the everyday crude thinker mystified by it all and this is the history of the world the intelligence of each of us is very limited and our habits and ways of thought arc only a little more clumsy than our authors characters whom he uses to bring out as always a wonderful contrast the story is well worth reading whatever you call those ginks that admit theyre sane and prove youre not pronounced him hopelessly insane i aint disputing no jury of my peers if they say lies a nut hes a nut thats all but i didnt get introduced to proctor in the regular way we didnt have no mutual ac quaintances to slip us the knockdown it all came about thru me droppin in one night casual like to blow his safe you might wonder what a yegg would want out of a laboratory safe maybe youll wise up when i tip you it was a con tract job not my own see im namin no names but there was a gang of big guys that wanted old proctors formula for chero and thought it would amazing stories be cheaper to buy it off me than him anyway im after the paper with the makeup of this explosive when i jimmied the laboratory window im say in this right here proctor may be a nut but hes no boob i was expecting burglar alarms scientific thief traps all that kind of stuff and i was all fixt for an electrified box proctor put one over on me just the same and if he didnt do it with the mind machine how in hell else do you account for it i was workin on the old can she was a fairly respectable affair and i make up my mind to blow her i was drillin away when click goes a switch and the sudden flare of light dazzled me were you ever caught working on a guys safe brother no well take it from oscar its like nothing you ever felt before even before i can see right my minds workin overtime hunting for a way out and then i can see again and there stands proctor a long cord trailing behind him and phones over his ears like the wireless men and i notice with joy that he aint got a gatânot that i can see anyway i risk it just as quick as i can draw i flashes my automatic i point it right at his head and makin my voice as hard as i can i says tense like you speak one word and youll eat your break fast in hell and proctor smiles get that with my gat at his head he smiles and fellow when proctor smiles it gives you the creeps and then he saysâ s help meâpm not bullyin youâput your gun away my man its not loaded can you beat that it wasnt either but how did he know it bluffing thats what i thought and i sees his bet and raises him you move i growls and youll discover youre a bad guesser he smiles again say i can fel my flesh creep yet its not loaded he says very calm and he walks a few steps toward me i dont shoot you cant you know with an empty gun and i see that hes called my bluff you win i says it aint but i can beat the life out of you with it that smile again his hand goes to his pocket he pulls out a little bottle just about the size they sell you pills in that my friend he says is full of chero if i just toss it at your feet youll never attempt to steal a formula again on this planet does he win he owns the building callthe officer and i chucks the gun on the floor ill go quietly sensible he remarks very sensible you possess judgment even if you do lack courage who sent you here call in the bulls i growls pm not squealing he takes no notice i know who sent you i knew you were coming look here i blurts if that gang framed me ill talk they sent for me i didnt go to them i no one informed me if thats what you mean he says coldly it is not necessary for any one to inform me of anything the world is an open book to me thats just what he told that gang of sawbones afterwards and they said he was looney but if they had seen him as i seen him he was talking again my man i wriggled when he spoke the men for whom you work are imbeciles i have named my price for chero and they dont want to pay it they believe they can wrest it from me by force or trickery you are their first emissary and it is my wish that you be their last i am going to convince them that it is useless to attempt anything of the kind with me i am not going to turn you over to the police i am going to show you something and then i am going to send you back to your masters to tell them what you have seen after that he smiled i dont think i shall be troubled by them come he stalked into the next room me at his heels there wasnt much in that roomâjust a table covered with apparatus i have seen a wireless set it looked something like that onlyâwell there was something different about it he pointed to it oh i can see him yet with his flashing eyes and his big dome there says he is the mind machine and you a criminal are the first man to see it except its creator im getting on my feet again and not so scared and so i gazes at it curious what is it doc i asks it reads your thoughts he says just as solemn as an owl thats right laugh i dont blame you i grinned myself he saw me grin and he turned on me like a tiger dolt he hollers clod you doubt pig your type has retarded the progress of mankind throughout the ages you sneerâyou imbecile well just then im like the doctors a nut i thinks and loose with that bottle of chero in his pocket and its up to me to soothe him how does it work i asks to gain time when youre in a room with a nut thats nursin a bottle of h e your one thought is to go away from there and this particular nut dont want me to but i have hopes by dumb luck i hits the right chord how does it work gets results right away he seems to forget hes mad he seems to forget im a yegg he gets kind of dreamy and he runs a caressin hand over the shiny brass of the nearest instrument simple he says very simple it is based on the electromagnetic wave and the conducting ether theories its over my head but i listen have you ever considered just what happens when you think intensely by an effort of what you call the will you concentrate on what you are thinking emotion too plays its part you are intensely angry intensely worried intensely interested this concentrating acts physically on the brain there is a call on the heart for more blood and the heart responds sending a thicker faster stream to the affected locality now what happens he turns to me like my teacher used to do in school when there was a question to be answered search me i murmurs but he doesnt even see me i guess the in creased stream rushing at an unusual rate rubs against the walls of the veins and arteries of the head producing friction i see i says politely but i dont this friction is the physical result of the mental action your purely mental process has by the membership of the rushing blood and its attending whispering ether friction been transformed into or has produced a physical manifestation his voice sank to a whisper it is this fact that makes my great invention possible the friction set up produces faint currents of electricity it is natures own generator the currents are faint weak but they are there and they vary in in tensity in proportion as the rushing blood stream surges and ebbs thus they have imprinted on them all the characteristics of the thought that gives rise to them they vary in the individual some minds can generate a current one hundredâyes one thou sandâtimes greater than others but all minds generate to some extent and these electrical impulses are thrown out into space in wave trains exactly as the radio tele graph throws them out this accounts for the phenomena of mental telepathy if conditions are just right the receiving mind in perfect tune with the transmitting mind and sensitive enough to interpret the received impulses you have accom plished telepathy all that remained for me to do was to measure the intensity and characteristics of the generated current its frequencyâand it is high âand he paused and fixt me with that fishy stare i didnt know just what to say so i took a brody and what doc slip it to me quick and the length of the emitted wave he comes back at me triumphantly it might be one mil lionth of a meter or it might be one million meters or it might be any length between those extremes or beyond them for that matter i succeeded in making these measurements he laughed or rather he laughed and snarled all at once im telling you straight fellow your hair stands on end when proctor laughs like that i fancy some of your radio experts would gape if they were permitted to see my wave meter i be lieve it would cause some excitement in the labora tories of lodge or marconi iâproctorâi measured these waves which of course means that i found a detector for them our friend deforest thinks that he has a monopoly on ultrasensitive detectors proctors detector is to the audion what a stop watch is to a wheel barrow and the frequency it is beyond the limits of audibility as that term is understood i wound phones that will render the received signals audible and the task was done most of that stuff had gone over but like a light ning flash the big idea burst thru my shrapnel proof cranium i fairly stuttered as i got his drift ill bet my eyes popped as i gaped at that machine good god i spluttered do you mean that that thing can hear you think proctor smiled the nearest to a human smile that i ever saw on his mug you have glimmerings of intelligence he said in a gratified way i mean just that and then he went off his handle again and i mean he roared that you are to go back to the scum that sent you and tell them that it is useless for them to plot against me for i can hear their very thoughts as they think them i can read their miserable souls thats how i knew you were com ing here tonight thats how i knew that your lethal weapon contained no charge and he seized me and shook me until my heels nearly broke my neck and thats how i know you swine that even now you dont know whether to believe me or not he released me and tore the telephone things from off his ears here he bellowed clamping them over my ears here listen and be con vinced he wheeled to the table and whirled knobs and dials a continuous humming and buzzing sounded in the phones and then it happened listen to me close i know they labeled proctor squirrel food for telling them less than this but this was jidy of get that suddenly something like a voiceâno not like a voice eitherâlike a voice inside my own head if you can get me said masterfully with a strong ger man accent serbia mil because she dare not sub mit france must because she will see my hand behind it england must as a last desperate effort to save herself but my armies will grind them like grain in the mill and then proctor tore the phones from me i was like a stuffed doll and i never raised a mitt he grabbed me and it was just like being caught in the jaws of a vise you have heard he thundered now go the last thing i remember was that he heaved me toward the door i remember spinning toward it and thats all the next thing i remember is waking up in that hospital ward it was july of when proctor chucked me and it was late august when i found myself in that hospital as near as i can learn i missed the door hit the wall and a bottle of that chero stuff got knocked off a shelf they dug proctor and i out of the ruins and we were both pretty well messed up proctor raved about his ruined mind machine and it got him a pass to the squirrel cage if you read the papers at the time youll remem ber proctor wanted me to back him up but i wouldnt talk least said easiest remedied now you got all i know about it i spilled it once to gentleman joe a highbrowed crook who soaked up all they pass you at harvard when he was young joe said maybe proctor fooled me with a camoflaged phonograph maybe he did i might think so myself if it had happened in september instead of july get me the end the runaway skyscraper by murray leinster and before the wigwam were two or three brownskinned indians utterly petrified with astonishment behind the first wig wam were others painted like the first with daubs of brightly colored clay from them too indians issued and stared in incredu lous amazement their eyes growing wider and wider the runaway skyscraper the whole thing started when the clock on the metropolitan tower began to run backward it was not a graceful proceeding the hands had been mov ing onward in their customary de liberate fashion slowly and thoughtfully but sud denly the people in the offices near the clocks face heard an ominous creaking and groaning there was a slight hardly discernible shiver through the tower and then something gave with a crash the big hands on the clock began to move backward immediately after the crash all the creaking and groaning ceased and instead the usual quiet again hung over everything one or two of the occupants of the upper offices put their heads out into the halls but the elevators were running as usual the lights were burning and all seemed calm and peaceful the clerks and stenographers went back to their ledgers and typewriters the business call ers returned to the discussion of their errands and the ordinary course of business was resumed arthur chamberlain was dictating a letter to estelle woodward his sole stenographer when the crash came he paused listened and then resumed his task it was not a difficult one talking to estelle woodward was at no time an onerous duty but it must be admitted that arthur chamberlain found it difficult to keep his conversation strictly upon his business he was at this time engaged in dictating a letter to his principal creditors the gary amp milton com pany explaining that their demand for the im mediate payment of the instalment then due upon his office furniture was untimely and unjust a young and budding engineer in new york never has too much money and when he is young as arthur chamberlain was and as fond of pleasant company and not too fond of economizing he is liable to find all demands for payment untimely and he usually considers them unjust as well arthur finished dictating the let ter and sighed miss woodward he said regretfully i am afraid i shall never make a successful man miss woodward shook her head vaguely she did not seem to take his remark very seriously but then she had learned never to take any of his remarks seriously she had been puzzled at first by his manner of treating everything with a half joking pessimism but now ignored it she was interested in her own problems she had suddenly decided that she was going to be an old maid and it bothered her she had discovered that she did not like any one well enough to marry and she was in her twentysecond year she was not a native of new york and the few young men she had met there she did not care for she had regretfully decided she was too finicky too fastidious but could not seem to help herself she we have all heard of and read about the einstein theory which involves the use in its calculations of the mysterious fourth dimension here our author gives a wonderfully effective picture of what the fourth dimension did in the annihilation of time in the wiping out of the centuries where it brings a company of twentieth century business men and xvomen to a time centuries back from the days of modern nezu yorkâthey are transferred with great rapidity of receding time to the days when indians were the only inhabitants of man hattan until at last the recession of the centuries ceases and gives them pause for a while the modem sky scraper has accompanied them on their way but prob lems of food and support have to be worked out for them in their new position in the ages at last they evolve a way to return to get their skyscraper back to familiar old madison square read and see how they do it could not understand their absorption in boxing and baseball and she did not like the way they danced she had considered the matter and decided that she would have to reconsider her former opinion of women who did not marry heretofore she had thought there must be something the matter with them now she believed that she would come to their own estate and probably for the same reason she could not fall in love and she wanted to she read all the popular novels and thrilled at the lovescenes contained in them but when any of the young men she knew became in the slightest degree sentimental she found herself bored and disgusted with herself for being bored still she could not help it and was struggling to reconcile herself to a life without romance she was far too pretty for that of course and arthur chamberlain often longed to tell her how pretty she really was but her abstracted air held him at arms length he lay back at ease in his swivelchair and con sidered looking aâł her with unfeigned pleasure shegt did not notice it for she was so much absorbed in her own thoughts that she rarely noticed anything he said or did when they were not in the line of her duties miss woodward he repeated i said i think ill never make a successful man do you know what that means she looked at him mutely polite inquiry in her eyes it means he said gravely that i am going broke unless something turns up in the next three weeks or a month at the latest ill have to get a job and that meansâ she asked all this will go to pot he explained with a sweeping gesture i thought id better tell you as much in advance as i could you mean youre go ing to give up your office âand me she asked a little alarmed giving up you will be the harder of the two he said with a smile but thats what it means youll have no difficulty finding a new place with three weeks in which to look for one but im sorry im sorry too mr chamberlain she said her brow puckered she was not really frightened because she knew she could get an other position but she became aware of rather more regret than she had expected there was silence for a moment jove said arthur suddenly its getting dark isnt it it was it was growing dark with unusual rapidity arthur went to his window and looked out funny he remarked in a moment or two things dont look just right down there some how there are very few people about amazing stories he watched in growing amazement lights came on in the streets below but none of the buildings lighted up it grew darker and darker it shouldnt be dark at this hour arthur ex claimed estelle went to the window by his side it looks awfully queer she agreed it must be an eclipse or something they heard doors open in the hall outside and arthur ran out the halls were beginning to fill with excited people what on earths the matter asked a worried stenographer probably an eclipse replied arthur only its odd we didnt read about it in the papers he glanced along the corridor no one else seemed better informed than he and he went back into his office estelle turned from the window as he appeared the streets are deserted she said in a puzzled tone whats the matter did you hear arthur shook his head and reached for the telephone ill call up and find out he said confidently he held the receiver to his ear what theâ he exclaimed listen to this a small sized roar was coming from the receiver arthur hung up and turned a blank face upon estelle look she said suddenly and pointed out of the window all the city was now lighted up and such of the signs as they could see were brilliantly illumined they watched in silence the streets once more seemed filled with vehicles they darted along their headlamps lighting up the roadway brilliantly there was however something strange even about their motion arthur and estelle watched in grow ing amazement and perplexity areâare you seeing what i am seeing asked estelle breathlessly i see them going backward arthur watched and collapsed into a chair for the love of mike he exclaimed softly rotation of the earth reversed he was roused by another exclamation from estelle its getting light again she said arthur rose and went eagerly to the window the darkness was becoming less intense but in a way arthur could hardly credit far to the west over beyond the jersey hillsâ easily visible from the height at which arthurs office was locatedâa faint light appeared in the sky grew stronger and then took on a reddish tint that in turn grew deeper and at last the sun ap peared rising unconcernedly in the ivest arthur gasped the streets below continued to be thronged with people and motorcars the sun was traveling with extraordinary rapidity it rose overhead and as if by magic the streets were thronged with people every one seemed to be running at topspeed the few teams they saw moved at a breakneck paceâbackward in spite of the suddenly topsyturvy state of affairs there seemed to be rid accidents arthur put his hand to his head miss woodward he said pathetically im afraid ive gone crazy do you see the same things i do estelle nodded her eyes wide open what is the matter she asked helplessly she turned again to the window the square was almost empty once more the motorcars still traveling about the streets were going so swiftly they were hardly visible their speed seemed to increase steadily soon it was almost impossible to distinguish them and only a grayish blur marked their paths along fifth avenue and twentythird street it grew dusk and then rapidly dark as their office was on the western side of the building they could not see the sun had sunk in the east but sub consciously they realized that this must be the case in silence they watched the panorama grow black except for the streetlamps remain thus for a time and then suddenly spring into brilliantly illuminated activity again this lasted for a little while and the west once more began to glow the sun rose somewhat more hastily from the jersey hills and began to soar overhead but very soon darkness fell again with hardly an interval the city became illuminated and the west grew red once more apparently said arthur steadying his voice with a conscious effort theres been a cataclysm somewhere the direction of the earths rotation has been reversed and its speed immensely increased it seems to take only about five minutes for a rotation now as he spoke darkness fell for the third time estelle turned from the window with a white face whats going to happen she cried i dont know answered arthur the scientist fellows tell us if the earth were to spin fast enough the centrifugal force would throw us all off into space perhaps thats whats going to happen estelle sank into a chair and stared at him ap palled there was a sudden explosion behind them with a start estelle jumped to her feet and turned a little gilt clock over her typewriterdesk lay in fragments arthur hastily glanced at his own watch great bombs and little cannonballs he shouted look at this his watch trembled and quivered in his hand the hands were going around so swiftly it was impossible to watch the minutehand and the hour hand traveled like the wind while they looked it made two complete revolu tions in one of them the glory of daylight had waxed waned and vanished in the other darkness reigned except for the glow from the electric light overhead there was a sudden tension and catch in the watch arthur dropped it instantly it flew to pieces before it reached the floor if youve got a watch arthur ordered swiftly stop it this instant estelle fumbled at her wrist arthur tore the watch from her hand and threw open the case the machinery inside was going so swiftly it was hardly visible relentlessly arthur jabbed a pen holder in the works there was a sharp click and the watch was still arthur ran to the window as he reached it the sun rushed up day lasted a moment there was darkness and then the sun appeared again the runaway skyscraper miss woodward arthur ordered suddenly look at the ground estelle glanced down the next time the sun flashed into view she gasped the ground was white with snow what has happened she demanded terrified oh what has happened arthur fumbled at his chin awkwardly watching the astonishing panorama outside there was hardly any distinguishing between the times the sun was up and the times it was below now as the darkness and light followed each other so swiftly the effect was the same as one of the old flickering motionpictures as arthur watched this effect became more pro nounced the tall fifth avenue building across the way began to disintegrate in a moment it seemed there was only a skeleton there then that vanished story by story a great cavity in the earth appeared and then another building be came visible a smaller brownstone unimpressive structure with bulging eyes arthur stared across the city except for the flickering he could see almost clearly now he no longer saw the sun rise and set there was merely a streak of unpleasantly brilliant light across the sky bit by bit building by building the city began to disintegrate and become replaced by smaller dingier buildings in a little while those began to disappear and leave gaps where they vanished arthur strained his eyes and looked far down town he saw a forest of masts and spars along the waterfront for a moment and when he turned his eyes again to the scenery near him it was almost barren of houses and what few showed were mean small residences apparently set in the midst of farms and plantations estelle was sobbing oh mr chamberlain she cried what is the matter what has happened arthur had lost his fear of what their fate would be in his absorbing interest in what he saw he was staring out of the window wideeyed lost in the sight before him at estelles cry however he reluctantly left the window and patted her shoulder awkwardly i dont know how to explain it he said un comfortably but its obvious that my first surmise was all wrong the speed of the earths rotation cant have been increased because if it had to the extent we see wed have been thrown off into space long ago butâhave you read anything about the fourth dimension estelle shook her head hopelessly well then have you ever read anything by wells the time machine for instance again she shook her head i dont know how im going to say it so youll understand but time is just as much a dimension as length and breadth from what i can judge id say there has been an earthquake and the ground has settled a little with our building on it only instead of settling down toward the center of the earth or sidewise its settled in this fourth dimension but what does that mean asked estelle un comprehendingly if the earth had settled down wed have been lower if it had settled to one side wed have been moved one way or another but as its settled back in the fourth dimension were going back in time thenâ were in a runaway skyscraper bound for some time back before the discovery of america the seasons are reversed in order it was very still in the office except for the flickering outside everything seemed very much as usual the electric light burned steadily but estelle was sobbing with fright and arthur was trying vainly to console her have i gone crazy she demanded between her sobs not unless ive gone mad too said arthur soothingly the excitement had quite a soothing effect upon him he had ceased to feel afraid but was simply waiting to see what had happened were way back before the founding of new york now and still going strong are you sure thats what has happened if youll look outside he suggested youll see the seasons following each other in reverse order one moment the snow covers all the ground then you catch a glimpse of autumn foliage then sum mer follows and next spring estelle glanced out of the window and covered her eyes not a house she said despairingly not a building nothing nothing nothing arthur slipped his arm about her and patted hers comfortingly its all right he reassured her well bring up presently and there well be theres nothing to be afraid of she rested her head on his shoulder and sobbed hopelessly for a little while longer but presently quieted then suddenly realizing that arthurs arm was about her and that she was crying on his shoulder she sprang away blushing crimson arthur walked to the window look there he exclaimed but it was too late ill swear to it i saw the halfmoon hudsons ship he declared excitedly were way back now and dont seem to be slackening up either estelle came to the window by his side the rap idly changing scene before her made her gasp it was no longer possible to distinguish night from day a wavering streak moving first to the right and then to the left showed where the sun flashed across the sky what makes the sun wabble so she asked moving north and south of the equator arthur explained casually when its farthest southâto the leftâtheres always snow on the ground when its farthest right its summer see how green it is a few moments observation corroborated his statement id say arthur remarked reflectively that it takes about fifteen seconds for the sun to make the round trip from farthest north to farthest south he felt his pulse do you know the normal rate of the heartbeat we can judge time that way a clock will go all to pieces of course amazing stories why did your watch explodeâand the clock running forward in time unwinds a clock doesnt it asked arthur it follows of course that when you move it backward in time it winds up when you move it too far back you wind it so tightly that the spring just breaks to pieces he paused a moment his fingers on his pulse yes it takes about fifteen seconds for all the four seasons to pass that means were going back ward in time about four years a minute if we go on at this rate in another hour well be back in the time of the northmen and will be able to tell if they did discover america after all funny we dont hear any noises estelle ob served she had caught some of arthurs calmness it passes so quickly that though our ears hear it we dont separate the sounds if youll notice you do hear a sort of humming its very highpitched though estelle listened but could hear nothing no matter said arthur its probably a little higher than your ears will catch lots of people cant hear a bat squeak i never could said estelle out in the coun try where i come from other people could hear them but i couldnt they stood a while in silence watching when are we going to stop asked estelle un easily it seems as if were going to keep on indefinitely i guess well stop all right arthur reassured her its obvious that whatever it was it only af fected our own building or wed see some other one with us it looks like a fault or a flaw in the rock the building rests on and that can only give so far estelle was silent for a moment oh i cant be sane she burst out semihyster ically this cant be happening you arent crazy said arthur sharply youre sane as i am just something queer is happening buck up say your multiplication tables say any thing you know say something sensible and youll know youre all right but dont get frightened now therell be plenty to get frightened about later the grimness in his tone alarmed estelle what are you afraid of she asked quickly time enough to worry when it happens arthur retorted briefly youâyou arent afraid well go back before the beginning of the world are you asked estelle in sudden access of fright arthur shook his head tell me said estelle more quietly getting a grip on herself i wont mind but please tell me arthur glanced at her her face was pale but there was more resolution in it than he had expected to find ill tell you then he said reluctantly were going back a little faster than we were and the flaw seems to be a deeper one than i thought at the roughest kind of an estimate were all of a thousand years before the discovery of america now and i think nearer three or four and were gaining speed all the time so though i am as sure as i can be of anything that well stop this cavein eventually i dont know where its like a crevasse in the earth opened by an earthquake which may be only a few feet deep or it may be hundreds of yards or even a mile or two we started off smoothly were going at a terrific rate what will happen when we stop estelle caught her breath what she asked quietly i dont know said arthur in an irritated tone to cover his apprehension how could i know estelle turned from him to the window again look she said pointing the flickering had begun again while they stared hope springing up once more in their hearts it became more pronounced soon they could dis tinctly see the difference between day and night they were slowing up the white snow on the ground remained there for an appreciable time autumn lasted quite a while they could catch the flashes of the sun as it made its revolutions now instead of its seeming likd a ribbon of fire at last day lasted all of fifteen or twenty minutes it grew longer and longer then half an hour then an hour the sun wavered in midheaven and was still far below them the watchers in the tower of the skyscraper saw trees swaying and bending in the wind though there was not a house or a habita tion to be seen and a dense forest covered all of manhattan island such of the world as they could see looked normal whatever or rather in whatever epoch of time they were they had arrived indians occupy madison square arthur caught at estelles arm and the two made a dash for the elevators fortunately one was standing still the door open on their floor the elevatorboy had deserted his post and was looking with all the rest at the strange landscape that surrounded them no sooner had the pair reached the car however than the boy came hurrying along the corridor three or four other people following him also at a run without a word the boy rushed inside the others crowded after him and the car shot down ward all of the newcomers panting from their sprint theirs was the first car to reach the bottom they rushed out and to the western door here where they had been accustomed to see madison square spread out before them a clearing of perhaps half an acre in extent showed itself where their eyes instinctively looked for the dark bronze fountain near which soapbox orators afore time held sway they saw a tent a wigwam of hides and bark gaily painted and before the wigwam were two or three brownskinned indians utterly petrified with astonishment behind the first wigwam were others painted like the first with daubs of brightly colored clay from them too indians issued and stared in incredulous amazement their eyes growing wider andwider when the group of white people con fronted the indians there was a moments deathlike silence then with a wild yell the redskins broke and ran not stopping to gather together their be longings nor pausing for even a second glance at the weird strangers who invaded their domain arthur took two or three deep breaths of the the runaway skyscraper fresh air and found himself even then comparing its quality with that of the city estelle stared about her with unbelieving eyes she turned and saw the great bulk of the office building behind her then faced this small clearing with a virgin forest on its farther side she found herself trembling from some undefined cause arthur glanced at her he saw the tremb ling and knew she would have a fit of nerves in a moment if something did not come up demanding instant attention wed better take a look at this village he said in an offhand voice we can probably find out how long ago it is from the weapons and so on he grasped her arm firmly and led her in the direction of the tents the other people left be hind displayed their emotions in different ways two or three of themâwomenâsat frankly down on the steps and indulged in tears of bewilderment fright and relief in a peculiar combination defying analysis two or three of the men swore in shaken voices meantime the elevators inside the building were rushing and clanging and the hall filled with a whitefaced mob desperately anxious to find out what had happened and why the people poured out of the door and stared abput blankly there was a peculiar expression of doubt on every one of their faces each one was asking himself if he were awake and having proved that by pinches openly administered the next query was whether they had gone mad arthur led estelle cautiously among the tents the village contained about a dozen wigwams most of them were made of strips of birchbark cleverly overlapping each other the seams cemented with gum all had hide flaps for doors and one or two were built almost entirely of hides sewed together with strips of sinew arthur made only a cursory examination of the village his principal motive in taking estelle there was to give her some mental occupation to ward off the reaction from the excitement of the cataclysm tery at all its a basket that was woven of reeds and then smeared with clay to make it fireresisting the people who made that didnt know about baking clay to make it say put when america was dis covered nearly all the tribes knew something about pottery he looked into one or two of the tents and found merely couches of hides with minor domestic uten sils scattered about he brought from one tent a bow and quivei of arrows the workmanship was good but very evidently the maker had no knowl edge of metal tools arthurs acquaintance with archeological subjects was very slight but he observed that the arrow heads were chipped and not rubbed smooth they were attached to the shafts with strips of gut or tendon arthur was still pursuing his investigation when a sob from estelle made him stop and look at her oh what are we going to do she asked tear fully what are we going to do where are we you mean when are we arthur corrected with a grim smile i dont know way back before the discovery of america though you can see in every thing in the village that there isnt a trace of euro pean civilization i suspect that we are several thou sand years back i cant tell of course but this pottery makes me think so see this bowl he pointed to a bowl of red clay lying on the ground before one of the wigwams if youll look youll see that it isnt really pot tery at all its a basket that was woven of reeds and then smeared with clay to make it fire resisting the people who made that didnt know about baking clay to make it stay put when america was dis covered nearly all the tribes knew something about pottery but what are we going to do estelle tearfully insisted were going to muddle along as well as we can answered arthur cheerfully until we can get back to where we started from maybe the people back in the twentieth century can send a relief party after us when the skyscraper vanished it must have left a hole of some sort and it may be possible for them to follow us down if thats so said estelle quickly why cant we climb up it without waiting for them to come after us arthur scratched his head he looked across the clearing at the skyscraper it seemed to rest very solidly on the ground he looked up the sky seemed normal to tell the truth he admitted there doesnt seem to be any hole i said that more to cheer you up than anything else estelle clenched her hands tightly and took a grip on herself just tell me the truth she said quietly i was rather foolish but tell me what you honestly think arthur eyed her keenly in that case he said reluctantly ill admit were in a pretty bad fix i dont know what has happened how it happened or anything about it im just going to keep on going until i see a way clear to get out of this mess there are two thou sand of us people more or less and among all of us we must be able to find a way out estelle had turned very pale were in no great danger from indians went on arthur thoughtfully or from anything else that i know ofâexcept one thing what is that asked estelle quickly arthur shook his head and led her back toward the skyscraper which was now thronged with the people from all the floors who had come down to the ground and were standing excitedly about the con course asking each other what had happened arthur led estelle to one of the corners wait for me here he ordered im going to talk to this crowd he pushed his way through until he could reach the confectionery and newsstand in the main hall way here he climbed up on the counter and shouted people listen to me im going to tell you whats happened in an instant there was dead silence he found himself the center of a sea of white faces every one contorted with fear and anxiety to begin with he said confidently theres nothing to be afraid of were going to get back to where we started from i dont know how yet but well do it dont get frightened now ill tell you whats happened he rapidly sketched out for them in words as simple as he could make them his theory that a flaw in the rock on which the foundations rested had developed and let the skyscraper sink not down ward but into the fourth dimension amazing stories im an engineer he finished what nature can do we can imitate nature let us into this hole well climb out in the mean time matters are serious we neednt be afraid of not getting back well do that what weve got to fight isâstarva tion planning for the foodsupply weve got to fight starvation and weve got to beat it arthur continued dogged ly im telling you this now because i want you to begin right at the beginning and pitch in to help we have very little food and a lot of us to eat it first i want some volunteers to help with rationing next i want every ounce of food in this place put under guard where it can be served to those who need it most who will help the swift succession of shocks had paralyzed the faculties of most of the people there but half a dozen moved forward among them was a single grayhaired man with an air of accustomed au thority arthur recognized him as the president of the bank on the ground floor i dont know who you are or if youre right in saying what has happened said the grayhaired man but i see somethings got to be done andâ well for the time being ill take your word for what that is later on well thrash this matter out arthur nodded he bent over and spoke in a low voice to the grayhaired man who moved away grayson walters terhune simpson and for sythe come here the grayhaired man called at a doorway a number of men began to press dazedly toward him arthur resumed his harangue you peopleâthose of you who arent too dazed to thinkâare remembering theres a restaurant in the building and no need to starve youre wtong there are nearly two thousand of us here that means six thousand meals a day weve got to have nearly ten tons of food a day and weve got to have it at once hunt someone suggested i saw indians some one else shouted can we trade with them we can hunt and we can trade with the indians arthur admitted but we need food by the tonâby the ton people the indians dont store up sup plies and besides theyre much too scattered to have a surplus for us but weve got to have food now how many of you know anything about hunt ing fishing trapping or any possible way of get ting food there were a few hands raisedâpitifully few arthur saw estelles hand up very well he said those of you who raised your hands then come with me up on the second floor and well talk it over the rest of you try to conquer your fright and dont go outside for a while weve got some things to attend to before it will be quite safe for you to venture out and keep away from the restaurant there are armed guards over that food before we pass it out indis criminately well see to it theres more for tomor row and the next day he stepped down from the counter and moved toward the stairway it was not worth while to use the elevator for the ride of only one floor estelle managed to join him and they mounted the steps together do you think well pull through all right she asked quietly weve got to arthur told her setting his chin firmly weve simply got to the grayhaired president of the bank was wait ing for them at the top of the stairs my name is van deventer he said shaking hands with arthur who gave his own name where shall our emergency council sit he asked the bank has a board room right over the safety vault i dare say we can accommodate everybody thereâeverybody in the council anyway arthur followed into the boardroom and the others trooped in after him im just assuming temporary leadership ar thur explained because its imperative some things be done at once later on we can talk about electing officials to direct our activities right now we need food how many of you can shoot about a quarter of the hands were raised es telles was among the number and how many are fishermen a few more went up what do the rest of you do there was a chorus of gardener i have a garden in my yard i grow peaches in new jer sey and three men confessed that they raised chickens as a hobby well want you gardeners in a little while dont go yet but the most important are huntsmen and fishermen have any of you weapons in your offices a number had revolvers but only one man had a shotgun and shells i was going on my vacation this afternoon straight from the office he explained and have all my vacation tackle good man arthur exclaimed youll go after the heavy game with a shotgun the sportsman asked aghast if you get close to them a shotgun will do as well as anything and we cant waste a shell on every bird or rabbit those shells of yours are precious you other fellows will have to turn fishermen for a while your pistols are no good for hunting the watchmen at the bank have riot guns said van deventer and there are one or two repeating rifles there i dont know about ammunition good i dont mean about the ammunition but about the guns well hope for the ammunition you fishermen get to work to improvise tackle out of anything you can get hold of will you do that a series of nods answered his question now for the gardeners you people will have to roam through the woods in company with the hun ters and locate anything in the way of edibles that grows do all of you know what wild plants look like i mean wild fruits and vegetables that are good to eat a few of them nodded but the majority looked dubious the consensus of opinion seemed to be that they would try arthur seemed a little dis couraged i guess youre the man to tell about the restaur ant van deventer said quietly and as this is the food commission or something of that sort the runaway skyscraper everybody here will be better for hearing it any way everybody will have to know it before night i took over the restaurant as you suggested and posted some of the men from the bank that i knew i could trust about the doors but there was hardly any use in doing it the restaurant stocks up in the afternoon as most of its business is in the morning and at noon it only carries a days stock of foodstuffs and theâ the cataclysm or whatever it was came at three oclock there is practically nothing in the place we couldnt make sandwiches for half the women that are caught with us let alone the men every body will go hungry tonight there will be no breakfast toiporrow nor anything to eat until we either make arrangements with the indians for some supplies or else get food for ourselves arthur leaned his jaw on his hand and considered a slow flush crept over his cheek he was getting his fighting blood up at school when he began to flush slowly his schoolmates had known the symptom and avoided his wrath now he was growing angry with mere circumstances but it would be none the less unfor tunate for those circumstances well he said at last deliberately weve got toâ whats that there was a great creaking and groaning sud denly a sort of vibration was felt under foot the floor began to take on a slight slant great heaven some one cried the buildings turning over and well be buried in the ruins the tilt of the floor became more pronounced an empty chair slid to one end of the room there was a crash arthur and estelle in conference arthur woke to find some one tugging at his shoulders trying to drag him from beneath the heavy table which had wedged itself across his feet and pinned him fast while a flying chair had struck him on the head oh come and help estelles voice was calling deliberately somebody come and help hes caught in here she was sobbing in a combination of panic and some unknown emotion help me please she gasped then her voice broke despondently but she never ceased to tug ineffectually at chamberlain trying to drag him out of the mass of wreckage arthur moved a little dazedly are you alive she called anxiously are you alive hurry oh hurry and wriggle out the buildings falling to pieces im all right arthur said weakly you get out before it all comes down i wont leave you she declared where are you caught are you badly hurt hurry please hurry arthur stirred but could not loosen his feet he halfrolled over and the table moved as if it had been precariously balanced and slid heavily to one side with estelle still tugging at him he ma naged to get to his feet on the slanting floor and started about him arthur continued to stare about no danger he said weakly just the floor of the one room gave way the aftermath of the rockflaw he made his way across the splintered flooring and piledup chairs were on top of the safedeposit vault he said thats why we didnt fall all the way to the floor below i wonder how were going to get down estelle followed him still frightened for fear of the building falling upon them some of the long floorboards stretched over the edge of the vault and rested on a tall bronze grating that protected the approach to the massive strongbox arthur tested them with his foot they seem to be pretty solid he said tenta tively his strength was coming back to him every mo ment he had been no more than stunned he walked out on the planking to the bronze grating and turned if you dont get dizzy you might come on he said we can swing down the grille here to the floor estelle followed gingerly and in a moment they were safely below the corridor was quite empty when the crash came estelle explained her voice shaking with the reaction from her fear of a moment ago every one thought the building was coming to pieces and ran out im afraid theyve all run away theyll be back in a little while arthur said quietly they went along the big marble corridor to the same western door out of which they had first gone to see the indian village as they emerged into the sunlight they met a few of the people who had already recovered from their panic and were re turning a crowd of respectable size gathered in a few moments all still pale and shaken but coming back to the building which was their refuge arthur leaned wearily against the cold stone it seemed to vibrate under his touch he turned quickly to estelle feel this he exclaimed she did so ive been wondering what that rumble was she said ive been hearing it ever since we landed here but didnt understand where it came from you hear a rumble arthur asked puzzled i cant hear anything it isnt as loud as it was but i hear it estelle insisted its very deep like the lowest possible bass note of an organ you couldnt hear the shrill whistle when we were coming here arthur exclaimed suddenly and you cant hear the squeak of a bat of course your ears are pitched lower than usual and you can hear sounds that are lower than i can hear listen carefully does it sound in the least like a liquid rushing through somewhere yyes said estelle hesitatingly somehow i dont quite understand how it gives me the im pression of a tidal flow or something of that sort arthur rushed indoors when estelle followed him she found him excitedly examining the marble floor about the base of the vault its cracked he said excitedly its cracked the vault rose all of an inch estelle looked and saw the cracks amazing stories what does that crack in the floor mean it means were going to get back where we belong arthur cried jubilantly it means im on the track of the whole trouble it means every things going to be all right he prowled about the vault exultantly noting exactly how the cracks in the flooring ran and seeing in each a corroboration of his theory ill have to make some inspections in the cellar he went on happily but im nearly sure im on the right track and can figure out a corrective how soon can we hope to start back asked estelle eagerly arthur hesitated then a great deal of the excite ment ebbed from his face leaving it rather worried and stern it may be a month or two months or a year he answered gravely i dont know if the first thing i try will work it wont be long if we have to experiment i darent guess how long we may be butâhis chin set firmlyâwere going to get back estelle looked at him speculatively her own expression grew a little worried too but in a month she said dubiously weâthere is hardly any hope of our finding food for two thou sand people for a month is there weve got to arthur declared we cant hope to get that much food from the indians it will be days before theyll dare to come back to their vil lage if they ever come it will be weeks before we can hope to have them earnestly at work to feed us and thats leaving aside the question of how well communicate with them and how well manage to trade with them frankly i think everybody is going to have to draw his belt tight before we get throughâif we do some of us will get along any way estelles eyes opened wide as the meaning of his last sentence penetrated her mind you meanâthat all of us wontâ im going to take care of you arthur said gravely but there are liable to be lively doings around here when people begin to realize theyre really in a tight fix for food im going to get van deventer to help me organize a police band to en force martial law we mustnt have any disorder thats certain and i dont trust a citybred man in a pinch unless i know him he stooped and picked up a revolver from the floor left there by one of the bank watchmen when he fled in the belief that the building was falling wild pigeons dash against the building arthur stood at the window of his office and stared out toward the west the sun was setting but upon what a scene where from this same windoiy arthur had seen the sun setting behind the jersey hills all edged with the angular roofs of factories with their chim neys emitting columns of smoke he now saw the same sun sinking redly behind a mass of luxuriant foliage and where he was accustomed to look upon the tops of high buildingsâeach entitled to the name of skyscraperâhe now saw miles and miles of waving green branches the wide hudson flowed on placidly all unruffled by the arrival of this strange monument upon its shoresâthe same hudson arthur knew as a busy thoroughfare of puffing steamers and chugging launches two or three small streams wandered unconcernedly across the land that arthur had known as the most closely builtup territory on earth and far far below himâarthur had to lean well out of his window to see itâstood a collection of tiny wigwams those small bark structures rep resented the original metropolis of new york his telephone rang van deventer was on the wire the exchange in the building was still work ing van deventer wanted arthur to come down to his private office there were still a great many things to be settledâthe arrangements for com mandeering offices for sleeping quarters for the women and numberless other details the men who seemed to have best kept their heads were gathering there to settle upon a course of action arthur glanced out of the window again before going to the elevator he saw a curiously compact dark cloud moving swiftly across the sky to the west miss woodward he said sharply what is that estelle came to the window and looked they are birds she told him birds flying in a group ive often seen them in the country though never as many as that how do you catch birds arthur asked her i know about shooting them and so on but we havent guns enough to count could we catch them in traps do you think i wouldnt be surprised said estelle thought fully but it would be hard to catch many come downstairs directed arthur you know as much as any of the men here and more than most apparently were going to make you show us how to catch things estelle smiled a trifle wanly arthur led the way to the elevator in the car he noticed that she looked distressed whats the matter he asked you arent really frightened are you no she answered shakily butâim rather upset about this thing its soâso terrible some how to be back here thousands of miles or years away from all ones friends and everybody pleaseâarthur smiled encouragingly at herâ please count me your friend wont you she nodded but blinked back some tears arthur would have tried to hearten her further but the elevator stopped at their floor they walked into the room where the meeting of cool heads was to take place no more than a dozen men were in there talking earnestly but dispiritedly when arthur and estelle entered van deventer came over to greet them weve got to do something he said in a low voice a wave of homesickness has swept over the whole place look at those men every one is thinking about his family and contrasting his cozy fire side with all that wilderness outside you dont seem to be worried arthur observed with a smile van deventers eyes twinkled im a bachelor he said cheerfully and i live in a hotel ive been longing for a chance to see some real excitement for thirty years business the runaway skyscraper has kept me from it up to now but im enjoying myself hugely estelle looked at the group of dispirited men well simply have to do something she said with a shaky smile i feel just as they do this morning i hated the thought of having to go back to my boardinghouse tonight but right now i feel as if the odor of cabbage in the hallway would seem like heaven arthur led the way to the flattopped desk in the middle of the room lets settle a few of the more important mat ters he said in a businesslike tone none of us has any authority to act for the rest of the people in the tower but so many of us are in a state of blue funk that those who are here must have charge for a while anybody any suggestions housing answered van deventer promptly i suggest that we draft a gang of men to haul all the upholstered settees and rugs that are to be found to one floor for the women to sleep on mm yes thats a good idea anybody a better plan no one spoke they all still looked much too homesick to take any great interest in anything but they began to listen more or less halfheartedly ive been thinking about coal said arthur theres undoubtedly a supply in the basement but i wonder if it wouldnt be well to cut the lights off most of the floors only lighting up the ones were using that might be a good idea later estelle said quietly but light is cheering somehow and every one feels so blue that i wouldnt do it tonight to morrow theyll begin to get up their resolution again and you can ask them to do things if were going to starve to death one of the other men said gloomily we might as well have plenty of light to do it by we arent going to starve to death retorted arthur sharply just before i came down i saw a great cloud of birds greater than i had ever seen before when we get at those birdsâ when echoed the gloomy one they were pigeons estelle explained they shouldnt be hard to snare or trap i usually have my dinner before now the gloomy one protested and im told i wont get any thing tonight the other men began to straighten their shoul ders the peevishness of one of their j number seemed to bring out their latent courage well weve got to stand it for the present one of them said almost philosophically what im most anxious about is getting back have we any chance arthur nodded emphatically i think so i have a sort of idea as to the cause of our sinking into the fourth dimension and when that is verified a corrective can be looked for and applied how long will that take cant say arthur replied frankly i dont know what tools what materials or what workmen we have and whats rather more to the point i dont even know what work will have to be done the pressing problem is food oh bother the food some one protested impa tiently i dont care about myself i can go hun gry tonight i want to get back to my family thats all that really matters a chorus of voices echoed wed better not bother about anything else unless we find we cant get back concentrate on getting back one man stated more explicitly look here said arthur incisively youve a family and so have a great many of the others in he tower but your family and everybody elses family has got to wait as an inside limit we can hope to begin to work on the problem of getting back when were sure theres nothing else going to happen i tell you quite honestly that i think i know what is the direct cause of this catastrophe and ill tell you even more honestly that i think im the only man among us who can put this tower back where it started from and ill tell you most honestly of all that any attempt to meddle at this present time with the forces that let us down here will result in a catastrophe considerably greater than the one that happened today well if youre sureâ some one began reluct antly i am so sure that im going to keep to myself the knowledge of what will start those forces to work again arthur said quietly i dont want any impatient meddling if we start them too soon god only knows what will happen organizing the food supply van deventer was eyeing arthur chamberlain keenly it isnt a question of your wanting pay in exchange for your services in putting us back is it he asked coolly arthur turned and faced him his face began to flush slowly van deventer put up one hand i beg your pardon i see we arent settling the things we came here for estelle interrupted she had noted the threat of friction and hastened to put in a diversion arthur relaxed i think that as a beginning he suggested wed better get sleeping arrangements completed we can get everybody together somewhere i dare say and then secure volunteers for the work right van deventer was anxious to make amends for his blunder of a moment before shall i send the bank watchmen to go on each floor in turn and ask everybody to come downstairs you might start them arthur said it will take a long time for every one to assemble van deventer spoke into the telephone on his desk in a moment he hung up the receiver theyre on their way he said arthur was frowning to himself and scribbling in a notebook of course he announced abstractedly the pressing problem is food weve quite a number of fishermen and a few hunters weve got to have a lot of food at once and everything considered i think wed better count on the fishermen at sun rise wed better have some people begin to dig bait and wake our anglers theyd better make their tackle tonight dont you think there was a general nod well announce that then the fishermen will go to the river under guard of the men we have amazing stories who can shoot i think what indians there are will be much too frightened to try to ambush any of us but wed better be on the safe side theyll keep together and fish at nearly the same spot with our hunters patroling the woods behind them taking potshots at game if they see any the fishermen should make more or less of a success i think the indians werent extensive fishers that i ever heard of and the river ought fairly to swarm with fish he closed his notebook how many weapons can we count on alto gether arthur asked van deventer in the bank about a dozen riotguns and half a dozen repeating rifles elsewhere i dont know forty or fifty men said they had revolvers though well give revolvers to the men who go with the fishermen the indians havent heard firearms and will run at the report even if they dare attack our men we can send out the gunarmed men as hunters some one suggested and send gardeners with them to look for vegetables and such things well have to take a sort of census really arthur suggested finding what every one can do and getting him to do it i never planned anything like this before van deventer remarked and i never thought i should but this is much more fun than running a bank arthur smiled lets go and have our meeting he said cheer fully but the meeting was a gloomy and despairing affair nearly every one had watched the sun set upon a strange wild landscape hardly an indivi dual among the whole two thousand of them had ever been out of sight of a house before in his or her life to look out at a vast untouched wilder ness where hitherto they had seen the most highly civilized city on the globe would have been startling and depressing enough in itself but to know that they were alone in a whole continent of savages and that there was not indeed in all the world a single community of people they could greet as brothers was terrifying few of them thought so far but there was actu allyâif arthurs estimate of several thousand years drop back through time was correctâthere was actually no other group of englishspeaking people in the world the english language was yet to be invented even rome the synonym for antiquity of culture might still be an obscure vil lage inhabited by a band of tatterdemalions under the leadership of an upstart romulus soft in body as these people were citybred and unaccustomed to face other than the most conven tionalized emergencies of life they were terrified hardly one of them had even gone without a meal in all his life to have the prospect of having to earn their food not by the manipulation of figures in a book or by expert juggling of profits and prices but by literal wrestling of that food from its source in the earth or stream was a really terrifying thing for them in addition every one of them was bound to the life of modern times by a hundred ties many of theni had families a thousand years away all had interests engrossing interests in modern new york one young man felt an anxiety that was really ludicrous because he had promised to take his sweet heart to the theater that night and if he did not come she would be very angry another was to have been married in a week some of the people were like van deventer and arthur so situated that they could view the episode as an adventure or like estelle who had no immediate fear because all her family was provided for without her help and lived far from new york so they would not learn of the catastrophe for some time many however felt instant and pressing fear for the families whose expenses ran always so close to their incomes that the disappearance of the breadwinner for a week would mean actual want or debt there are very many such families in new york the people therefore that gathered hopelessly at the call of van deventers watchmen were dazed and spiritless their excitement after arthurs first attempt to explain the situation to them had evaporated they were no longer keyed up to a high pitch by the startling thing that had happened to them nevertheless although only half comprehending what had actually occurred they began to realize what that occurrence meant no matter where they might go over the whole face of the globe they would always be aliens and strangers if they had been carried away to some unknown shore some wilderness far from their own land they might have thought of building ships to return to their homes they had seen new york vanish before their eyes however they had seen their civilization dis appear while they watched they were in a barbarous world there was not for example a single safety match on the whole earth except those in the runaway skyscraper a foodriot in the building arthur and van deventer in turn with the others of the cooler heads thundered at the apathetic people trying to waken them to the necessity for work they showered promises of in evitable return to modern times they pledged their honor to the belief that a way would ultimately be found by which they would all yet find themselves safely back home again the people however had seen new york disinte grate and arthurs explanation sounded like somo wild dream of an imaginative novelist not one person in all the gathering could actually realize that his home might yet be waiting for him though at the same time he felt a pathetic anxiety for the welfare of its inmates every one was in a turmoil of contradictory be liefs on the one hand they knew that all of new york could not be actually destroyed and replaced by a splendid forest in the space of a few hours so theaccident or catastrophe must have occurred to those in the tower and on the other hand they had seen all of new york vanish by bits and fragments to be replaced by a smaller and dingier town had beheld that replaced in turn and at last had landed in the midst of this forest every one too began to feel an unusual and un comfortable sensation of hunger it was a mild discomfort as yet but few of them had experienced it before without an immediate prospect of assuag ing the craving and the knowledge that there was the runaway skyscraper no food to be had somehow increased the desire for it they were really in a pitiful state van deventer spoke encouragingly and then asked for volunteers for immediate work there was hardly any response every one seemed sunk in despondency arthur then began to talk straight from the shoulder and succeeded in rousing them a little but every one was still rather too frightened to realize that work could help at all in desperation the dozen or so men who had gath ered in van deventers office went about among the gathering and simply selected men at random ordering them to follow and begin work this began to awaken the crowd but they wakened to fear rather than resolution they were citybred and unaccustomd to face the unusual or the alarming arthur noted the new restlessness but attributed it to growing uneasiness rather than selfish panic he was rather pleased that they were outgrowing their apathy when the meeting had come to an end he felt satisfied that by morning the latent resolu tion among the people would have crystallized and they would be ready to work earnestly and intelli gently on whatever tasks they were directed to undertake he returned to the ground floor of the building feeling much more hopeful than before two thou sand people all earnestly working for one end are hard to down even when faced with such a task as confronted the inhabitants of the runaway sky scraper even if they were never able to return to modern times they would still be able to form a community that might do much to hasten the devel opment of civilization in other parts of the world his hope received a rude shock when he reached the great hallway on the lower floor there was a fruit and confectionery stand here and as arthur arrived at the spot he saw a surging mass of men about it the keeper of the stand looked fright ened but was selling off his stock as fast as he could make change arthur forced his way to the counter here he said sharply to the keeper of the stand stop selling this stuff its got to be held until we can dole it out where its needed iâi cant help myself the keeper said theyre takin it anyway get back there arthur cried to the crowd do you call this decent trying to get more than your share of this stuff youll get your portion to morrow it is going to be divided up go to hell some one panted you cn starve if you want to but im goin to look out fr myself the men were not really starving but had been put into a panic by the plain speeches of arthur and his helpers and were seizing what edibles they could lay hands upon in preparation for the hunger they had been warned to expect arthur pushed against the mob trying to thrust them away from the counter but his very effort intensified their panic there was a quick surge and a crash the glass front of the showcase broke in in a flash of rage arthur struck out viciously the crowd paid not the slightest attention to him however every man was too panicstricken and too intent on getting some of this food before it was all gone to bother with him arthur was simply crushed back by the bodies of the forty or fifty men in a moment he found him self alone amid the wreckage of the stand with the keeper wringing his hands over the remnants of his goods van deventer ran down the stairs whats the matter he demanded as he saw arthur nursing a bleeding hand cut on the broken glass of the showcase bolsheviki answered arthur with a grim smile we woke up some of the crowd too suc cessfully they got panicstricken and started to buy out this stuff here i tried to stop them and you see what happened wed better look to the restaurant though i doubt if theyll try anything else just now he followed van deventer up to the restaurant floor there were picked men before the door but just as arthur and the bank president appeared two or three whitefaced men went up to the guards and started lowvoiced conversations arthur reached the spot in time to forestall bribery arthur collared one man vandeventer another and in a moment the two were sent reeling down the hallway some fools have got panicstricken van de venter explained to the men before the doors in a casual voice though he was breathing heavily from the unaccustomed exertion theyve smashed up the fruitstand on the ground floor and stolen the contents its nothing but blue funk only if any of them start to gather around here hit them first and talk it over afterward youll do that we will the men said heartily shall we use our guns asked another hopefully van deventer grinned no he replied we havent any excuse for that yet but you might shoot at the ceiling if they get excited theyre just frightened he took arthurs arm and the two walked toward the stairway again chamberlain he said happily tell me why ive never had as much fun as this before arthur smiled a bit wearily im glad youre enjoying yourself he said im not im going outside and walk around i want to see if any cracks have appeared in the earth anywhere its dark and ill borrow a lantern down in the fireroom but i want to find out if there are any more developments in the condition of the building theorizing on the strange occurence despite his preoccupation with his errand which was to find if there were other signs of the continued activity of the strange forces that had lowered the tower through the fourth dimension into the dim and unrecorded years of aboriginal america arthur could not es cape the fascination of the sight that met his eyes a bright moon shone overhead and silvered the white sides of the tower while the brightlylighted windows of the offices within glittered like jewels set into the shining shaft from his position on the ground he looked into the dimness of the forest on all side black ob scurity had gathered beneath the dark masses of moonlit foliage the tiny birchbark tepees of the now deserted indian village glowed palely above amazing stories the stars looked calmly down at the accusing finger of the tower pointing upward as if in reproach at their indifference to the savagery that reigned ever the whole earth like a fairy tower of jewels the building rose alone among a wilderness of trees and streams it towered in a strange beauty moonlit to silver lighted from within to a mass of brilliant gems it stood serenely still arthur carrying his futile lantern about its base felt his own insignificance as never before he won dered what the indians must think he knew there must be hundreds of eyes fixed upon the strange sightâfixed in awestricken terror or superstitious reverence upon this unearthly visitor to their hunt ing grounds a tiny figure dwarfed by the building whose base he skirted arthur moved slowly about the vast pile the earth seemed not to have been affected by the vast weight of the tower arthur knew however that long concrete piles reached far down to bedrock it was these piles that had sunk into the fourth dimension carrying the building with them arthur had followed the plans with great interest when the metropolitan was constructed it was an engineering feat and in the engineering periodicals whose study was a part of arthurs business great space had been given to the building and the methods of its construction while examining the earth carefully he went over his theory of the cause for the catastrophe the whole structure must have sunk at the same time or it too would have disintegrated as the other buildings had appeared to disintegrate mentally arthur likened the submergence of the tower in the oceans of time to an elevator sinking past the different floors of an office building all about the building the other skyscrapers of new york had seemed to vanish in an elevator the floors one passes seem to rise upward carrying out the analogy to its logical end arthur reasoned that the building itself had no more cause to disintegrate as the buildings it passed seemed to disintegrate than the elevator in the office building would have cause to rise because its surroundings seemed to rise within the building he knew there were strange stirrings of emotions queer currents of panic were running about throwing the people to an fro as leaves are thrown about by a current of wind yet underneath all those undercurrents of fear was a rapidly growing resolution strengthened by an in creasing knowledge of the need to work men were busy even then shifting all possible comfortable furniture to a single story for the women in the building to occupy the men would sleep on the floor for the present beds of boughs could be improvised on the morrow at sunrise on the following morning many men would go to the streams to fish guarded by other men all would be frightened no doubt but there would be a grim resolution underneath the fear other men would wander about to hunt there was little likelihood of indians approaching for some days at least but when they did come arthur meant to avoid hostilities by all possible means the indians would be fearful of their strange visitors and it should not be difficult to convince them that friendliness was safest even if they displayed unfriendly desires the pressing problem was food there were two thousand people in the building softbodied and citybred they were unaccustomed to hardship and could not endure what more primitive people would hardly have noticed they must be fed but first they must be taught to feed themselves the fishermen would help but arthur could only hope that they would prove equal to the occasion he did not know what to expect from them from the hunters he expected but little the indians were wary hunters and game would be shy if not scarce the great cloud of birds he had seen at sunset was a hopeful sign arthur vaguely remembered stories of great flocks of woodpigeons which had been exterminated as the buffalo was exterminated as he considered the remembrance became more clear they had flown in huge flocks which nearly darkened the sky as late as the forties of the nineteenth century they had been an important article of food and had glutted the market at certain seasons of the year estelle had said the birds he had seen at sunset were pigeons perhaps this was one of the great flocks if it were really so the food problem would be much lessened provided a way could be found to secure them the ammunition in the tower was very limited and a shell could not be found for every bird that was needed nor even for every three or four great traps must be devised or birdlime might possibly be produced arthur made a mental note to ask estelle if she knew anything of birdlime a vague humming roar altering in pitch came to his ears he listened for some time before he identified it as the sound of the wind playing upon the irregular surfaces of the tower in the city the sound was drowned by the multitude of other noises but here arthur could hear itplainly he listened a moment and became surprised at the number of night noises he could hear in new york he had closed his ears to incidental sounds from sheer selfprotection somewhere he heard the ripple of a little spring as the idea of a spring came into his mind he remembered estelles description of the deeptoned roar she had heard he put his hand on the cold stone of the building there was still a vibrant quivering of the rock it was weaker than before but was still noticeable he drew back from the rock and looked up into the sky it seemed to blaze with stars far more stars than arthur had ever seen in the city and more than he had dreamed existed as he looked however a cloud seemed to film a portion of the heavens the stars still showed through it but they twinkled in a peculiar fashion that arthur could not understand he watched in growing perplexity the cloud moved very swiftly thin as it seemed to be it should have been silvery from the moonlight but the sky was noticeably darker where it moved it advanced toward the tower and seemed to obscure the upper portion a confused motion became visible among its parts wisps of it whirled away from the brilliantly lighted tower and then re turned swiftly toward it the runaway skyscraper arthur heard a faint tinkle then a musical scrap ing which became louder a faint scream sounded then another the tinkle developed into the sound made by breaking glass and the scraping sound became that of the broken fragments as they rubbed against the sides of the tower in their fall the scream came again it was the frightened cry of a woman a soft body struck the earth not ten feet from where arthur stood then another and another arthur and estelle in conference again arthur urged the elevator boy to greater speed they were speeding up the shaft as rapidly as possible but it was not fast enough when they at last reached the height at which the excitement seemed to be centered the car stopped with a jerk and arthur dashed down the hall half a dozen frightened stenographers stood there huddled together whats the matter arthur demanded men were running from the other floors to see what the trouble was theâthe windows broke andâand something flew in at us one of them gasped there was a crash inside the nearest office and the women screamed again arthur drew a revolver from his pocket and ad vanced to the door he quickly threw it open en tered and closed it behind him those left out in the hall waited tensely there was no sound the women began to look even more frightened the men shuffled their feet uneasily and looked uncomfortably at one another van deventer appeared on the scene puffing a little from his haste the door opened again and arthur came out he was carrying something in his hands he had put his revolver aside and looked somewhat foolish but very much delighted the food question is settled he said happily look he held out the object he carried it was a bird apparently a pigeon of some sort it seemed to have been stunned but as arthur held it out it stirred then struggled and in a moment was flap ping wildly in an attempt to escape its a woodpigeon said arthur they must fly after dark sometimes a big flock of them ran afoul of the tower and were dazed by the lights theyve broken a lot of windows i dare say but a great many of them ran into the stonework and were stunned i was outside the tower and when i came in they were dropping to the ground by hun dreds i didnt know what they were then but if we wait twenty minutes or so i think we can go out and gather up our supper and breakfast and several other meals all at once estelle had appeared and now reached out her hands for the bird ill take care of this one she said wouldnt it be a good idea to see if there arent some more stunned in the other offices in half an hour the electric stbves of the restau rant were going at their full capacity men cheer fully excited men now were bringing in pigeons by armfuls and other men were skinning them there was no time to pluck them though a great many of the women were busily engaged in that occupation as fast as the birds could be cooked they were served out to the impatient but much cheered cast aways and in a little while nearly every person in the place was walking casually about the halls with a roasted broiled or fried pigeon in his hands the ovens were roasting pigeons the fryingpans were flying them and the broilers were loaded down with the small but tender birds the unexpected solution of the most pressing question cheered every one amazingly many people were still frightened but less frightened than be fore worry for their families still oppressed a great many but the removal of the fear of imme diate hunger led them to believe that the other problems before them would be solved too and in as satisfactory a manner arthur had returned to his office with four broiled pigeons in a sheet of wrappingpaper as he somehow expected estelle was waiting there thought id bring lunch up he announced are you hungry starving estelle replied and laughed the whole catastrophe began to become an ad venture she bit eagerly into a bird arthur began as hungrily on another for some time neither spoke a word at last however arthur waved the leg of his second pigeon toward his desk look what weve got here he said estelle nodded the stunned pigeon arthur had first picked up was tied by one foot to a paper weight i thought we might keep him for a souvenir she suggested you seem pretty confident well get back all right arthur observed it was surely lucky those blessed birds came along theyve heartened up the people wonderfully oh i knew youd manage somehow said es telle confidently i manage arthur repeated smiling what have i done why youve done everything affirmed estelle stoutly youve told the people what to do from the very first and youre going to get us back arthur grinned then suddenly his face grew a little more serious i wish i were as sure as you are he said i think well be all right though sooner or later im sure of it estelle declared with conviction why youâ why i asked arthur again he bent for ward in his chair and fixed his eyes on estelles she looked up met his gaze and stammered youâyou do things she finished lamely im tempted to do something now arthur said look here miss woodward youve been foi my em ploy for three or four months in all that time ive never had anything but the most impersonal comments from you why the sudden change the twinkle in his eyes robbed his words of any impertinence why i reallyâi really suppose i never noticed you before said estelle please notice me hereafter said arthur i have been noticing you ive been doing practically nothing else estelle flushed again she tried to meet arthurs amazing stories eyes and failed she bit desperately into her pigeon drumstick trying to think of something to say when we get back went on arthur meditative ly ill have nothing to doâno work or anything ill be broke and out of a job estelle shook her head emphatically arthur paid no attention estelle he said smiling would you like to be out of a job with me estelle turned crimson im not very successful arthur went on sober ly im afraid i wouldnt make a very good hus band im rather worthless and lazy you arent broke in estelle youreâ youreâ arthur reached over and took her by the shoulders what he demanded she would not look at him but she did not draw away he held her from him for a moment what am i he demanded again somehow he found himself kissing the tips of her ears her face was buried against his shoulder what am i he repeated sternly her voice was muffled by his coat youreâyoure dear she said there was an interlude of about a minute and a half then she pushed him away from her dont she said breathlessly please dont arent you going to marry me he demanded still crimson she nodded shyly he kissed her again please dont she protested she fondled the lapels of his coat quite content to have his arms about her why maynt i kiss you if youre going to marry me arthur demanded she looked up at him with an air of demure primness youâyouve been eating pigeon she told him in mock gravity andâand your mouth is greasy a geyser effects a happy return it was two weeks later estelle looked out over the now familiar wild landscape it was much the same when she looked far away but near by there were great changes a cleared trail led through the woods to the waterfront and a raft of logs extended out into the river for hundreds of feet both sides of the raft were lined with busy fishermenâmen and women too a little to the north of the base of the building a huge mound of earth smoked sullenly the coal in the cellar had given out and charcoal had been found to be the best substitute they could improvise the mound was where the charcoal was made it was heartbreaking work to keep the fires go ing with charcoal because it burned so rapidly in the powerful draft of the furnaces but the original fireroom gang had been recruited to several times its original number from among the towerites and the work was divided until it did not seem hard as estelle looked down two tiny figures sauntered across the clearing from the woods with a heavy animal slung between them one was using a gun as a walkingstick estelle saw the flash of the sun on its polished metal barrel there were a number of indians in the clearing watching with wideopen eyes the activities of the whites dozens of birchbark canoes dotted the hudson each with its load of fishermen in dustriously working for the white people it had been hard to overcome the fear in the indians and they still paid superstitious reverence to the whites but fair dealings coupled with a constant readiness to defend themselves had enabled arthur to in stitute a system of trading for food that had so far proved satisfactory the whites had found spare electriclight bulbs valuable currency in dealing with the redmen pic turewire too was highly prized there was not a picture left hanging in any of the offices metal paperknives bought huge quantities of provisions from the eager indian traders and the story was current in the tower that arthur had received eight canoeloads of corn and vegetables in exchange for a brokendown typewriter no one could guess what the savages wanted with the typewriter but they had carted it away triumphantly estelle smiled tenderly to herself as she remem bered how arthur had been the leading spirit in all the numberless enterprises in which the castaways had been forced to engage he would come to her in a spare ten minutes and tell her how every thing was going he seemed curiously boylike in those moments sometimes he would come straight from the fire roomâhe insisted on takingpart in all the more arduous dutiesâhaving hastily cleaned himself for her inspection snatch a hurried kiss and then go off laughing to help chop down trees for the long fishingraft he had told them how to make char coal had taken a leading part in establishing and maintaining friendly relations with the indians and was now down in the deepest subbasement work ing with a gang of volunteers to try to put the building back where it belonged estelle had said after the collapse of the flooring in the boardroom that she heard a sound like the rushing of waters arthur on examining the floor where the safedeposit vault stood found it had risen an inch on these facts he had built up his theory the building like all modern skyscrapers rested on concrete piles extending down to bedrock in the center of one of those piles there was a hollow tube originally intended to serve as an artesian well the flow had been insufficient and the well had been stopped up arthur of course as an engineer had studied the construction of the building with great care and happened to remember that this partly hollow pile was the one nearest the safedeposit vault the collapse of the boardroom floor had suggested that some change had happened in the building itself and that was found when he saw that the deposit vault had actually risen an inch he at once connected the rise in the flooring above the hollow pile with the pipe in the pile estelle had heard liquid sounds evidently water had been forced into the hollow artesian pipe under an unthinkable pressure when the catastrophe oc curred from the rumbling and the suddenness of the whole catastrophe a volcanic or seismic disturbance was evident the connection of volcanic or seismic action with a flow of water suggested a geyser or a hot spring of some sort probably a spring which the runaway skyscraper had broken through its normal confines some time before but whose pressure had been sufficient to prevent the accident until the failure of its flow when the flow ceased the building sank rapidly for the fact that this sinking was in the fourth directionâthe fourth dimensionâarthur had no explanation he simply knew that in some mysteri ous way an outlet for the pressure had developed in that fashion and that the tower had followed the spring in its fall through time the sole apparent change in the building had occurred above the one hollow concrete pile which seemed to indicate that if access were to be had to the mysterious and so far only assumed spring it must be through that pile while the vault re tained its abnormal elevation arthur believed that there was still water at an immense and incalculable pressure in the pipe he dared not attempt to tap the pipe until the pressure had abated at the end of a week he found the vault slowly settling back into place when its return to the normal was complete he dared begin boring a hole to reach the hollow tube in the concrete pile as he suspected he found water in the pileâ water whose sulfurous and mineral nature con firmed his belief that a geyser reaching deep into the bosom of the earth as well as far back in the realms of time was at the bottom of the extra ordinary jaunt of the tower geysers were still far from satisfactory things to explain there are many of their vagaries which we cannot understand at all we do know a few things which affect them and one thing is that soaping them will stimulate their flow in an extraordinary manner arthur proposed to soap this mysterious geyser when the renewal of its flow should lift the run away skyscraper back to the epoch from which the failure of the flow had caused it to fall he made his preparations with great care he confidently expected his plan to work and to see the skyscraper once more towering over midtown new york as was its wont but he did not allow the fishermen and hunters to relax their efforts on that account they labored as before while deep down in the subbasement of the collossal building arthur and his volunteers toiled mightily they had to bore through the concrete pile until they reached the hollow within it then when the evidence gained from the water in the pipe had confirmed his surmises they had to prepare their charge of soapy liquids by which the geyser was to be stirred to renewed activity great quantities of the soap used by the scrub women in scrubbing down the floors was boiled with water until a sirupy mess was evolved means had then to be provided by which this could be quickly introduced into the hollow pile the hole then closed and then braced to withstand a pressure unparal leled in hydraulic science arthur believed that from the hollow pile the soapy liquid would find its way to the geyser proper where it would take effect in stimulating the lessened flow to its former propor tions when that took place he believed that the building would return to normal modern times as swiftly and as surely as it had left them the telephone rang in his office and estelle answered it arthur was on the wire a signal was being hung out for all the castaways to return to the building from their several occupations they were about to soap the geyser did estelle want to come down and watch she did she stood in the main hallway as the excited and hopeful people trooped in when the last was inside the doors were firmly closed the few friendly indians outside stared perplexedly at the mysterious white strangers the whites laughing excitedly began to wave to the indians their leavetaking was premature estelle took her way down into the cellar arthur was awaiting her arrival van deventer stood near with the grinning grimy members of arthurs volunteer work gang the massive concrete pile stood in the center of the cellar a big steamboiler was coupled to a tiny pipe that led into the heart of the mass of concrete arthur was going to force the soapy liquid into the hollow pile by steam at a signal steam began to hiss in the boiler live steam from the fi reroom forced the soapy sirup out of the boiler through the small iron pipe into the hollow that led to the geyser far under ground six thousand gallons in all were forced into the opening in a space of three minutes arthurs grimy gang began to work with desper ate haste quickly they withdrew the iron pipe and inserted a long steel plug painfully beaten from a bar of solid metal then girding the colossal con crete pile ring after ring of metal was slipped on to hold the plug in place the last of the safeguards was hardly fastened firmly when estelle listened intently i hear a rumbling she said quietly arthur reached forward and put his hand on the mass of concrete it is quivering he reported as quietly i think well be on our way in a very little while the group broke for the stairs to watch the panorama as the runaway skyscraper made its way back through the thousands of years to the times that had built it for a monument to modern commerce arthur and estelle went high up in the tower from the window of arthurs office they looked eagerly and felt the slight quiver as the tower got under way estelle looked up at the sun and saw it mend its pace toward the west night fell the evening sounds became high pitched and shrill then seemed to cease altogether in a very little while there was light again and the sun was speeding across the sky it sank hastily and returned almost immediately via the east its pace became a breakneck rush down behind the hills and up in the east down in the west and up in the east down and upâ the flickering began the race beck toward modern time had started arthur and estelle stood at the window and looked out as the sun rushed more and more rapid ly across the sky until it became but a streak of light shifting first to the right and then to the left as the seasons passed in their turn with arthurs arms about her shoulders estelle stared out across the unbelievable landscape while the nights and days the winters and summers and the storms and calms of a thousand years swept past them into the irrevocable aeons presently arthur drew her to him and kissed her while he kissed her so swiftly did the days and continued on page an experiment in gyrohats by ellis parker butler author of pigs is pigs etc i was able to place tho end of one toe on the point of one picket and thus balanced wave the other leg in the air when walsing ham pulled my hand i inclined gently toward him until i was at right angles to the picket fence with my foot still on top of the picket and when he released my hand i slowly swung upright again an experiment in gyrohats the idea of a gyrohat did not come to me all at once as some great ideas come to inventors in fact i may say that but for a most unpleasant circumstance i might never have thought of gyro hats at all although i had for many years been considering the possibility of utilizing the waste space in the top of silk hats in some way or other as a practical hat dealer and lover of my kind it had always seemed to me a great economical waste to have a large vacant space inside the upper portion of top hats or high hats or stovepipe hats as they are variously called when a shoe is on it is full of foot and when a glove is on it is full of hand but a top hat is not and never can be full of head until such a day as heads assume a cylindrical shape perfectly flat on top and no sensible man ever expects that day to come i had therefore spent much of my leisure in devising methods by which the vacant space above the head in high hats might be turned to advantage and my patents ranged all the way from a small filing cabinet that just occupied the waste space to an extensible hat rack on the accordion plan that could be pushed compactly into the top of the hat when the hat was worn but could be ex tended into a hat and coat rack when the hat was not in use this device should have been very popular but i may say that the public received the idea coldly my attention had been for some time drawn away from this philanthropic work by certain symptoms of uneasiness i noticed in my daughter anne and my wife and i decided after careful consideration that anne must be in love and that her love must be unhappy otherwise we could not account for the strange excitability of our usually imperturbable daughter as a practical hat dealer my time has been almost exclusively devoted to hats and as a good wife my companions attention has been almost exclusively devoted t o her husband while anne was usually so calm and selfcontained that she did not take my attention from my hat business at all but when such a daughter suddenly devel ops signs of weeping and sighs and general nervous ness any father no mat ter how devoted to the hat trade must pay attention one of the primary necessities of a dealer in good hats is calm an ordinary hat dealer may not need calm he may buy his hats as another dealer buys flour in the bulk and then trust to advertise ments to sell them but i am not that kind of hat dealer hat dealing is an art with me and great art requires calm and peace in order that it may reach its highest development when i buy hats i do not think of dozens and dollars no indeed i think of noses and ears to be able to buy of a manufacturer a hat that will make the pug nose and big ears of a man i have never seen seem normal that mechanical marvel the gyroscope is being used successfully today to keep big ocean liners from roll ing it is being used for the same purpose in submarines and for many other stabilization purposes so ellis parker butler of pigs is pigs fame in this story seises upon this almost mechanical miracleâand makes it the feature of his story charged with his characteristic humor the story goes along deliberately from point co point ludicrous in its ctbsurdity but having the aspect of a true tale nevertheless the contrast be tween the sober man who cannot help staggering and reeling as he progresses and the thoroughly drunken man who must walk rigorously straight is admirably shown and contributes not a little tcnvard making the story both humorous and interesting and beautiful when that man enters my store and buys a hat requires calm and no hatter can have calm in his soul while his daughter is lovesick and unhappy i demand happiness about and around me and i must have it so i told my wife and i told her so most emphatically and i informed her that anne must become happy at once perhaps you can imagine the shock i received when my wife after making the necessary inquiries of anne informed me that anne was indeed in love and in love with walsingham gribbs it was not because walsingham gribbs had never bought a hat of me that i was shocked bad hats are a common failing of mankind and a man will try a hundred hatters before he at last comes to me the trouble was deeper than this the thing that staggered me was that walsingham was a staggerer this is a joke but i hold that a hatter has as good a right to make a joke as the next man that my daughter had fallen in love with wals ingham gribbs without having met him was alto gether to her credit she first saw him when she was crossing the ocean for she travels where she pleases my hat business affording her such pleas ures and that he reeled and staggered about the boat did not impress her for it was a stormy trip and everyone aboard reeled and staggered even the captain of the boat but when she returned to new york and saw walsingham gribbs on the firm pave ment of fifth avenue she had a harsh cruel dis illusionment walsingham gribbs reeled and stag gered on terra firma i am glad to say that my daughter saw at once the impossibility of the daughter of a highclass hatter mating with a permanent staggerer as sho realized this she became sad and nervous thus creating an atmosphere in my home that was quite opposed to the best high class hatting irritating my faculties and threaten ing to reduce me to the state of a mere commer cial hatter further investigation only made the matter seem worse for quiet inquiries brought out the informa tion that walsingham gribbs had been stagger ing since the year his father died he had been constantly in a reeling staggering state since his twentieth birthday for such a man reform is indeed impossible and what made the case more sad was that all proof seemed to point to the fact that walsingham gribbs was not a bounder nor a rounder two classes of men who occasionally acquire a stagger and a reel in company with hearty boon companions in short no one had ever seen walsingham gribbs take a drink in public and i was forced to conclude that he was of that horrid type that drinks aloneâ alone but with unabated zeal as that great poet sir walter scott has remarked in one of his charm ing poems amazing stories if all these investigations of mine were conducted without the knowledge of walsingham gribbs you must admit i did only what was right in keeping them secret from him for since he had never met my daughter he might have considered the efforts of a perfect stranger to peer into his life as being uncalled for my wife did what she could to com fort anne but anne sadly replied that she could never marry a man that staggered and reeled day in and day out thus day by day she became more sad and i became so upset that i actually sold a narrowbrimmed derby hat to a man with wide outstanding ears of course this could not go on no highgrade hat business could support it and i was standing in my shop door looking gloomily out when i chanced to see walsingham gribbs stagger by i had seen him many times but now for the first time i noticed what i should have noticed beforeâthat he invar iably wore a high hat or topper as our cus tomers like to call them i observed that the shape was awful and that the hat badly needed the iron and then my mind recurred to the old problem of the vacant space in the top of top hats but i found i could not con centrate whenever i tried to think of top hats i thought of walsingham gribbs in one of them stag gering and reeling up the street and gradually the thought came that it would be an excellent idea should i be able so to use the space in the top of walsinghams hat that he would no longer stagger and reel and then the thought of the gyroscope hat came to me i admit that at first i put the idea aside as futile but it came back again and again and at length it seemed to force me into enthusiasm i dropped everything and went to work on the gyrohat the gyroscope is as everyone knows a top and i might have called the hat i invented a top hat except that any tall cylindrical silk or beaver hat is called a top hat so i was forced to adopt the name of gyrohat a gyroscope is not an ordinary top it is like a heavy fly wheel revolving on an axle and if it is spun the speed of the revolutions maintains the axle in the perpendicular a huge gyroscope is used to steady the channel steamers which would other wise stagger and reel a gyroscope has been adopted to the monorail cars and so long as the gyroscope gyrates the monorail car cannot stagger or reel if a proper gyroscope was fastened on the end of a knitting needle and gyrated at full speed that knitting needle could be stood on end and it would not fall over therefore if a gyroscope was placed in the top of a top hat and the top hat firmly fastened to the head of a man and the gyroscope set going that man would remain perpendicular in spite of any thing he could not stagger he could not reel he could walk a line as straight as a crack when i had completed this gyrohat i showed it to my wife and briefly explained what it was and what i meant to do with it the small but wonder fully powerful motor and the gyroscope itself were all concealed inside the hat and i explained to my wife that walsingham gribbs need but fasten the hat firmly on his head and he would never stagger again at first my wife seemed doubtful but as i continued she became more and more enthusiastic the only thing she disliked was the method of fastening the hat to the head for as it was quite necessary that the hat be very firmly fixed to the head i had sewed ear tabs to the hat and these i tied firmly under my chin my wife said she feared it would require some time to persuade the public to take to silk hats with ear tabs and that the sight of a man in a silk hat with ear tabs would be a sign that he was a staggerer she wanted an other method of holding the hat on the head vacuum suction i said for i am quick to catch an idea a man has to be in the hat business but i added where would you get the vacuum a man cannot be expected to carry a can of vacuum or whatever he would need to carry a vacuum in around with him especially the kind of man that would need the gyrohat my dear said ray wife after a minute of thought during which we both studied the gyro hat i have it let the hat make its own vacuum if the hat is lined with airtight aluminum and has a rubber sweatband and an expulsion valve the gyroscope motor could pump the air out it self it could create its own vacuum of course it could i exclaimed i could rig it up so that putting the hat on the head would start the gyroscope and the gyroscope would pump a vacuum all any staggerer would need to do would be to put on his hat and the hat would do the rest it would stay on his head and it would keep him evenly on his keel of course i would not use a nautical term like keel in my hat shop but at home i allow myself some liberties of that sort i set to work at once to perfect the gyrohat on the plan suggested by my wife and in a few days i was able to say it was a success by this i mean it was a success insofar as the eye could judge by looking at the hat and all that was needed was a practical trial as the hat had been invented for walsingham gribbs more than for any other man i proposed to my wife that walsinghamâwe had spoken of him so often that we now mentioned him as walsingham âshould be the man to try it out but my wife is better posted in social matters than i and she said it would not do at all to attempt such a thing in the first place none of us knew walsingham and in all other places it would be insulting to suggest such a thing to him and might ruin annes chances i then assured my wife that i did not mean to allow any ordinary intoxicated man to ex periment with the only gyrohat i possessed and possibly wreck and ruin it we had too much at stake for that so after considerable discussion my wife and i decided upon what was after all the only rational courseâi should try out the gyro hat myself i admit here that i am not much of a drinker although not so by principle i am by action a tee totaller i consider that the highest good of a hat shop demands it as a matter of fact i had never up to this time tasted intoxicating liquor but it was evident to my wife and me that the time had ar rived when the hat business demanded this sacri fice on my part evidently if a gyrohat is meant to keep a staggerer and reeler steady on his keel an experiment in gyrohats the only test of the gyrohat must be on the head of a man who without the hat could not help stag gering and reelingâa thoroughly intoxicated man we did not of course admit anne into our little conspiracy and we chose a restaurant where we were sure intoxicants would be sold we proceeded to the restaurant about the dinner hour and after studying the waiters carefully i selected one that seemed likely to know something about intoxicants and we seated ourselves at his table i placed the gyrohat carefully across my knees first setting the starter and beckoned the waiter to us my good fellow i said when he had approached with his pencil and order card in hand i desire to become intoxicated this evening and i presume you know something about intoxicating liquors yes sir said the waiter tell him henry said my wife that we also wish something to eat but that as our principal object in coming here is to secure intoxicants we wish him to be particular about them you have heard what the lady said i told the waiter and you will be guided accordingly yes sir said the waiter politely does the lady desire to become intoxicated also heavens no exclaimed my wife certainly not said the waiter now i said to the waiter you doubtless have different kinds of intoxicating liquors hereâsome strong and some not so strongâand i do not desire to drink a great quantity to obtain the result i desire what would you recommend to give the re quired reeling and staggering condition as quickly as possible well sir he said if you will let me advise i would advise a certain brandy we have of that brandy sir a little goes a long way i have seen it work sir and i can assure you that a small quantity of that will make you stagger and reel to your hearts content very well i said you may bring me some i suppose a quart would be enough i beg your pardon sir he said but have you ever tried the brandy of which i speak i have not i said then sir said the waiter apologetically un less you are a very heavy drinker i would not advise a quart of that brandy a quart of that brandy sir would if i may so speak lay you out flat you would not reel and stagger sir you would be para lyzed stiff sir dead to the world i thanked the waiter warmly you observe i said that i am not used to this sort of thing and i appreciate the interest you are taking i am inclined to leave the matter en tirely in your hands i may not know when i have had exactly the right quantity but you with your larger experience will know sir yes sir and i think the lady will know sir said the waiter i found the brandy most unpleasant to the taste but certain symptoms assured me that the waiter had not belied its effectiveness long before the waiter was satisfied that i would stagger and reel my long lost vocal prowess returned and i caroled gaily some songs that had been favorites of my youth many of these were affectionate songs and when i sang them i had a great longing to hold my wifes hand and did so but as she would not let me kiss her i felt the need of kissing the waiter here again i was repulsed but it did not make me angry i merely slid down into my chair and waved my hand at him coquettishly if you please sir said the waiter when i had finished another burst of song i think you are pretty ripe now if you would just get up and walk a few steps i can tell more definitely my wife smiled at me reassuringly and nodded to me that what the waiter proposed had her full sanction but even so i was filled with a fear that we were about to be parted forever and for a few minutes i clung to her neck weeping bitter tears i then tore myself away and i did indeed stagger and reel i believe i knocked over two small tables and ended by seating myself in the lap of a young man who was dining alone he accepted my apology before i had spoken more than fifteen minutes of it and then he aided the waiter in steering me back to my table whatever may have been my past opinion of wals ingham gribbsâfor it was heâi loved him most dearly at that moment and in my incoherent man ner i tried to tell him so i think he understood at any rate he spoke to my wife like a true gentle man madame he said i can sincerely sympathize with your husband and if you will allow me i will gladly help you assist him to a cab i beg you not to be frightened by his condition i myself am sub ject to the same trouble and although he may seem drunk seem drunk exclaimed my wife seem drunk i beg you to know that my husband is as drunk as a man can become without being senseless either that or we have been defrauded by this waiter walsingham gribbs looked at my wife and then smiled very well he said if what you wanted was to have him drunk ill admit that he is about the drunkest man i have ever seen i only spoke as i did in order that i might spare your feelings for most wives object to seeing their husbands stagger and reel i myself stagger and reel continually and i have never tasted intoxicating liquor in my life but i can share the feelings of one who staggers and reels or who has a relative that staggers and reels at this my wife said are you not walsingham gribbs if you are i am delighted to meet you even in this unconventional manner for what brought us here will interest you she then told him of the gyrohat i had invented and explained just why i had come to this place and had swallowed the strong brandy i took no part in this conversation but walsingham gladly agreed to accompany us and he put my gyrohat on my head the result was indeed marvelous instantly the vacuum pump began to work and the gyroscope to revolve my head which had been lying one side straightened up the rubber sweat band grip ped my head tightly with a slight pulling sensation without assistance i arose from my chair and stood erect my brain was still confused but i walked as straight as a string direct to the door of the restaurant and stood holding it open while my wife amazing stories passed out with the ever staggering walsingham the gyroscope was revolving at the rate of three thousand revolutions a minute and the slight hum ming was hardly noticeable i did not stagger and i did not reel when i reached gramercy park i was full of glee i had been walking on the edge of the curb but i now desired to climb atop of the iron fence that surrounds the park and walk on the points of the pickets my wife and walsingham tried to dissuade me but i climbed to the top of the fence i not only walked on the points of the pickets easily but i was able to place the end of one toe on the point of one picket and thus balanced wave the other leg in the air my wife and walsingham gribbs coaxed me to come down to the level of the walk but as i saw no reason to do so i flatly refused and at last wals ingham reached up and took me by the hand and pulled me ordinarily a man that had imbibed a quantity of brandy would have fallen to the street if pulled by one hand while standing on the top of a row of pickets but i did not when walsingham pulled my hand i inclined gently toward him until i was at right angles to the picket fence with my foot still on top of the picket and when he released my hand i slowly swung upright again without any effort whatever on my part i got down off that fence when i was ready and not before there could be no doubt whatever that i was far more intoxicated than walsingham gribbs and all the way home i gave vent to tremendous bursts of laughter over the idea that while walsingham thought he was seeing me safely home i walked as straight and true as a general and he staggered and reeled exceptwhen he clung closely to my arm many persons stopped and looked at us and i cannot wonder at it for walsingham is a young man of most dignified countenance and it must have seemed strange to see a young man of such sober mien reeling drunkenly while a dignified and steadily walking hatter laughed and shouted drunk enly it was as if the two of us had been able to afford but one spree and had divided it in that way he taking the stagger and i taking the boisterous ness my wife was much touched by the kind atten tions of walsingham and when we reached home she invited him in and while i found a little harm less amusement in walking up the stairbanisters and sliding down them standing on my feet which i was enabled to do because of the steadying effect of the gyrohat she took walsingham into the parlor and introduced him to anne formally my poor daughter was quite overcome with em barrassment and pleasure but when walsingham was sitting he showed no evidence of his stagger and reel whatever and they managed to become quite well acquainted while my wife was assisting me to bed unfortunately i had neglected to arrange any method for letting the vacuum out of the gyrohat and although my wife tugged and pulled at the hat the suction held it fast to my head and it refused to come off unless my scalp came with it my wife decided that i must sleep in the hat since i was in no condition of mind to do anything about it myself i was dying for sleep and my wife tumbled me into bed and pulled the sheet over mo and that same instant i fell into a heavy slumber but the moment my wife released her grasp on me i began arising to my feet irresistibly drawn to the perpendicular by the action of the gyrohat i continued to arise until i was standing upright i can only liken the manner in which i arose to the way a man might raise a stiff arm slowly until it pointed straight upward my wife immediately pushed me down onto the pillow again but it was unavailing again the gyrohat drew me to a standing position and my wife was forced to let me continue my nights rest in that position the next morning i did not feel very well but i never saw my wife in better spirits she told me she was sure walsingham had taken a great fancy to anne for he had asked permission to call again that evening and my wife said that in her opinion it would be well to take up the matter of the mar riage with walsingham at once before it went any further if he meant business he would be glad to wear the hat and be rid of his stagger and reel and if he meant nothing it would be a good thing to know it and the sooner we were rid of him the better i agreed with her fully but i spent the day perfecting the vacuum outlet on the hat i must admit that walsingham seemed somewhat surprised when i made the suggestion to him that evening for a few minutes he did not seem to know what to say perhaps it was a little overcom ing to have the parents of anne suggest the idea of a marriage in this offhand manner and at the same time propose the wearing of a gyrohat but wals ingham was a gentleman and when he glanced up after his first surprise and saw anne gazing at him appealingly with her hands clasped i could see that love had won but instead of acquiescing immediately walsingham gribbs took one of annes hands in his and after patting it spoke directly to me sir he said i cannot but appreciate the deli cate manner in which you have handled this matter but if i am only too glad to find that there is a hat that will correct my unfortunate staggering and reeling and if i am to accept your offer of that hat i feel it due to myself to assure you that liquor has nothing whatever to do with my staggering and reeling i am the victim of an unfortunate ex perience of my youthful days my father was a man of many ideas and always trying to make the world better he had a neighbor that had a mule it was a mousecolored mule and very stubborn and it used to wring my fathers heart to see the neighbor belabor that mule with a heavy whip trying to make the mule proceed in a direction in which it did not wish to go the mule was quite willing to go toward the barn where the feed was kept but it often refused to goin the opposite direction although it would go well enough if it once started my father therefore conceived the idea of what he called the gribbs mule reverser this was a circular platform large enough to hold a mule and his loaded wagon and beneath the platform was a motor capable of revolving the platform all that was necessary was to place the mule and the wagon on the platform and start the mule in the direction an experiment in gyrohats of home and then suddenly turn the platform in the direction the mule was desired to go and the mule would proceed unwittingly in that direction a very excellent idea i said except that it would not work in the least said walsingham in the first place it was necessary to dig a pit five feet square beneath the revolving platform to contain the motor and this was not al ways convenient in the second place the platform and motor would hardly ever happen to be where the mule balked and it would have been a great deal easier to load the mule on a wagon than to load the platform and motor on three wagons and in the third place if the mule would not start homeward neither would it start towards the platform of the mule reverser so after my father had tried the platform in our back yard with a mule on it and the revolutions had thrown the mule up against the side of the barn breaking both the mule and the bam he de cided that other things were better to invent and abandoned the platform i and the lads of the neighborhood found this a good place to play and one day i was standing exactly in the center of the platform when one of the boys happened to start the motor i had sense enough to remain exactly in the center of the platform or i would have been thrown off and possibly killed for the platform was revolving at the rate of eightthousand revolutions a minute the motor had power to re volve the platform slowly when loaded with a mule and loaded wagon so it was capable of immense speed with only a small boy on it when my companions saw what they had done continued walsingham they all ran away and for four hours i remained in the center of that platform being revolved at an enormous speed and when my father came home and stopped the plat form i staggered and reeled and fell in a heap at his feet that is how i acquired my unfortunate stagger and unpleasant reel and i have only told you this that you may have no unjust suspicions but why asked my wife who had been greatly interested by walsinghams story do you not re volve in the opposite direction and unwind your self as we used to say madame said walsingham i have every night for one hour before i go to bed i revolve but it requires an immense number of revolutions to overcome such a spin as i had in my youth he waited a moment and then said but i am now ready to try the gyrohat i looked out of the window and hesitated a thin rain was falling and was freezing as it fell and i hated to have a good silk gyrohat go out into such weather but as a leading hatter i felt that it would never do for me to seem small and picayun ish in regard to hats i remembered that a really good silk hat would not be ruined by a few drops of water and i saw that if anything could convince anne and walsingham that the gyrohat held their happiness it would be a trial on such slippery walks as the evening had provided so i brought down the hat and pressed it on wals inghams head instantly the vacuum creator be gan to work and the hat clung fast to his head he arose to his feet and walked across the parlor in a perfectly steady manner and out into the hall i held open the front door and he stepped out walsingham crossed the porch with as steady a tread as ever any man crossed the porch of a high class hatter but when he reached the top step his foot struck the ice and he slipped he did not stagger nor reel if he fell he fell steadily i can best liken his fall to the action of a limber reed when the wind strikes it he inclined slowly with his feet still on the top step and continued to in cline until his head touched the walk below with considerable violence then his feet slipped down the edges of the steps until they rested on the walk i never saw a more graceful fall and i was about to congratulate walsingham when he began to in cline toward the perpendicular again in the same slow manner but this was not the reason i held my words ehe reason was that the gyrohat and walsingham were behaving in a most unaccountable manner walsingham was revolving i discovered later that the fall had jammed the gyroscope on the pivot so that the gyroscope could not revolve without revolving the whole hat and as the hat was firmly suctioned to walsingham the hat could not revolve without revolving walsing ham for an instant walsingham revolved away from us down the walk and anne gave a great cry but almost at that moment walsingham regained the upright and began to revolve rapidly the icy walk offered no purchase for his feet and this was indeed lucky for if it had his head would have continued to revolve none the less and the effect would have been fatal i estimated that walsingham was revolving at a rate of perhaps fifteen hundred revolutions a minute and it was some minutes before my wife was able so far to recover from the shock of seeing her prospective soninlaw whirl thus as to ask me to stop him my first impulse was to do so but my long training as a hatter had made me a careful thoughtful man and i gently pushed my wife back my dear i said let us pause and consider this case here we have walsingham revolving rapidly he is revolving in one of the only two directions in which he can revolveâthe direction in which he revolved on the mule reverser or the opposite di rection if it is the opposite direction all is well for he will be unwound in a few hours if his neck is not wrung in the meantime if it is in the same direction it is no use to stop him now for by this time he will be in such a condition of reeling and staggering that we would not have him as a son inlaw on any terms i propose therefore to let him spin here for a few hours when he will have had a full recovery or be permanently too dizzy for any use my wife and anne too saw the wisdom of this course and as it was very miserable weather out side we all withdrew to my parlor from the window of which we could watch walsingham revolve oc casionally when he seemed about to revolve off the walk i went out and pushed him on again i figured that by six oclock in the morning he would be sufficiently revolvedâprovided he was re volving in the right directionâand at midnight i sent my wife and anne to bed i fear anne slept but little that night for she must have had a lovers natural anxiety as to how all was to turn out continued on page the malignant entity by otis adelbert kline the nucleus cried the doctor excitedly shifting the flask pour it on the nucleus the thing upreared itself and

he has become a convert to spiritism i replied with all due respect to sir oliver said the doctor i should say that he has rather singled out such facts as suited his purpose and assembled them as evidence to support the spiritistic theory it may seem paradoxical to add that i believe he has always been thoroughly conscientious in his inves tigation and sincere in his deductions im afraid i do

no doubt chief mcgraws communication is of a confidential natureâ i began with the purpose of taking leave of my host nothing secret about it so far as dr dorp and his friends are concerned interrupted the chief it may be that if you are a psychologist you can offer some solution of the mystery of course i dont exactly know whether its a case for a psy chologist or not damned curious thing and ghast ly too stay and listen if you are interested said the doctor if it has any smattering of psychology or the occult you know my failing i responded cant say as to that said the chief its queer enough thoughand horrible you gentlemen have heard of professor townsend i presume you mean albert townsend the chemist and inventor asked the doctor assuredly who hasnt heard of him and his queer theories about creating life from inert matter what has he done now i dont know whether its something he did or something that was done to him but anyway hes dead murdered thats the point i want you to help me clear up i dont know his daughter phoned the office this morning and asked for me when i got on the wire i could hardly understand her she was so hysterical sobbed out something about her father being gone and a human skele ton lying on the floor of his laboratory i jumped in the car and took hirsch the fingerprint expert out there with me we found the frightened girl weep ing in the arms of a moth erly neighbor who in formed us that the labor atory was on the second floor the whitened skeleton of professor townsend fully clothed in garments that hung like rags on a scarecrow lay on the floor of the laboratory you made sure of course that it really was the skeleton of the professor beyond the least shadow of doubt in the first place it was clothed in the professors garments his watch with his name in the back was ticking in the vest pocket his monogrammed ring a present from his daughter circled a bony finger on the bones of his right forearm were the marks of a fracture that had healed and the skull was slightly indented above the right temple these marks re amazing stories suited from an automobile accident in which the professor was injured two years ago to make as surance doubly sure we called in his dentist who readily identified his own work on the teeth when was the professor last seen alive that is the feature that makes the affair so un canny he was alive and apparently normal mentally and physically at dinner last evening most amazing exclaimed dr dorp suppose we go outâ just what i was going to suggest replied the chief my car is waiting outside would you care to accompany us mr evans he would perish from curiosity if he couldnt see the thing through now said the doctor when i hesitated come along with us old man if two minds are better than one then surely three minds are superior to two we piled into the chiefs roomy roadster and were soon speeding toward the house of mystery two mysterious deaths presently the car stopped before a two story brick house its upper windows with shades half drawn appeared to stare down at us with a look of sly cunning as if endeavoring to conceal some fearful secret a short chunky individual smoothfaced and with a decidedly florid complexion met us at the door chief mcgraw introduced him as hirsch the finger print expert all alone hirsch asked the chief looking about as we entered the spacious living room might as well be replied hirsch miss town send is in her room with a neighbor the cookand housemaid are out in the kitchen scared green coroner been here no he called me up about twenty minutes ago and said he had an inquest to attend to on the south side told me he didnt know how soon he could get here but it would be several hours at least how about the prints all the finger prints in the laboratory seem to have been made by the same person evidently the professor hum better phone headquarters right away and have them send rooney out he might come in handy to guard the death room in case the coroner is late all right sir ill call up right away now gentlemen said the chief turning to the doctor and me let us go upstairs we followed him up the thickly carpeted stairway and along a broad corridor at the end of which he opened a door i started involuntarily at sight of the grinning ghastly thing that lay on the floor not so dr dorp he knelt beside it and examined it minutely his keen gray eyes alert for every detail he even touched his fingers to the white forehead and prod ded the shadowy depths of the empty eye sockets at length he rose and washed his hands at the porcelain lavatory it seems incredible he said that this man could have been alive yesterday just what i was thinking responded the chief those bones could not have been drier or whiter if they had bleached in the sunlight for the last teii years the doctor now turned his attention to the con tents of the laboratory he examined the collection of retorts test tubes breakers jars dishes and other paraphernalia spread on a porcelaintopped table set against the wall and reaching half the length of the room the walls were shelved clear to the ceiling and every shelf was crowded to its ut most capacity with bottles jars and cans containing a multitude of chemicals to these he gave but scant attention in the center of the immaculate white tile floor stood an open glasslined vat from its height and diameter i estimated its capacity at about sixty gallons this vat was more than a third full of a colorless vistous liquid that gave off a queer musty odor what do you suppose that stuff is i asked dr dorp looks like a heavy albuminous or gelatinous so lution he said possibly it is some special com pound the professor employed in his experiments mediums of this nature are often used in the culti vation of colonies of bacteria and it is possible that he intended to use it as a carrier and food for the organisms it was his ambition to create synthet ically any idea what caused the death of the pro fessor asked the chief i have a theory replied dr dorp but it seems so illogical so wildly impossible soâer contrary to the teachings of science that i prefer to keep it to myself for the present at least a heavy tread sounded in the hallway and a moment later a blueuniformed officer entered hello rooney greeted chief mcgraw i want you to see that no one disturbs this room or its contents until the coroner arrives we are going downstairs now keep a weather eye on things and ill send a man to relieve you soon if either of these gentlemen wants to come in at any time you may admit him yes sir ill remember them we trooped down stairs two women were seat ed in the living room chief mcgraw presented us to the younger who proved to be the professors daughter dorothy townsend she wras a slender giri about twenty years of age with pale regular features and a wealth of goldbrown hair her large expressive eyes were red with recent weeping and her lips quivered slightly as she bowed to us in turn and introduced us to the stout middleaged neighbor mrs harms who had been endeavoring to comfort her hirsch and i are going to run down to head quarters for a couple of hours said the chief would you prefer to come with us or stay here and look around i think we had better look around a bit if you dont mind replied the doctor all right im going to send a man to relieve rooney at six will be along myself a little later if you discover anything new call me up when the two men were gone the doctor bowed before miss townsend may i have a few words with you in private he asked the malignant entity certainly she replied rising in fathers study if you wish they entered the study which was directly off the living room and closed the door they must have been gone about a half hour but it seemed like two hours to me as fidgeting inwardly i listened to mrs harms family history her account of the death of her beloved husband and minute descrip tions of six operations she had undergone each time to use her own expression standing at the entrance of deaths door she assured me also that she knew what it was to have death in the home the grim reaper had visited her family a score of times she averred and only three weeks before one of her roomers had been found dead in bed she prattled on with scarce a pause until the door of the study opened i was glad when she went upstairs with miss townsend and left dr dorp and me together come into the study he said i have learned some interesting things and it is possible that more awaits us in here professor townsends study was neither large nor pretentious it was obviously the retreat of a profound student as attested by the booklined walls many of the volumes of which were worn with much handling the furniture consisted of a large rolltop desk a smaller typewriter desk on which stood a hooded machine a filing cabinet two office chairs and three comfortable overstuffed chairs one beside the window the other two placed conveniently under wall lights for reading a thick pile of typewritten manuscripts lay on the rolltop desk the doctor divided them handing me half and settling himself comfortably in one of the overstuffed chairs with the other half miss townsend kindly brought these out of the files for me explained the doctor i think it possible that they may shed some light on the mys terious cause of the death of their author we can save time dividing the work i believe i can conduct a more intelligent search if you will give me some idea of what i am to look for i said quite so he agreed i had forgotten for the moment that you were not familiar with the details of my interview with miss townsend let me re view it briefly she finished school nearly a year ago and since that time has been acting as her fathers secretary typing his manuscripts and attending to much of his voluminous correspondence he had been working day and night in his effort to prove his theory that a living organism can be created from inorganic matter during their months of close association she found him extremely irritable until one morning about three weeks ago it appeared that his very nature had changed over night and she assumed that he had made some im portant discovery she remembers the exact date owing to the fact that mrs harms roomer was found dead in bed on the night of the supposed dis covery this roomer who was living under an alias was found to be a notorious character known as immune benny and is alleged to have committed numerous crimes among which were several re volting murders without ever having been con victed after that night the professors jubilant atti tude kept up until death he paid no attention to his correspondence or manuscripts and spent the greater part of his time in his laboratory presum ably experimenting with numerous live animals which he had delivered each day his first experi ments she stated were with mice rats and guinea pigs he next used cats rabbits and small dogs then larger dogs until on the day before his death he had two huge mastiffs brought to the house and took them into the laboratory none of the animals taken behind the door ever reappeared and she quite naturally assumed that they had been the subjects of vivisection my theory is that heâ the doctor was interrupted by a loud rap at the study door he rose and opened it revealing a sturdy uniformed policeman a frightened house maid peered around his huge bulk the man seemed greatly perturbed his voice shook as he askedâ wheres rooney hes on guard in the laboratory replied the doctor are you the man sent to relieve him im officer burke the maid here showed me to the laboratory but rooney aint there its a horrible place dont blame him for leavin yes that skeleton on the floor isnt exactly pretty that skeleton you mean them skeletons there was two of them and one was dressed in a cops uniform with an exclamation of surprise and horror the doctor threw down the manuscripts he was holding and rushed for the stairway i followed breath lessly a strange diary what we saw in that awful room of death confirmed our wildest fears a skeleton with the bones whitened like those of the professor lay on the floor facing the doorway one bony arm was stretched across the threshold as if its owner had been attempting to drag himself from the room when struck down a blue uniform bagged loosely over the bones and on the feet were the heavy hobnailed squaretoed shoes i had no ticed on rooneys feet some time before the doctor squinted at the star on the breast of the recumbent figure then he turned to officer burke who had come up behind us what was rooneys number he asked then this is rooneys uniform and it probably is his skeleton call up the chief and tell him whafc happened this is horribleâdiabolical your theory i said does this shed any light on it on the contrary he replied it makes the case more baffling than ever it seems incredible that such things can really happen i tell you evans there is some mysterious force at work hereâ something new and unheard of in the annals of scientific research it is my opinion that the late professor townsend chanced upon some force hitherto unknown to scientists and played with it amazing stories like a little child with fire until it suddenly de stroyed him the death of officer rooney is ample proof that this terrible force whatever it may be survived him now let us conjecture regarding the nature of this thing that has taken the lives of two human beings we know that the professors chief ambi tion was to create life from inert matter all of his experiments in the laboratory were made with this object in view all his printed works show plainly his firm belief that the thing could be accomplished some of them going so far as to point out the pro cesses by which he believed protoplasm the primi tive basic life substance might be analyzed as protoplasm is a compound of almost unlimited com plexity in its physical and chemical constitution our most skilled chemists have been unable to unravel its secrets in fact the further a chemist gets in his attempts at analysis the more baffling and com plex he finds it to be being a compound composed of complex substances which are in turn composed of others still more complex and so on ad infini tum its secrets are fully as inscrutable as those of the starry universe the professors first step therefore in this seemingly impossible undertaking would be to an alyze protoplasm assuming that he succeeded in reducing it to its basic elements his next prob lem would be to take similar elements and through a process even more complex than vjthe pievious one assemble and reassemble theni until they were capable of sustaining life let us suppose that he did these things let us assume that he has succeeded in creating proto plasm what next we will say that he has taken some primitive form of life for a pattern a mone ron perhaps the most simple type of animal con sisting of a single cell of protoplasm there still exists a difference between the moneron and the synthetically created cell chemically and physi cally they are the same but the moneron is alive what is life broadly defined as we recognize it on this earth it is a temporary union of mind and matter there may be and probably is another kind of life which is simply mind without matter but we of the material world know it not to us mind without matter or matter without mind aie equally dead the moneron has a mindâa soulâa something that makes it a living individual call it what you will the professors cell of manmade protoplasm has not can you conceive of any pos sible way in which he could having reached this stage create an individual mind or soul an essence of life that once united with his cell of protoplasm would form an entity it seems impossible i admitted so it seems he replied yet it is only on such an hypothesis that i can account for the mysterious deaths of the professor and officer rooney but i dont see how a moneron or a creature remotely resembling one could kill and completely devour a man in less than two hours i objected nor i agreed the doctor in fact i am of the opinion that if the professor did succeed in creating life the result was unlike any creature large or small now inhabiting the earthâa hideous monster perhaps with undreamed of powers and possibilitiesâan alien organism among billions of other organisms hating them all because it has nothing in common with themâa malignant entity governed solely by the primitive desire for food and growth with only hatred of and envy for the more fortunate natural creatures around it if the professor did succeed in creating or dis covering such a creature i said it is evidently in this house at this very moment unless it has the faculty of making itself invisible a thorough search should reveal its whereabouts for having consumed two men it must be a monster of mean proportions that is true replied the doctor however we have another hypothesis that is equally worthy of our consideration if we accept the premise that the professor created a living creature judging from his writings he spent a considerable portion of hsis time studying and experimenting in micro biology suppose he succeeded in creating a micro scopic organism and that organism had the power to reproduce its kind if it reproduced by fission that is by simply dividing itself after it had at tained a certain size the only check to its increase would be death or lack of food the more food it could obtain that much more rapidly would it and its descendants multiply countless billions of such creatures might occupy this room and yet be in visible without the aid of a compound microscope there is ample room for a swarm of such creatures numerous enough to devour a man to float in the air above our heads without revealing its presence the words of the doctor affected me strangely involuntarily i looked upward half expecting a swarm of maneating microbes to descend and de vour me for a moment i was seized with a feel ing of panic so strong i could scarcely restrain my self from leaping for the door the fact that the sun had just set and dusky shadows were thicken ing in the room augmented the illusion i crossed the floor nervously and pressed the switch beside the door instantly the place was flooded with blue white light from a cluster of powerful globes de pending from the middle of the ceiling as i was recrossing the room my eyes fell on the contents of the glasslined tank i stared unbeliev ingly for a moment then called dr dorp what is it evans he asked the liquid in this tank i replied it has changed color something has turned it pink the effect of the artificial light no doubt he said coming up beside me then i saw the expres sion of doubt on his face change to one of surprise and wonder you are right he exclaimed it has not only changed color but a still more remarkable trans formation has taken place when we noticed it this afternoon the tank was a third full of the colorless liquid this pink fluid reaches half way to the top a drawer filled with bones he tread of many feet sounded in the hall chief mcgraw paused in the doorway star ing down at the blueclad skeleton the floor a look of horror on his face behind him were four policemen in uniform isâis that the skeleton of poor old rooney the malignant entity mcgraw asked its too ghastly a thing to believe im afraid it is replied dr dorp the chief knelt and examined the star on the bag ging blue coat its hellish positively hellish he said rising do you know what killed him we are working on a theoryâ began the doctor but was interrupted by the chief theories be damned he snapped work on your theories if you want to this thing has gone too far im going to get some facts he swung on the four men behind him search the house he said look sharp foi nything of a suspicious nature an infernal machine perhaps or a blood sucking animal there is a mankiller of some kind human or otherwise hidden in this house and its our business to find it when the men had departed he stepped over rooneys skeleton ill search this room myself he said he did with professional thoroughness looking for hidden panels and sounding the walls both in the open areas and behind the shelves for hollow spaces then he began opening the drawers in a tall cabinet that stood in one corner disclosing sur gical and dissecting instruments of various kinds an indexed set of microscope slides with some extra lenses platinum dishes porcelain drying pans crucibles glass rods and tubing pipettes rubber tubing and stoppers rubber gloves and aprons and other miscellaneous laboratory paraphernalia the bottom drawer of the cabinet was quite large and deep the chief cried out excitedly when he saw its contents good lord look at that he exclaimed it was filled to the top with dry white bones nothing but the bones of small animals said dr dorp picking up a skull this for instance is the skull of a dog then taking up another here is the skull of a rabbit notice the charac teristic chiselshaped teeth this one beside it once supported the bewhiskered countenance of a com mon house cat what do you suppose he was doing with them asked the chief it is my belief that they were brought here to be killed and devoured by the same thing that killed the professor and rooney and that thing isâ at present merely a shadowy theory although it most certainly has an existence there is a power in this house that is a menace to everyone under this roofâa malignant entity that destroys human beings in some mysterious manner unparal leled in the annals of science or human experience this much we know reasoning from effects rea soning from possible causes we are aware that the hobby of professor townsend was the endeavor to create a living thing from inorganic matter and putting the two together it seems to me that the logical hypothesis would be that he either succeed ed in creating a monster of a sort unknown to biologists or discovered and developed unheard of powers and habits in a creature already known if theres such a thing in this house believe me im going to find it said the chief stamping out of the room now that we have a few moments to ourselves said dr dorp when mcgraw had departed let us conduct a search or rather an inquiry on our own account i perceive that we have a very excellent compound microscope at our disposal and am curious to examine the liquid whichhas so myster iously risen and changed color in the tank he took a blank slide from the cabinet drawer and a small glass rod from the table as he was about to dip the rod in the liquid he uttered a low exclamation of surprise whats up now i asked this amazing liquid has again become trans parent he replied the red tint is gone he plunged the tip of the rod into the viscous liquid twisted it slightly and withdrew it al though the liquid seemed quite heavy it slipped from the end of the rod much after the manner of the white of an egg after considerable juggling he succeeded in obtaining a small amount which he smeared on the slide he then placted the slide in position and adjusted the microscope with a prac ticed hand well i asked after he had peered into the eye piece for a full ten minutes what is the stuff any way here look for yourself he replied what i saw in the field of the microscope ap peared to be a mesh work or foam work of exceed ingly fine bubbles or perhaps globules granules of different sizes and shapes seemed imbedded in these globules and the whole was dotted at inter vals with small white objects while i watched several of these white objects seemed to dissolve and disappear all of them apparently were en dowed with life for i noticed that they expanded or contracted spasmodically and seemed endeavor ing to push their way through the surrounding bubbles seems to be a sort of foam i said with some thing alive floating in it the foam as you call it bears a singular re semblance to the basic life principle protoplasm when seen under the microscope replied the doc tor but those white thingsâ i began the white things he went on are the living remnants of a complex organism that has been de stroyed they are waging an unequal and hopeless battle against assimilation by the globules that sur round them these faithful guardians of the or ganism when alive still fight and will continue to fight the enemy until figuratively speaking the last man falls but what are they i demanded unless i am very much mistaken he replied they areâ his answer was cut short by the appearance of chief mcgraw coroner and jury are downstairs he said terse ly i suppose theyll want your testimony ill leave a couple of men on guard here if you want to come down let us go down to the study and complete our perusal of the professors manuscripts while the jury is in session said the doctor we can thus save considerable time and will be on hand when they are ready to question us we met coroner haynes and his jurors at the amazing stories foot of the stairs they were about to go up for an inspection of the laboratory and its gruesome contents dr dorp switched on one of the reading lamps and closed the door then he established himself in a comfortable chair with a pile of manuscripts and i followed his example we found essays and articles on almost every subject pertaining to the transmission or generation of life there were papers on anatomy bacteriology cellstructure microbiology and embryology there were trea tises on evolution spontaneous generation and the structures and habits of microorganisms a force ful and extremely impressive essay set forth the astounding theory that all life was merely a form of force generated from matter the reasoning wp of course purely analogical the professors contention stated briefly was that just aselec tricity a force that is invisible and indefinable is generated by the friction of particles of certain kinds of matter so life is generated and springs into being when certain other types of matter come together in the right proportions and combinations what is your opinion of this theory i asked dr dorp it is most cleverly put but false because based on the false premise of the materialists that there are but two things in the universe matter and force they do not recognize the power that con trols the force which moves the matter toward a fixed objective that power is mind thus to them all life and all mind are merely forms of force generated originally from inert matter if the professor succeeded in creating a living thing from inert matter i said it seems to me that he has demonstrated his propostion why because he was experimenting with dead matter and not with mind or living creatures there would be no mind or soul involved to inherit its being from a parent mind or soul a new life entity would be generated as it were from matter which formerly contained no life i think said the doctor quietly you would have stated the proposition more accurately had you said that a life entityâa mind without a bodyâ had been induced to enter the body synthetically created our discourse was interrupted by chief mcgraw who informed us that we were wanted by the coroner the coroners jury dr dorp did the talking before the coroners jury all theway through his testimony was negative when asked if he had any idea what killed the professor and the policeman he replied that he had several ideas but none of them would be worth bringing before the jury with out more facts to substantiate them i could see that his purpose was to get the inquest over with as soon as possible so we mightcontinue the inves tigation after due deliberation a verdict of death from cause or causes unknown was brought in and the coroner departed with his men now that the inquest is over what do you sug gest mcgraw asked the doctor my suggestion is that we immediately destroy the liquid in the glasslined tank in the laboratory why because i am convinced that it is at least one of the causes of the deaths that have taken place in this house i suppose you have a good reason for your assumption an excellent one i believe while you and your men were searching the house mr evans and i conducted a little investigation of our own we put some of the liquid under the compound micros cope and as we both saw the same things i ain convinced that my eyes did not deceive me tell the chief what you saw evans i described the foam work the granules and the white objects which appeared to be aiive and strug gling to escape all greek to me said the chief what was it the foam work with its accompanying granules closely resembled protoplasm the basic life sub stance and the white thingsâ were white blood corpuscles from the veins of a human being they were the strongest of the human body cells to resist assimilation and conse quently the last to succumb the red corpuscles turned the liquid pink for a while but they had disappeared before we made our microscopic exam ination good lord why didnt you tell me this before demanded the chief lets go up and destroy the stuff now those two men up there might be killed any minute we found the two policemen unharmed and made our plans for the destruction of the substance in thetank several demijohns of acid stood under the table and the doctor selected one nearly full of sulphuric acid open the windows he ordered this is going to make a horrible stench then he removed the rubber stopper from the mouth of thedemijohn and i helped him hoist it to the edge of the tank the searing liquid struck the heavy fluid in the tank with a hissing sound and bored into it like hot water poured in a snow bank the jellylike mass quivered slightly and pungent nauseating fumes arose to torment our nostrils then suddenly as if in horrible pain and awak ened to the danger of its dissolution the plasmic substance began to heave and billow toward the top of the tank with a movement suggestive of the writhing of a huge coiled serpent in its death agony by directing the stream of acid at the various peaks that arose we endeavored to keep it all washed down to a common level then a dozen peaks rose simultaneously and i noticed that one was capped with a round ball in the center of which was a black spot the nucleus cried the doctor excitedly shifting the demijohn pour it on the nucleus we were too late the thing upreared itself with amazing speed and lopped over the edge of the tank opposite us we dropped the nearlyemptied demi john into the tank and rushed around to intercept it just in time to see the ball containing the black the malignant entity spot separate itself from the stringy mass by which it was suspended drop to the floor and roll under the table an exciting chase of several minutes ensued the thing darted or rather rolled from place to place with amazing rapidity the tile floor was cracked in a dozen places by blows from the clubs of the two policemen who assisted us at length we drove it into the corner beneath the lavatory and advanced in close formation i had armed my self with a large spatula the doctor gripped a heavy pestle the two policemen had their clubs and the chief held his automatic pistol in readiness as we drew close we moved with extreme cau tion our nerves taut our weapons ready to strike when the thing should make its dash for liberty we waited breathlessly but no movement came from the corner i prodded the space behind the water pipes with my spatula still no sign of the thing we were after then i peered behind them and saw the reasonâa hole an inch in diameter in the tile floor probably drilled in the wrong place by a careless plumber and left unfilled because it was out of sight when i pointed it out to dr dorp he shook his head solemnly the malignant entity has escaped he said no one in this houseâin this community evenâ is safe until it is captured or killed you dont mean to tell me that little thing we were chasing around the room could kill anybody said the chief i am not so sure that it could kill any one now that it has been reduced to the size of a golf ball although the cytoplasm surrounding the nucleus evidently has the power of quickly dissolving and assimilating living tissues its growth apparently is only limited by the amount of food it can find maybe wed better get the women out of the house said the chief the sooner the better i suggest also that you surround the place with men armed with shotguns if that thing gets out and starts to grow i shudder to think of what may happen children will not be safe outside their own homes and perhaps not even within them adults will be attacked as soon as the creature has attained sufficient size and there is always the possibility that it may have the power to reproduce its kind organisms of this kind as a rule multiply with exceeding rapidity think of a thousand or perhaps a million such monsters roaming through the land it is almost impossible to kill them because of the power we have just witnessed of leaving the body no matter how large it has grown taking with it only enough cytoplasm to protect the nucleus and make a new start we were all gasping from the fumes that came out of the tank and glad to get out of the labora tory when all were assembled in the living room the chief phoned headquarters for men and shotguns while dr dorp and i explained what we had found to miss townsend after we had described our adventure in detail the doctor said it seems strange that your father left no records of his experiments with the monster i feel quite sure that he left a record of some sort though i have never seen it replied miss townsend have you any idea where it is perhaps in his safe in the study i do not remember seeing a safe in the study naturally it is hidden come and i will show you where it is we followed her into the study and she swung back one of the bookcases which was hung on con cealed hinges revealing a small wall safe would you mind opening it for us asked the doctor she turned the dial to number twelve then pulled the lever it did not move she seemed surprised set the dial more carefully and tried again with the same result its no use i guess she said the last number of the combination is twelve he usually turned it back to one and then it was only necessary to turn it to twelve to open it he must have locked it last night dont you know the combination no father was the only one who knew that i wonder if you would object to our blowing the safe he asked not if it will be of any assistance to you chief mcgraw who had just finished calling head quarters came into the room think you can get us a safecracker tonight chief asked the doctor get you most anything you want whats in the safe we believe it contains some valuable information regarding the thing we were chasing a while ago ill get a man out here right away said mc graw going once more to the phone officer burke escorted miss townsend mrs harms and the two servants to the harms home where they were to spend the night shortly afterward there arrived twenty policemen armed with shotguns and carrying several dozen bullseye lanterns they brought extra weapons which were distributed to all of us who remained in the house the chief the doctor the four police men and myself burke was to remain on guard next door a ring of lanterns was placed around the house and the twenty armed men were posted at inter vals between them we then divided our forces as follows one policeman was placed on guard in the laboratory chief mcgraw with another police man patrolled the upper rooms and halls the doctor and one policeman remained on the first floor and i accompanied by a strapping young fellow named black who had recently been admitted to the force did sentry duty in the basement theorizing the townsend basement was divided into three rooms each lighted rather dimly by the yellow rays from an incandescent globe sus pended on a short dropcord the furnace room and coal bins were situated at the rear end the middle compartment contained a miscellaneous as sortment of boxes barrels garden tools household continued on page dr hackensaws secrets some minor inventions by clement fezandie this machine you see here is only useful

few thousand autographs for that class of people of whom one is born every minute if not oftener but whats that queer machine youre using this pep is one of my minor inventionsâa little device designed to save the time of authors moviestars and other celebrities as you see the machine is simplicity itself it consists of one hun dred stylographic pens connected in ten rows of ten pens each rigidly held in a framework i write my autograph with an extra pen a masterpen which is attached to the framework thus causing each of the other pens to make the same motions by writing my name once with the master pen on a sheet of cardboard on the table i get one hun dred signatures on the cardboard which is then cut by machine into a hundred separate visiting cards each bearing my autograph i can thus write a thousand autographs in the time it would take an other man to write ten i may add continued the doctor chuckling that i have made some lifelong friends among actors and other celebrities and even among business men and government officials who have numerous documents to sign by making them a present of one of these machines many of these people are so grateful that they would be willing to do anything for me you must have made a lot of inventions in your lifetime observed pep yes htrndreds of them returned the doc tor as i happen to have some spare time now i can

into a phonograph but how can you do away with the person who ham mers the keys the problem is not as difficult as it seems my object was to do away entirely with the young lady an employer is often obliged to let his stenographer see letters which he would prefer to keep confiden tial then too think of the sums spent yearly for stenographers and typists go into any large business house and you

with the human typistâand even translator entirelyâetcâall useful machines still he is dissatisfiedâso he always goes ahead ever seeking netu improvements usually he succeeds here is food for thoughtâand experimentation âeven if the story is humorously told it is full of in terest and new ideas i will explain my first idea was merely to sim plify the work of the typewrittet at present her delicate hands have to hammer at the keys all day and she is subject to the malady known as type writers cramp it struck me that the work could be made much less fatiguing by pressing the keys by electricity instead of by the fingers i found that by dipping the tips of my fingers in a solution of copper i could make sufficient contact by touch ing a typewriter key to switch on an electric cur rent that would press down the desired letter the keys you understand remained stationary it was only the type that moved there was no time or energy lost in pushing down the keys and letting them rise agaim a dexterous person could write several times as fast as with the most rapid present day typewriter every touch meant a letter as the keys were motionless they could be crowded close together separated only by insulating ma terial i saved so much space that even using sep arate keys for the capitals and shiftletters my keyboard was smaller than the standard size the typewriter itself was greatly simplified as all mov ing parts were done away with except the few simple ones necessary to turn the typewheel which contained the letter on its rim each touch released a plunger that forced the wheel against the paper writing the character desired so compact was my machine and so simple that i found it desirable to duplicate the letters most often used for example there are five es on my keyboard at different convenient places so there is always one at hand when desired this increased speed so much that the typist could take dictation as fast as a stenographer of course with electric ity it was a simple matter to connect all five keys to the letter e on the wheel in such a way that making the contact on any one of the keys would close the circuit if i place my finger coated with metallic cop per on any one of the five keys the circuit is closed and the letter e is struck but objected pep no girl would be willing to copperplate her fingers like that no that was just my first rough idea my next improvement was to do away with any touch at all i wanted a vocal typewriterâone that could be worked entirely by the voice the mere articulation of each letter must be sufficient to close the proper circuit and print the letter would that be possible entirely so my first model consisted of a series of gas jets so constructed that each flame flared up as soon as some particular letter was spoken this flaring up closed an electric circuit and the letter was typed in practice however such a machine was too delicate for general use the great difficulty being keeping the gas jets properly adjusted in spite of differences of temperature but i finally amazing stories devised a machine that worked with a phonograph when the letter was spoken the vibiation of the diaphragm would turn on the proper current to strike the letter how about capital letters in dictating it is necessary to use the prefix cap when you wish the next letter to be a capital thus if you were dictating the name dickens you would have to say cap dickens and the machine would write the word properly with the capital d flushed with my success i decided to go further and write whole syllables instead of letters by using the phonograph there was no limit to the number of different keys i would use hence i could have separate keys for thousands of syllables al though the typewriter itself needed but twenty six letters how did you manage that each syllable key was so arranged that when depressed it switched on in turn all the letters which spelt the syllable thus when i spoke the syllable be the key tuned to work when this sound was uttered received the electric current and in de scending it switched a second electric current on to the letters b and e in turn so that these two letters were written on the paper a man could then dictate his letters to the machine just as he would to a stenographer how about syllables that sound alike but are spelled differently like pa in paper and pay ah that was the stumbling block to avoid it i made my first machine to write italian as in that language words are spelt as they are pronounced but i found that even in english there were not so many syllables that sound alike and are spelt dif ferently and i realized it would be a very easy matter for the dictator to learn to pronounce them slightly different thus the syllables dough doe and do could be pronounced somewhat as they are spelt a man could learn the proper pronunciation in an hour and the machine would then spell each properly then you succeeded perfectly my first machine had to be tuned to suit the voice of the dictator but experience soon taught me to leave enough play so that the machine would answer to any voice try it your self and see how it works dont shout just speak quietly into the mouthpiece just as you would at a telephone pep accordingly took up the mouthpiece and spoke a few sentences with some coaching from the doctor as to the proper pronunciation and was delighted to see that the machine typewrote from her dictation without a single error thats great cried pep isnt it i was so delighted with my success that i didnt stop there it was an easy matter to make a phonographic record that would repeat the dictation automatically as often as required and thus make a thousand typewritten copies from dictation if desired even this didnt satisfy me i resolved to go a step further and build a typewriter that would trans late my dictation automatically into several different languages i dictated in english and the machine at iny dictation typewrote copies in english french german and whatever other language i desired but objected pep that is impossible you cant make a machine think you cant translate without thinking and no steel springs electric currents can ever be made to think doctor hackensaw laughed that isnt the first impossible thing that ive made possible pep said he as a matter of fact the thing is simple in theoryâthough it is complex in practice if it were sufficient to translate word for word the prob lem would be easy say there are a hundred thou sand words in use in the english language it would only be necessary to have one hundred thou sand keys to spell the corresponding word in the foreign language it would be no more difficult than my dictation typewriter though it would require more keys but the problem is far more complex words spelt alike in english such as row a line and row the verb would have to be translated differ ently into german or french it is therefore neces sary to make these similar words different when dictating i accomplish this by saying row row row according to the meaning of the word i use the proper german equivalent is then released of course this means that the dictator must spend months in learning to dictate but he need know only english and his dictation will be automatically translated into any language de sired how about idioms special phrases proverbs and so on each idiom must of course have a key of its own this necessarily multiplies the number of keys all the keys you see in this room are parts of ray machine for translating into french my inversion keys will give you some idea of the many problems i had to meet and solve in french every noun is either masculine or feminine and its adjec tives must agree with the noun in gender for example horse is masculine and table is feminine so a good horse must be translated un bon cheval and a good table une bonne table in french too most adjectives follow the noun instead of preceding it as in english a french man does not say a black horse he says un cheval noir ie a horse black also french verbs must agree with their subject then as you re marked there are a large number of idiomatic phrases all these difficulties however i over come by an arrangement by which no typewriting is done before a complete sentence is dictated au tomatic inversion keys enable me to get the proper construction of words and their proper termina tions i dont understand you i will explain the adjective black in french may be either noir noire noirs or noires according to the gender and number of the noun that follows my key for the adjective tblack can write any one of these four words if the first nounkey that follows is masculine plural it is provided with a finger that turns around the key black so as to write the word noirs as the adjective black must always follow the noun the key black is also pro vided with an inversion device that prevents it from typewriting its word until the noun that follows it is typewritten so that if i dictate the words dr hackensaws secrets black horses the machine will write automatically chevaux noirs isnt that awfully complicated yes but not as complicated as it seems how ever this machine you see here is only useful for commercial purposes all my french business let ters are dictated to it in english and the french translations it makes are wonderfully good some day when i have time i shall construct a trans lating machine that will make really literary trans lations but i cannot at present spare either the patience or the time and money required besides there would be little demand for such a machine these commercial machines however fill a real need every large business house needs one the expense is not prohibitive as business letters re quire only simple sentences and stock phrases that keep recurring all the time my machine can trans late business letters and simple phrases like have you the parrot of your grandmothers cousin thats about the highest limitf real literature that my machine will translate pep jaughed your idea seems good said she but this machine is much too complicated couldnt your efficiency experts simplify it a little at the words efficiency expert doctor hacken saw snorted dont talk to me of efficiency experts pep said he unless you want to drive me crazy i have no use for them understand me i believe in organ ization organization is necessary for everything âeven for a collegeyell and i highly honor the efficiency expert who organizes a business so that the article to be manufactured enters at one door passes in turn to each of the men wrho have to work at it and goes out to the delivery wagon without traveling a single unnecessary foot i also honor the man who lowers the cost of goods without sacri ficing the quality but the efficiency expert who spends his time seeking to save one screw on a ma chine or a button or a stitch on a garment is a menace to society in making any machine engi neers allow for what is called the factor of safety they know that every machine at times will be called on to sustain undufe strains or stresses and they allow a margin of strength to meet these unusual demands the efficiency expert however spends his time paring down this factor of safety cutting out a screw here a nail there and producing an article that will give way at the least unusual strain leaving the owner in the lurch at a time when the idle machine means a loss to him many thousands of times the cost of the extra screw such experts are the bane of my existence only once in my life did i ever have occasion to bless an efficiency expert when was that when i was a young man pep i fell in love with a pretty girl and i bought a new suit of clothes on the day when i decided to propose to her but the tailor i bought it from was an efficiency expert who had found means of saving three stitches on every pair of trousers he made and thus increasing his gains onetenth of a cent on each pair the conse quence was that when i got down on my knees to propose to the idol of my heart there was a ripping and tearing sound heard as the trousers gave way at the seams burning with shame and confusion i jumped up and backed out of the room in as much haste as was possible under the circumstances and i never dared go near the young lady again well i understand now why you dont like the efficiency experts not at all at the time i felt like strangling the fellow but afterwards i would have done any thing for him the girl married another man and i remained free all my life pep laughed and doctor hackensaw continued there is one field where efficiency experts could do useful work and that is in the standardizing of the parts of different machinery at the present day we have standard sizes of screws nails bolts etc and this standardization has proved a great blessing it would however be possible to extend it to a great many castings and other parts of ma chinery certain parts of one automobile for ex ample should be capable of use on others or on aero planes or other machinery very slight changes in the patterns would often make this possible and lower the cost of production while at the same time it would facilitate repairs what is that next machine you have there asked pep thats a simple little attachment to prevent the theft of automobiles when you leave your car press a hidden switch the burglar comes starts the auto without trouble and makes off but as soon as the car begins to move a sign appears at the back this car is stolen the sign disappears as soon as the car stops but you will have no trouble tracing your car for a crowd will gather and the driver seeing how much attention he is getting will take the first op portunity to escape yet he wont know what caused the excitement as the sign has already van ished next to that machine you will see another can ning bread canning bread echoed pep yes while traveling abroad i often found it difficult to obtain nice fresh rolls and to attempt to carry a supply was out of the question as they became stale in a few hours travelers in the wild erness are obliged to carry flour and bake their own bread frequently or else consent to live on hard tack and crackers they would willingly pay the small additional cost for canned rolls or canned sandwiches if they were put up in tins filled with nitrogen instead of ordinary air the rolls will keep perfectly for years if properly sterilized and suffi ciently moist when packed they will be as fresh when opened as when first sealed and that very peculiar machine next to the sand wich canning machine asked pep that replied doctor hackensaw proudly is one of my greatest triumphs in inventing that is an automatic judge our courts are now all overcrowded with cases this machine will auto matically listen to the pleadings of the contending parties and give a just decision in fact ill guar antee the decisions of the machine to be equitable in cases out of a thousandâwhich is a larger proportion than any judge i ever heard of can boast how ridiculous retorted pep whoever heard of an automatic judge why such a thing is im amazing stories possible a machine cant possibly thinkâor have judgment doctor hackensaw chuckled it would seem so pep said he but i assure you i am perfectly serious when i say the machine will do what i claim for it it seems impossible but as in the case of the translating machine this is only one of many impossible things made possible but how does it work ill tell you for the basic principle is extremely simple i have had a great deal of experience in the courts and i have noticed that theman who is in the wrong always secures the best lawyer the man who knows he is right will be satisfied with a poor lawyer trusting to the justice of his cause to per suade the jury his opponent however knows his only hope is to secure a better lawyer than his ad versary and will spare no pains or expense to secure it consequently if i were a judge i would let both lawyers talk five minutes each and then decide the case in favor of the poorer lawyer but in that case why do you need a machine the machine is useful as an aid to tell which lawyer is really the cleverer it registers their brain capacity their intelligence their energy etc but objected pep it seems to me that people would soon learn your system and then both sides would try to engage the poorest lawyers they could find precisely to avoid that i must keep my method secret my machine does the real judging but i should hire cheap men to listen quietly to the cases and at the end they would secretly draw a slip from the machine which would tell them what verdict to give and as i said i would guarantee the judgment to be equitable in cases out of a thousand whats that little instrument that looks like a match asked pep thats a gynaionometer its an instrument for measuring a womans age a gynaionometer yes thats greek and means the measure of a womans age great scott how does it work i got the idea from an author who wrote under the pen name of diogenes tubb who some forty years ago wrote the story of an inventor mr p q jones of an instrument for ascertaining a womans age at that time about the ladies all wore long skirts well this mr p q jones was a phil osopher iie had often stood on a street corner on a muddy day and he noticed that the ladies in crossing always raised their skirts a little in order to keep them out of the mud well theres nothing very extraordinary in that no but mr jones noticed the remarkable fact that the extent to which the skirt was raised varied with the age of the womanâin fact he found that the amount of stocking displayed was directly pro portional to the womans ageâthe older the woman the higher she raised her skirts it was another instance of the law of compensationâmaking up in quantity for what was lacking in quality mr p q jones used this fact as the basis for an instrument which he called a gynaionometer and which he used for measuring the ages of the ladies he met in this matchlike instrument on the table you see an improvement of mine on mr jones idea âa very simple means for ascertaining the age of your motherinlaw or any other of your female friends as you see my device was simplicity itself it consisted merely of a dial on which was a fixed needle and a movable needle on a muddy day you could stand exactly ten feet away from the curb and place the instrument so the fixed needle is perfectly horizontal three feet from the ground then you wait for the lady to come along and when she raises her skirt you move the movable needle until it points directly at the highest visible portion of her stock ing and you could at once read her exact age on the dial in years months and days good heavens but the thing wouldnt work nowadays when we all wear short skirts no the fashions changed and i was obliged to modify my instrument as a persons arteries harden with age i tried to make one that would work according to the degree of hardness of the artery but i failed when the audion was invented however i succeeded by making agynaionometer that worked by electricity every human being is an electrical machineâcontinually generating elec trical currents careful study showed me that these currents vary with age by the use of an audion i could amplify these currents and i constructed the rather complicated machine you see here which ena bles me to tell a ladys exact age in an instant i expected to make a fortune from my device but would you believe it the thing has brought me nothing but trouble and vexation like mr jones i have lost all my lady friends and have become es tranged from my female relatives because i claimed to know their ages better than they did themselves no pep there are some things it doesnt pay to monkey with one of them is the buzzsaw an other is a womans age the end the runaway skyscraper by murray leinster concluded years flee by three generations were born grew and begot children and died again estelle held fast in arthurs arms thought noth ing of such trivial things she put her arms about his neck and kissed him while the years passed them unheeded of course you know that the building landed safely in the exact hour minute and second from which it started so that when the frightened and excited people poured out of it to stand in madison square and feel that the world was once more right side up their hilarious and incomprehensible con duct made such of the world as was passing by think a contagious madness had broken out days passed before the story of the two thousand was believed but at last it was accepted as truth and eminent scientists studied the matter ex haustively there has been one rather queer result of the journey of the runaway skyscraper a certain isidore eckstein a dealer in jewelry novelties whose office was in the tower when it disappeared into the past has entered suit in the courts of the united states against all holders of land on man hattan island it seems that during the two weeks in which the tower rested in the wilderness he traded independently with one of the indian chiefs and in exchange for two nearpearly necklaces six teen fingerrings and one dollar in money received a titledeed to the entire island he claims that his deed is a conveyance made previous to all other sales whatever strictly speaking he is undoubtedly right as his deed was signed before the discovery of america the courts however are deliberating the question with a great deal of perplexity eckstein is quite confident that in the end his claim will be allowed and he will be admitted as the sole owner of realestate on manhattan island with all occupiers of buildings and territory paying him groundrent at a rate he will fix himself in the mean time though the foundations are being reenforced so the catastrophe cannot occur again his entire office is packed full of articles suitable for trading with the indians if the tower makes an other trip back through time eclcstein hopes to be come a landholder of some importance no less than eightyseven books have been written by members of the memorable two thousand in description of their trip to the hinterland of time but arthur who could write more intelligently about the matter than any one else is so extremely busy that he cannot bother with such things he has two very important matters to look after one is of course the reenforcement of the foundations of the building so that a repetition of the catas trophe cannot occur and the other is to convince his wifeâwho is estelle naturallyâthat she is the most adorable person in the universe he finds the latter task the more difficult because she insists that he is the most adorable personâ the end to our readers since the second issue of amazing stories appeared

room was used as a laundry officer black and i searched each room thorough ly using a flash light in the dark corners and mov ing everything that wasnt fastened to the floor or walls several mice jumped out from behind boxes and barrels but we saw no sign of the creature we were hunting we were peering behind the furnace when several loud squeaks came to us from the middle room with shotgun held in readiness i moved stealth ily toward the point from which the sound came there in the center of the floor almost under the yellow electric light bulb i saw the fast disappear ing body of a mouse under a mass of plasmic jelly my first impulse was to shoot but on second thought i dccided to attempt to capture the thing alive if possible instructing black to hold his wea pon in readiness in case i failed i unscrewed the lid from a large empty fruit jar and walked softly toward the center of the floor i expected the thing to spring away but to my surprise it lay almost mo tionless on the body of its victim i could see streaks of bright red flowing through the jellylike mass as blood of the mouse was drawn up for assimilation i clapped the mouth of the jar over the creature and still it made no effort to escape then sliding a fire shovel which black brought me under the thing and its victim i turned the jar right side up it fell to the bottom of the receptacle still clinging to the now formless mass that had once been a mouse and making no effort to escape i put the lid in place and screwed it down tight now try to get away you devil i cried shak ing the jar exultantly i almost dropped it a moment later as a muffled explosion jarred the building then i remembered chief mcgraws safecracker and hurried upstairs when i reached the livingroom dr dorp was emerging from the study in a cloud of plaster dust in his hand was a thick looseleaf book i have the professors diary he called excitedly dont get fussed over such trifles i replied look what ive got caught it alive too i put the jar on the table and he squinted at it for a moment the bloodbloated monstrosity had separated its shapeless hulk from the whitened bones of its victim and was sluggishly crawling up the side of the glass you caught it sure enough he said i only hope it hasnt any little sons or daughters about ill keep the house under guard for a couple of days said chief mcgraw who had come down to learn the result of the cracksmans labors if there are any more of these things around they ought to show themselves by that time the doctor drew a chair up to the table and eagerly scanned the pages of the diary while we watched the antics of the thing in the jar it kept getting lighter colored all the time and more lively by the time the cytoplasm had become transparent it was racing around contorting its body into all kinds of shapesâflat oval and round at times it put forth pseudopods sometimes elongating them until it resembled a small cuttle fish september twentythird was the night immune benny died wasnt it chief asked the doctor right why then this diary tallies with miss townsend tes timony here is the professors entry september nearly midnight eureka i have succeeded i placed a tiny drop of syntheplasm on the slide tonight as have done a thousand times before and covered it with a weak sterile solution of gelatine i watched it steadily for a half hour but noth ing happened until suddenly i noticed a tiny black spot forming in its center i am positive there were no animalcules either in the syntheplasm or the solu tion yet no sooner had the black spot become readily distinguishable than my speck of syntheplasm began moving about as if searching for food evidently it cannot subsist on gelatine i next introduced a rhizopod into the solution my animal slightly resembles it but is larger and gets about much faster i wanted to compare the tivo but the rhizopod was quickly devoured notv i know what to feed it it is growing late so i will not read all the de tails to you continued the doctor suffice to say that the professor discovered his synthetically creat ed creature would feed on nothing but living crea tures he fed it so many microscopic animals the second day that it grew to a size visible to the naked eye then he fed it gnats mosquitos flies beetles and finally mice when it became so large he was forced to transfer it from the small porcelain dish in which he kept it to a much larger one the thing grew at a prodigious rate of speed its growth seemed only limited by the amount of living creatures it was permitted to devour at length he was compelled to keep it in the glasslined tank which he had been using for the culture of in fusoria its victims were thrown into the tank alive and were quickly killed by the monster he noticed that it was sluggish while assimilating its food but moved with catlike quickness when hun gry though it had no eyes it seemed to sense the approach of food in some way and toward the last stretched forth pseudopods and snatched the animals from his hands yesterday the professor led two mastiffs into the room hardly had he closed the door of the laboratory before the monster was out of the tank it killed and devoured the two big dogs in less than a half hourâthen crawled back sluggishly into the tank to digest its meal thus ends the written record of the professors adventures with the malig nant entity his whitened bones on the floor of the laboratory are mute testimony of what occurred there was a moment of awed silence when the doctor finished his narrative his eyes fell on the struggling thing in the glass jar what are you going to do with it i asked come he said taking up the jar and starting for the basement i will show you amazing stories the chief and i followed him down the basement stairs and into the fur nace room he opened the firedoor and tossed the jar on the glowing coals the thing raced about spasmodically for a moment in the intense heat then fell huddled in the bottom of the jar suddenly as if inflated from be neath it puffed upward and outward almost filling the receptacle in a shape that resembled a human head i thought this only a figment of my imagination at first â blinked â and looked a second time the face of a man stared back at me from behind the curved glass eyes glowing with malevolent hatred and lips drawn back in a snarl that revealed crooked yel ow fangs for a moment only the vision held the next instant the jar was empty of all save a tiny pile of white flaky ash and the bones of the mouse dr dorp shut the door suddenly and noisily that face i exclaimed did you see it also a queer distortion of the gasin flated protoplasm he replied chief mcgraw seemed greatly per turbed he drew a long black cigar from his pocket lighted it and puffed nervously for a moment distortion hell he muttered it was a perfect double for the face of immune benny the end an experiment in gyrohats by ellis parker butler concluded
