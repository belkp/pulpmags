commanded what is it you have withheld somewhere in the history of these cases is a factor you have not re vealed some denominator common to them all which makes your police instinct doubt your senses evidence howd ye guess it sor the big irish man looked at him admiringly yeve put yer finger right upon it but he stifled an embarrassed cough then turning slightly red tis th perfume sor as makes me wonder perfume the little frenchman ech oed what in satans foul name well sor i aint one o them as sees a womans skirts ahidin back of ivery crime though you an i both knows theres mighty few crimes

like th kind o smell ye smell when they takes a floater from th bay sor well i looks around ter see where its acomin from an its strongest in th bedroom but divil a sign o any woman bein there i find ceptin fer th smell o perfume so when we runs in on th trivers suicide an i smells th same perfume incense of abomination again i say that this is sumpin more than mere coincidence but th same thing hap pens there th smell is strongest in th bedroom but there aint any sign that hed had company th night before so just ter make sure i takes th casins off th pil lows an has th boys at th crime labra tory look at em divil a trace o rouge or powder do they find both these other fellies kilt their selves at night or early in th mornin so o course their beds wuz all unmade but when we hustle over ter

em th perfumes faded out he looked at us with vaguely troubled eyes and ran his hand across his mouth tis meself thats goin nuts about these suicides acomin one on top th other an this perfume bobbin up in every case he finished de grandin pursed his lips you would know this so strange scent if you encountered it again faith sor id know it in me slape and you have never met with it be fore indade an i had not nayther before nor since savin in th imayjate prisence o them three dead corpses one regrets it is so evanescent per haps if i could smell it i might be able to identify it i recall when i was serving with le sûreté we came upon a band of scoundrels making use of a strange indian drug called by the hindoos chhota maut or little death it was a subtle powder which made those inhaling it go mad or fall into a coma simulating death if they inspired enough those naughty fellows mixed the drug with incense which they caused to be burned in their victims rooms some went mad and some ap peared to die one of those who went insane committed suicide howly mither an ye think we may be up against a gang like that sor one cannot say mon vieux had i a chance to sniff this scent perhaps i could have told you its odor is not one that is soon forgotten as it ishe raised his shoulders in a shrugwhat can one do will ye be afther holdin yerself in readiness ter come arunnin if theys an other o these suicides sor the big de tective asked as he rose to say goodnight id take it kindly if ye would you may count on me my friend a bientôt the little frenchman answered with a smile the storm had blown itself out earlier in the evening but the streets were still bright with the filmy remnant of the sleety rain and the moon was awash in a breaking surf of windclouds it was longer by the north road but with the pavements slick as burnished glass i pre ferred to take no chanccs and had throt tled down my engine almost to a walking pace as we climbed the gradient leading to north bridge de grandin sank his chin into the fur of his upturned coat collar and nodded sleepily the party at the merrivales had been not at all amus ing and we were due at city hospital at seven in the morning ah bah he murmured drowsily we were a pair of fools my friend we forgot a thing of great importance when we left the house tonight um i grunted what to stay there he returned had we but the sense le bon dieu gives an un weird tales fledged gosling we should havesapristi stop him he is intent on selfdestruction at his shouted warning i looked to ward the footwalk and descried a figure in a heavy ulster climbing up the guard rail shooting on my power i jerked the car ahead then cut the clutch and jammed the brakes down hard swinging us against the curb abreast of the intending suicide i kicked the door aside and raced around the enginehood but de grandin disdained such delays and vaulted over side half leaping half sliding on the slippery pavement and cannoning full tilt against the man who sought to climb the breasthigh railing parbleu you shall not he exclaimed as he grasped the others legs with outfiung arms it is wet down there monsieur and most abominably cold wait for summer if you care to practise diving the man kicked viciously but the lit tle frenchman hung on doggedly and as the other loosed his hold upon the rail they both came crashing to the pavement where they rolled and thrashed like fight ing dogs i hovered near the mêlée intent on giv ing such assistance as i could but my help was not required for as i reached to snatch the strangers collar de grandin gave a quick twist arched his body upon neck and heels and with a blow as rapid as a striking snakes chopped his adversary on the adams apple with his stiffened hand the result was instantaneous the larger man collapsed as if he had been shot and my little friend slipped out from underneath him teeth flashing in an impish grin small blue eyes agleam a knowledge of jiujutsu comes in handy now and then he panted as he rearranged his clothing for a moment i had fears that he would take me with him to a watery bed well what shall we do with him i asked hes out completely and we cant afford to leave him here hell surely try to kill himself again if parbleu attendez sil vous plait he interrupted le parfumdo you smell him he paused with backthrown head narrow nostrils quivering as he sniffed the moist cold air there was no doubt of it faint and growing quickly fainter but plainly no ticeable the aura of a scent hung in the atmosphere it was an odd aroma not wholly pleasant yet distinctly fascinating seeming to combine the heavy sweetness of patchouli with the bitterness of frank incense and the penetrating qualities of musk and civet yet underlying it there was a faint and slightly sickening odor of corruption why i never smelled i began but de grandin waved aside my observa tion nor i he nodded shortly but un less i am at fault this is the perfume which the good costello told us of can not you see my friend we have here our laboratory specimen an uncompleted suicide with the redolence of this mysteri ous scent upon it help me lift him in the car mon vieux we have things to say to this one we shall ask him by ex ample why it was suppose that he wont talk i broke in ha you suppose that if your sup position proves correct and he is of the obstinacy you shall see a beautiful ex ample of the third degree you shall see me turn him inside out as if he were a ladys glove i shall creep into his mind me i shallmordieu before the night is done i damn think i shall have at least a partial answer to the good costellos puz zle come let us be of haste en avant despite his height the salvaged man did not weigh much and we had no trouble getting him inside the car in incense of abomination fifteen minutes we were home just as our rescued human flotsam showed signs of returning consciousness be careful warned de grandin as he helped the passenger alight if you behave we shall treat you with the kind ness but if you try the monkeys tricks i have in readiness a second portion of the dish i served you on the pont du nord here he added as we led our captive to the study this is the medicine for those who feel at odds with life he poured a gill of scots into a tumbler and poised the siphon over it will you have soda with your whisky he inquired or do you like it unpolluted soda please the other answered sulkily drained his glass in two huge gulps and held it out again eh bien the frenchman chuckled your troubles have not dulled your ap petite it seems drink my friend drink all you wish for the evening is still young and we have many things to talk of thou and i the visitor eyed him sullenly as he took a sip from his fresh glass i sup pose you think youve done your boy scouts good deed for today he mut tered mais oui mais certainement the frenchman nodded vigorously we have saved you from irreparable wrong my friend le bon dieu did not put us here to thats comic the other burst out with a cackling laugh le bon dieu much use he has for me de grandin lowered his arching brows a little the effect was a deceptively mild thoughtful frown soo he murmured that is the way of it you feel that you have been cast off that why not didnt weicast him out didnt i deny him take service with his enemies mock at him be not deceived my friendthe double lines between the frenchmans narrow brows was etched a little deeper as he answered in an even voicegod is not mocked it is easier to spit against the hurricane than jeer at him besides he is most merciful he is compassionate and his patience transcends understand ing wicked we may be but if we offer true repentance even if youve committed the unpar donable sin tiens this péché irrémissible of which the theologians prate so learnedly yet which none of them defines you had a mother one assumes you may have sinned against her grievously disap pointed her high hopes in you shown in gratitude as black as satans shadow abused her trust or even done her bodily hurt yet if you went to her sincerely penitent and told her you were sorry that you truly loved her and would sin no more parbleu she would forgive you know it will the heavenly father be less merciful than earthly parents very well then who can say that he has sinned past reconciliation i can i didwe all did we cast god out and embraced satan something that was lurking horror seemed to take form in his eyes giving them a stony glazed appearance it was as if a filmy curtain were drawn down across them hiding everything within mirroring only a swiftmounting terror ah de grandin murmured thought fully now we begin to make the prog ress abruptly he demanded you knew messieurs eldridge tri vers and atkins he flung the words more like a challenging accusation than a query yes and they too thought they had sinned past redemption they saw in sui cide the last hope of escape they were concerned with you in this iniquity weird tales they were but no interfering busy body stopped them let me out of here im going to monsieur de grandin did not raise his voice but the look he bent upon the other was as hard and merciless as though it were a leveled bayonet you are going to remain right here and tell us how it came about you will tell of this trans gression which has caused three deaths already and almost caused a fourth do not fear to speak my friend we are physicians and your confidence will be respected on the other hand if you per sist in silence we shall surely place you in restraint you would like to be lodged in a madhouse have your every action watched be strapped in a straitjacket if you attempted selfdestruction hein slowly spoken his words had the impact of a bodily assault and the other reeled as from a beating not that he gasped o god any thing but that ill tell you everything if you will promise you have our word monsieur say on the visitor drew his chair up closer to the fire as if a sudden cold had chilled his marrow he was some forty years of age slim and quite attractive immaculately dressed well groomed his eyes were brown deepset and drawn as if unutterably weary with little pouches under them his shoulders sagged as if the weight they bore was too much for them his hair was almost wholly gray beaten was the only adjective to modi fy him i think perhaps you knew my parents doctor trowbridge he began my father was james balderson i nodded jim balderson had been a senior when i entered college and his escapades were bywords on the campus nothing but the tolerance which stamps a rich youths viciousness as merely indi cation of high spirits had kept him from dismissal since his freshman year and faculty and townsfolk sighed with relief when he took his sheepskin and departed simultaneously the balderson and ald ridge fortunes were combined when he married bronson aldridges sole heir and daughter and though he settled down in the walnutpaneled office of the farmers loan amp trust company his sons had car ried on his youthful zest for getting into trouble drunken driving divorce cases scandals which involved both criminal and civil courts were their daily fare two of them had died by violence one in a motor smashup one when an outraged husband showed better marksmanship than selfrestraint one had died of poi son liquor in the prohibition era we had just saved the sole survivor from attempted suicide yes i knew your father i responded do you remember horton hall he asked i bent my brows a moment wasnt that the school down by the shrewsbury where they had a scandalsomething about the headmaster committing sui cide or youre right thats it i was in the last class there so were eldridge trivers and atkins i was finishing my junior year when the war broke out in seventeen dad got bulletproof commissions for the older boys but wouldnt hear of my enlisting in the navy youve a job to do right there at horton he told me get your certificate then well see about your join ing up so back i went to finish out my senior year dad didnt know what he was doing to me things might have turned out differently if id gone in the service everyone who could was getting in the army or the navy wed lost most incense of abomination of our faculty when i went back in eight een and theyd put a new headmaster in a doctor herbules fellows were leaving right and left enlisting from the campus or being called by draft boards and i was pretty miserable one day as i was walking back from science lab i ran full tilt into old herbules whats the matter balderson he asked you look as if youd lost your last friend well i have almost i answered with so many fellows off at train ingcamp having all kinds of excite ment you want excitement eh he inter rupted i can give it to you such excite ment as youve never dreamed of i can make you he stopped abruptly and it seemed to me he looked ashamed of something but hed got my curiosity roused youre on sir i told him what is it a prizefight herbules was queer everybody said so he couldnt have been much past thirty yet his hair was almost snow white and there was a funny sort o peace ful expression on his smooth face that reminded me of something that i couldnt quite identify he had the schoolmasters trick of speaking with a sort of pedantic precision and he never raised his voice yet when he spoke in chapel we could understand him perfectly no matter how far from the platform we were sitting id never seen him show signs of excite ment before but now he was breathing hard and was in such deadly earnest that his lips were fairly trembling what do you most want from life he asked me in a whisper why i dont know just now id like best of all to get into the army id like to go to france and bat around with the mademoiselles and get drunk any time i wanted youd like that sort of thing he laughed i can give it to you and more more than you ever imagined wine and song and gayety and womenbeautiful lovely cultured women not the street trulls that youd meet in franceyou can have all this and more if you want to balderson lead me to it i replied when do we start ah my boy nothings given for nothing there are some things youll have to do some promises to make some thing to be paid all right how much i asked dad was liberal with me i had a hundred dol lars every month for spending money and i could always get as much again from mother if i worked it right no no not money he almost laughed in my face the price of all this cant be paid in money all we ask is that you give the master something which i greatly doubt you realize you have my boy it sounded pretty cockeyed to me but if the old boy really had something up his sleeve i wanted to know about it count me in i told him what do i do next there was no one within fifty yards of us but he bent until his lips were al most in my ear before he whispered next wednesday at midnight come to my house private party or could i bring a friend or two his features seemed to freeze who is the friend he asked well id like to bring eldridge and trivers and maybe atkins too theyre all pretty good eggs and i know they crave excitement oh by all means yes be sure to bring them its agreed then next wednesday night at twelve at my house weird tales herbules was waiting for us in a perfect fever of excitement when we tiptoed up his frontporch steps on wednesday night he had a domino and mask for each of us the dominoes were fiery red with hoods that pulled up like monks cowls the masks were black and hideous they represented long thin faces with outjutting chins the lips were purple and set in horrid grins the eye brows were bright scarlet wool and at the top there was another patch of bright red worsted curled and cut to simulate a fringe of hair good lord said atkins as he tried his on i look just like the devil i thought that herbules would have a stroke when he heard atkins speak youll use that name with more respect after tonight my boy he said after that we all got in his car and drove down toward red bank we stopped about a mile outside of town and parked the car in a small patch of woods walked some distance down the road climbed a fence and cut across a field till we reached an old deserted house id seen the place as i drove past and had often wondered why it was unoccu pied for it stood up on a hill surrounded by tall trees and would have made an ideal summer home but id been told its well was dry and as there was no other source of water nobody wanted it we didnt go to the front door but tiptoed round the back where herbules struck three quick raps waited for a mo ment then knocked four more wed all put on our robes and masks while he was knocking and when the door was opened on a crack we saw the porter was robed and masked as we were nobody said a word and we walked through a basement entrance down a long and nar row hall and turned a corner where we met another door here herbules went through the same procedure and the door swung back to let us in we were in a big room twenty by forty feet i guess and we knew it was a cellar by the smellstiflingly close but clammy as a tomb at once rows of fold ing chairs like those used at bridge games or funeralswere arranged in double rows with a passage like an aisle between and at the farther end of the big room we saw an altar in all my life i dont believe id been to church ten times but we were nom inally protestants so what i saw had less effect on me than if id been a catholic or episcopalian but i knew at once the altar wasnt regulation oh it was suffi ciently impressive but it had a sort of comicno not comic grotesque rather note about it a reredos of black cloth was hung against the wall and before it stood a heavy table more than eight feet long and at least six wide covered by a black cloth edged with white it reminded me of something though i couldnt quite identify it for a moment then i knew id seen a jewish funeral once and this cloth was like the blackserge pall they used to hide the plain pine coffin at each end of the altar stood a seven branched candelabrum made of brass each with a set of tall black candles in it these were burning and gave off a pale blue glow they seemed to be perfumed too and the odor which they burned with was pleasantat first then as i sniffed a second time it seemed to me there was a faint suspicion of a stench about it something like the fetor that you smell if youre driving down the road and pass a dog or cat thats been run over and has lain a while out in the sunjust a mo mentary whiff but nauseating just the same between the candelabra right ex actly in the center of the altar but back against the wall was a yardhigh crucifix of some black wood with an ivory figure incense of abomination on it upside down before the cross there was a silver wine goblet and a box of gilt inlay about the size and shape of a ladys powderpuff box i heard atkins catch his breath and give a sort of groan hed been brought up an episcopalian and knew about such things he turned half round to leave but i caught him by the sleeve come on you fool dont be a sissy i admonished and next moment we were all so interested that he had no thought of leaving there was a sort of congregation in the chapel every seat was occupied by someone masked and robed just as we were save three vacant places by the altar steps these we knew were kept for us but when we looked about for herbules he was nowhere to be seen so we went forward to our seats alone we could hear a hum of whispering as we walked up the aisle and we knew some of the voices were from women but who was man and who was woman was impossible to tell for each one looked just like his neighbor in his shrouding robe the whispering suddenly became in tense like the susurrus of a hive of swarming bees every neck seemed sud denly to crane every eye to look in one direction and as we turned our glances toward the right side of the cellar we saw a woman entering through a cur tained doorway she wore a long loose scarlet cape which she held together with one hand her hair was very black her eyes were large and luminously dark seeming to have a glance of overbearing sensuousness and sweet humility at once her white set face was an imponderable mask her full red lips were fixed in an uneven bitter line beneath the hem of her red cloak we saw the small feet in the golden highheeled slippers were un stockinged as she neared the altar she sank low in genuflection then wheeled about and faced us for a moment she stood there svelte graceful mysteriously beautiful with that thin white face and scarlet lips so like a mask then with a sudden kicking motion she unshod her feet opened wide her cloak and let it fall in scarlet billows on the dullblack carpet of the altar steps she was so beautiful it almost hurt the eyes to look at her as she stood there in white silhouette against the ebon back ground of the blackdraped altar with her narrow boylike hips slim thighs and full high pointed breasts she was a thing of snow and fire her body palely cool and virginal her lips like flame her eyes like embers blazing when a sudden wind stirs them to brightness the modern striptease routine was unthought of in those days and though i was sophisticated far beyond my eighteen years i had never seen a woman in the nude before the flame of her raced in my blood and crashed against my brain with almost numbing impact i felt my self go faint and sick with sudden weak ness and desire weird tales a longdrawn sigh came from the audience then the tableau was abruptly broken as the girl turned from us mount ed nimbly to the blackdraped altar and stretched herself full length upon it crossed her ankles and thrust her arms out right and left so that her body made a white cross on the sable altarcloth her eyes were closed as though in peace ful sleep but her bosoms rose and fell with her tumultuous breathing she had become the altar silence fell upon the congregation like a shadow and next instant herbules came in he wore a priests vestments a long red cassock over it the alb and stole and in his hand he bore a small red book behind him came his acolyte but it was not an altarboy it was a girl slender copperhaired petite she wore a short surcoat of scarlet cut low around the shoulders sleeveless reaching just be low the hips like the tabards worn by mediæval heralds over it she wore a laceedged cotta otherwise she was un clothed we could hear the softlyslap ping patter of her small bare feet upon the altarsill as she changed her place from side to side genuflecting as she passed the reversed crucifix she swung a brazen censer to and fro before her and the gray smoke curled in spurting puffs from it filling the entire place with a per fume like that generated by the candles but stronger more intense intoxicating herbules began the service with a muttered latin prayer and though he seemed to follow a set ritual even i could see it was not that prescribed by any church for when he knelt he did so with his back turned toward the altar when he crossed himself he did it with the thumb of his left hand and made the sign beginning at the bottom rather than the top but even in this mummers parody the service was majestic i could feel its power and compulsion as it swept on toward its climax herbules took up the silver chalice and held it high above his head then rested it upon the living altar placing it between her breasts and we could see the flesh around her nails grow white as she grasped the black palled altar table with her fingers her body shining palely on the coffinpall under the flickering candles light was arched up like a tauted bow she shook as if a sudden chill had seized her and from her tightdrawn scarlet lips there issued little whimpering sounds not cries nor yet quite groans but something which partook of both and at the same time made me think of the soft whining sounds a newborn puppy makes the kneeling acolyte chimed a sac ringbell and the congregation bent and swayed like a wheatfield swept across by sudden wind when all was finished we were bid den to come forward and kneel before the altar steps herbules came down and stood above us and each of us was made to kiss the red book which he held and take a fearful oath swearing that he would abstain from good and embrace evil serve satan faithfully and well and do his best to bring fresh converts to the worship of the devil should we in any manner break our oath we all agreed that satan might at once foreclose upon his mortgage on our souls and bear us still alive to hell and the sign that we were come for was to be the odor of the per fume which the candles and the censer gave that night when this ritual was finished we were bidden name our dearest wish and told it would be granted i could hear the others mumble something but could not understand their words i dont know what possessed me when it came my turn to ask a boon of satanpossibly he put the thought into my mind maybe it was my longing to get out of school and go incense of abomination to france before the war was ended at any rate when herbules bent over me i muttered i wish the pater would bump off he leaned toward me with a smile and whispered you begin your postu lancy well my son then held his hand out to me signifying that i should return his clasp with both of mine as i put out my hands to take his i saw by my wrist watch that it was exactly halfpast twelve what followed was the wildest party i had ever seen or dreamt of the farm house windows had been boarded up and curtained and inside the rooms were literally ablaze with light men and wo men some draped in their red dominoes some in evening dress some naked as the moment that they first drew breath min gled in a perfect saturnalia of unrestrained salacity on tables stood icebuckets with champagne and beside them tall decan ters of cut glass filled with port and sher ry tokay madeira muscatel and malaga also there was bottled brandy vodka and whisky trays of cigarettes boxes of cigars sandwiches cake and sweetmeats it was like the carnival at new orleans only ten times gayer madder more abandoned i was grasped by naked men and women whirled furiously around in a wild dance then let go only to be seized by some new partner and spun around until i almost fell from dizziness between times i drank mixing wine and spirits without thought stuffed sandwiches and cake and candy in my mouth then drank fresh drafts of chilled champagne or sharp toned brandy staggering drunkenly about the table i was reaching for another glass when i felt a hand upon my shoulder turning i beheld a pair of flashing eyes laughing at me through the peepholes of a mask come with me my neophyte the masked girl whispered there is still a chalice you have left untasted she pulled me through the crowd led me up the stairs and thrust a door ajar the little room we entered was entirely oriental a persian lamp hung like a blazing ruby from the ceiling on the floor were thick soft rugs and piles of downfilled pillows there was no other furniture with a laugh she turned her back to me motioning me to slip the knot which held the girdle of her domino then she bent her head while i withdrew the pins that held her hair it rippled in a cascade to her waistbelow nearly to her knees black and glossy as the plumage of a grackles throat and as it cataracted down she swung around shrugging her shoul ders quickly and let the scarlet domino fall from her an upswing of her hand displaced the blackfaced purple grin ning mask and i looked directly in the face of the pale girl who half an hour earlier had lain upon the altar of the devil kiss me she commanded kiss me her arms were tight about my neck pulling my lips to hers drawing her slender unclothed body tight against me her lips clung to my mouth as though they were a pair of scarlet leeches through her halfclosed lids i saw the glimmer of her bright black eyes burning like twin points of quenchless fire it was daylight when we reached the dorm next day and all of us reported sick at chapel sometime about eleven as i rose to get a drink of water a knock came at my door it was a telegram that stated father dropped dead in his study at twelve fortyfive come mother i hurried back to school as soon as possible my fathers death had startled frightenedme but i put it down to coincidence hed been suffering from brights disease for several years and weird tales probably his numberd just turned up i told myself besides the longing for the celebration of the sacrilegious mass with its sensual stimulation followed by the orgiastic parties had me in a grip as strong as that which opium exerts upon its addicts twice a week each wednesday and friday my three friends and i attended the salacious services held in the old farmhouse cellar followed by the revels in the upper rooms and bit by bit we learned about our fellow cultists herbu les the head and center of the cult was a priest stripped of his orders pastor of a parish in the suburbs of vienna he had dabbled in the black art seduced a num ber of his congregation from their faith finally celebrated the black mass the ecclesiastical authorities unfrocked him the civil government jailed him on a morals charge but disgrace could not im pair his splendid education or his bril liant mind and as soon as his imprison ment was over he emigrated to america and at once secured a post as teacher though his talents were unquestionable his morals were not and scandal fol lowed every post he held he was at the end of his string when he managed to worm his way into the horton trustees confidence and secured the post left va cant by the former headmasters entrance in the army our companion devilworshippers were mostly college and preparatory stu dents looking for a thrill now tangled in the net of fascination that the cult spun round its devotees but a few of them were simply vicious while others turned to demonolatry because they had lost faith in god one of these was marescha nurmi the girl who acted as the living altar she was my constant partner at the orgies and bit by bit i learned her history only nineteen she was the victim of a heart affection and the doctors gave her but a year to live when they pronounced sen tence she was almost prostrated then in desperation she turned to religion going every day to church and spending hours on her knees in private prayer but medi cal examination showed her illness was progressing and when she chanced to hear of herbules devilcult she came to it im too young too beautiful to die she told me as we lay locked in each others arms one night why should god take my life i never injured him all right if he wont have me satan will hell give me life and happiness and power let me live for years and years keep me young and beautiful when all these snivelling christian girls are old and faded what do i care if i go to hell to pay for it ill take my heaven here on earth and when the bills presented i wont welch theres an old saying that each time god makes a beautiful woman the devil opens a new page in his ledger he must have had to put in a whole set of books when marescha was converted to our cult she was attractive as a witch had no more conscience than a snake and positively burned with ardor to do evil night after night she brought new converts to the cult sometimes young men some times girls come on you little fool i heard her urge a girl who shrank from the wild orgy following initiation take off your robe thats what were here for this is our religion the oldest in the world its revolt against the goodygood ies revolt against the narrowness of god we live for pleasure and unbridled pas sion instead of abnegation and renuncia tionlife and love and pleasure in a world of vivid scarlet instead of fear and dreariness in a world all cold and gray thats our creed and faith were set apart were marked for pleasure we wor shippers of satan incense of abomination tiens the lady was a competent sales woman de grandin murmured did she realize her dreams the laugh that prefaced baldersons reply was like the echo of a chuckle in a vaulted tomb i dont know if she got her moneys worth but certainly she paid he answered it was nearing graduation time and the celebrations were about to stop until the fall for it would be impossible to keep the farm house windows shuttered so theyd show no gleam of light especially with so many people on the roads in summer herbules had just completed invocation raised the chalice overhead and set it on mareschas breast when we saw her twitch convulsively the little whimpering ani malcries she always made when the climax of the obscene parody was reached gave way to a choked gasping and we saw the hand that clutched the altartable sudden ly relax she raised her head and stared around the chapel with a look that sent the chill of horror rippling through me then cried out in a strangled voice o lord be pitiful then she fell back on the coffinpall that draped the altar and her fingers dangled loosely on its edge her feet uncrossed and lay beside each other herbules was going on as if noth ing had happened but the woman who sat next to me let out a sudden wail look at her she screamed look at her face mareschas head had turned a little to one side and we saw her features in the altarcandles light her dark hair had come unbound and fell about her face as though it sought to hide it her eyes were not quite closed nor fully open for a thread of gray eyeball was visible between the long black lashes her mouth was partly open not as though she breathed through it but lax slack as though she were exhausted where a line of white defined the lower teeth we saw her tongue had fallen forward lying level with the full red lip somewhere in the rear of the chapel another womans voice shrilly pitched but controlled cried out shes dead there was a wave of movement in the worshippers chairs were overturned gowns rustled whispered questions buzzed like angry bees then the woman sitting next me scrcamed again this is no natural death no illness killed her shes been stricken dead for sacrilege shes sacrificed for our sinsfly fly be fore the wrath of god blasts all of us herbules stood at the altar facing us a mask as of some inner feeling of strange forbidden passions of things that raced on scurrying feet within his brain seemed to drop across his features his face seemed old and ancient yet at the same time ageless his eyes took on a glaze like polished agate he raised both hands above his head the fingers flexed like talons and laughed as if at some dark jest known only to himself whoso leaves the temple of his lord without weird tales partaking of this most unholy sacrament the same will satan cast aside defense less from the vengeance of an outraged god he cried then i knew karl erik herbules renegade christian priest brilliant schol ar poisoner of souls and votary of satan was mad as any tom o bedlam he stood there by the devils altar hurling curses at us threatening us with heavens vengeance casting an anathema upon us with such vile insults and filthy language as a fishwife would not dare to use but panic had the congregation by the throat they pushed and fought and scratched and bit like frenzied cats claw ing and slashing at one another till they gained the exit then rushing pellmell down the hill to their parked cars with out a backward look leaving herbules alone beside the altar he had raised to satan with the dead girl stretched upon it there was no chance that herbules would help he kept reciting passages from the black mass genuflecting to the altar filling and refilling the winecup and stuffing his mouth with the wafers meant to parody the host so trivers eldridge atkins and i took mareschas body to the river weighted it with win dowirons and dropped it in the water but the knots we tied must have been loose or else the weights were insufficient for as we turned to leave her body floated almost to the surface and one white arm raised above the rivers glassy face as though to wave a mute farewell it must have been a trick the current played as the tide bore her away but to us it seemed that her dead hand pointed to us each in turn certainly there was no doubt it bobbed four times above the rivers surface before the swirling waters sucked it out of sight youve probably heard garbled ru mors of what happened afterward the farmhouse burned that night and because there was no water to be had there was no salvage still a few things were not utterly destroyed and people in the neighborhood still wonder how those persian lamps and brazen candlesticks came to be in that deserted house herbules committed suicide that night and when the auditors went over his ac counts they found hed practically wrecked horton there was hardly a cent left for hed financed his whole grisly farce of devil worship with the money he embez zled the trustees made the losses good and gave up in disgust ours was the last class graduated they found mareschas body floating in the shrewsbury two days later and at first the coroner was sure shed been the victim of a murder for while the win dowweights had fallen off the cords that tied them were still knotted round her ankles when the autopsy disclosed shed not been drowned but had been put into the river after death from heart disease the mystery was deepened but until tonight only four people knew its answer now there are only three three monsieur de grandin asked thats right trivers atkins and eldridge are dead im still here and you and doctor trowbridge your figures are at fault my friend you forget we are physicians and your narrative was given us in confidence but see here i asked as the silence lengthened what is there about all this to make you want to kill yourself if youd been grown men when you joined these devilworshippers it would have been more serious but college boys are always in some sort of mischief and this all happened twenty years ago you say you are sincerely sorry for it and after all the leaders in the movement died so balderson broke through my moraliz ing with a short hard laugh men die w t incense of abomination more easily than memories doctor be sides yes monsieur besides de grandin prompted as our guest stared silently into the study fire do you believe the spirits of the dead the dead who are in hell or at least cut off from heavencan come back to plague the living he demanded de grandin brushed the ends of his small waxed mustache with that ges ture which always reminded me of a tom cat combing his whiskers you have ex perienced such a visitation i have so did the others mordieu how was it you may remember reading that ted eldridge hanged himself three days be fore it happened he met me on the street and i could see that he was almost frantic i saw marescha last night he told me in a frightened whisper marescha you must be off your rocker man we put her in the shrews bury and shes come back again re member the perfume of the candles and the incense herbules used in celebrating the black mass id come home from new york last night and was getting ready for a drink before i went to bed when i began to smell it at first i thought it was some fool trick that my senses played on me but the scent kept getting stronger it seemed as if i were back in that dreadful chapel with the tall black candles burning and the hellish in cense smoldering herbules in his red vestments and marescha lying naked on the altari could almost hear the chant ing of inverted prayers and the little whimpering noises that she made i gulped my drink down in two swallows and turned round she was standing there with water on her face and stream ing from her hair and her hands held out to me youre crazy as a goat i told him come have a drink he looked at me a moment then turned away walking quickly down the street and muttering to himself id not have thought so much about it if i hadnt read about his suicide next day and if stanley trivers hadnt called me on the telephone hear about ted eld ridge he asked the moment i had said hello when i told him id just read about it he demanded did you see him recently yes ran into him in broad street yesterday i answered seemed worried didnt he did he tell you anything about marescha say what is this i asked did he say anything to you yes he did and i thought he had a belfry full o bats theres not much doubt the poor old lad was cuckoo thats where youre mistaken bal derson according to the paper hed been dead for something like four hours when they found him that would have made it something like four oclock when he died so what so this i waked up at four oclock this morning and the room was positively stifling with the odor of the incense they used in the black chapel yeah i suppose you saw marescha too i did she was standing by my bed with water streaming from her face and body and tears were in her eyes i tried to talk him out of it tell him that it was a trick of his imagination stimulated by ted eldridges wild talk but he insisted that hed really seen her two days later he committed suicide don atkins followed i didnt talk w t weird tales with him before he shot himself but ill wager that he saw her too and smelled that devils incense de grandin looked at me with up raised brows then shook his head to cau tion silence ere he turned to face our guest and you monsieur he asked yes i too don killed himself some time in early afternoon and i was home that day id say that it was shortly after two for id lunched at the city club and come home to pack a bag and take a trip to nantakee i had the highboy open and was taking out some shirts when i began to notice a strange odor in the air but it wasnt strange for long as it grew stronger i recognized it as the scent of herbules incense it grew so strong that it was almost overpowering i stood there by the chest of drawers smelling the in creasing scent and determined that id not turn round you know how cole ridge puts it like one that on a lonesome roaddoth walk in fear and dreadand having once turned round walks onand turns no more his headbecause he knows a frightful fienddoth dose behind him tread the odor of the incense grew until i could have sworn somebody swung a cen ser right behind me then suddenly i heard the sound of falling water drip dripdrip it fell upon the floor drop by deliberate drop the suspense was more than i could bear and i wheeled about marescha stood behind me almost close enough to touch water trickled from the hair that hung in gleaming strands across her breast and shoulders it hung in little gleaming globules on her pale smooth skin ran in little rivulets across her forehead down her beautifully shaped legs made tiny puddles on the polished floor beside each slim bare foot i went almost sick with horror as i saw the knotted cords wed used to tie the windowweights on her still bound about her ankles water oozing from their coils she did not seem dead her lovely slen der body seemed as vital as when i had held it in my arms her full and mobile lips were red with rouge her eyes were neither set and staring nor expressionless but they were sad immeasurably sad they seemed to probe into my spirits very depths asking beseeching entreat ing and to make their plea more elo quent she slowly raised her lovely hands and held them out to me palms upward fingers slightly curled as though she be sought alms there was a faint resemblance to her bitter crooked smile upon her lips but it was so sad so hopelessly entreating that it almost made me weep to see it mar i began but the name stuck in my throat this couldnt be the body that id held against my heart those lips were not the lips id kissed a thou sand times this was no girl of flesh and blood marescha lay deep in a grave in shadow lawns cemetery had lain there almost twrenty years dust had filled those sad entreating eyes long before the col lege freshmen of this year were born the worms somewhere i had heard that if you called upon the trinity a ghost would vanish in the name of the father i began but it seemed as if a clap of thunder sounded in my ears what right have you to call upon the triune god a mighty voice seemed asking you who have mocked at heaven taken every sacred name in vain made a jest of every holy thinghow dare you invoke deity your sacrilegious lips cannot pronounce the sacred name and it was true i tried again but the words clogged in my throat i tried to force them out but only strangling inarticulacies sounded mareschas smile was almost pityingly incense of abomination tender but still she stood there pleading entreating begging me though what it was she wanted i could not divine i threw my arm across my eyes to shut the vision out but when i took it down she was still there and still the water dripped from her entreating hands ran in little courses from her danklyhanging hair fell drop by drop from the sopping cords that ringed her ankles i stumbled blindly from the house and walked the streets for hours presently i bought a paper and the head lines told me donald atkins had been found a suicide in his apartment when i reached my house again the incense still hung in the air but the vision of marescha was not there i drank al most a pint of brandy neat and fell across my bed when i recovered from my alcoholic stupor marescha stood beside me her great eyes luminous with tears her hands outstretched in mute entreaty shes been with me almost every wak ing instant since that night i drank myself into oblivion but every time i sobered she was standing by me id walk the streets for hours but every time i halted she would be there always silent always with her hands held out always with that look of supplication in her tearfilled eyes id rush at her and try to drive her off with blows and kicks she seemed to float away staying just outside my reach however savagely i ran at her and though i cursed her using every foul word i knew she never changed expression never showed resentment just stood and looked at me with sad imploring eyes always seeming to be begging me for something i cant endure it any longer gentle men tonight she stood beside me when i halted on north bridge and id have been at peace by now if youd not come along non there you are mistaken mon ami de grandin contradicted had you carried your intention out and leaped into the river you would have sealed your doom irrevocably instead of leaving her you would have joined her for eternity all right balderson asked rasping ly i suppose you have a better plan i think i have the little frenchman answered first i would suggest you let us give you sedatives you will not be troubled while you sleep and while you rest we shall be active shakespeare was right i said as we left our patient sleeping from a dose of chloral hydrate conscience does make cowards of us all the memory of that early indiscretion has haunted that quartet of worthless youngsters twenty years no wonder they kept seeing that poor girl after theyd thrown her so cal lously into the shrewsbury of all the heartless despicable things he emerged from a brown study long enough to interrupt and is your con science clean my friend what has my conscience to do with it i didnt throw a dead girl in the river i didnt précisément neither did the good costello yet both of you described the odor of that devils incense costello when he went to view the bodies of the suicides you when we halted monsieur baldersons attempt at selfdestruction were you also haunted by that scent or were you not i smelled it i responded frigidly but i wasnt haunted by it just what is it youre driving at that the odor of that incense or even the perception of the dead mareschas revenant is no optical illusion caused by guilty conscience it is my firm conviction that the apparition which appeared to these unfortunate young men was the weird tales earthbound spirit of a girl who begged a boon from them then you dont think that she haunted them because theyd thrown her body in the river entirely no i think she came to ask their help and in their fear and horror at beholding her they could not under stand her plea first one and then an other lashed with the scorpionwhip of an accusing conscience destroyed himself because he dared not look into her plead ing eyes thinking they accused him of mistreating her poor body when all the pauvre belle créature asked was that they help her to secure release from her earth bound condition why should she have appealed to them in all that congregation of benighted worshippers of evil she knew them best they saw her die they gave her body sepulture one of them at least had been her lover and was presumably bound to her by ties of mutual passion she was most strongly in their minds and memo ries it was but natural that she should appeal to them for succor did not you notice one outstanding fact in all the testimonythe poor marescha appeared to them in turn looking not reproach fully but pleadingly her lips were held she might not put her plea in words she could but come to them as they had last beheld her entreat them by dumb show and hope that they would understand one by one they failed her one by one they failed to understand well is there anything that we can do about it i think there is come let us be upon our way where the deuce to the rectory of st chrysostom i would interview the reverend doctor bentley at this time of night mais certainement clergymen and doctors they have no privacy my friend surely you need not be told that the freshly lighted fire burned bright ly in the reverend peter bentleys study the blue smoke spiraled upward from the tips of our cigars the gray steam curled in fragrant clouds from the glasses of hot scotch which stood upon the coffeetable looking anything but clerical in redflannel bathrobe black pa jamas and red turkish slippers doctor bentley listened with surprizing tolerance to de grandins argument but it seems the poor girl died in mortal sin he murmured obviously more in sorrow than in righteous indig nation according to your statement her last frantic words called on the devil to fulfill his bargain o lord be piti ful précisément mon père but who can say her prayer was made to satan true those so bewildered misled followers of evil were wont to call the devil lord and master but is it not entirely possible that she repented and addressed her dying prayer to the real lord of the heaven and earth somewhere an english poet says of the lastminute prayer of a not whollyrighteous foxhunter who was un horsed and broke his sinful neck betwixt the stirrup and the groundi mercy asked mercy i found me i believe in all sincerity that her repentance was as true as that the thief upon the cross expressed that in the last dread moment she perceived the grievous error of her ways and made at once con fession of sin and prayer for pity with her dying breath but she had bent the knee at satans shrine with her fair bodythat body which was given her to wear as if it were a garment to the greater glory of the lord she parodied the sacred faircloth of the incense of abomination altar by such things she had cut herself adrift she had put herself beyond com munion with the righteous which is the blessèd company of all the faithful there was no priest to shrive her sin encumbered soul no one to read words of forgiveness and redemption above her lifeless clay until some one of her com panions in iniquity will perform the serv ice of contrition for her until the office for the burial of christian dead is read above her grave she lies excommunicate and earthbound she cannot even expiate her faults in purgatory till forgiveness of sins has been formally pronounced sin cerely repentant hell is not for her un shrived and with no formal statement of conditional forgiveness she cannot quit the earth but must wander here among the scenes of her brief and sadly misspent life do we dare withhold our hands to save her from a fate like that doctor bentley sipped thoughtfully at his hot scotch there may be something in your theory he admitted im not especially strong on doctrine but i cant believe the fathers of the early church were the crude nincompoops some of our modern theologians call them they preached posthumous absolution and there are instances recorded where ex communicated persons who had hovered round the scenes theyd known in life were given rest and peace when absolu tion was pronounced above their graves tell me is this balderson sincerely sorry for his misdeeds i could swear it mon père then bring him to the chapel in the morning if he will make confession and declare sincere repentance then submit himself to holy baptism ill do what you request its rather mediæval but id hate to think that im so modern that i would not take a chance to save two souls the penitential service in the chapel of the intercession was a brief but most impressive one only balderson i and de grandin occupied the pews with doctor bentley in his stole and cassock but without his surplice at the little altar we have followed too much the devices and desires of our own hearts we have offended against thy holy laws remember not lord our offenses nor the offenses of our forefathers neither take thou vengeance of our sins we ac knowledge and bewail our manifold sins and wickednesses the memory of them is grievous unto us the burden of them is intolerable after absolution followed the short service ordered for the baptism of adults then we set out for shadow lawns now doctor bentley wore his full ca nonicals and his surplice glinted almost whiter than the snow that wrapped the mounded graves as he paused beside an unmarked hillock in the nurmi family plot slowly he began in that low full voice with which he fills a great church to its farthest corner i am the resur rection and the life saith the lord he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live it was one of those still winter days quieter than an afternoon in august for no chirp of bird or whir of insect sounded no breath of breeze disturbed the ever greens yet as he read the opening sen tence of the office for the burial of the dead a low wail sounded in the copse of yew and hemlock on the hill as though a sudden wind moaned in the branches and i stiffened as a scent was borne across the snowcapped grave mounds incense yet not exactly incense either there was an undertone of fetor in it a faint distinctly charnel smell balderson was trembling and despite myself i flinched weird tales but doctor bentley and de grandin gave no sign of recognition thou knowest lord the secrets of our hearts shut not thy merciful ears to our prayer but spare us lord most holy intoned the clergyman and amen said jules de grandin firmly as the prayer concluded the æolian wailing in the evergreens died to a sobbing low clamation as doc tor bentley traced in sand a cross upon the snowcapped grave declaring unto almighty god we commend the soul of our departed sister and we commit her body to the ground earth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust in the sure and certain hope of the resurrection into eter nal life and now there was no odor of corrup tion in the ghostly perfume but the clean inspiring scent of frankincense redolent of worship at a thousand consecrated altars as the last amen was said and doctor bentley turned away i could have sworn i heard a gentle slapping sound and saw the blond hairs of de grandins small mustache bend inward as though a pair of lips invisible to me had kissed him on the mouth doctor bentley dined with us that night and over coffee and liqueurs we discussed the case it was a fine thing you did the cleric told de grandin six men in seven would have sent him packing and bid him work out his salvationor damna tionfor himself theres an essential nastiness in devilworship which is re volting to the average man not to men tion its abysmal wickedness tiens who of us can judge anothers wickedness the little frenchman an swered the young man was repentant and repentance is the purchase price of heavenly forgiveness besidesa look of strain like a nostalgic longing came into his eyesbefore the altar of a con vent in la belle france kneels one whom i have loved as i can never love another in this life ceaselessly except the little time she sleeps she makes prayer and intercession for a sinful world could i hold fast the memory of our love if i refused to match in works the prayer she makes in faith eh bien mon père my inclination was to give him a smart kick in the posterior to bid him go and sin no more but sinfully or otherwise to go ha but i am strong me i overcame that inclination the earnestness of his expression faded and an impish grin replaced it as he poured a liberal potion of napoléon in his brandysnifler jules de grandin he apostrophized himself you have acted like a true man you have overcome your natural desires you have kept the faith

tickets for months her slender right hand readied across the table to him im terribly sorry charles but helen has been after me for weeks to go and dmitris evenings are always thursdays ethredge grimaced i think its rath er silly of you twothis thrill visit to an obvious charlatan mary shook her head helen stacey forbes doesnt think dmitri a charlatan she swears by the manclaims hes done wonders for ronny ethredge laughed dmitri not a char latan with his halfbaked parlor magic and that movingpicture brand of mysti cism he exudes ive heard all about him doc hanlon says that if he isnt exposed pretty soon therell be a major rabies epi demic among our local psychiatry for a moment mary roberts did not reply but sat quietly her delicately oval face profiled her wideset limpid eyes thoughtful as she gazed musingly through the irongrilled window at the row of dwarf evergreens in their stone window box beneath the sill discreetly from its palmhidden sound shell on the mezza nine the hotels string quintet began to play a strauss waltz abruptly mary turned back to her fiancé a strange little smile trembling on her lips oh charles i wish that i could be so sure yes youre

all right its been diag nosed as such several times within the past year why but charles ethredge was not really listening he was recalling some of the vague ugly stories he had heard in re cent months of dmitri vassilievitch tu linstories which could not all be put down to professional jealousy and curi ously he was thinking of the twenty yearsdead tsarevitch and of a mad monk named gregori rasputin the spider and the flies and the man is a perfect ghoul about money you know most of the people here mary you wouldnt say that any were really poor would you mary roberts looked about this room in which she sat it was a long room ex tending the full length of the second floor of a brownstone solidly aristocratic house obviously two interior walls had been demolished to provide the single large chamber the wall to marys left abutting the adjoining house was blank red velvet drapes covered the windows mary knew that it was dmitris voice yet it sounded millions of miles away weird tales at the ends of the room three doors ir regularly spaced along the righthand wall led into the secondfloor corridor a ponderous oaken table and chair stood close to the drapes at one end of the room about sixty foldingchairs were ar ranged in orderly rows facing these grim ly utilitarian furnishings perhaps thirty persons the great majority of whom were women sat in small selfconscious groups about the room talking among them selves in low tones occasionally someone laughednervous laughter that was quickly suppressed dmitris evenings mary roberts sus pected were not particularly pleasant affairs mary knew these people one or two were really ill several were suffering from neuroses a few were crackpot fad dists but the majority were merely out for a thrill and all were wealthy the man dmitri mary decided as she looked about must be even if a charla tan certainly a personality she turned with a wry smile to her friend this gathering surely makes me feel like a poor little churchmouse she ad mitted ruefully father was never a financial giant you know helen helen staceyforbes smiled reassur ingly money cant buy character and breed ing my dear i see old mortimer dunlop up there in the second row you are wel come in homes hes never seen and never will seeexcept from the street damned old bucketshop pirate have you heard the rumor that hes full of carcinoma theyre giving him from six to nine months to live that must be why hes here some ones told him about dmitri mary gasped and people believe that dmitri can cure carcinoma why itscharles said only the other day that dmitri was merely a halfcracked psychia trist whos had rather spectacular luck with a few rich patients imaginary ail ments but carcinoma gravely helen staceyforbes shook her head dmitris far greater than his enemies will admit they call him a superpsychologist a faithhealer and they laugh at him and threaten him but the fact remains that his methods suc ceed he achieves cures impossible cures miraculous cures i know because hes the only man who can stop ronnys hemorrhages at five thousand dollars a treatment five thousand dollars helen laughed a dry bitter little laugh believe me dmitri is a monster not a man mortimer dunlop will have to pay dearly for his carcinoma cure the words sent an odd little shudder racing along marys spine for obvious ly helen staceyforbes believed believed implicitly that dmitri could curecancer suddenly then the room was silent the door at the upper end of the cham ber had opened a man had entered in the abrupt stillness the man small selfeffacing bearing in his hands a large lacquered tray walked to the oaken table and arranged upon it several articles a halfdollar a pair of pliers a penny box of matches a smallcaliber automatic pistol a tenounce drinkingglass a tin kling pitcher of icewater and a battered gasoline blowtorch a curious incom prehensible array the little man left the room the babble of nervous voices began again as suddenly stopped when the door re opened and a monstrosity entered the man was huge at least six feet three inches tall he was as tremendous horizontally as vertically a mountain of flesh swathed in a silken loungingrobe he slowly walked to the table and settled grunting into the big oaken chair in the thing on the floor stantly immobile he surveyed the room through small coalblack eyes set close together in a pastywhite face obscene of body and countenance his forehead was nevertheless magnificent but his scalp even to the sides of his head was utterly bald beneath the table his pillar like ankles showed whitely above gargan tuan houseslippers thisthis mary roberts knew was dmitri leisurely the monster poured a glass of water and took a tentative sip the glass looking no larger than a jigger in his tre mendous flabby hand an expression that might have been a smileor a leer rippled momentarily across his faten gulfed features revealed an instants glimpse of startlingly white teeth he began to speak i see a number of new faces before me today he began in a voice incongru ously almost shockingly vibrant and beautiful enrico carusos speaking voice mary thought suddenly must have sound ed like thatand for the benefit of those who are not already familiar with my theories i will repeat briefly my con ception of the function of the will in the treatment of disease he paused sipped meagerly from his glass of icewater then he went on his speech only faintly stilted only faintly revealing him a man to whom english was an acquired language speaking in the philosophicalnot the chemicalsense it is my belief that there is but one fundamental element abstract mind of course that which we term matter is in the last analysis energy there is no such thing as matter except as a manifestation of energy yet it is quite obvious or it should be obvious at any rate that mindthat attribute which we wrongfully confuse with conscious nessis totally independent of matter a man dies

your carcinoma i will leave you the poorer man by half your fortune before you are cured that pros pect at least you can understand mortimer dunlop his seamed face livid with rage got hastily to his feet and strode to the center door he jerked the door open slammed it behind him as he stormed from the room unperturbed dmitri continued mind came before matter mind is the great motivator mind can conceive matter matter cannot conceive anything even itself it is evident to any person who care fully considers these conclusions that in each one of us exists a spark part and parcel of that great intangible will which created all things but this reasoning in variably leads to a conclusion so tremen weird tales dous that the human consciousness except in rare instances rejects it the conclusion is plain the unfet tered will by and of itself can work miracles move mountains create and de stroy listen carefully for coué and pavlov and your own j b watson were closer to the truth than they knew i pick up this coin and i place it upon my wrist so now i suggest to myself that it is very hot but my conscious knows that it is not hot and so i merely appear to myself and to you all a trifle foolish nevertheless any hypnotist can sug gest to a prehypnotized subject that the coin is indeed hot and the subjects flesh will blister if touched with this same cold coin now i will call my servant placing his two enormous shapeless hands on the table dmitri heaved himself to his feet and a tremendous bel low issued from his barrellike chest that summons though the words were lost in a gulf of sound was unmistakable and presently the door opened and the little man prim and neat and wholly a colorless personality entered yes master dmitri stood beside the table his right hand resting heavily on the polished oak sit down little stepan the small man the ghost of a pleased smile on his peasant face sat down prim ly in the oaken chair and looked about the room with childlike pleasure ob viously he was enjoying to the uttermost his small moment you would prefer the sleep little one it is not necessary we have been through this experiment many times to gether you and i i would prefer the sleep master the little man said with a slight shudder despite myself my eyes flinch from the flame very well dmitris voice was casual and low relax little one and sleep sleep soundly he turned from his servant and picked up the fiftycent piece turning it over and over in the fingers of his left hand he began to speak slowly i have told this subjects subconscious that its body is invulnerable to physical injury watch the little man was sitting erect in the massive chair his eyes were closed his face immobile dmitri stooped lifted an arm let it fall you are not yet sleeping soundly stepan relax and sleepsleep slowly the muscles in the little mans face loosened slowly his mouth drooped half open small bubbles of mucus ap peared at the comers of his lips dmitri seemed satisfied quietly sooth ingly he spoke can you hear me the mans lips moved i can hear you who am i the answer came slowly without in flection you are the voice that speaks from beyond the darkness dmitri loomed above the chair you remember the truths that i have taught you master i remember you believe master i believe you have told me that you are infallible dmitri straightened triumphantly and surveyed his silent audience suddenly then a roaring streamer of bluish flame lanced across the room dmitri had set the gasoline torch alight a woman was babbling hysterically but above the steady moan of the flame dmitri said loudly there is no cause for alarm now observe closely i am the thing on the floor going to go far beyond the ordinary hypnotists procedure he carefully picked up with the pliers the fiftycent piece for a long moment he let the moaning flame play on the coin until both coin and pliertips glowed angrily calmly without warning he dropped the burning coin on his servants naked wrist a woman screamed but then gasps of relief eddied from the tense audience for although the glowing whiteness of the coin had scarcely begun to fade into cherryred the man stepan had shown no sign that he felt pain there was no stench of burning flesh in the room even the fine hairs on the back of the servants wrist hairs that touched and curled deli cately above the burning coin showed not the slightest sign of singeing dmitris face was an obese smirk in order that you may be convinced that this is neither illusion nor trickery he grunted watch carefully he tapped the coin with the pliers knocking it from the mans wrist to the floor around the coins glowing rim smoke began to rise still smirking dmitri poured a half glass of icewater on the redhot coin and the water hissed and fumed as it struck the incandescent metal there was a little puff of thick smoke from the burning wood and now the coin was cold cold and black and seared no scar marked the servants white wrist dmitri rubbed his great shapeless hands together and shuddering mary roberts watched him for she knew in stinctively that this was indeed no trick ery abruptly dmitri lifted the roaring torch thrust its fierce blast full in his servants face held it there for a moment that seemed an eternity then he turned a valve and the hot flame died though the man stepans face was streaked with carbon soot the flesh was smooth and unharmed as though the blue flame had never been dmitri looked at his guests and chuckled one more test he boomed then and we will turn to more pleasant things believe me when i tell you that these hor rors are necessary if you would have faith in me he picked up the small auto matic pistol will someone examine this weapon assure you all that it is fully loaded no one offered to touch the gun dmitri shrugged do not doubt me the weapon is loaded and with lethal ammunition he wheeled and for an instant the gun hammered rapidly and on the breast of his servants shirt over the heart there appeared suddenly a little cluster of blackedged holes beneath whidi the white flesh gleamed un marked dmitri put down the gun and rubbed his hands together affably should anyone care to examine the back of that chair he will find all the bullets i have just fired together with a great many others fired in previous ex periments he stooped over his still pallidfaced servant you may awaken now little one then to the horror ridden group before him there will be refreshments and music immediately downstairs i will mingle among you and you may ask me any questions you wish stepan the slight wholly undistin guishedappearing servant had risen from the chair and was holding wide the door slowly regally his master walked from the room weird tales the hypnotic lamp you really must meet him mary heshes such an overwhelming personality and it would be rude really to avoid him now see hes looking to ward us casually mary roberts turned her head across the long expanse of this almost flamboyantly oriental downstairs room in which dmitris guests had assembled she saw the man he was seated in a massive ivoryarmed dragonfooted chair and he was talking to a group of three or four women but he was looking be yond them speculatively at mary helen im afraid of him heshes evilblasphemous helen staceyforbes only laughed blasphemous she echoed nonsense hes only years ahead of his time never fearhis interest in you will vanish as soon as he learns that you cant pay his outrageous fees she was already marys arm linked in her ownthreading her way through the chatting throng the colossus as they approached ab ruptly cut short his conversation with the group of admiring ladies and turned his flabby bulk toward them they are thrillseekers miss stacey forbes he exclaimed petulantly still i have made appointments with two of them but how is your brother ron ald and who is your friend dmitrimary roberts helen sta ceyforbes said formally miss roberts is the daughter of the honorable james roberts ronald is well he is very careful not to endanger himself dmitri chuckled ronald is being very careful eh well wellbut acci dents sometimes happenand then there is only dimitri he stared fixedly at mary you are very beautiful my child our police commissioner ethredge is a fortunate manindeed he is mary roberts flushed i was im pressed by your demonstration she said hastily it wasspectacular he lifted a monstrous shapeless paw histrionics he said flatly my real work does not deal with such fireworks would you be convinced are you in every respect sound and well mary tried to repress the shudder of aversion that crept through her as she looked at the man i am in perfect health she said firmly dmitri looked down at his great soft hands then he spoke as it were casually to helen staceyforbes i have wantedsince your brother came to me a year agoto examine you as well you come from an old family should you marry it is possible that you would transmit to your children the hemo philia from which he suffers today is a propitious day your friend can accom pany us while i interrogate you then should she need me at some future time she would not fear me as she does now helen staceyforbes face was grave i had thoughtof coming to you she admitted perhapsif miss roberts is willing mary objected only faintly she was wondering if perhaps helen had not re ally brought her here bccause she feared to be alone with this man theguests dmitri glanced about the room heaved himself ponderously to his feet the guests he exclaimed we will be but a few minutes those in need of me will wait the others are better gone come the chamber into which dmitri ush ered the two young women was a small room almost monastically fur nished there was a large table and the thing on the floor dmitris usual massive chair several other smaller chairs were scattered hap hazardly about a faded strip of carpet ing ran diagonally from the door toward the table there were no pictures no bookcases or books no filingcabinet or desk a telephone rested at one end of the table close beside an ambiguity that save for its grotesquely large bulb full of an uncommon multiplicity of filaments and several oddly shaped and curiously perforated metal vaneslooked like an unshaded desklamp dmitri lowered himself into his tre mendous chair sit down he directed abruptly compose yourselves you miss roberts may watch this experiment it is in no way new yet it is always fasci nating notice this lamp it is so designed that it emits whorls of multicolored light which move according to a recurrent pat tern somewhat in the manner of a pin wheel his hands hidden beneath the table touched a concealed switch and the odd looking lamp began to glow in all its many filaments while simultaneously the complexity of tiny vanes began to revolve slowly at first and then faster and faster until they had attained a maximum veloc ity beyond which there was no further acceleration and as the filaments within the lamp gradually warmed mary real ized that they gave off light of many colors as varied and as beautiful as the spectrum seen in rainbows colors which moved and changed in a weirdly hyp notic sequence of patterns observe the lamp miss stacey forbes dmitri said in a calm conversa tional tone do not trouble to think merely observe the lampsee how the colors melt and run together and repeat themselves again abruptly the ceiling light was extin guished and mary roberts gasped at the unearthly beauty of the whirling lights even beneath the cold glow of the mazda lamp they had been a strange symphony but now glowing and whirl ing like a mighty nebula of spinning suns her eyes were riveted upon them they seemed to draw her toward them to suck her into themselves observe the lights miss stacey forbes mary knew that it was dmitris voice yet it sounded billions of miles away and curiously she believed for a fleeting instant that there was a new note in that slumbrous whispera hint of exultation but the thought vanished in its second of birth lost amid the maze of spinning lightsthe lights that were too too beautiful the stolen jewels mrs gregory luce stood surveying herself with pardonable satisfaction in the almostcomplete circle of full length chromiumframed mirrors that glittered their utilitarian splendor in a corner of her bedroom it was well she was reflecting that the electricblue gown fitted her with wrinkleless perfection that her hair was a miracle even francois had seldom achieved today was her tenth wedding anniversary and tonight greg ory was taking her to hear tristan and isolde with sophisticated grace she returned to her dressingtable and seated herself in her walk languid and selfappreciative though it had been there was neverthe less a vague essence reminiscent of mary roberts priscilla luce might almost have been a prophetic vision of mary as she would some day betheir mothers were sisters only priscilla was a little more the cautious type than was mary priscilla had selected her husband with an eye to the future she did not wholly approve of charles ethredge otherwise the two young women were very much alike weird tales slowly then priscilla luce smiled surprizingly her marriage had turned out an emotional as well as a financial success she was truly grateful to and in love with gregory now there had been an un suspected tinge of romanticism in him after all on their wedding day he had given her his grandmothers emerald brooch set with its great flawless square cut stoneand the ruby and emerald tiara and today he had brought her a cartier bracelet also of cool green em eralds languidly she arose and walked to the south wall here between the two win dows hung a single exquisite little etch ing priscilla luce reached up swung the etching back on cleverly concealed hinges twirled the combination of the bluedsteel wallsafe in the moment that she reached inside the tiny safe priscilla luce knew that someone other than herself had handled the little leatherbound jewelcases within for a moment she stood stockstill then carefully she began to remove the jewelcases opening and examining each one when she had finished she walked to the dressingtable and sat down she knew that she would not tell gregory tonight she would wear the cartier brace let and he would not know his evening would not be spoiled but she would have to tell him tomorrow and they would have to decide what to do the emerald brooch and the priceless old tiara were gone and very clearly priscilla luce real ized that the th ief was someone they knew someone they trusted she stared at herself in the mirror she was beginning to feel frightened beginning to feel a sick anticipatory dread ethredge hears startling news when police commissioner charles b ethredge received priscilla luces enigmatic and disturbingly urgent telephone call he lost no time in getting to the vermont marble and bethlehem steel palace the luce millions had built ten years before for gregory luces young bride it concerns mary ter ribly his fiancées cousin had said her voice taut and strange but do not under any circumstances tell her that i have called you priscilla luce met him in the library she greeted him with grave gratitude as soon as they were seated she began almost bruskly to speak i called you charles because you are both influential and discreet and because you are vitally concerned in what i have to say charles do you know anything of a psychiatrist who came to town about fourteen months agoa man who calls himself dmitri ethredge nodded why yes i have heard of him mary attended one of his thursday evenings a week or two ago with helen stacey forbes helen is enthusiastic about what he seems to have done for ronald priscilla luce smiled thinly it seems strange that ronald was never ill until after he met this dmitri do you know anything more about the man yes ethredge grunted i do dmitri is a sensationalist the more conservative psychiatrists have tried to convict him of extortion of making messianic and un fulfillable promises of other unethical and even criminal practises as he is still practising their attempts needless to say have all failed priscilla luce nodded what did mary say about him ethredge grinned very little said that she was amused w t the thing on the floor that perhaps beneath all his stage trap pings the man might even be competent thats all nervously priscilla luce leaned for ward charles obviously you dont know that mary has been after me these past two weeks to go to dmitris with her she hasnt asked me merely a few times shes asked me incessantly ive always refusedgregory as you know would disapproveand since last friday she hasnt asked me once but last thursday evening she went again to dmitris did you know ethredges mouth was grim i didnt no priscilla luce leaned forward and put her hands pleadingly on charles eth redges lean strong wrists this is going to be hard terribly hard to tell you and please charles please understand that i have not come to you because you are marys fiancé i am not as despicable as that i have come to you because you are the commissioner of police because if anyone can you can help her in gods name ethredge whispered what is wrong tell me the womans face was drawn with misery between thursday last and last night grandma luces brooch and tiara were stolen from my wallsafe only two per sons know the combination to that safe and of those two persons gregory is automatically absolved you suspectmary it was not a question it was a statementflat life less and in ethredges heart was a slow growing horror for this thing mary could never have done yet he knew knew already that her hands had taken the jewels yes gregory has had private detec tivesfrom philadelphia marys finger prints there was silence in that room then while ethredge stared at priscilla luces slender patrician hands still clasping his wrists it was not in mary to do this thing he said at last quietly there must be some other explanation however incred ible mary could never steal the small hands touching his wrists trembled perhaps i was wrong about you and mary priscilla luce said softly i was arrogantand ambitious for her i am sorry suddenly her eyes welled with tears the great drops falling like glistening diamonds on ethredges hands ethredge asks help peters come to my apartment ive got to talk to you detectivelieutenant peters of the hom icide squad sitting with his squaretoed boots outsplayed on the scarred top of his detectivebureau desk listened his face expressionless as stone to the taut nerve racked voice of his chief calmly he spoke o k commissioner ill be right out carefully leaning forward from his hips he set the telephone down for an instant he did not move then he swung his feet to the floor and stood erect his face as he crossed the room toward the coatrack was still blankly impassive yet within his skull his thoughts were seething through an instinct born of long association and mutual trust he knew that the commissioner had at last de cided to confide in him between the commissioner and his subordinate there existed a peculiarand by most persons unsuspectedfriendship w t weird tales the distance to ethredges home was not great and peters driving a police sedan covered it quickly the commis sioner when he rang let him in at once definitely peters saw at once ethredge looked ill but peters knew too that something far less easily defined than mere illness had kept the commission er away from his desk these past few days drink ethredge gestured toward a nest of bottles and an array of glasses conveniently at hand thanks peters helped himself to two ounces of whisky downed it neat the men sat down peters ethredge began abruptly im up against something that i cant fight alone and i cant use the police because ive no case that would convince a jury id be thought mad also mary is involved and her connection with this affair must never become public knowl edge peters nodded better tell me every thing commissioner peters can a hypnotist cure disease in another man through subconscious sug gestion can an adept so control his sub jects mind that that subject becomes his virtual slave even to the extent of com mitting a theft can a hypnotist cause his subject to suffer and die from a dis ease which heretofore has not threatened him peters looked thoughtfully at the nest of bottles sounds like dmitri yes ethredge exclaimed hoarsely it is dmitri damn him leisurely the detectivelieutenant rose poured a halfdrink of ambercolored whisky sat down again commissioner hypnosis the powers of the will the depths of the subcon scious are to a great extent unknowns and limitless unknowns i cannot say that i would definitely disbelieve anything anything at all you might tell me con cerning them dmitri certainly i be lieve the stories ive heard about dmitri tales of men dying of loathsome diseases after willing him their moneytales of strange thefts and inexplicable gifts of which he seems invariably the benefi ciary ethredge leaned forward yet we can do nothinglegally peters shook his head no nothing legally ethredge spread out his hands and looked helplessly at them peters i went to see the man he has mary under his control ive been watch ing her following her about for days she doesnt know and im tired tired almost to death ive had to do it all my self i dared trust no one peters a week ago mary took her cousin priscilla luces jewels and brought them to dmitri god knows what hes done with them since then shes been trying to persuade mrs leedsarthur leeds widowto go to dmitris with her god i know that the mans a monster yet im helpless against him ethredge paused and slowly his hands knotted into fists relaxed peters when i went to see him he laughed at me more he said that so long as mary had access to wealthy homes he would continue to use her and that if i so much as attempted to interfere with him he would make her suffer horribly she was my vulnerability he told me and she was his chattel peters lifted his drink to his lips a venomous fellow he said softly and a strategist as well yes ethredge muttered im afraid that he can do everything he says peters set down the small glass empty you are right undoubtedly he can do everything he says and yet we are the thing on the floor men and when men meet a poisonous serpent they squash it and we must squash dmitri as pitilessly he paused then slowly continued there might even be a certain poetic justice in the method by which this may most safely be done yes i think so i think that on thursday evening you and i will be included among dmitris guests and then we shall see what we shall see the spiders lair charles ethredge sat alone in dmitris small firstfloor consulting room he sat poised tensely on the very edge of his hard uncomfortable chair as the minutes slowly passed his fingers drummed now and again with a nerv ous jerky rhythm on the top of dmitris massive table occasionally he glanced swiftly about the barren room but there was little to attract his attention within that tiny chamber even the cryptic lamp in the center of the table was dark and lifeless and ethredge was not really con cerned with the room in which he sat his whole attention was focussed on the room adjoining the theatrically oriental reception chamber from which came faintly the sensuous sobbing of dmitris balalaika orchestra and the muffled mur muring of departing guests one by one the voices dwindled and at last even the music of the orchestra ceased there was the sound of brief confusion as the musicians packed their instruments and took their departure and then utter silence the door opened and dmitri wearing his invariable loungingrobe and slippers entered with slow waddling shuffle he crossed behind the table to his personal chair and carefully eased his flabby bulk into its capacious depths very well commissioner ethredge we are alone together as you requested my guests have gone my orchestra is already drinking vodka within some wine shop only my servant remains within the house you see that i am not afraid of you abruptly he paused for the door be hind ethredges shoulder had opened and a man had stepped swiftly into the room closing the door behind him dmitris cruel black eyes were suddenly wary who are you i recognize you you were among those at my demonstration butyou disappeared what are you do ing here peters grinned reassuringly at the com missioner spoke almost soothingly to dmitri there is a narrow space be tween your orchestra dais and the wall uncomfortable yet a sufficient hiding place who am i he shrugged slightly i amof the police afraid that you might not agree to grant us a joint audi ence i took the precaution of concealing myself for a moment dmitri sat still then his fat shoulders heaved in a billowing shrug and he spoke almost scornfully one or two or a dozen of your kind what does it matter with your mujik here to lend you courage commissioner what do you propose now the words were goading taunting and swiftly peters signed to ethredge to re main silent almost gently he murmured what do we propose now well dmitri we propose first that you release mary roberts from whatever enjoinments you have placed upon her subconscious he paused for the obese colossus was smiling suppose that i refuse peters literally purred his reply you are an intelligent man i assure you that the police of this country have devised extremely piquant methods of making a weird tales man suffer methods which we would not hesitate to employ upon you for an instant the pupils of dmitris eyes dilated then his voice blandly im passive he said you forget that even if i would i could not in her absence re lease maty roberts subconscious i am not a storybook magician and i cannot command her conscious to come here she will not come here again except of her own free will unless she bringsanother with her and that will be only on a thursday she did not come tonight would you wait here seven days for her to present herself slowly peters smiled mary roberts at commissioner ethredges request is waiting in a small restaurant not far from here i will telephone her he rose took a step toward the table the colossus seemed to swell in his chair like an infuriated toad stop his chest heaved and from his cavernous interior there issued a halfshriek half bellow that beat in that small room like the scream of an ape stepan stepan peters hand flicked to his hip but dmitri only smiled smiled and shook his monstrous head your weapon will be of no avail against my stepan stepan abruptly the door opened and the small wholly selfeffacing stepan entered glanced imperturbably about he carried dmitris small automatic pistol in his right hand and instinctively peters fingers moved again toward his hip then paused helplessly as his mind re called with sudden sharp vividness the incredible demonstration he had wit nessed only a brief hour before too well he knew that his gun was indeed power less to harm stepan dmitri was grinning broadly watch these men closely stepan and usher them from my house should they attempt any tricks do not hesitate to shoot after all they are here against my will and they have threatened me the servant stepan only a slight tinge of color in his cheeks revealing that he felt any interest whatever in the proceed ings gestured with the small automatic and in that instant peters whipped to the floor his hands grasped the end of the strip of carpet on which stepan stood his body jerked backward his arms wildly flailing stepan plunged to his hands and knees the automatic skittered across the floor and suddenly dmitri half lifting himself from his chair was babbling unintelli gible fearridden words ethredge as peters rose to his feet had pounced upon the outsplayed servant pinioning him to the floor peters his right hand at his hip swung alertly toward dmitri ivegot him peters ethredge gasped the little man beneath him no match for the commissioners sinewy strength and chill shuddery horror ab ruptly swept him as he realized that this man he touched this squirming writhing thing beneath his hands was invulnerable to lead or to flame a being that could be overpowered but that could not be de stroyed whatll i do with him grimly peters snarled hold on to him ill handle this deathridden dia betic his service automatic a bluesteel men ace in his right hand peters walked to the table with his left hand he lifted the receiver from the telephone and dialed a number warily he stooped over the table as he spoke presently with mary roberts then he cradled the receiver and sat down facing the colossus she will come here at once seemingly dmitri had collapsed his shapeless hands lay limply on the chair the thing on the floor arms his great chest heaved gulpingly only the snaky brightness in his darting ebon eyes warned peters that his tremen dous brain was thinking planning calcu lating with chainlightning rapidity the servant stepan was only spasmodically struggling peters spoke abruptly to ethredge when mary comes someone will have to admit her can you keep this devil covered while i go to the door ethredge crouching across the serv ants chest his knees crushing the mans shoulders against the floor nodded silence rolling on with interminable slowness gripped the room gradually the rattle of dmitris breathing was grow ing quiet he sat now in his chair like some obscene waiting idol his face an undecipherable mask from beyond the tightclosed door a bell faintly tinkled peters edged toward ethredge slipped his automatic into the commissioners outstretched hand then he was gone dmitri did not move a minute passed to ethredge it seemed as though all the suspense of myriad ages was bound up in that brief span then the door reopened and peters followed by mary roberts reentered the room marys fair oval face was a composite of bewilderment and apprehension in the instant that she glimpsed the tableau within the room her slender body trembled violently and the color drained from her face leaving it white as new paper but then her straight strong young spine stiffened and her firm little jaw set hard pale though she was she glanced inquiringly at eth redge charles she whispered shakily ethredge smiled he nodded toward dmitri bloated swollen hud dled inscrutably in his chair ill have to tell younow mary he said slowly try to understand on the night that you came here with helen staceyforbes dmitri ensnared you he cast aspell over you we have come here we have asked you to come here we are going to force him to release you mary staring at her sweetheart was frowning almost musingly she spoke i have hadterrible dreams she said her voice low dreams in which he told me to dostrange things dreams in which iobeyed him but i believed that they were only nightmares and yet though i loathed him i know that i have surrendered to the strangest im pulse to ask others to come here with me mrs arthur leeds ethredges eyes as he glanced at dmitri were suddenly cruel then gent ly he spoke again to mary we must free you now free you from dmitrifor ever but peters believes that you will have to go once more be neath his spell for a long moment mary stood there quiet then the words barely audible she breathed very well charles i am ready peters who until this moment had been standing hands in his jacket pockets with his back against the door advanced into the room stooped for the automatic in ethredges outstretched hand and dropped into one of the row of chairs that faced dmitris huge table very well dmitri he said gestur ing significantly with the automatic let us waste no more time proceed and understand clearly that if you attempt to trick me i will certainly kill you briefly the mens eyes met and clashed then with surprizing suddenness dmitri rolled his flaccid shoulders in an expres sive acquiescent shrug his loose lips split in a goodhumored leer shall i confess that i am beaten then he asked affably yes let it be so i begin to believe that i have in any weird tales case overestimated mary roberts value to me if you will sit across from me miss roberts and look fixedly at the lamp warningly peters exclaimed dont look directly at that thing commis sioner did a flicker of disappointment cross dmitris face peters as he moved from his chair to stand directly behind dmitri the muzzle of the automatic inches from dmitris silkswathed shoulders never knew the spider spins dmitris fat fingers touched a small button set beneath the edge of the table and instantly though peters forced himself not to look up he felt beating against his lowered eyelids the incredibly soothing incredibly beautiful monotony of whirling color produced by the fantastic lamp abruptly then the ceiling light went out except for the diabolically cadenced leaping reiteration of pinwheel color dancing in the center of the table like some chromatic dervish the room was dark grimly peters kept his eyes averted kept his gaze boring into dmitris black pillarlike silhouette slow seconds passed then dmitri spoke spoke in that vibrant beautiful voice of his that was like the chanting of a cathedral organ you are asleep maty roberts there was a moments pause warn ingly the police automatic in peters hand touched the sodden flesh at the base of dmitris neck through the stillness came marys re ply master i am asleep by not so much as a single involun tary shudder had dmitri betrayed even the slightest awareness of the cold gun muzzle yet peters knew that even now the man was planning calculating chance against chance who am i the words boomed like great mellow bass notes marys answer came unhesitatingly you are the voice that speaks from be yond the darkness you are the infal lible one peculiarly peters sensed that in that instant dmitri had reached a decision the strong resonant phrases rolled on you will forget the assignment that i have given you there was a pause and peters realized with a curious crawling anticipation that dmitri was gathering himself together concentrating himself upon himself ominously then the black words boomed let your nerves go mad and your muscles tense and writhe until death releases you damn you peters snarled the curse his gunmuzzle sloughed savagely into dmitris obese flesh yet the gun did not speak and dmitri wincing beneath the torturing steel chuckled i gambled that you would not fire he gasped his voice suddenly gloating and now we are no longer stalemated before i will consent to release mary roberts from the agony she endures you will promise me immunity and more than immunityyou will promise me pro tection henceforth take that cannon from my neck the ceiling light flashed up the whirl ing of the multicolored vanes slowed and died and as the eyes of ethredge and peters grew accustomed to the increased illumination within the room the two men felt their blood flow pause then run like icewater in their veins for mary roberts had toppled from her chair and now lay weirdly unnatur ally sprawled on the naked floor beside dmitris table her spine bent backward like a tightdrawn bow the slender heels the thing on the floor of her tiny shoes nearly touching her chestnut hair beneath her chic little hat her throat and jaw muscles stretched like oversharp violin strings her teeth and pink gums bared in a ghastly grin her breasts were rising and falling spasmod ically she breathed in choking rattling gasps the fair pale flesh of her oval face was purpling god ethredge stumbled to his feet stood swaying drunkenly his hands out stretched he had utterly forgotten the servant stepan for an instant the little man struggled to rise then sank back weakly the obscene colossus grinned do not fear she will live a long time her nerves will tire then she will relax for a moment she will breathe more easily then and as though the prophecy were a command marys body went suddenly horribly limp melted against the barren floor as though death had abruptly col lapsed every straining muscle only her gulping hurried breathing and the grad ual fading of the terrible purple conges tion from her face told that she was still alive mucus was beginning to run from her loosely open mouth ethredge took a slow uncertain step forward god he mumbled again then he found words babbling pleading words youdevil free her only free her and commissioner it was peters voice harsh rasping commissioner with a sudden gasping sob he paused for with the sharply reiterated exclama tion marys body had once more tensed knotted into a backwardbent bow more terrible to look upon than had she twisted and writhed dear god ethredge moaned he took a second wavering step forward and then peters found speech commissioner his voice was im placable steely stop do you know what you are doing in surrendering to thisbeast of hell you are dishonor ing yourself for ever you are promising him immunity to torture and murder and debaseyes for he has done all of these things ethredges lips were a twisted snarl peters i would promise him my soul to free mary dmitri was grinning grinning peters words were like the flicking of a rapier mary would loathe youif she knew mary would never permit this sacrifice of honor ethredge took another step forward he seemed not to have heard a little white pellet with sudden grim determination peters plunged his left hand deep in his breast pocket his right hand dropped the gun to the floor his right arm constricted about dmitris throat there was a small white pellet in the fin gers of his left hand dmitri he snarled this tablet can you guess what it isit smells of al monds the powerful biceps of his right arm tightened caught in that strangling em brace dmitri writhed weakly horribly his piglike eyes wildly staring peters face was inches above dmitris fearmaddened eyes the pellet moved closer to dmitris slavering gasping jaws just a touch against the tip of the tongue you attempted trickery dmitri had you not done that we might have drawn your fangs and let you live but now swiftly then he forced the bitter smelling pellet into dmitris widedis tended mouth crushed the mans jaws violently together weird tales the taste of almond was strong on dmitris tongue for a split second his eyes seemed bursting from their sockets a horrible retching moan welled from his saliva drcnched mouth blue veins leaped on his hairless temples then like a pin pricked balloon he collapsed his massive head rolled forward upon his flaccid chest he huddled there stilly in his chair the end of you dmitri peters was whispering the end of you and then he heard ethredges voice dazed with the horror he had undergone yet implacable now with heartbroken re solve we must kill him peters you are right mary would not have us sell honor even to save her ethredge his eyes unseeing his mind nearcrazed by suffering did not know that dmitri was already dead and yet dmitri is dead peters said softly his whole attention was focussed upon mary upon the small huddled figure that in the instant of dmitris passing had suddenly relaxed lay now in semi conscious exhaustion and in peters heart there leaped exultation for in his mind had been all along the strange weird conviction that the end of dmitri would bring release to those he had en slaved for peters knew that dmitri had instilled into the subconscious of his vic tims the belief that he was infallible the belief that he was a kind of god protect ing them shielding them curing them of their ills but now the mangod was dead and of necessity in each of his dupes the blind limitless sea of the sub conscious was rejecting the theories he had taught spewing out his broken im age obliterating him in disillusionment from the chasms of memory before peters eyes the unnatural tendency to convulsion that dmitri had instilled in mary roberts subconscious the cruel weapon he had implanted within the core of her being and goaded in terrorridden desperation into life had died in the in stant her subconscious became aware of dmitris passing had ceased as abruptly as though a circuit had been broken as completely as though an evil light had been extinguished peters stooping over mary now limp ly weakly relaxed slipped his strong right arm beneath her shoulders mur mured swift soothing words sanity he saw was flooding back into her eyes and then she looked toward and be yond ethredge and she screamedand screamed again peters eyes followed her rigid gaze and as he looked at the servant stepan his nerves crawled and the short hairs at the base of his neck bristled in an ecstasy of horror deargod in that second of unsurpassable horror there blazed across peters mind a strange kaleidoscope of tableaux tableaux that were all the same tableaux of the obese dmitri and the small selfeffacing stepan enacting a multitude of dmitris experi ments experiments in which invariably the small automatic hammered bullets into stepans chest the blowtorch flamed in stepans face hot coins were dropped with seeming harmlessness on stepans wrists that horror on the floor that horror that had been the servant stepan that horror that had in the moment of dmitris passing changed deargod for the fleshandblood face of the servant stepan had vanished and in its place there remained only nightmare only a flamecharred crimson skull the hor ror lay upon its back its arms outflung as it had lain while ethredge pinioned it down its jacket was open and the the thing on the floor exposed expanse of shirtfront was a sticky crimson smear deargod those bullets those hundreds of bul lets that dmitri must have fired during the months and years through stepans chest and somehow peters knew as he gazed through mercifully glazed eyes upon the horror outsplayed there that beneath the reddrenched shirt there re mained no shred of mortal flesh but only a bleeding bulletblasted hole and on stepans wrists peters saw the holes the great fireseared holes the charred circular holes the size of a half dollar deargod peters was babbling over and over inanely dimly while his brain reeled and his soul retched as he gazed upon the ghastly thing on the floor he yet realized that the same release that had in the instant of dmitris passing loosed mary roberts nerves and muscles from the deathladen throes of convulsion had also and in that same awful instant freed stepans subconscious from the enjoin ment that his body was invulnerable to physical injury and with that release had come stepans doomthe longde layed death that should have been his in the instant now perhaps years in the past that dmitri had first blasted a bullet through his heart in that moment peters was hardly a manhe was more an animal terrified near mad with horror he realized only vaguely that his hands were clenched into rigid fists that his heart was pounding with frantic rapidity he could feel his spine crawl and bristle sweat reeking with adrenal secretions leaped from his pores but warningly through waves of hor ror some tiny figment of his brain was reiterating the command dont let go of yourself dont let your nerve break slowly then he tore his gaze away from that horror on the floor and gradually his vision cleared his brain resumed its functioning he had been close to madness he saw ethredge then standing close beside the table gazing at the horror at his feet swaying tottering drunkenly just as the commissioner would have reeled to the floor peters stumbled to his feet grasped the man guided him like a shambling cretin to a chair fumbled in the commissioners hip pocket for his whiskyflask dear lord peters whispered as he forced whisky into ethredges trembling mouth dear lord if this doesnt drive himdrive hermad that horrorthat horror on the floor but the hot burning stimulant was bringing color back into ethredges face swiftly peters turned to mary tilted her head back poured a staggering draft down her throat gently he lifted her up supported her to a chair where she sat dazedly mercifully she was in almost a comatose condition ethredge was beginning to find words that thingthatthing he was mum bling incisively then peters spoke commissioner youve got to get hold of yourself we must get the medical examiner here get hanlon and delaney and men from the medical association we must hush this affair up thank god we have influence thank god the hor rors dmitri has perpetrated on this man have been witnessed by many persons perhaps the story will bea private ex periment that failed and dmitri dead of heartfailure dmitri was after all diabetic and his heart was untrustworthy butwe cannot wait we must call han lon at once he moved toward the tele phone weird tales but dmitri ethredge whispered dmitridead of cyanide poisoning the medical examiner will know dmitri murdered peters turned his face as he slowly shook his head was enigmatic no commissioner remember that i once told you that there might even be a certain poetic justice in the manner by which dmitri might be most safely destroyed that pellet was harmless made of crushed almonds and flour dmitri was his own executioner he be lieved that he was tasting cyanide and so he died his own weapon the power of suggestion killed himjustly he was lifting the telephone to his ear but before he dialed the wellremem bered number he looked thoughtfully for a long moment at dmitri at the bloated repulsively hairless hulk that had once housed a brilliant utterly evil soul poor warped devil he softly mused he could treat and cure others by sugges tion but he could not treat himself and now he is dead well the short stubby fingers of his right hand were dialing the number and as he listened to the small reiterated grat ing sound of the whirling dial he real ized vaguely that ethredge had gone to mary roberts that ethredge was stoop ing over her comfortingly soothing her within his strong embracing arms dreadful sleep by jack williamson a thrilling tale a romantic and tragic tale a weirdscientific story of the awakening of the fearsome beings that lay in dreadful slumber under the antarctic ice and the weird doom that befell the world an initial apology seems due the reader of this history for i ronald dunbar am not a man of letters three of the books that bear my namethose entided antarcticana i ii and iiiare merely the necessary sci entific records of my various polar explo rations and the popular abridgment of them called an odyssey of the ice was no more than an effort which turned out very happily to wipe out the deficit of my third expedition it happens however that no accom plished literary historian was present to observe those mindcrushing events that made the year the most terrible in human history i am the only surviving witness to much of that hideously enig matic catastrophe despite my disqualifi cations therefore as well as the natural reluctance of an active man to spending some months confined to on unaccus tomed desk i feel it my duty to set down a plain simple account of what hap pened if without much literary embel lishment it will at least be accurate and clear the event of june december is already recognized to be the most astounding and terrifying phenomenon that ever overtook our world it was high noon over america on june when the dreadful sleep the shining siren fled away before him mocking elusive summer sun abruptly vanished and the chill blackness of a wintry midnight fell soundless but infinitely apalling at the same instant in the eastern hemisphere night was turned incredibly into day amid the stunned shock and panic that followed astronomers swiftly perceived that the earth had moved half around its orbit in a split heartbeat six months had somehow gone the christmas sea son fell unwarned upon a world too staggered and fearful for merriment for inexplicably the disaster had cost thousands of lives from office and home and street in that dazing instant the vic tims had abruptly vanished bewildered survivors found themselves addressing empty air or passing food to a vacant plate the vanished left no clue the bodies were never recovered near new york however which had suffered most heavily a sinister thing was found upon the jersey palisades lay a queer gray area of lifeless desolation and near its center where lovely alpine park had been was a wide circle of strange squat earthen mounds the mounds were swiftly crumbling but apprehensive explorers venturing into the unpleasant labyrinth of burrows weird tales beneath them found a few gruesome relics identified with the missing persons no single human fragment however had been found when the tunnels caved in the world has had no explanation of this amazing tragedy the astrophysicists it is true put their learned heads together called up the shades of einstein and minkowski and spoke sagely of a flaw in the spacetime continuum the press caught up their magic words and the whole planet was soon informed that it was a time fault which had made six months seem like the winking of an eye neither savants nor newspapers how ever could account for the vanished thou sands or explain the grisly mounds in that queerly devastated park upon the palisades i am the only surviving man who knows the actual cause of the time fault who experienced all the nerveshattering horror of those six lost months or who met face to face the incredible menace that stopped all the world i found cour age then to go ahead believing that the inherent interest of what i have to tell will make up for any lack of literary adornment the different doctor harding on the morning of february of fateful doctor aston harding came into my room at the aero club i was just three days returned from that seasons very successful polar flight clang orous new york still seemed a shining paradise and any old acquaintance a wel coming angel i greeted harding like a brotherbefore i discovered that he wanted me to fly him back to the ant arctic the very next week i put the answer to that in pretty plain words we cant do that harding theres just about six weeks of twilight left at the south pole before six months of winter set in i know what its like ive just come from there i ignored the set determination on his blank face im fed up with silence and ice and frostbitten feet what i want is jazz bands and my ice in a frosty glass and feet tapping on waxed hardwood sorry doctor but it simply cant be donenot this season now if you can wait until november harding set down the whisky soda i had mixed for him and rose deliberately to stand over my chair he was a tall man his broad shoulders a little stooped but powerful he had a ruddy skin and yellowish hair a few years older than i but still under forty he was already dis tinguished in both philanthropy and sci ence i had always liked harding for a quick generosity and a spirit of genuine fellow ship almost as much as i admired the girl he had married lovely jerry ware i was indebted to him as director of the planet research foundation for substan tial aid to my polar flights he had been a good friendand i was deeply shocked now to see the change in him his pale blue eyes fixed me with a penetration that i found disquieting and his low voice a new strange hardness in it rapped yes dunbar youre going to fly us to the polethis season his eyes always before so genially mild were suddenly sharp as gimlets an explorer you want fame you want to advance science you want money for another expedition youve got a price dunbarwhat is it a very rude reply was on my tongue but my respect for the old doctor hard ing my old friendship for jerry ware rose up in time to check the words and harding stabbed at me with an almost menacing forefinger dreadful sleep weve got the biggest proposition you ever had a nibble at dunbar his harsh voice crackled at me were going to reclaim antarctica were going to thaw the ice cap with atomic power he paused a moment to let that sink in his keen pale eyes boring into my face an invention of meriden bells his rasp went on you know him this is confidential dunbar i trust you weve formed a syndicate five of us my wife and i bell and tommy veeringand yourself at last i swallowed my amazement and thaw the ice i blurted harding you dont know what youre talking about ive spent years there remember what antarctica is five million square miles covered with ice up to a mile deep with temperatures seventy to a hundred below thawthat it can be done he rapped you talk to bell and there are millions in it billions for all five of us ive put you down for four per cent plus ex penses his tone became unpleasantly dictatorial get ready dunbar to fly us down in your austral queenby the end of next week if thats all you want harding i bit my tongue and held open the door something some indefinable qual ity in his bearing made me want desper ately to hit him it was his old friend ship that held my arm and jerry ware i was still hurt and puzzled by this harsh dictatorial insolence in a man who had been the most patient and generous of my friends when the phone rang again that afternoon and i was surprized to hear the voice of hardings wife a discord of anxious worry marred its old sweet music ron she cried eagerly how are you jerry had been and was perhaps the friend held closest in my lonely life but i must make it clear against possible misunderstanding that i did not love her nor she me i had sincerely congratulated the hardings on their marriage believing them perfectly mated the change in her husband distressed me deeply for i knew what it must mean to jerry her voice was quivering now plead ing ron if astons way provoked you i am sorry i must explain about him he had anillness two years ago he had been working late in his office at the foundationsome government research on account of the pacific war and one night hedisappeared i was frantic the police couldnt find him i was afraid he wasdead it was two weeks before he came to himself stumbling along a highway out in jersey it was amnesia still he cant remem ber what happened there was evidence that somebody had broken into his office the police thought an asiatic spy might have attacked him to get some secret but he doesnt know and since her low voice caught choked since he seems differentsharp and impatientsometimes cruel and still there are lapses in his memory details he cant recall i have to help him for hes stillshe choked againstill dear to me and promise me ron that youll forgive him bear with him i promise jerry i told her oh thank you it was a glad eager cry and ron will you come out to dinner tonight theres to be a meeting of the syndicate afterward to discuss the expedition ill be there jerry to see you but i warn you im not flying back to the pole not this season her gay little laugh ignored that last weird tales thanks ron she said doctor bell will pick you up at seven meriden bellold merry bell i was eager to see him and yet dreaded the encounter i had known him well when he worked at the foundation be fore the terrible events that shattered his career and estranged him from the world his genius had been a flame in him in the old days radiant good spirits had sparkled in his eyes i knew that things were different now i had hardly seen him for two years but the outline of his tragedy was familiar to me it is part of the blackest chapter in american history three years before a day came back to me when i had called on bell in his biological laboratory at the foundation which then occupied a gray old building at the edge of the jersey meadows hard ing had already hinted that bells bac teriological research was the greatest of the century but i was nevertheless sur prized all that longpast summer afternoon came back the air in the laboratory a little stuffy unpleasant with a vague odor of formaldehyde the north light gleam ing on microscopes incubators centri fuges and specimen jars bell a tall blue eyed man young and slender in labora tory white eagerly busy over a spectro scope he came to meet me turned to point dramatically at a testtube that held a few drops of an amber fluid my triumph ron eager elation rang in his low voice that is my cult ture v the perfect bacteriophage it is a filterable virus that will destroy any living thing any bacterium any malig nant organism when i have developed the controla specific protection for the cells of the human bodyit can eradi cate all disease all disease awed by the might of this slender mans genius perhaps a little incredulous before his sudden promise of universal health i reached out gingerly to touch the tube in its rack bell swiftly caught my arm and dont his tense voice warned if one drop touched you ronor the mil lionth of a dropnothing could save you nothinguntil i have developed the specific control i turned somewhat apprehensively for those few brown drops seemed sud denly more terrible than all the blizzards of antarcticaand came face to face with the most dreadful man i have ever seen five against the ice dreadfulno other word so fits that human monstrosity wearing a stained laboratory smock he stood less than five feet tall his back was horribly hunched and his great gnarled hands slung forward like the limbs of a gorilla beneath sleek black hair his face was a yellow vshaped mask his eyes set deep beneath dense bushy dark brows that sloped to make a smaller v were black alsoand his most appalling fea ture they held me his eyes in a sort of shrinking fascination because they were hideous one was oddly redflecked around the contracted pupil with an evil glittering red the other was strangely dilated a fearsome inscrutable midnight orb that seemed to have no iris those dark mismated eyes were fixed on the yellow liquid in the tube with an intensity somehow terrifying beneath the ugly blankness of the yellow pointed face i sensed a sinister storm of sup pressed emotion a mad black yearning a bitter burning hatred a savage and tri umphant gloating i started back appalled as if some bot tomless crevasse had abruptly snapped dreadful sleep open before me bell made a hasty in troduction ron this is doctor kroll captain dunbar meet doctor mawson kroll who is assisting my biological research the hunchback had started also and all hint of that yearning and hatred and gloating was instantly gone from the yel low v of his facethough he couldnt erase its stifled searing fury from my mind the hand he gave me was unpleas antly cold doctor bell has made a remarkable discovery krolls voice was oily and yet grating unpleasant as his breath one the world will not forget the horror to come must have been already in his twisted mindperhaps i had seen its birth but only afterward did i see the sardonic second meaning in his words the pacific war was fought during my next polar expedition ended before i knew of its beginning for the censored radio carried no news the american air forces supported by the fleet had already won a swift and brilliant victory when bells culture v fell mysteriously into the hands of the enemy nevertheless by the last vengeful order of a defeated and mortally wounded commander three surviving asiatic planes sprayed the bacteriophage along the pacific coast from seattle to san diego it took a million and a quarter lives hideously hideously for every droplet that touched a human body started an incur able sore a bleeding crater of agony that spread implacably swiftly destroying skin and flesh and bone until not life alone but every vestige of the corpse was con sumed on that terrible morning when a whole nation was stunned with horror and death high military authorities called on meriden bell at his laboratory his skill could do nothing the dead were dead and asiatic vengeance satisfied bell admitted that his bacteriophage must have caused the deaths but could not ac count for its possession by the enemy he was arrested tried by courtmartial convicted of treasonthen suddenly ex onerated when the guilt was pinned upon mawson kroll for bells assistant had taken flight leaving a trunk filled with asiatic gold in the intercepted communications of the enemy were found letters in which kroll demanded as payment for his treason to be made emperor of america the fugitive hunchback was arrested two weeks later on the mexican border stupidly he denied his guilt even his own identity an alienist pronounced him criminally insane tried in a military court he was convicted by the over whelming weight of circumstantial evi dence shot by a firingsquad bell abandoned his experiments de stroyed his records and various cultures at the foundation by military command his brilliant mind it seemed for months had been shattered by the disaster he was forcibly restrained from suicide com mitted to an asylum his tortured brain had assumed the guilt of a million murders the psychia trists if they failed to unburden him alto gether of krolls crime at least convinced him that he might best make atonement by living he had come back to the foundation before my last expedition to begin research in a newly opened field of subatomic physics now when bell came to meet me in the winter gloom that filled the halls of the aero club i saw that he had never escaped the shadow of that tragedy he was frail and thin his blue eyes dark with brooding his white pinched face looked as if it never smiled the eager weird tales ness of his greeting however was almost pathetic good old ron he whispered and felt the muscle of my shoulder with his pale fingers as if we were schoolboys again you must thrive on coldyoure looking like a redheaded hercules but ive had enough of winter for this season merry i told him what im looking for is warmth and women and laughter and i asked hopefully harding wasnt possibly joking about this project to thaw the ice cap no ron bells pale thin face was abruptly serious almost grimly resolute were going to do it all right the equipment will be ready in a week and you are the only man with experience enough to take us where we want to go at this season were going to the staple don basin the stapledon basinright across the pole that got me surely merry you havent considered how difficultor impossibleit would be to thaw a conti nent of ice his dark eyes came gravely to my face and in them was some commanding power some deep reflection of his old supernal genius that silenced my protests but i have considered ron he said quietly and i have solved every prob lem i have developed an atomic battery that will supply ample powerit is still secret what i tell you is confidential atomic power he nodded it is a hydrohelium vacuum cell we call it the atombuilder it builds hy drogen atoms into helium four hundred grams of hydrogen gives you three ninety nine of helium plus one of pure energy a gram of energy is a great deal ron a few tons of water will be all the fuel we need we shall burn ice to thaw antarctica i was speechless to that merry went on gravely your plane will carry all the equip ment we need i have designed a heat beam radiator transformers tower everything harding has formed a syn dicate to put up the money we are all meeting tonight listen merry i started to object harding is taking just a little too much for granted so far as im concerned his white fingers caught my arm but ron old man you dont under stand his voice was hoarse quivering this is the chance for me to make up for what i have done one discovery of mine took a million lives if another could open up a new continent where millions could live it would help settle the score he gulped his tortured eyes searched my face thats all ive been working for ron since icame back you wont stop me will you no resisting that all right merry i told him his thin hand wrung mine thanks old man he was almost sobbing well be ready to fly by the eighteenth you can have the austral queen in shape there will be five of us going and no others but jerry harding i protested she isnt goingnot into such hardship and danger some of my men might be persuaded to return no others an old bitterness was hard in bells voice this thing is secret there wont be another mawson kroll his dark eyes stared at me so terrible that i looked away and jerry will hear of nothing else but going he went on therell be just the five of us against the ice w t dreadful sleep the dweller in the pylon we found the hardings at their up town apartment and tommy veer ing jerry harding was her old self slen der grayeyed charming yet i could see her deep concern for her husband she hovered anxiously near him twice came swiftly to his aid when his memory seemed to stumble upon a momentary blank veering was a slim slickhaired young chap whose smiling brown eyes held a diffident appeal a new protege of hard ings he had been with the foundation since his graduation for all his youth he was already distinguished in electronic engineering he listened intently as bell briefly out lined the momentous plan after we had eaten keen enthusiasm lit his boyish face eagerly he gripped bells hand wonderful doctor bell itits great you have given the world another world and he began a question your precise subatomic formulæ if i have revealed enough to convince you merry bell said gravely i shall reserve the rest until we have reached the site of operations old bitterness shad owed his voice again so there cannot be another he bit his thin lip i have listed the equipment we shall need veerings enthusiasm ended indecision we went on to plan the expedition plotted a schedule for the flight to the frozen stapledon basin that would be a race against the swiftfalling polar night listed our essential supplies and the nine tons of bells equipment against the maxi mum capacity of my loyal old plane the austral queen it was two oclock when i got back to my room at the club elated with this mad dream of conquering the polar world yet troubled with vague apprehensions in spired by the change in doctor harding i was thinking moodily too of the mock cry in bells old nickname for if ever i had seen a man walking alive in hell it was surely he it was worth all the risk and folly of the flight i thought to alle viate his torture i went to bed and of old habit fell immediately asleep from this point it is difficult for me to go on much of the remainder of this history must deal with facts and beings that will appear incredible in the severe light of established science i share the reluctance of the orthodox scientist to admit anything not proven by objective observations and beyond all doubt for i know too well the possible subjective vagaries of the human mind i am sensitive too of any charges of sen sationalism or mistreatment of the truth yet it is my obvious duty to omit noth ing that happened however fantastic or illsupported the account of it may seem to leave out anything would distort the whole perhaps it is to be expected after all that the circumstances leading up to the incredible phenomenon of the time fault should appear equally astounding i woke suddenly in my dimlit room the city had grown almost quiet the illuminated hands of the electric clock showed five minutes past threei had been sleeping no more than an hour the sound that had waked me was totally unfamiliarunless perhaps it sug gested the song of some tiny exotic trop ical bird its plaintive keenness held a wail of lonely despair yet somehow it was heartpiercingly sweet i sat up in bed abruptly less frightened than merely startled although my heart was thudding my hand went toward the light before i touched the switch however i saw what was in the room and all movement left me my incredible visitor was floating a yard off the floor beside my bed it w t weird tales shone with a pale light of its own so that i had no need of the electrics a brief high note came from it again keen with lonely longing and somehow telling me not to be afraid a being beyond conception supernal an exquisite rosy shell floating upright flushed with a living light its fluted spirals tapered to a point below its gleaming lips flared out like a vase of pearl held the bust of an elfin woman marumora her tiny shoulders were covered with a fine golden down her delicate head wasor seemedthe head of a pigmy queen but the golden plates that crowned it i knew and the plumed scar let crest above were living part of her her small pointed face was whiter than alabaster and imperial in its pride her eyes were huge purple limpid they were round and sober with the innocence of a childs they were inscrutable with ageless wisdom they were dark wells of agony ancient and ageless her lips were a tiny crimson wound they were full almost sensuous they smiled at me with a faint twist of malice marumora i knew that she was noth ing human yet my fancy ever made her so for eyes and lips and even the impu dent flirt of her crimson plume held all the essence of humanity wisdom and the vain yearning to forget pride and bitter defeat hot passion and long frustration hope and despair bright courage and con suming fear living joy and ultimate in finite agony against all that it mattered not if she had a golden carapace instead of hair if her great eyes were lidless if her facial economy seemed to provide no nostrils bodily she might have more in common with the mollusk than with man but some chord in her spirit touched the hu man none the less altogether elfin bust and pearly vase she was less than four feet tall and the flying shell i knew was as much a part of her as much alive as the shining crest or her purple eyes i sat in the bed staring at her bewil dered incredulous she should have been a dream the fastened windowfor the room was airconditionedhad not been disturbed the door was still locked but here she was and i was as wide awake as i had ever been i heard the distant thunder of an elevated train the red lips pouted the keen voice came again like a whistling saying as i sensed its wordless meaning do not be afraid the shining being drifted a lit tle toward my bed settled toward me over the lip of the shell reached a slen der arm bright with golden fur the hand that reached for me was tiny infinitely delicate sevenfingered it was thumbless the middle finger longest the nails were narrow pointed crimson for all its golden strangeness it was beau tiful and to me a hand the keen piping so lonely so sorrow fully sweet wailed again i looked into the infinite wells of those purple eyes and something made me put up my own big hand grasp those tiny furry fingers instantly incredibly i was snatched out of my body i know how utterly fantastic impos sible that must seem but i had an in stants impression of my body left behind in that dim room sitting boltupright and motionless in the bed then we were plunging upward outside above the dark building and the restless city southward we soaredthat shining being beside me drawing me by the hand for my form was still the same even if my body lay behindacross slumbering continents and over dark whispering oceans we swept into the frigid gray twilight that lay upon the polar lands i recog dreadful sleep nized the very mountains of despair of which my party had made an aerial sur vey on the last expedition and lying vast and desolate beyond them the stapledon basin and down we sloped again across gray crevasseriven glaciers toward a tow ering transpolar range that i had glimpsed in the distance called the mountains of uranus but had never reached as we dropped toward those black granite peaks bleakly stark frostshat tered yet rearing so majestically from the eternal ice i was amazed to see what seemed a building with twin hexagonal towers projecting above the naked wind swept ledges of a rounded summit this structurei hardly know a name for itseemed deeply anchored in the living granite its material was un familiar iceclear and richly purple like some unimaginable colossal amethyst its low massive outline somewhat suggested those towered gateways of the ancient egyptians that archeologists call pylons but it had no opening it appeared door less windowless one solid block of flaw less crystal near it however a wide fissure cleft the black summit worn stone steps freshly swept free of snow led down into it at their foot was a massive door of black metal battered and corroded as if by the impact of ages we settled down upon the barren ledge above the fissure i stood upon the snowpatched graniteor it seemed that i did for i was still aware that my body lay back in new york and the shining being floated beside me the golden tendrils of her fingers still grasp ing my hand a weirdly unforgettable scene the stark black mountain beneath us tower ing above the gray infinity of ice the midnight sun burning low and ominously red in the misty distance the immemo rial mass of that towered crystal block strange with deepcut glyphs looming above us like the enigmatic monument of some lost and forgotten race but the being at my side was looking down at that ancient black door her eery piping keened out again calling a little time went by then a girl opened the door and came running lightly up the steps she was beautifulslender tall filled with the glory of young womanhood her trim clothing was strangely cut from some pure white fur the one strand of hair that escaped her closefitting cap was a gorgeous ruddy gold her oval face was very fair the forehead high and white her wide blue eyes were burning with some newborn eagerness beautiful my stumbling words could never convey her perfect loveliness i looked at her drank deep of her vital splendor for some old haunting thirst was being satisfied she held some elusive perfection that i had sought for many weary years in many lands even in my polar explorations and never glimpsed before beautiful i knew instantly that i wanted her to possess and to serve to love for ever and i knew bitterly that this was was only some strange dream that i really lay stillor my body did back in new york city marumora the girl ran to the flying being with that eager greeting on her tongue she embraced those golden shoulders light ly gently a tiny goldenfurred hand stroked her head affectionately then the keen thin piping of marumora came again and the girl turned eagerly toward me i know your name you are ron dunbar she said surprizingly she spoke english her voice was low faint weird tales ly awkward as if she were little used to speech it was soft deeply rich de licious i am karalee she said maru mora brought you here to her dwelling or a part of youso that i might speak to you for her ior the part of mestood drink ing in her sheer glowing loveliness swift admiration had conquered my old diffidence with women even my present amazement i stood merely looking de lighted until suddenly i was afraid that my gaze might offend or discomfit the girl im glad that she did i said and i wish that she had brought all of me so that perhaps i could stay deep and serene the girls clear blue eyes looked into mine her full lips quivered suddenly her white nostrils flared to a deeper breath her deep bosom lifted i wish ron dunbar her low voice said simply that you could stay afterward i was surprized at my swift surrender to a woman in a dream but emotion as well as thought all through that incredible experience seemed more direct and clear than common some old restraint was left behind ill come again i found myself promising the girl now i know the way ill fly back to these very mountains next time all of mefor you eagerness shone bright on her face you will come ronfor me gleaming tears misted her eyes and sometimewe can go out togetherout into the world the sweet exotic piping of marumora came again then swiftly urgent the girl karalee looked up at that supernal being and back to me and all the eagerness had gone from her face it was a pale bleak oval stricken the tears were gone her eyes were dry dark with pain no ron you must never come back her voice was steady and low that is what marumora brought you to hear you must never fly your machine into this land again you must promise that i looked at her sharing all the agony written on her white face but im coming back i said before the sun is gone im coming to take you away karalee her face brightened for a moment to a tortured eagerness of longing she looked up again at the silent fantastic shape of marumora no ron dunbar her voice came slow and heavy with regret you must not come to this land again her tone quivered nevernot even for me marumora forbids it i looked up at the shining being that still held my hand in her tiny furry fin gers demanding why they that sleep again that eldritch plaintive piping sobbed from the elfin womans head goldcrowned and scarletplumed above that flaring opalescent shell again the fair girl karalee so lovely in her trim white furs rendered translation it is true ron dunbar that you are planning to fly here again with new com panions before this sun is gone it is i said surprized it is true karalee gave the next question that your purpose is to thaw the ice from all this world perhaps i shouldnt have been amazed at that after all marumora had come to new york after me it didnt much increase the wonder of it i suppose that she now displayed knowledge of what had occurred there that evening in hard ings apartment for an instant however i was speech less a strange fear chilled and shook dreadful sleep me until i looked up into those great purple orbs they came down to my face and i felt a warmth of supernal peace the fear was gone thats right i said were going to use atomic power doctor bell hopes to make the whole continent temperate and open it up to settlement then you must give up the plan karalee rendered the swift reply for the ice must never be thawed death is sleeping under the ice ron dunbar the death of all the world take care lest you rouse it death i demanded what do you mean then took place the strangest and cer tainly the most terrible part of all that in credible adventure we still stood together beside that colossal purple pylon on the naked gran ite of that frozen peak red as blood the midnight sun burned low in the horizon less distance where the gray illimitable desert of ice merged with the gray and featureless sky a bitter wind howled and moaned about the towers of the pylon i was insensible of any cold but the girl karalee was already pale shiver ing she had gestured toward the steps that led down to the door in the rock let us go down into my rooms she said it is warmer there dark with longing and regret her eyes looked at marumora and back at me if you are forbidden ever to return at least marumoras piping cut her off as if answering a command the girl stepped quickly to the flying being she held out a mittened hand tiny golden fingers clasped it come the girl translated maru mora is carrying us to see the peril that you must not rouse it is they that sleep we rose again i had the briefest glimpse of karalee left standing on that frozen ledge her arm rigidly extended yet she was with us also drawn by maru moras other handdrawn out of her body as i had been we three soared swiftly through chill gray mists descended upon a rugged iceplain from which jutted great boulders of granite black naked shat tered with the frost of ages we stood at the brink of a dark crevasse karalee pointed across it her lips moved twice before she could speak and her voice came muffled breath less choked with horror there she said one of them it is the watcher i shuddered at sight of that monstrous thing it stood upright upon a cragged boulder and it did not move the body of it was black covered with great scales a swollen elongated thing shaped like an immense barrel it stood upon three black tentacular limbs whose extremities had coiled like mighty serpents to grasp the granite head it had none but the bulged up per end of the black body was broken with a great sharp triangular projection which looked like a hideous snout three scaled triangular flaps just about its swol len equatorial belt might i thought cover strange organs of sense this creature was utterly horrifying in a sense i can hardly define its horror held nothing familiar if marumora was clearly nonhuman it was certainly non terrestrial it chilled me with an element al absolute revulsion i knew that the girl was sick and cold with dread i heard her make a pleading little whistle her human imitation of the voice of marumora her strained hoarse whisper came to me urgent look swiftly ron so that we can go i do not like these things but maru mora says you must see weird tales the black monstrosity indeed held my gaze with a fascination of utter terror it had been there motionless a long time the great black scales were silvered with frost snow was banked beyond it the ice had climbed up over the coils of its ophidian limbs the boulder was cracked i saw shat tered time had splintered the granite since those giant tentacles first grasped it only their frozen pressure held it from crumbling how many centuries surely after so long i thought it must be deadand i knew that it was not nothing dead could inspire such resist less fear i sensedor fancieda slow implacable beat like a pulse of evil measured menacing mindshattering i flinched suddenly turned away hid my eyes with a trembling hand i fought a strange and elemental sickness a new born horror that gnawed wormlike at the marrow of my bones it brought a flood of vast relief when come said karalee we go to see the others we left that stark eternal black sentinel overlooking the glaciers we soared swiftly through the leaden mists came down upon ridged and fissured ice the others said the girl are all about their ship beneath the ice driven by a fascinated compulsion to see all i could even though the horror of it should consume me i was striving in vain to peer down through the graywhite obscurity of the icewhen suddenly we were beneath it down through the darkness of the gla cier we plunged as swiftly as through the air above the ice was all around us like a bluegreen liquid and suddenly we were standing again on a long ridge of granite we were far beneath the glacier which was like a thick greenblack mist above us i could see little at first but gradually my vision sharpenedor perhaps marumora in some manner shared her own strange senses with meand i perceived the great valley beyond and below us dim in the green haze of the ice i presently distinguished a cyclopean ma chine resting on tremendous skids which lay far along the floor of the val ley it was all of darkly gleaming red black metal a colossal bulging hull sur rounded with a confusion of struts and braces masts and booms and metal arms mysterious rods and vanes towered even above the ridge where we stood it was like the bloated body of some monstrous spider crouching with folded limbs set to spring here and there about those crimson planes and arms frozen motionless in the green mist of ice i saw black and hid eous beings like the watcher scaled bod ies headless and bulging supported on triple ophidian limbs an alien horror touched me as we stood on that black ridge beneath the ice it was the stark menace of the outside the terror of worlds strange beyond con ception of powers and entities supernal monstrous utterly alien that stark won dering elemental dreadsome dim in stinctive inkling of it i think is at the basis of many primitive religionsis the most terrible emotion a human being can feel dimly through the numbness of my dread as if i dreamed within a dream i heard the piping of marumora and karalee spoke that is the ship that came from beyond and they are the tharshoon they came to conquer earth that was in another age before the ice came here this was a fair world then and my peo ple ruled it man was not born i knew that this was marumora dreadful sleep speaking through the lips of the wide eyed terrordazed girl the tharshoon brought fearsome weapons giant needles that poured out terrible red flame even their eyes could stare us intonothingness and we had none we had been a people of peace the invaders attacked our white cities overwhelmed them in horror and death we were without defense until i the seeker who had long since given up my body on the altar of science discovered a power that made them sleep by that time it was too late to save my people they all had perished but i livedwhen rather i had died i stopped the tharshoon in the hour of their vic tory and i have stood guard upon them whom i could not destroy the halfchanting voice of karalee speaking i knew the thoughts of the strange elder beinghad become oddly like the piping of marumora it was plaintively sorrowful weary with ageold loneliness piercing with a yearning be yond words the world has changed its axis the ice has come to bind the sleepers more securely your race of man has risen from the northern jungle beasts and still i wait and watch and the thar shoon shall not wake however amazing that scrap of earth history it was in my singular mental state somehow credible i knew antarc tica had once been tropical it is rich with coal seams our survey had revealed a rich jurassic fossil flora of ferns conifers and cycads within fifty miles of the pole i was familiar with the various theories of axial shift and continental drift for the rest of it the hideous forms of the invaders and the seekers exotic beauty were here before my eyes yes i accepted it without question then and the ray of understanding merely increased my shocked and reeling dread marumora was piping again and the girl said anxiously come we must return marumoras strength is low should it fail we all must perish for myself i was eager to escape the green mist of ice was suddenly crushing suffocating and i was sick from the overwhelming horror of that ship and its monstrous crew but the tiny golden fingers tightened on my hand and the girls we left the black ridge beside that vessel from be yond drove upward through the mala chite haze of the ice we swept over the glaciers again toward the towering black range and the timebattered summit where the purple pylon stood i glimpsed the girls body waiting rigid in its fursnot a muscle had moved since we left then we were beside it and there was but one karalee blue with cold shuddering she began beating her mittened hands stiffly against her sides the seeker piped again and she turned to me gasping you have seen them now ron dun bar the eternal sleepersif they are waked your world will die let them sleepdo not try to thaw the iceand dont come back again but i am coming back i tugged toward her against the strange strength of marumoras hand for i love you karalee the shivering girl started toward me eagerly but the eery voice of marumora stopped her the white oval of her face went starkly rigid her wide blue eyes turned dark with dread no ron dont come back she sobbed for you will die and i and all the world the seeker piped again imperatively the girl turned slowly as if in reluctant weird tales obedience her dry eyes looked back at me black with tragedy mutely imploring she tried to speak and could not she went stiffly at last down the steps in the fissure and through the black door karalee i callcd after her vain ly the door closed ponderously i was still staring at it when i felt the seekers tiny fingers tugging at my hand she drew me toward the side of the pylon the purple transparency of it towered sheer out of the black granite frost of ages had splintered and crumbled the stone blizzards of ages carved it gro tesquely that cyclopean crystal how ever remained diamondhard diamond polished it was deeply graven with the lost runes of a world dead before the coming of the ice one moment she paused against that amethystine wall wondrous being a fluted spiral vase of opalescent pearl holding flowerlike an elfin queen gold enrobed and goldencrowned crimson plumed last and greatest of a people lost marumora the seeker the deep purple wells of her immense eyes regarded me soberly as if with un uttered warning her delicate sevenfin gered hand gestured toward karalees door her scarlet mouth pouted to a sin gle admonishing note then her furry fingers released me as easily as we had entered the ice she drift ed through that adamantine wall into the crystal pylon she seemed to relax for an instant i watched her still sinking peacefully through its pellucid depths then i turned i tried to walk back toward the crevice in the rock that opened to karalees abode but the world splin tered about me i was crushed beneath a black appalling avalanche of pain and then i was in bed again back in my room at the aero club beyond the pole even now writing these words i am overcome with a black tide of guilt for the warning in that singular vision had been explicit unmistakable had i but been wise enough to heed it what untold horror and death might have been averted the silent hands of the electric clock when i looked stood at threeforty my body which had lain thirtyfive minutes uncovered and motionless was stiff with cold yet strangely damp with sweat a blinding headache splintered through the back of my brain clambering uncertain ly out of the bed i found myself trem bling with nervous exhaustion sound heart fluttering as if it had come through some terrific strain at first i could hardly stand but i felt better as movement restored circulation i wouldnt i decided call a doctor what i wanted was a chance to think over what had happened after a few turns around the room i took two aspirins smoked out a pipe and went back to bedbut not to sleep that night for my mind was still too full of maru moras supernal wonder of the immemo rial icedrowned horror of the sleepers of karalees young intoxicating beauty desperately i wrestled with the terrible question had it been real or a dream it all had been absolutely convincing as it passed doubt had only come after ward it had seemed too perfect in de tail too strangely coherent too fearfully alien to be a dreamfor the dreaming mind commonly reflects only the familiar patterns of the day creating nothing new but the stiff orthodoxy of my scientific training balked at accepting it as anything more than dream could the human mind exist outside the bodyfly ten thousand miles and dreadful sleep back in half an hourdive a mile be neath the ice cap that was childish superstition any en lightened savage would know better the seekerwas she possible a pre human being as high as mankindor higher ageless dweller in a crystal block flitting intangibly over the planet at the speed of thought who would believe my tale of marumora the tharshooncould such monstros ities be could sentient invaders have crossed the gulf from some unimaginable beyond assuming that they came when a tropical wilderness covered the present polar continent could they have survived ten or a hundred million years beneath the ice the scientist in me answered those questions with an outraged no moreover at the risk of greater blame but for the sake of honesty i must con fess that even if i had been fairly con vinced of the reality of that experience still i might have gone for a kind of foolhardinessor it may be only egotism has made me ever seek danger rather than avoid it not that i am fearless at all merely that great peril has a resistless fascination even when it terrifies me and then besides i had seen karalee that is all my apology i merely hope the reader will try to understand why i chose to ignore that singular warning why i strove to credit it in my own mind to a heavy supper and my worries about doctor harding and our flight to the south i said nothing at all to my associates about that astounding dream our preparations were completed with little delay on the afternoon of february the last bulky crates of bells atomic ap paratus were stowed aboard the austral queen moored in san francisco bay the next morning we took off for antarc tica via honolulu suva and dunedin we were five remembering the loyal faith of jerry ware i might have known that no husband of hers would go into peril without her by his side a strange haze that forewarned of an early blizzard met us as we came down across the dark polar sea in the pale light of the low sun reddening behind us in the north it shimmered with a curious pellucid saffron radiance the towering whitecrowned icebergs loomed out of it with a suddenness always startling flying low no more than a frail mote lost in the ominous immensity of this ice walled sea at the bottom of the world the austral queen soon battled a freezing headwind a big fourmotored amphibian trans port she had served me loyally through two previous expeditions but she was too heavily laden now with the five of us our winters supplies and equipment and the nine tons of bells apparatus the blizzard as if to give warning of the grim night to come met us with sav age fury sometimes it drove us perilous ly close to the fangs of the ice sometimes its opposing violence held us motionless tommy veering had spelled me at the controls while i got a little sleep back on the dunnage that filled half the cabin but he called me forward as the wind grew worse in the sixties i was tired for all the flight had been a desperate race against the polar night yet back at the controls i found an old elation i shared the victory of the ship as she defied the teeth of the ice and the seas cold maw and met the blows of the bitter wind floes and bergs became more frequent and at last the white pack was beneath us the desolate balleny islands were be hind we veered a little eastward around cape adare and battled our way along the grim coast of south victoria land dimshrouded in the blizzard the dark masses of mount erebus and mount ter weird tales ror crept down to our right and at last the ross barrier came marching out of the everthickening saffron mists a black and hostile wall towering hundreds of feet to the white desert of flying snow jerry harding had come up into the cockpit after veering went back bring ing hot coffee her brave gray eyes scanned the wall of ice ahead then she looked at me and her voice came quiet and grave we are flying very low ron do you think ive been trying to keep under the wind i said the ship is heavy but shell climbshe has to climb eighteen thousand feet to cross the passes into the stapledon basin but shell pull through i hope so ron jerry said aston has staked everything so much de pends on usa whole new world the blizzard screaming off the ice shelf as i brought the ship up struck like the hand of a demoniac giant she shud dered like a stricken thing and plunged down again into the mist of ice crystal whipped off the frozen barrier hardings wife stifled her instinctive cry of fear but her white small hand went convulsively tight on my shoulder her gray eyes looked at me big with that ter rible question its all right jerry i tried to get some calm into my voice the queen has never failed me yet shes braveas a woman and she didnt fail me then she came up again with motors thundering wide open through that flying spume of frost she hung evenly battling the wind for a heartbreaking moment above the frozen blade that edged the ice plateau she sank liftedleapt ahead and here we areon the world weve come to conquer jerry harding caught a breath of relief and her hand relaxed on my shoulder she leaned across to peer down at the polar world thickly misted with blizzard whipped snow savagefanged with hum mocks and pressure ridges blackscarred with abysmal crevasses then again something happened that it is difficult to account for in the cold rational light of established science a small thing in itself perhapsmerely the inexplicable sensation of an instantbut terrible in its significance i had looked aside at jerrys frail love liness her pale lips now parted with a little smile and some warning tentacle of cold reached suddenly into the insu lated cabin to touch my spine some thing i know made me shudder made my trembling hands knot hard on the wheel it was a thing i could not explain any more than the dream of the seeker but in that instant as surely as if i had seen her lying in her coffin i knew that jerry was doomed she knew it too she felt the same ghastly intuitionthat was the terrible part otherwise i should have ignored it set it down to fatigue and my own vague fears for i have never been ruled by hunches her face went abruptly paler she caught her breath and her white lips set for a moment her whole thin body was rigid then her gray eyes looked at me suddenly dark dreadful shadowed with the doom i knew they had seen quite a bump we passed i said as easily as i could made me giddy for a moment and nearly got the controls for a long terrible moment her tor tured eyes looked into my face straining as if to read some awful secret i tried not to let her know i had shared that fear ful premonition at last she swallowed uneasily ron she said uncertainly ifif anything should happen to me please dreadful sleep look after aston he needs someone he isnthes not quite himself and she left me in a moment and went back to her husband i tried to deny or forget that disturb ing uncanny sensation but it clung and grew in my brain like something evil and alive and the difficulties ahead seemed suddenly a more terrible barrier than the wall of ice we had passed where lay any hope of success what impress could four men and a woman make upon this eternal citadel of winter the tense hours passed we drove on into the blizzard above the featureless white surface of the barrier as our load of fuel was lightened i fought for alti tude to gain the passes and plateaus be fore us the barren summits of the common wealth range behind we flew up the long inlet of the barrier beside queen mauds range the austral queen la bored bravely upward battled the shriek ing wind that hurled her at the black crags that walled a glaciercarven pass and we were at last above the polar plateau we passed seventy miles to the left of the pole itself for two hours we fought the tempest that raged down beside the mountains of despair across beyond the pole before we reached the only pass it was the highest on the flight and there we met the most savage wind i had to drop half our reserve tanks of gasoline before the ship found courage to lift above the barrier beyond we came down into the staple don basin the site that bell had chosen for our attempt to thaw the ice it was an iceclad plateau nine thousand feet high walled on all sides with dark tre mendous ranges towering above the glaciers far across it a hundred and forty miles away and invisible in the hazy fury of the blizzard rose i knew that mighty unex plored transpolar range that i had glimpsed and named the mountains of uranuson whose summit in the dream i had seen the purple pylon of the seeker i had resolved to discount the dream but now i found myself straining my eyes through the bleak gray mist wondering dwelling even upon the bright memory of the girl karaleeuntil a jutting rocky ridge broke the ice beneath us and it was time to land wind and altitude made that landing difficult the heavyburdened plane came hurtling down far too swiftly a black granite boulder loomed suddenly out of the blinding driftsnow whipped along the surface our skids crashed against the ice crust the ship bounced lurched awk wardly around the boulder buried her nose in the drift beyond the flight was ended the haunted camp i opened a hatch and dug my way to the surface merry bell followed me up into the blizzard it had moderated to a mere fiftymile gale but still at nine thousand feet at forty below it could pierce our furs and sear our lungs a welter of dark outcroppings of shat tered granite and fantastically carved white drifts surrounded us the desolate rugged ice beyond was like a wild sea congealed in the midst of a furious storm the dark ranges that walled the basin fifty to eighty miles away were lost in leadgray mist bell was staring about shivering this ridge is the summit of a moun tain buried under the glacier i told him our survey showed the ice over most of the basin to be three to five thousand feet his tortured thin face was suddenly warm with enthusiasm weird tales its just the spot i wanted ron he was saying eagerly well set up the tower on the ridge the atomic beam it self will reach to all these mountains and the basin when it is warmed will serve as a sort of furnace to moderate all the continent with windconvection and warm rivers flowing down through the passes the breathless wonder of his dream caught me for a moment i saw lush ver dure replace the white desolation of ice saw green forests blanket the black flanks of those mountains that had known no life for ten million years i saw busy cities even rich plantations spread be neath the summerlong day mines rail roads factories once this land was warm bells quick voice had run on coal forests in the permocarboniferous that brought back my haunting dream the fantastic beauty of marumora and all the alien horror of the sleepers jerry hardings voice reached me faintly from the plane and i recalled the grim pre monition that had struck me as we crossed the barrier i shuddered and tried to forget our first problem is to build living quarters i told bell if we dont well this is mild summer compared to what is coming and we set to work at once to estab lish a winter camp for the plane we cut a sort of hangar in the ice covered it with protecting blocks of snow our liv ingquarters also were hewn in the gla cier walled with the packingcases that held our supplies roofed with snow packed on tarpaper that occupied the most of our time until late in marchuntil the sun wheel ing ever lower and redder and huger and colder peered for the last time through a pass in the mountains of uranus and did not return none of the others had had any pre vious polar experience all but harding were willing to follow my leadership in building the camp but he made himself difficult to put it mildly he wanted bell to begin erecting his atomic battery at once but bell said that three months or half a year might pass before the installation could be completed and during that time i knew without good livingquarters we must perish bell and jerry did their best to convince hard ing of this necessity but he remained sul len and unwilling hardings disturbing change of man ner seemed always more extreme there was no visible physical difference in him unless as i sometimes thought his pale blue eyes had turned a little darker but something had totally changed his nature had i been superstitious enough to cred it such a thing i should have thought him literally possessed for many years he had been a close friend of mine the long ruddy face be neath his untidy mass of yellowish hair was still unmistakably familiar yet sometimes as i caught the new ruthless hardness in his eyes i thought i looked upon a stranger he became increasingly dictatorial quarrelsome even vicious he was sav agely rude even cruel to young tommy veering he cursed him made rough jokes at his expense ridiculed his youth and timidity twice i saw him knock veering down when they were at work together with no excuse at all and the thin young engineer through some quirk of doglike meekness accept ed all hardings offensiveness without any show of resentment indeed so far as i could tell he liked the big man all the better for this abuse he kept hardings company and came to side with him in any argument what most distressed me about hard dreadful sleep ing however was his unkindness to jerry he developed a way of saying sharp cruel things to her displaying a venomous malevolence that i had never suspected in him one day at table for example saying that his tea was cold he flung it into jerrys face and began cursing her sav agely i should have hit him then but jerry ran to me wiping the scalding liquid out of her eyes caught my arm and begged me not to strike him the rude dwelling finished at last we unloaded bells equipment and carried it to the chosen site a bare out cropping of living granite just above the camp working beneath a canvas shelter for since the sun had gone it was growing bitterly coldwe began drilling holes in the rock to anchor the legs of the tower as we cleared the crust of ice from this ledge tommy veering made a curious discovery in a crevice he found a num ber of tiny fossils lichens several small ancient spiders two minute degenerative hymenopterous insects and a small am monite the specimens were not so re markable as their state of preservation for every tiny limb and segment was in tact diamondhard veering showed the find to harding who became oddly excited over it these are the original bodies he ex claimed peering at them with a pocket miscoscope there has been no miner alizing no substitution as in ordinary petrification they have been just some howfrozen mere heat however did not thaw them the effort seemed sheerest folly for the presence of the extinct mollusk alone was proof that the things had ex isted unchanged through geological ages but harding and veering in our rude little laboratory made continual effort to revive the fossils but they arent fossils at all hard ing insisted there has been no change or deterioration since they were alive the microscopic structure is perfect every cell intact his weeks of work only deepened the puzzle it was about this time incident ally that he began to wear colored glasses saying that the long hours at the micro scope strained his eyes the newer physics he told me once would say that these creatures are in a spacetime stasis the spectroscope shows that the characteristics of space about their atoms has been altered warped so that no change or motion is possiblenot even any time behind the dark lenses his eyes glit tered with a strange excitement if we could reverse that warping force unlock the stasis they would live again unaware that even a second had passed his voice was feverish husky terrible and that secret if we learn it will be a weapon greater than the gor gons head frankly i thought the project mere folly if not insane delusion for i had increasing doubts of hardings mental balance but i did not discourage it be cause it occupied his time and left him less troublesome the erection of bells automatic appa ratus meantime went steadily forward veering proved himself a skilled and brilliant technician by midwinter it seemed the battery might be in opera tion all the ice would be thawed from the basin bell promised by the coming of the sun it is hard to give a true record of those weary dragging months of winter night the shadow of dire catastrophe had over hung us from the first my old irrational conviction of approaching tragedy had weird tales slowly deepened life in the antarctic is a grim enough business at best and hard ings increasingly evil nature made it at times almost insupportable but aside from all that there had been something elsesomething that bell and perhaps even jerry must have sensed more keenly than i when i say that the camp was haunted it sounds like superstitious nonsense yet almost from the day of our arrival i had a curious uneasy feeling that it was that some strange intangible presence hung about us alertly watching every move we made listening to every word we said bell and jerry i think were more con scious of it than i for i often saw them silent with cocked heads and strained intent faces listening its nothing ron jerry said once when i asked her what she listened for her tired face tried to smile im just nervous i guess worried about poor aston he has changed so grown so much worsehave you noticed and bell as we worked together about his tower often paused to peer away across the ice he laughed when i spoke about it but his white face remained very grave just a feeling he said that some thing is watching ustrying to speak to us perhaps his thin frame abruptly shivered ive a queer feeling ron he confessed that we shouldnt thaw the ice im somehow afraid his dark tor tured eyes stared away again his voice sank low yes afraidof what we might uncover the warning of that singular dream came to me again i felt an impulse to tell bell about it but checked my tongue he was troubled enough already i didnt want to increase his anxiety for still i believed it a dream i dared not regard it as anything else sometimes i found myself staring northward toward the mountains of uranus wondering if the seekers purple pylon might indeed stand on some summit there but i could never see it march had gone and most of april when the thing happened that crys tallized all my vague apprehensions and shattered the routine of our life at camp that started the dread avalanche that did not end until all the world had been overwhelmed in horror the whole camp was asleep after a long shift spent bolting together the sec tions of bells tower i started suddenly awake alarmed yet not knowing what had roused me for an instant i lay still listening the wind which had blown steadily for many days had died at first i could hear only a soft weird rustlingthe whisper of the aurora but suddenly mingled with that eery sussuration i caught another sounda sound terribly familiar and yet incred ible a thin far wailing infinitely sweet and infinitely sad it held all the heart broken loneliness of the world caught in slow eery minors so faint they mocked the ears it was the piping of the seeker of my dream the voice of marumora or had i merely dreamed again for it had ceased breathless and trembling uncertain that i had heard anything at all i donned furs and hastened up out of our icebur row into the polar night the unutter able appalling splendor of it caught me held me for a moment motionless complete calm had fallen the air curiously brilliant with frost was abso lutely still the clear sky was purple black the southern constellations pale be yond the most brilliant auroral display i ever witnessed pure silver crystal green dreadful sleep and living rose its curved rays sprayed from beyond the pole its rustling ban nered hosts marched endlessly whisper ing immemorial secrets of outer space with an effort i broke the aching thrall of its beauty i stumbled up to the ledge beside bells unfinished tower and peered away across the snow it lay glittering and brilliant dimly flushed with auroral color drifts massed fantastically painful as the ring of glass to a violin bow i heard that sound again an eery minor threnody a resistless call of provo cative promise and far away beyond black grotesque hummocks of bare ice i saw an incred ible thing above the silver snow plain in the auroras radiance it drifted flew wingless a tapered spiral flaring up ward a womans bust goldenfurred cradled in its shimmering cup an elfin womans head goldencrowned proudly scarletcrested slim golden arms that beckoned it was marumora the seeker of my dream and the dream then was real the purple pylon did tower somewhere from the peaks beyond the ice and lovely karalee to whom i had promised in the dream to return must be living reality a cold tide of horror flowed suddenly over my soul for the black tharshoon the scaled and monstrous sleepers of the ice must then be also realand waiting to be wakened if we should thaw the polar ice i had ignored the seekers warning and karalees tearful appeal what now was to be the penalty marumoras piping came again allur ing with its uncanny haunting sweetness terrible with immemorial pain the au rora flooded the sky again and once more far away i glimpsed the alien beauty of the seeker she flew low but swiftly calling gol den arms beckoning and beneath her stumbling frantically after her wasa man caught in a queer paralysis of fasci nated dread i watched as he toiled up a slippery bank tottered perilously along the brink of a blank crevasse the shin ing alien siren fled awiy before him mocking elusive he followed her over the flank of a gleaming drift they both were gone it was a moment before i could recover myself put down a sense of outraged unreality then i shouted ran along the ledge toward the drift where they had vanished what the seeker might be dream or illusion phantom or alien living being i knew notbut i did know that only terrible death could await any man lured out across the ice was that her way to stop our work the aurora dimmed suddenly in the starlit darkness i saw nothing beyond the drift thin echoes from the ice were the only answer to my calls the eery song had ceased the singer and her victim vanished shivering from the shock of eldritch horror as much from the bitter cold i stumbled back to the camp my shouts had roused the others jerry harding bewildered anxiouseyed met me as i came down into our burrow what was it ron she whispered apprehensively what happened i woke with the most dreadful feeling and where is poor merry bell i gasped hes gone from his bunk she told me and i knew that it was meriden bell who had followed the seeker across the snow you will not want to miss the thrilling chapters of this fascinating story in next months weird tales we suggest that you reserve your copy at your magazine dealers now the shadow on the screen byhenry kuttner a weird story of hollywood and the grisly horror that cast its dreadful shadow across the silver screen as an incredible motionpicture was run off torture master was being given a sneak preview at a beverly hills theatre somehow when my credit line directed by peter haviland was flashed on the screen a little chill of apprehension shook me despite the ap plause that came from a receptive audi ence when youve been in the picture game for a long time you get these hunches ive often spotted a dud flicker before a hundred feet have been reeled off yet torture master was no worse than a dozen similar films id handled in the past few years but it was formula boxofiice formula i could see that the star was all right the makeup department had done a good job the dialogue was unusually smooth yet the film was obviously boxoffice and not the sort of film id have liked to direct after watching a reel unwind amid an encouraging scattering of applause i got up and went to the lobby some of the gang from summit pictures were loung ing there smoking and commenting on the picture ann howard who played the heroine in torture master noticed my scowl and pulled me into a corner she was that rare type a girl who will screen well without a lot of the yellow grease paint that makes you look like an ani mated corpse she was small and her hair and eyes and skin were brownid like to have seen her play peter pan that type you know i had occasionally proposed to her but she never took me seriously as a matter of fact i myself didnt know how serious i was about it now she led me into the bar and ordered sidecars dont look so miserable pete she said over the rim of her glass the pictures going over itll gross enough to suit the boss and it wont hurt my reputation well that was right ann had a fat part and shed made the most of it and the picture would be good boxoffice universals night key with karloff had been released a few months ago and the audiences were ripe for another horror picture i know i told her signaling the bartender to refill my glass but i get tired of these damn hokumy pics lord how id like to do another cabinet of doctor caligari or another ape of god ann sug gested i shrugged even that maybe theres so much chance for development of the weird on the screen annand no pro ducer will stand for a genuinely good picture of that type they call it arty and say itll flop if i branched out on my ownwell hecht and macarthur tried it and theyre back on the holly wood payroll now someone ann knew came up and en gaged her in conversation i saw a man beckoning and with a hasty apology left ann to join him it was andy worth hollywoods dirtiest columnist i knew him for a doublecrosser and a skunk but i also knew that he could get more inside w t the shaddow on the screen information than a brace of winchells he was a short fat chap with a meticu lously cultivated mustache and sleeky po maded black hair worth fancied himself as a ladies man and spent a great deal of his time trying to blackmail actresses into having affairs with him that didnt make him a villain of course i like anybody who can carry on an intelligent conversation for ten min utes and worth could do that he fin gered his mustache and said i heard you talking about ape of god a coincidence pete yeah i was cautious i had to be with this walking scandalsheet hows that he took a deep breath well you understand that i havent got the real lowdown and its all hearsaybut ive found a picture thatll make the weirdest flicker ever canned look sick i suspected a gag okay what is it torture master eh nothough blakes yarn de served better adaptation than your boys gave it no pete the one im talking about isnt for general releaseisnt com he was lifted through a welter of coiling ropy tentacles w t weird tales pleted in fact i saw a few rushes of it a oneman affair titles the nameless arnold keenes doing it worth sat back and watched how i took that and i must have shown my amazement for it was arnold keene who had directed the notorious ape of god which had wrecked his promising career in films the public doesnt know that picture it never was released sum mit junked it and they had good cause although it was one of the most amaz ingly effective weird films ive ever seen keene had shot most of it down in mex ico and hed been able to assume virtual dictatorship of the location troupe sev eral mexicans had died at the time and there had been some ugly rumors but it had all been hushed up id talked with several people who had been down near taxco with keene and they spoke of the man with peculiar horror he had been willing to sacrifice almost anything to make ape of god a masterpiece of its type it was an unusual picturethere was no question about that theres only one master print of the film and its kept in a locked vault at summit very few have seen it for what machen had done in weird literature keene had done on the screenand it was literally amazing i said to worth arnold keene eh ive always had a sneaking sympathy for the man but i thought hed died long ago oh no he bought a place near tu junga and went into hiding he didnt have much dough after the blowup you know and it took him about five years to get together enough dinero to start his nameless he always said ape of god was a failure and that he intended to do a film that would be a masterpiece of weirdness well hes done it hes canned a film thatsunearthly i tell you it made my flesh creep whos the star i asked unknowns russian trick you know the real star is aa shadow i stared at him thats right pete the shadow of something thats never shown on the screen doesnt sound like much eh but you ought to see it id like to i told him in fact ill do just that maybe hell release it through summit worth chuckled no chance no studio would release that flicker im not even going to play it up in my dirt sheet this is the real mccoy pete whats keenes address i asked worth gave it to me but dont go out till wednesday night he said the rough prints ll be ready then or most of them and keep it under you hat of course a group of autograph hunters came up just then and worth and i were sepa rated it didnt matter id got all the in formation i needed my mind was seeth ing with fantastic surmises keene was one of the great geniuses of the screen and his talent lay in the direction of the macabre unlike book publishers the studios catered to no small discriminat ing audiences a film must suit every body finally i broke away and took ann to a dance at belair but i hadnt forgot ten keene and the next night i was too impatient to wait i telephoned worth but he was out oddly enough i was unable to get in touch with him during the next few days even his paper couldnt help me a furious editor told me the associated press had been sending him hourly telegrams asking for worths copy but the man had vanished com pletely i had a hunch the shadow on the screen it was tuesday night when i drove out of the studio and took a short cut through griffith park past the planetari um to glendale from there i went on to tujunga to the address worth had given me once or twice i had an uneasy sus picion that a black coupé was trailing me but i couldnt be sure arnold keenes house was in a little canyon hidden back in the tujunga moun tains i had to follow a winding dirt road for several miles and ford a stream or two before i readied it the place was built against the side of the canyon and a man stood on the porch and watched me as i braked my car to a stop it was arnold keene i recognized him immediately he was a slender man under middle height with a closely cropped bristle of gray hair his face was coldly austere there had been a rumor that keene had at one time been an offi cer in prussia before he came to holly wood and americanized his name and scrutinizing him i could well believe it his eyes were like pale blue marbles curiously shallow he said peter haviland i did not expect you until tomorrow night i shook hands sorry if i intrude i apologized the fact is i got impatient after what worth told me about your film he isnt here by any chance the shallow eyes were unreadable no but come in luckily the develop ing took less time than i had anticipated i need only a few more shots to complete my task he ushered me into the house which was thoroughly modern and comfortably furnished under the influence of good cognac my suspicions began to dissolve i told keene i had always admired his ape of god he made a wry grimace amateurish haviland i depended too much on ho kum in that film merely devilworship a reincarnated gilles de rais and sadism that isnt true weirdness i was interested thats correct but the film had genuine power man has nothing of the weird in him intrinsically it is only the hints of the utterly abnormal and unhuman that give one the true feeling of weirdness that and human reactions to such supernatural phenomena look at any great weird workthe horla which tells of a mans reaction to a creature utterly alien black woods willows machens black seal lovecrafts color out of spaceall these deal with the absolutely alien influencing normal lives sadism and death may con tribute but alone they cannot produce the true intangible atmosphere of weird ness i had read all these tales but you cant film the indescribable how could you show the invisible beings of the willows keene hesitated i think ill let my film answer that i have a projection room downstairs the bell rang sharply i could not help noticing the quick glance keene darted at me with an apologetic gesture he went out and presently returned with ann howard at his side she was smiling rather shakily did you forget our date pete she asked me i blinked and suddenly remembered two weeks ago i had promised to take ann to an affair in laguna beach this evening but in my preoccupation with keenes picture the date had slipped my mind i stammered apologies oh thats all right she broke in id much rather stay herethat is if mr keene doesnt mind his picture you know about it i told her keene said when she explained why she had come i took the liberty of inviting her to stay to watch the weird tales film i did not want her to drag you away you see he finished smiling some cognac for misseh i introduced them for miss howard and then the nameless at his words a tiny warning note seemed to throb in my brain i had been fingering a heavy metal paperweight and now as keenes attention was momenta rily diverted to the sideboard i slipped it on a sudden impulse into my pocket it would be no defense though against a gun what was wrong with me i wondered an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion seemed to have sprung out of nothing as keene ushered us down into his pro jection room the skin of my back seemed to crawl with the expectation of attack it was inexplicable but definitely un pleasant keene was busy for a time in the pro jection booth and then he joined us modern machinery is a blessing he said with heavy jocularity i can be as lazy as i wish i needed no help with the shooting once the automatic cameras were installed the projector too is au tomatic i felt ann move closer to me in the gloom i put my arm around her and said it helps yes what about releas ing the picture mr keene there was a harsh note in his voice it will not be released the world is uneducated not ready for it in a hun dred years perhaps it will achieve the fame it deserves i am doing it for poster ity and for the sake of creating a weird masterpiece on the screen with a muffled click the projector be gan to operate and a title flashed on the screen the nameless keenes voice came out of the darkness its a silent film except for one sequence at the start sound adds nothing to weird ness and it helps to destroy the illusion of reality later suitable music will be dubbed in i did not answer for a book had flashed on the gray oblong before us that amazing tour de force the circus of doctor lao a hand opened it and a long finger followed the lines as a tone less voice read these are the sports the offthrows of the universe instead of the species these are the weird children of the lust of the spheres mysticism explains them where science cannot listen when that great mysterious fecundity that peopled the worlds at the command of the gods had done with its birthgiving when the celes tial midwives all had left when life had begun in the universe the primal womb thing found itself still unexhausted its loins still potent so that awful fertility tossed on its couch in a final fierce out break of lifegiving and gave birth to these nightmare beings these abortions of the world the voice ceased the book faded and there swam into view a mass of tumbled ruins the ages had pitted the man carved rocks with cracks and scars the basrelief figures were scarcely recog nizable i was reminded of certain ruins i had seen in yucatan the camera swung down the ruins seemed to grow larger a yawning hole gaped in the earth beside me keene said the site of a ruined temple watch now the effect was that of moving forward into the depths of a subterranean pit for a moment the screen was in darkness then a stray beam of sunlight rested on an idol that stood in what was apparently an underground cavern a narrow crack of light showed in the roof the idol was starkly hideous i got only a flashing glimpse but the the shadow on the screen impression on my mind was that of a bulky ovoid shape like a pineapple or a pinecone the thing had certain doubt ful features which lent it a definitely un pleasant appearance but it was gone in a flash dissolving into a brightly lighted drawingroom thronged with gay couples the story proper began at that point none of the actors or actresses was known to me keene must have hired them and worked secretly in his house most of the interiors and a few of the exteriors seemed to have been taken in this very canyon the director had used the parallel trick which saves so much money for studios yearly id often done it myself it simply means that the story is tied in with real life as closely as pos sible that is when i had a troupe working up at lake arrowhead last winter and an unexpected snowfall changed the scene i had the continuity rewritten so that the necessary scenes could take place in snow similarly keene had paralleled his own experiencessometimes almost too closely the nameless told of a man ostra cized by his fellows because of his fanati cal passion for the morbid and bizarre who determined to create a work of art a living masterpiece of sheer weirdness he had experimented before by directing films that were sufficiently unusual to stir up considerable comment but this did not satisfy him it was actingand he wanted something more than that no one can convincingly fake reaction to horror not even the most talented actor he contended the genuine emotion must be felt in order to be transferred to the screen it was here that the nameless ceased to parallel keenes own experiences and branched out into sheer fantasy the pro tagonist in the film was keene himself but this was not unusual as directors often act in their own productions and by deft montage shots the audience learned that keene in his search for au thenticity had gone down into mexico and had with the aid of an ancient scroll found the site of a ruined aztec temple and here as i say reality was left behind as the film entered a morbid and extraor dinary phase there was a god hidden beneath this ruined temple a longforgotten god which had been worshipped even before the aztecs had sprung from the womb of the centuries at least the na tives had considered it a god and had erected a temple in its honor but keene hinted that the thing was actually a sur vival one of the offthrows of the uni verse unique and baroque which had come down through the eons in an exist ence totally alien to mankind the crea ture was never actually seen on the screen save for a few brief glimpses in the shadowed underground temple it was roughly barrelshaped and perhaps ten feet high studded with odd spiky pro jections the chief feature was a gem set in the things rounded apexa smoothly polished jewel as large as a childs head it was in this gem that the beings life was supposed to have its focus it was not dead but neither was it alive in the accepted sense of that term when the aztecs had filled the temple with the hot stench of blood the thing had lived and the jewel had flamed with unearthly radiance but with the passage of time the sacrifices had ceased and the being had sunk into a state of coma akin to hibernation in the picture keene brought it to life he transported it secretly to his home and there in an underground room hol lowed beneath the house he placed the monstergod the room was built with an eye for the purpose for which keene intended it automatic cameras and clever weird tales lighting features were installed so that pictures could be shot from several differ ent angles at once and pieced together later as keene cut the film and now there entered something of the touch of genius which had made keene famous he was clever i had always realized that yet in the scenes that were next unfolded i admired not so much the technical trickswhich were familiar enough to meas the marvelously clever way in which keene had managed to in ject realism into the acting his charac ters did not actthey lived or rather they died for in the pic ture they were thrust into the under ground room to die horribly as sacrifices to the monstergod from the aztec tem ple sacrifice was supposed to bring the thing to life to cause the jewel in which its existence was bound to flare with fan tastic splendor the first sacrifice was i think the most effective the underground room in which the god was hidden was large but quite va cant save for a curtained alcove which held the idol a barred doorway led to the upper room and here keene appeared on the screen revolver in hand herding before him a manoverallclad with a stubble of black beard on his stolid face keene swung open the door motioned his captive into the great room he closed the barred door and through the grating could be seen busy at a switchboard light flared the man stood near the bars and then at keenes gesture with his weapon moved forward slowly to the far wall he stood there staring around vaguely dull apprehension in his face light threw his shadow in bold relief on the wall then another shadow leaped into ex istence beside him it was barrelshaped gigantic studded with blunt spikes and capped by a round dark blobthe lifejewel the shadow of the monster god the man saw it he turned stark horror sprang into his face and at sight of that utterly ghastly and realistic expression a chill struck through me this was almost too convincing the man could not be merely acting but if he was his acting was superb and so was keenes direction the shad ow on the wall stirred and a thrill of movement shook it it rocked and seemed to rise supported by a dozen tentacular appendages that uncoiled from beneath its base the spikeschanged they lengthened they coiled and writhed hideously wormlike it wasnt the metamorphosis of the shadow that held me motionless in my chair rather it wras the appalling ex pression of sheer horror on the mans face he stood gaping as the shadow toppled and swayed on the wall grow ing larger and larger then he fled his mouth an open square of terror the shadow paused with an odd air of inde cision and slipped slowly along the wall out of range of the camera but there were other cameras and keene had used his cuttingshears deftly the movements of the man were mir rored on the screen the glaring lights swung and flared and ever the grim shadow crawled hideously across the wall the thing that cast it was never shown just the shadow and it was a dramatically effective trick too many directors i knew could not have resisted the tempta tion to show the monster thus destroy ing the illusionfor papiermaché and rubber no matter how cleverly con structed cannot convincingly ape reality at last the shadows mergedthe gi gantic swaying thing with its coiling ten tacles and the black shadow of the man that was caught and lifted struggling and kicking frantically the shadows mergedand the man did not reappear the shadow on the screen only the dark blob capping the great shadow faded and flickered as though strange light were streaming from it the light that was fed by sacrifice the jewel that waslife beside me there came a rustle i felt ann stir and move closer in the gloom keenes voice came from some distance away there were several more sacrifice scenes haviland but i havent patched them in yet except for the one youll see in a moment now as i said the film isnt finished i did not answer my eyes were on the screen as the fantastic tale unfolded the pictured keene was bringing another vic tim to his cavern a short fat man with sleekly pomaded black hair i did not see his face until he had been imprisoned in the cave and then abruptly there came a closeup shot probably done with a telescopic lens his plump face with its tiny mustache leaped into gigantic visibility and i recognized andy worth it was the missing columnist but for the first time i saw his veneer of sophisti cation lacking naked fear crawled in his eyes and i leaned forward in my seat as the ghastly barrelshaped shadow sprang out on the wall worth saw it and the expression on his face was shock ing i pushed back my chair and got up as the lights came on the screen went blank arnold keene was staanding by the door erect and military as ever he had a gun in his hand and its muzzle was aimed at my stomach you had better sit down haviland he said quietly you too miss howard ive something to tell youand i dont wish to be melodramatic about it this gunhe glanced at it wrylyis neces sary there are a few things you must know haviland for a reason youll un derstand later i said therell be some visitors here for you soon keene you dont think id neglect normal precautions he shrugged youre lying of course also youre unarmed or youd have had your gun out by now i didnt expect you until tomorrow night but im prepared in a word what i have to tell you is this the film you just saw is a record of actual events anns teeth sank into her lip but i didnt say anything i waited and keene resumed whether you believe me or not doesnt matter for youll have to believe in a few minutes i told you something of my motive my desire to create a genu ine masterpiece of weirdness thats what ive done or will have done before to morrow quite a number of vagrants and laborers have disappeared and the col umnist worth as well but i took care to leave no clues youll be the last to van ishyou and this girl youll never be able to show the film i told him what of it youre a hack haviland and you cant understand what it means to create a masterpiece is a work of art any less beautiful because its hidden ill see the pictureand after im dead the world will see it and realize my genius even though they may fear and hate its expression the reactions of my unwilling actorsthats the trick as a director you should know that theres no substitute for realism the reactions were not fakedthat was obvious enough the first sacrifice was that of a clodan unintelligent moron whose fears were largely superstitious the next sacrifice was of a higher typea vagrant who came begging to my door some months ago you will complete the group for youll know just what youre facing and weird tales your attempt to rationalize your fear will lend an interesting touch both of you will stand up with your hands in the air and precede me into this passage all this came out tonelessly and swift ly quite as though it were a rehearsed speech his hand slid over the wall be side him and a black oblong widened in the oak paneling i stood up do as he says ann i said maybe i can no you cant keene interrupted gesturing impatiently with his weapon you wont have the chance hurry up we went through the opening in the wall and keene followed touching a stud that flooded the passage with light it was a narrow tunnel that slanted down through solid rock for perhaps ten feet to a steep stairway he herded us down this after sliding the panel shut its well hidden he said indicating metal sheathingindeed the entire cor ridor was lined with metal plates this lever opens it from within but no one but me can find the spring which opens it from without the police could wreck the house without discovering this pas sage that seemed worth remembering but of little practical value at the moment ann and i went down the stairway until it ended in another short passage our way was blocked by a door of steel bars which keene unlocked with a key he took from his pocket the passage where we stood was dimly lighted there were sev eral chairs here and the space beyond the barred door was not lighted at all keene opened the door and gestured me through it he locked it behind me and turned to ann her face i saw was paperwhite in the pale glow what happened after that brought an angry curse to my lips without warn ing keene swung the automatic in a short vicious arc smashing it against anns head she saw it coming too late and her upflung hand failed to ward off the blow she dropped without a sound a little trickle of blood oozing from her temple keene stepped over her body to a switch board set in the rock wall light lanced with intolerable brilliance into my eyes i shut them tightly open ing them after a moment to stare around apprehensively i recognized my sur roundings i was in the cave of sacrifice the underground den i had seen on the screen cameras high up on the walls began to operate as i discovered them from various points blinding arclights streamed down upon me a gray curtain shielded a space on the far wall but this was drawn upward to reveal a deep alcove there was an object within that nichea barrelshaped thing ten feet high studded with spikes and crowned with a jewel that pulsed and glittered with cold flame it was gray and varnishedlooking and it was the original of keenes aztec god somehow i felt oddly reassured as i examined the thing it was a model of course inanimate and dead for certainly no life of any kind could exist in such an abnormality keene might have in stalled machinery of some sort within it however you see haviland keene said from beyond the bars the thing actually ex ists i got on the trail of it in an old parchment i found in the huntington li brary it had been considered merely an interesting bit of folklore but i saw something else in it when i was making ape of god in mexico i discovered the ruined temple and what lay forgotten behind the altar he touched a switch and light streamed out from the alcove behind the thing swiftly i turned on the wall be the shadow on the screen hind me was my own shadow grotesquely elongated and beside it was the squat amorphous patch of blackness i had seen on the screen upstairs my back was toward keene and my fingers crept into my pocket touching the metal paperweight i had dropped there earlier that evening briefly i con sidered the possibility of hurling the thing at keene and then decided against it the bars were too close together and the man would shoot me at any sign of dan gerous hostility my eyes were drawn to the shadow on the wall it was moving it rocked slightly and lifted the spikes lengthened the thing was no longer inanimate and dead and as i swung about stark amazement gripping me i saw the incredible metamorphosis that had taken place in the thing that cast the shadow it was no longer barrelshaped a dozen smooth glistening appendages ending in flat pads supported the snake thin body and all over that grayish up right pole tentacles sprouted and length ened writhing into ghastly life as the horror awakened keene had not lied and the monstrous survival he had brought from the aztec temple was lum bering from the alcove its myriad ten tacles alive with frightful hunger keene saved me he saw me standing motionless with abysmal fear in the path of that gigantic nightmare being and realizing that he was being cheated of his picture the man shouted at me to run his hoarse voice broke the spell that held me unmoving and i whirled and fled across the cave to the barred door skin ripped from my hands as i tore at the bars run keene yelled at me his shal low eyes blazing it cant move fast look out a writhing snakelike thing lashed out and a sickening musky stench filled my nostrils i leaped away racing across the cave again the arclights died and others flared into being as keene manipu lated the switchboard he was adjusting the lights so that our shadows would not be lostso that in the climax of the nameless the shadow of that ghastly hor ror would be thrown on the cave wall beside me it was an infernal game of tag we played there in those shifting lights that glared down while the camera lenses watched dispassionately i fled and dodged with my pulses thundering and blood pounding in my temples and ever the grim shadow moved slowly across the walls while my legs began to ache with the strain for hours perhaps or eons i fled there would come brief periods of respite when i would cling to the bars cursing keene but he would not answer his hands flickered over the switchboard as he adjusted the arclights and his eyes never paused in their roving examination of the cave in the end it was this that saved me for keene did not see ann stir and open her eyes he did not see the girl after a swift glance around get quietly to her feet luckily she was behind keene and he did not turn i tried to keep my eyes away from ann but i do not think i succeeded at the last moment i saw keenes face change and he started back but the chair in anns hands crashed down and splintered on the mans head he fell to his knees clawing at the air and then collapsed inertly i was on the far side of the cave and my attention was momentarily diverted from the monster i had been watching it from the corner of my eye expecting to be able to dodge and leap away before weird tales it came too close but it lumbered forward with a sudden burst of speed although i tried to spring clear i failed a tentacle whipped about my legs and sent me sprawling as i tried to roll away an other smooth gray coil got my left arm intolerable agony dug into my shoul der as i was lifted i heard ann scream and a gun barked angrily bullets plopped into the smooth flesh of the monster but it paid no attention i was lifted through a welter of coiling ropy tentacles until just above me was the flaming jewel in which the creatures life was centered remembrance of keenes words spurred me to action this might be the monsters vulnerable point the paperweight was still in my pocket and i clawed it out desperately i hurled it with all my strength at the shining gem and the jewel shattered there came a shrill vibration like the tinkling of countless tiny crystalline bells piercingly sweet it shrilled in my ears and died away quickly and suddenly nothing existed but light it was as though the shattering of the gem had released a sea of incandescent flame imprisoned within it the glare of the arclights faded beside this flood of silvery radiance that bathed me the cold glory of arcturus the blaze of tropical moonlight were in the light swiftly it faded and fled away i felt myself dropping and pain lanced into my wrenched shoulder as i struck the ground i heard anns voice dazedly i got up expecting to see the monster towering above me but it was gone in its place a few feet away was the barrelshaped thing i had first seen in the alcove there was a gaping cav ity in the rounded apex where the jewel had been and somehow i sensed that the creature was no longer deadly no longer a horror i saw ann she was still holding keenes gun and in her other hand was the key with which she had unlocked the door she came running toward me and i went swiftly to meet her i took the gun and made sure it was loaded come on i said curtly were getting out of here anns fingers were gripping my arm tightly as we went through the door past the prone figure of keene and up the stairway the lever behind the panel was not difficult to operate and i followed ann through the opening into the theater then i paused listen ing ann turned watching me a question in her eyes what is it pete listen i said get the cans of film from the projection booth well take them with us and burn them butyoure not ill be with you in a minute i told her and swung the panel shut i went down the stairs swiftly and very quietly my gun ready and my ears alert for the low muttering i had heard from below keene was no longer unconscious he was standing beside the switchboard with his back to me and over his shoulder i could see the shadow of the monstergod sprawling on the wall inert and lifeless keene was chanting something in a lan guage i did not know and his hands were moving in strange gestures god knows what unearthly powers keene had acquired in his search for horror for as i stood there watching the patch of blackness on the cave wall i saw a little shudder rock that barrel shaped shadow of horror while a single spike abruptly lengthened into a tentacle that groped out furtively and drew back and vanished then i killed arnold keene we shall meet again perhaps in the shining mists of orions sword beyond the wall of sleep by h p lovecraft what strange splendid yet terrible experiences came to the poor mountaineer in the hours of sleepa story of a supernal being from algol the demonstar i have often wondered if the ma jority of mankind ever pause to re fleet upon the occasionally titanic sig nificance of dreams and of the obscure world to which they belong whilst the greater number of our nocturnal visions are perhaps no more than faint and fan tastic reflections of our waking experi encesfreud to the contrary with his puerile symbolismthere are still a cer weird tales tain remainder whose immundane and ethereal character permits of no ordinary interpretation and whose vaguely excit ing and disquieting effect suggests pos sible minute glimpses into a sphere of mental existence no less important than physical life yet separated from that life by an all but impassable barrier from my experience i cannot doubt but that man when lost to terrestrial conscious ness is indeed sojourning in another and uncorporeal life of far different nature from the life we know and of which only the slightest and most indistinct memories linger after waking from those blurred and fragmentary memories we may infer much yet prove little we may guess that in dreams life matter and vitality as the earth knows such things are not neces sarily constant and that time and space do not exist as our waking selves com prehend them sometimes i believe that this less material life is our truer life and that our vain presence on the terraqueous globe is itself the secondary or merely virtual phenomenon it was from a youthful revery filled with speculations of this sort that i arose one afternoon in the winter of when to the state psychopathic institution in which i served as an interne was brought the man whose case has ever since haunted me so unceasingly his name as given on the records was joe slater or slaader and his appearance was that of the typical denizen of the cats kill mountain region one of those strange repellent scions of a primitive colonial peasant stock whose isolation for nearly three centuries in the hilly fast nesses of a littletraveled countryside has caused them to sink to a kind of barbaric degeneracy rather than advance with their more fortunately placed brethren of the thickly settled districts among these odd folk who correspond exactly to the deca dent element of white trash in the south law and morals are nonexistent and their general mental status is prob ably below that of any other section of the native american people joe slater who came to the institution in the vigilant custody of four state police men and who was described as a highly dangerous character certainly presented no evidence of his perilous disposition when i first beheld him though well above the middle stature and of some what brawny frame he was given an ab surd appearance of harmless stupidity by the pale sleepy blueness of his small watery eyes the scantiness of his neglect ed and nevershaven growth of yellow beard and the listless drooping of his heavy nether lip his age was unknown since among his kind neither family rec ords nor permanent family ties exist but from the baldness of his head in front and from the decayed condition of his teeth the head surgeon wrote him down as a man of about forty from the medical and court documents we learned all that could be gathered of his case this man a vagabond hunter and trapper had always been strange in the eyes of his primitive associates he had habitually slept at night beyond the ordinary time and upon waking would often talk of unknown things in a man ner so bizarre as to inspire fear even in the hearts of an unimaginative populace not that his form of language was at all unusual for he never spoke save in the debased patois of his environment but the tone and tenor of his utterances were of such mysterious wildness that none might listen without apprehension he himself was generally as terrified and baffled as his auditors and within an hour after awakening would forget all that he had said or at least all that had caused him to say what he did relapsing into a bovine halfamiable normality like that of the other hilldwellers beyond the wall of sleep as slater grew older it appeared his matutinal aberrations had gradually in creased in frequency and violence till about a month before his arrival at the institution had occurred the shocking tragedy which caused his arrest by the authorities one day near noon after a profound sleep begun in a whisky de bauch at about five of the previous after noon the man had roused himself most suddenly with ululations so horrible and unearthly that they brought several neigh bors to his cabina filthy sty where he dwelt with a family as indescribable as himself rushing out into the snow he had flung his arms aloft and commenced a series of leaps directly upward in the air the while shouting his determination to reach some big big cabin with bright ness in the roof and walls and floor and the loud queer music far away as two men of moderate size sought to restrain him he had struggled with maniacal force and fury screaming of his desire and need to find and kill a certain thing that shines and shakes and laughs at length after temporarily felling one of his detainers with a sudden blow he had flung himself upon the other in a demo niac ecstasy of bloodthirstiness shriek ing fiendishly that he would jump high in the air and burn his way through any thing that stopped him family and neighbors had now fled in a panic and when the more courageous of them returned slater was gone leaving behind an unrecognizable pulplike thing that had been a living man but an hour before none of the mountaineers had dared to pursue him and it is likely that they would have welcomed his death from the cold but when several mornings later they heard his screams from a distant ra vine they realized that he had somehow managed to survive and that his removal in one way or another would be necessary then had followed an armed searching party whose purpose whatever it may have been originally became that of a sheriffs posse after one of the seldom popular state troopers had by accident observed then questioned and finally joined the seekers on the third day slater was found unconscious in the hollow of a tree and taken to the nearest jail where alien ists from albany examined him as soon as his senses returned to them he told a simple story he had he said gone to sleep one afternoon about sundown after drinking much liquor he had awaked to find himself standing bloodyhanded in the snow before his cabin the mangled corpse of his neighbor peter slader at his feet horrified he had taken to the woods in a vague effort to escape from the scene of what must have been his crime beyond these things he seemed to know nothing nor could the expert ques tioning of his interrogators bring out a single additional fact that night slater slept quietly and the next morning he wakened with no singu lar feature save a certain alteration of ex pression doctor barnard who had been watching the patient thought he noticed in the pale blue eyes a certain gleam of peculiar quality and in the flaccid lips an all but imperceptible tightening as if of intelligent determination but when questioned slater relapsed into the habit ual vacancy of the mountaineer and only reiterated what he had said on the pre ceding day on the third morning occurred the first of the mans mental attacks after some show of uneasiness in sleep he burst forth into a frenzy so powerful that the combined efforts of four men were need ed to bind him in a straitjacket the alienists listened with keen attention to his words since their curiosity had been aroused to a high pitch by the suggestive weird tales yet mostly conflicting and incoherent stories of his family and neighbors slater raved for upward of fifteen minutes bab bling in his backwoods dialect of green edifices of light oceans of space strange music and shadowy mountains and val leys but most of all did he dwell upon some mysterious blazing entity that shook and laughed and mocked at him this vast vague personality seemed to have done him a terrible wrong and to kill it in triumphant revenge was his para mount desire in order to reach it he said he would soar through abysses of emptiness burning every obstacle that stood in his way thus ran his discourse until with the greatest suddenness he ceased the fire of madness died from his eyes and in dull wonder he looked at his questioners and asked why he was bound r barnard unbuckled the leather harness and did not restore it till night when he succeeded in persuading slater to don it of his own volition for his own good the man had now admitted that he sometimes talked queeriy though he knew not why within a week two more attacks ap peared but from them the doctors learned little on the source of slaters visions they speculated at length for since he could neither read nor write and had apparent ly never heard a legend or fairytale his gorgeous imagery was quite inexplicable that it could not come from any known myth or romance was made especially clear by the fact that the unfortunate lunatic expressed himself only in his own simple manner he raved of things he did not understand and could not inter pret things which he claimed to have ex perienced but which he could not have learned through any normal or connected narration the alienists soon agreed that abnormal dreams were the foundation of the trouble dreams whose vividness could for a time completely dominate the wak ing mind of this basically inferior man with due formality slater was tried for murder acquitted on the ground of in sanity and committed to the institution wherein i held so humble a post i have said that i am a constant specu lator concerning dreamlife and from this you may judge of the eagerness with which i applied myself to the study of the new patient as soon as i had fully ascertained the facts of his case he seemed to sense a ccrtain friendliness in me born no doubt of the interest i could not conceal and the gentle manner in which i questioned him not that he ever recognized me during his attacks when i hung breathlessly upon his chaotic but cosmic wordpictures but he knew me in his quiet hours when he would sit by his barred window weaving baskets of straw and willow and perhaps pining for the mountain freedom he could never again enjoy his family never called to see him probably it had found another temporary head after the manner of decadent moun tain folk by degrees i commenced to feel an overwhelming wonder at the mad and fantastic conceptions of joe slater the man himself was pitiably inferior in men tality and language alike but his glowing titanic visions though described in a bar barous disjointed jargon were assuredly things which only a superior or even ex ceptional brain could conceive how i often asked myself could the stolid im agination of a catskill degenerate conjure up sights whose very possession argued a lurking spark of genius how could any backwoods dullard have gained so much as an idea of those glittering realms of supernal radiance and space about which slater ranted in his furious de lirium more and more i inclined to the belief that in the pitiful personality who cringed before me lay the disordered beyond the wall of sleep nucleus of something beyond my com prehension something infinitely beyond the comprehension of my more experi enced but less imaginative medical and scientific colleagues and yet i could extract nothing definite from the man the sum of all my in vestigation was that in a kind of semi corporeal dreamlife slater wandered or floated through resplendent and pro digious valleys meadows gardens cities and palaces of light in a region unbound ed and unknown to man that there he was no peasant or degenerate but a crea ture of importance and vivid life moving proudly and dominantly and checked only by a certain deadly enemy who seemed to be a being of visible yet ethereal structure and who did not ap pear to be of human shape since slater never referred to it as a man or as aught save a thing this thing had done slater some hideous but unnamed wrong which the maniac if maniac he were yearned to avenge from the manner in which slater al luded to their dealings i judged that he and the luminous thing had met on equal terms that in his dream existence the man was himself a luminous thing of the same race as his enemy this impression was sustained by his frequent references to flying through space and burning all that impeded his progress yet these con ceptions were formulated in rustic words wholly inadequate to convey them a cir cumstance which drove me to the con clusion that if a true dream world indeed existed oral language was not its medium for the transmission of thought could it be that the dream soul inhabiting this inferior body was desperately struggling to speak things which the simple and halting tongue of dullness could not ut ter could it be that i was face to face with intellectual emanations which would explain the mystery if i could but learn to discover and read them i did not tell the older physicians of these things for middle age is skeptical cynical and dis inclined to accept new ideas besides the head of the institution had but lately warned me in his paternal way that i was overworking that my mind needed a rest it had long been my belief that human thought consists basically of atomic or molecular motion convertible into ether waves of radiant energy like heat light and electricity this belief had early led me to contemplate the possibility of telep athy or mental communication by means of suitable apparatus and i had in my college days prepared a set of transmitting and receiving instruments somewhat simi lar to the cumbrous devices employed in wireless telegraphy at that crude pre radio period these i had tested with a fellowstudent but achieving no result had soon packed them away with other scientific odds and ends for possible fu ture use now in my intense desire to probe in to the dreamlife of joe slater i sought these instruments again and spent sev eral days in repairing them for action when they were complete once more i missed no opportunity for their trial at each outburst of slaters violence i would fit the transmitter to his forehead and the receiver to my own constantly making delicate adjustments for various hypo thetical wavelengths of intellectual en ergy i had but little notion of how the thoughtimpressions would if successfully conveyed arouse an intelligent response in my brain but i felt certain that i could detect and interpret them accordingly i continued my experiments though in forming no one of their nature it was on the twentyfirst of february that the thing occurred as i look back across the years i realize how unreal it seems and sometimes half won weird tales der if old doctor fenton was not right when he charged it all to my excited im agination i recall that he listened with great kindness and patience when i told him but afterward gave me a nerve powder and arranged for the halfyears vacation on which i departed the next week that fateful night i was wildly agitated and perturbed for despite the excellent care he had received joe slater was un mistakably dying perhaps it was his mountain freedom that he missed or per haps the turmoil in his brain had grown too acute for his rather sluggish physique but at all events the flame of vitality flickered low in the decadent body he was drowsy near the end and as darkness fell he dropped off into a troubled sleep i did not strap on the strait jacket as was customary when he slept since i saw that he was too feeble to be dangerous even if he woke in mental disorder once more before passing away but i did place upon his head and mine the two ends of my cosmic radio hoping against hope for a first and last message from the dream world in the brief time remaining in the cell with us was one nurse a mediocre fellow who did not understand the purpose of the apparatus or think to inquire into my course as the hours wore on i saw his head droop awkwardly in sleep but i did not disturb him i myself lulled by the rhythmical breathing of the healthy and the dying man must have nodded a little later the sound of weird lyric melody was what aroused me chords vibrations and harmonic ecstasies echoed passionately on every hand while on my ravished sight burst the stupendous spectacle of ultimate beauty walls columns and architraves of living fire blazed effulgently around the spot where i seemed to float in air extending upward to an infinitely high vaulted dome of indescribable splendor blending with this display of palatial magnificence or rather supplanting it at times in kaleidoscopic rotation were glimpses of wide plains and graceful val leys high mountains and inviting grot toes covered with every lovely attribute of scenery which my delighted eyes could conceive of yet formed wholly of some glowing ethereal plastic entity which in consistency partook as much of spirit as of matter as i gazed i perceived that my own brain held the key to these en chanting metamorphoses for each vista which appeared to me was the one my changing mind most wished to behold amidst this elysian realm i dwelt not as a stranger for each sight and sound was familiar to me just as it had been for uncounted eons of eternity before and would be for like eternities to come then the resplendent aura of my brother of light drew near and held col loquy with me soul to soul with silent and perfect interchange of thought the hour was one of approaching triumph for was not my fellowbeing escaping at last from a degrading periodic bondage escaping for ever and preparing to follow the accursed oppressor even unto the ut termost fields of ether that upon it might be wrought a flaming cosmic vengeance which would shake the spheres we floated thus for a little time when i per ceived a slight blurring and fading of the objects around us as though some force were recalling me to earthwhere i least wished to go the form near me seemed to feel a change also for it gradually brought its discourse toward a conclu sion and itself prepared to quit the scene fading from my sight at a rate somewhat less rapid than that of the other objects a few more thoughts were ex changed and i knew that the luminous one and i were being recalled to bondage though for my brother of light it would w t beyond the wall of sleep be the last time the sorry planet shell being wellnigh spent in less than an hour my fellow would be free to pursue the oppressor along the milky way and past the hither stars to the very confines of infinity a welldefined shock separates my final impression of the fading scene of light from my sudden and somewhat shamefaced awakening and straightening up in my chair as i saw the dying figure on the couch move hesitantly joe slater was indeed awaking though probably for the last time as i looked more closely i saw that in the sallow cheeks shone spots of color which had never before been present the lips too seemed un usual being tightly compressed as if by the force of a stronger character than had been slaters the whole face finally be gan to grow tense and the head turned restlessly with closed eyes i did not rouse the sleeping nurse but readjusted the slightly disarranged head bands of my telepathic radio intent to catch any parting message the dreamer might have to deliver all at once the head turned sharply in my direction and the eyes fell open causing me to stare in blank amazement at what i beheld the man who had been joe slater the catskill decadent was now gazing at me with a pair of luminous expanding eyes whose blue seemed subtly to have deepened neither mania nor degeneracy was visible in that gaze and i felt beyond a doubt that i was viewing a face behind which lay an active mind of high order at this juncture my brain became aware of a steady external influence operating upon it i closed my eyes to concentrate my thoughts more profoundly and was rewarded by the positive knowledge that my longsought mental message bad come at last each transmitted idea formed rapidly in my mind and though no ac tual language was employed my habitual association of conception and expression was so great that i seemed to be receiv ing the message in ordinary english joe slater is dead came the soul petrifying voice of an agency from be yond the wall of sleep my opened eyes sought the couch of pain in curious hor ror but the blue eyes were still calmly gazing and the countenance was still in telligently animated he is better dead for he was unfit to bear the active intellect of cosmic entity his gross body could not undergo the needed adjustments be tween ethereal life and planet life he was too much an animal too little a man yet it is through his deficiency that you have come to discover me for the cosmic and planet souls rightly should never meet he has been in my torment and diurnal prison for fortytwo of your ter restrial years i am an entity like that which you yourself become in the freedom of dream less sleep i am your brother of light and have floated with you in the effulgent valleys it is not permitted me to tell your waking earthself of your real self but we are all roamers of vast spaces and travelers in many ages next year i may be dwelling in the egypt which you call ancient or in the cruel empire of tsan chan which is to come three thousand years hence you and i have drifted to the worlds that reel about the red arc turus and dwelt in the bodies of the in sectphilosophers that crawl proudly over the fourth moon of jupiter how little does the earth self know life and its ex tent how little indeed ought it to know for its own tranquillity of the oppressor i cannot speak you on earth have unwittingly felt its distant presenceyou who without knowing idly gave the blinking beacon the name of algol the demonstar it is to meet and w t weird tales conquer the oppressor that i have vainly striven for eons held back by bodily en cumbrances tonight i go as a nemesis bearing just and blazingly cataclysmic vengeance watch me in the sky close by the demonstar i cannot speak longer for the body of joe slater grows cold and rigid and the coarse brains are ceasing to vibrate as i wish you have been my only friend on this planetthe only soul to sense and seek for me within the repellent form which lies on this couch we shall meet againperhaps in the shining mists of orions sword perhaps on a bleak pla teau in prehistoric asia perhaps in un remembered dreams tonight perhaps in some other form an eon hence when the solar system shall have been swept away at this point the thoughtwaves ab ruptly ceased and the pale eyes of the dreameror can i say dead mancom menced to glaze fishily in a halfstupor i crossed over to the couch and felt of his wrist but found it cold stiff and pulse less the sallow cheeks paled again and the thick lips fell open disclosing the repulsively rotten fangs of the degenerate joe slater i shivered pulled a blanket over the hideous face and awakened the nurse then i left the cell and went si lently to my room i had an instant and unaccountable craving for a sleep whose dreams i should not remember the climax what plain tale of sci ence can boast of such a rhetorical effect i have merely set down certain things appealing to me as facts allowing you to construe them as you will as i have already admitted my superior old doctor fenton denies the reality of every thing i have related he vows that i was broken down with nervous strain and badly in need of the long vacation on full pay which he so generously gave me he assures me on his professional honor that joe slater was but a lowgrade paranoiac whose fantastic notions must have come from the crude hereditary folktales which circulated in even the most decadent of communities all this he tells meyet i cannot forget what i saw in the sky on the night after slater died lest you think me a biased witness another pen must add this final testimony which may per haps supply the climax you expect i will quote the following account of the star nova persei verbatim from the pages of that eminent astronomical authority pro fessor garrett p serviss on february a marvelous new star was discovered by doctor ander son of edinburgh not very far from algol no star had been visible at that point before within twentyfour hours the stranger had become so bright that it outshone capella in a week or two it had visibly faded and in the course of a few months it was hardly discernible with the naked eye the strange witch ointments gave it beast form and beast heart the hairy ones shall dance by gans t field a novel of a hideous stark horror that struck during a spirit séance a tale of terror and sudden death and the frightful thing that laired in the devils croft the story thus far talbot wills the narrator is a former stage magician skeptical of psychic phenomena he goes with doctor zoberg to an isolated hamlet where says zoberg lives a medium who will prove the case for spiritism the medium is an attractive girl susan gird at a séance a bestial shape appears in the darkened room and kills john gird the mediums father the town this story began in weird tales for january weird tales constable accuses wills as the only per son able to escape the manacles which confined everyone in the room a mob gathers to lynch the supposed murderer and he manages to escape from a cell fleeing for shelter to a grove on the edge of town this is called the devils croft and custom and local law forbid anyone to enter it once inside he finds though a blizzard rages without the grove is as warm and green as the tropics in its depths he en counters and fights with the same beast shape that killed john gird by a lucky blow he stuns it and is horrified to see it turning gradually human he flees from the grove and meets judge keith pursui vant a scholarly recluse who shelters him and shows him by logic and by quotation of distinguished authorities that a were wolf can be explained by the spiritist the ory of ectoplasmic materialization the following day judge pursuivant goes to town to observe conditions and sends susan gird to his home to talk to wills the two are beginning to be drawn to each other though in wills mind lingers the possibility that susan gird may have a complex personality that sometimes materializes the beastthing returning from town the judge tells them that the mysterious monster appar ently still in the forbidden grove has claimed another victim the story continues to meet that monster face to face i think that both susan and i fairly reeled before this news like actors registering surprize in an oldfashioned melodrama as for judge pursuivant he turned to the table cut a generous wedge of the meat pie and set it all savory and steaming on a plate for himself his calm zest for the good food gave us oth ers steadiness again so that we sat down and even ate a little as he described his day in town he had found opportunity to talk to susan in private confiding in her about me and finally sending her to me this as he said so that we would convince each other of our respective innocences it was purely an inspiration for he had had no idea of course that such convic tion would turn out so final thereafter he made shift to enter the gird house and talk to doctor zoberg that worthy he found sitting somewhat limply in the parlor with john girds coffin in the next room zoberg the judge reported was mystified about the murder and anxious to bring to justice the townsfolk there were more than one it seemed who had beaten him most of all however he was concerned about the charges against me his greatest anxiety is to prove you innocent judge pursuivant informed me he intends to bring the best lawyer possible for your defense is willing even to assist in paying the fee he also swears that character witnesses can be brought to testify that you are the most peaceable and lawabiding man in the country thats mighty decent of him i said according to your reasoning of this morning his attitude proves him inno cent too what reasoning was that asked susan and i was glad that the judge con tinued without answering her i was glad that i had sent miss susan on if your car had remained there mr wills doctor zoberg might have driven off in it to rally your defenses not if i know him i objected the whole business what of the mys tery and occult significances will hold him right on the spot hes relentlessly the hairy ones shall dance curious and despite his temporary col lapse hes no coward i agree with that chimed in susan as for my pursuers of the previous night the judge went on they had been roaming the snowcovered streets in twos and threes heavily armed for the most part and still determined to punish me for killing their neighbor the council was too frightened or too perplexed to deal with the situation and the constable was still in bed with his brother assum ing authority when judge pursuivant made his inquiries the judge went to see the wounded man who very pluckily determined to rise and take up his duties again ill arrest the man who plugged me obryant had promised grimly and that kid brother of mine can quit playing policeman the judge applauded these sentiments and brought him hot food and whisky which further braced his spirits in the evening came the invasion by the younger obryant of the devils croft and his resultant death at the claws and teeth of what prowled there his throat was so torn open and filled with blood that he could not speak the judge concluded but he pointed back into the timber and then tried to trace something in the snow with his finger it looked like a wolfs head with pointed nose and ears he died before he finished you saw him come out i asked no id gone back to town but later i saw the body and the sketch in the snow he finished his dinner and pushed back his chair now he said heartily its up to us up to us to do what i inquired to meet that monster face to face he replied there are three of us and so far as i can ascertain but one of the enemy both susan and i started to speak but he held up his hand smiling i know without being reminded that the odds are still against us because the one enemy is fierce and blooddrinking and can change shape and character maybe it can project itself to a distancewhich makes it all the harder both for us to face it and for us to get help i know what you mean by that last i nodded gloomily if there were ten thousand friendly constables in the neigh borhood instead of a single hostile one they wouldnt believe us right agreed judge pursuivant were like the group of perplexed mor tals in dracula who had only their own wits and weapons against a monster no more forbidding than ours it is hard to show clearly how his con stant offering of parallels and rational izations comforted us only the unknown and unknowable can terrify completely we three were even cheerful over a bot tle of wine that william fetched and poured out in three glasses judge pur suivant gave us a toastmay wolves go hungryand susan and i drank it gladly dont forget whats on our side said the judge putting down his glass i mean the stedfast and courageous heart of which i preached to wills last night and which we can summon from within us any time and anywhere the werewolf dauntlessly faced loses its dread and i think we are the ones to face it now were ready for action i said that i would welcome any kind of action whatsoever and susan touched my arm as if in endorsement of the re mark judge pursuivants spectacles glit tered in approval you two will go into the devils croft he announced im going back to town once more weird tales into the devils croft we almost shouted both in the same shocked breath of course didnt we just get through with the agreement all around that the lycanthrope can and must be met face to face offense is the best defense as per haps one hundred thousand athletic train ers have reiterated ive already faced the creature once i reminded him as for appearing dauntless i doubt my own powers of deceit you shall have a weapon he said a fire gives light and we know that such things must have darknesssuch as it finds in the midst of that swampy wood so fill your pockets with matches both of you how about a gun i asked but he shook his head we dont want the werewolf killed that would leave the whole business in mystery and yourself probably charged with another murder hed return to his human shape you know the moment he was hurt even slightly susan spoke very calmly im ready to go into the croft judge pursuivant he clapped his hands loudly as if ap plauding in a theater bravo my dear bravo i see mr wills sets his jaw that means hes ready to go with you very well let us be off he called to william who at his or ders brought three lanternssturdy old fashioned affairs protected by strong wire nettingsand filled them with oil we each took one and set out it had turned clear and frosty once more and the moon shone too brightly for my comfort at least however as we approached the grove we saw no sentinels they could hardly be blamed for deserting after the fate of the younger obryant we gained the shadow of the outer cedars unchallenged here judge pursui vant called a halt produced a match from his overcoat pocket and lighted our lan terns all around i remember that we struck a fresh light for susans lantern we agreed that silly as the threeona match superstition might be this was no time or place to tempt providence come on said judge pursuivant then and led the way into the darkest part of the immense thicket we are here at his mercy we followed judge pursuivant susan and i without much of a thought beyond an understandable dislike for being left alone on the brink of the timber it was a slight struggle to get through the closeset cedar hedge espe rially for susan but beyond it we soon caught up with the judge he strode heavily and confidently among the trees his lantern held high to shed light upon broad polished leaves and thick wet stems the moist warmth of the groves interior made itself felt again and the judge explained again and at greater length the hot springs that made pos sible this surprizing condition all the while he kept going he seemed to know his way in that forbidden fastnessin deed he must have explored it many times to go straight to his destination that destination was a clearing in some degree like the one where i had met and fought with my hairy pursuer on the night before this place had however a great tree in its center with brandies that shot out in all directions to hide away the sky completely by strain ing the ears one could catch a faint mur mur of watermy scalding stream no doubt around us were the thickset trunks of the forest filled in between with brush and vines and underfoot grew velvety moss this will be our headquarters posi tion said the judge wills help me the hairy ones shall dance gather wood for a fire break dead branches from the standing treesnever mind picking up wood from the ground it will be too damp together we collected a considerable heap and crumpling a bit of paper in its midst he kindled it now then he went on im head ing for town you two will stay here and keep each other company he took our lanterns blew them out and ran his left arm through the loops of their handles im sure that nothing will attack you in the light of the fire youre bound to attract whatever skulks hereabouts how ever when i come back we ought to be prepared to go into the final act of our little melodrama he touched my hand bowed to susan and went tramping away into the timber the thick leafage blotted his lantern light from our view before his back had been turned twenty seconds susan and i gazed at each other and smiled rather uneasily its warm she breathed and took off her cloak dropping it upon one of the humped roots of the great central tree she sat down on it with her back to the trunk what kind of a tree is this i gazed up at the gnarled stem or as much of it as i could see in the firelight finally i shook my head i dont knowim no expert i ad mitted at least its very big and un doubtedly very oldthe sort of tree that used to mark a place of sacrifice at the word sacrifice susan lifted her shoulders as if in distaste youre right talbot it would be something grim and druidlike she began to re cite half to herself that tree in whose dark shadowthe ghastly priest doth reignthe priest who slew the slayer and shall himself be slain macaulay i said at once then to get her mind off of morbid things i had to recite the lays of ancient rome in school when i was a boy i wish you hadnt mentioned it you mean because its an evil omen she shook her head and contrived a smile that lighted up her pale face its not that if you analyze it shall himself be slainit sounds as if the enemys fate is sealed i nodded then spun around sharply for i fancied i heard a dull crashing at the edge of the clearing then i went here and there gathering wood enough to keep our fire burning for some time one branch a thick straight one i chose from the heap and leaned against the big tree within easy reach of my hand thats for a club i told susan and she half shrunk half stiffened at the im plication we fell to talking about judge pursui vant the charm and the enigma that in vested him both of us felt gratitude that he had immediately clarified our own in nocence in the grisly slayings but to both came a sudden inspiration distasteful and disquieting i spoke first susan why did the judge bring us here he said to help face and defeat the monster butbut who is that monster i demanded what human being puts on a semi bestial appearance to rend and kill yyou dont mean the judge as i say it had been in both our minds we were silent and felt shame and em barrassment look here i went on earnestly after a moment perhaps were being ungrate ful but we mustnt be unprepared think susan nobody knows where judge pursuivant was at the time of your fa thers death at the time i saw the thing in these woods i broke off remember weird tales ing how i had met the judge for the first time so shortly after my desperate strug gle with the pointeared demon no body knows where he was when the con stables brother was attacked and mortally wounded she gazed about fearfully nobody she added breathlessly knows where he is now i was remembering a conversation with him he had spoken of books mentioning a rare a supposedly nonexistent volume what was it the wicked bible and what was it i had once heard about that work it came back to me now out of the subconscious brainchamber where ap parently one stores everything he hears or reads in idleness and from which such items creep on occasion it had been in lewis spences encyclopedia of occult ism now on the shelf in my new york apartment the wicked bible scripture for witches and wizards from which magicmongers of the dark ages drew their inspiration and their knowledge and judge pur suivant had admitted to having one what had he learned from it how had he been so glib about the science yes and the psychologyof being a werewolf if what we suspect is true i said to susan we are here at his mercy no body is going to come in here not if horses dragged them at his leisure he will fall upon us and tear us to pieces but even as i spoke i despised myself for my weak fears in her presence i picked up my club and was comforted by its weight and thickness i met that devil once i said study ing cheer and confidence into my voice this time i dont think it relished the meeting any too much next time wont be any more profitable for it she smiled at me as if in comradely encouragement then we both started and fell silent there had risen somewhere among the thickets a long low whining i put out a foot stealthily as though fearful of being caught in motion a quick kick flung more wood on the fire i blinked in the light and felt the heat standing there as a primitive man might have stood in his flameguarded camp to face the horrors of the ancient world i tried to judge by ear the direction of that whine it died and i heard perhaps in my imagination a stealthy padding then the whining began again from a new quarter and nearer i made myself step toward it my shadow leaping grotesquely among the tree trunks almost frightened me out of my wits the whine had changed into a crooning wail such as that with which dogs salute the full moon it seemed to plead to promise and it was coming closer to the clearing once before i had challenged and taunted the thing with scornful words now i could not make my lips form a single syllable probably it was just as well for i thought and watched the more something black and cautious was mov ing among the branches just beyond the shrubbery that screened it from our fire light i knew without need of a clear view what that black something was i lifted my club to the ready the sound it made had become in some fashion articulate though not human in any quality there were no words to it but it spoke to the heart the note of plea and promise had become one of com mandand not directed to me i found my own voice get out of here you devil i roared at it and threw my club even as i let go of it i wished i had not the bushes foiled my aim and the missile crashed the hairy ones shall dance among them and dropped to the mossy ground the creature fell craftily silent then i felt sudden panic and regret at being left weaponless and i retreated toward the fire susan i said huskily give me an other stick hurry she did not move or stir and i rum maged frantically among the heaped dry branches for myself catching up the first piece of wood that would serve i turned to her with worried curiosity she was still seated upon the cloak draped root but she had drawn herself tense like a cat before a mousehole her head was thrust forward so far that her neck extended almost horizontally her dilated eyes were turned in the di rection from which the whining and crooning had come they had a strange clarity in them as if they could pierce the twigs and leaves and meet there an answering understanding gaze susan i cried still she gave no sign that she heard me if hear me she did she leaned far ther forward as if ready to spring up and run once more the unbeastly wail rose from the place where our watcher was lurking susans lips trembled from them came slowly and softly then louder a longdrawn answering howl aoooooooooooooo aoooooooooooo ooooooo the stick almost fell from my hands she rose slowly but confidently her shoulders hunched high her arms hung forward as though they wanted to reach to the ground again she howled aoooooooooooooooooooo i saw that she was going to move across the clearing toward the trees through the trees my heart seemed to twist into a knot inside me but i could not let her do such a thing i made a quick stride and planted myself before her susan you mustnt she shrank back her face turning slow ly up to mine her back was to the fire yet light rose in her eyes or perhaps be hind them a green light such as reflects in still forest pools from the moon her hands lifted suddenly as though to repel me they were half closed and the crooked fingers drawn stiff like talons susan i coaxed her yet again and she made no answer but tried to slip side wise around me i moved and headed her off and she growled actually growled like a savage dog with my free hand i clutched her shoulder under my fingers her flesh was as taut as wire fabric then sud denly it relaxed into human tissue again and she was standing straight her eyes had lost their weird light they showed only dark and frightened talbot she stammered whwhat have i been doing nothing my dear i comforted her it was nothing that we werent able to fight back from the woods behind me came a throttling yelp as of some hungry thing robbed of prey within its very grasp susan swayed seemed about to drop and i caught her quickly in my arms hold ing her thus i turned my head and laughed over my shoulder another score against you i jeered at my enemy you didnt get her not with all your filthy enchantments susan was beginning to cry and i half led half carried her back to the fireside at my gesture she sat on her cloak again as tractable as a child who repents of rebellion and tries to be obedient there were no more sounds from the timber i could feel an emptiness there as if the monster had slunk away baffled weird tales lights our best weapon neither of us said anything for a while after that i stoked up the fire to be doing something and it made us so uncomfortably warm that we had to crowd away from it sitting close against the treetrunk i began to imagine some thing creeping up the black lane of shad ow it cast behind us to the edge of the clearing and yet again i thought i heard noises club in hand i went to investi gate and i was not disappointed in the least when i found nothing finally susan spoke this she said is a new light on the thing its nothing to be upset about i tried to comfort her not be upset she sat straight up and in the light of the fire i could see a single pained line between her brows deep and sharp as a chiselgash not when i almost turned into a beast how much of that do you remem ber i asked her i was foggy in my mind talbot al most as at the séance but i remember be ing drawndrawn to what was waiting out there her eyes sought the thickets on the far side of our blaze and it didnt seem horrible but pleasant and welcome andwell as if it were my kind you and she glanced quickly at me then ashamedly away you were sudden ly strange and to be avoided is that all it spoke to me she went on in husky horror and i spoke to it i forbore to remind her that the only sound she had uttered was a wordless howl perhaps she did not know that i hoped not we said no more for another awkward time finally she mumbled im not the kind of woman who cries easily but id like to now go ahead i said at once and she did and i let her whether i took her into my arms or whether she came into them of her own accord i do not remem ber exactly but it was against my shoul der that she finished her weeping and when she had finished she did feel better that somehow washed the fog and the fear out of me she confessed al most brightly it must have been a full hour later that rustlings rose yet again in the timber so frequently had my imagination tricked me that i did not so much as glance up then susan gave a little startled cry and i sprang to my feet beyond the fire a tall gray shape had become visible with a pale glare of light around it dont be alarmed called a voice i knew it is iotto zoberg doctor i cried and hurried to meet him for the first time in my life i felt that he was a friend our differences of opinion once making companionship strained had so dwindled to nothing in comparison to the danger i faced and his avowed trust in me as innocent of mur der how are you i said wringing his hand they say you were hurt by the mob ach it was nothing serious he re assured me only this he touched with his forefinger an eye and i could see that it was bruised and swollen half shut a citizen with too ready a fist and too slow a mind has that to answer for im partly responsible i said you were trying to help me i understand when it happened more noise behind him and two more shapes pushed into the clear ing i recognized judge pursuivant nod ding to me with his eyes bright under his wide hatbrim the other man angular falconfaced one arm in a sling i had also seen before it was constable obry the hairy ones shall dance ant i spoke to him but he gazed past me apparently not hearing doctor zoberg saw my perplexed frown and he turned back toward the constable snapping long fingers in front of the great hooked nose he whistled shrilly obryant started grunted then glared around as though he had been suddenly and rudely awakened whats up he growled menacingly and his sound hand moved swiftly to a holster at his side then his eyes found me and with an oath he drew his re volver easy constable easy does it soothed judge pursuivant his own great hand clutching obryants wrist youve forgotten that i showed how mr wills must be innocent ive forgotten what were here for at all snapped obryant gazing around the clearing hey have i been drunk or something i said that id never ill explain offered zoberg the judge met me in town and we came to gether to see you remember you said you would like to avenge your brothers death and came with us then when you balked at the very edge of this devils croft i took the liberty of hypnotizing you huh how did you do that growled the officer with a look a word a motion of the hand said zoberg his eyes twinkling then you ceased all objections and came in with us pursuivant clapped obryant on the unwounded shoulder sit down he in vited motioning toward the roots of the tree the five of us gathered around the fire like picknickers instead of allies against a supernormal monster there at susans insistence i told of what had happened since judge pursuivant had left us all listened with rapt attention the constable grunting occasionally the judge clicking his tongue and doctor zoberg in abso lute silence it was zoberg who made the first com ment after i had finished this ex plains many things he said it dont explain a doggone thing grumbled obryant zoberg smiled at him then turned to judge pursuivant your ectoplasmic theory of lycanthropysuch as you have explained it to meis most interesting and i think valid may i advance it a trifle in what way asked the judge ectoplasm as you see it forms the werewolf by building upon the mediums body but is not ectoplasm more apt ac cording to the observations of many peo ple to draw completely away and form a separate and complete thing of itself the thing may be beastly as you suggest algernon blackwood the english writer of psychic stories almost hits upon it in one of his john silence tales he de scribed an astral personality taking form and threatening harm while its physical body slept i know the story you mean agreed judge pursuivant the camp of the dog i think its called very well then perhaps while miss susans body lay in a trance securely handcuffed between wills and my self oh wailed susan then it was i after all it couldnt have been you i told her at once but it was and while i was at the judges home with you part of me met the constables brother in this wood she stared wildly around her it might as well have been part of me i argued and obryant glared at me as if in sudden support of that likeli hood but susan shook her head weird tales no for which of us responded to the call of that thing out there for the hundredth time she gazed fear fully through the fire at the bushes be hind which the commanding whine had risen i have within me she said dully a nature that will break out look and act like a beastdemon will kill even my beloved father please interjected judge pursuivant earnestly you must not take responsibil ity upon yourself for what happened if the ectoplasm engendered by you made up the form of the killer the spirit may have come from without how could it she asked wretchedly how could marthe beraud exude ectoplasm that formed a bearded mascu line body pursuivant looked across to zoberg doctor you surely know the famous bien boa séance and how the materialized entity spoke arabic when the medium a frenchwoman knew little or nothing of that language zoberg sat with bearded chin on lean hand his joined brows bristled the more as he corrugated his forehead in thought we are each a thousand personalities he said sententiously if not comfortingly how can we rule them all or rule even one of them obryant said sourly that all this talk was too high flown for him to understand or to enjoy he dared hope however that the case could never be tied up to miss susan gird whom he had known and liked since her babyhood it can never do that zoberg said definitely no court or jury would con vict her on the evidence we are offering against her i ventured an opinion while you are attempting to show that susan is a werewolf you are forgetting that some thing else was prowling around our fire just out of sight ach just out of sight echoed zo berg that means you arent sure what it was or even that there was anything added susan so suddenly and strongly that i at least jumped there was something all right i in sisted i heard it you thought you heard a sound be hind the tree susan reminded me you looked and there was nothing everyone gazed at me rather like staid adults at a naughty child i said ungra ciously that my imagination was no bet ter than theirs and that i was no easier to frighten judge pursuivant suggested that we make a search of the surrounding woods for possible clues a good idea approved constable obryant the grounds damp we might find some sort of footprints then you stay here with miss susan the judge said to him we others will circle around the gaunt constable shook his head not much mister im in on whatever searching is done ive got something to settle with whatever killed my kid brother but there are only three lanterns pointed out judge pursuivant we have to carry themlights our best weapon zoberg then spoke up rather diffident ly to say that he would be glad to stay with susan this was agreed upon and the other three of us prepared for the search i took the lantern from zobergs hand nodded to the others and walked away among the trees i wasi ama wolf deliberately i had turned my face toward the section beyond the fire for as i have said repeatedly it was there the hairy ones shall dance that i had heard the movements and cries of the being that had so strongly moved and bewitched susan my heart whis pered rather loudly that i must look for myself at its traces or lack of them or for ever view myself with scorn almost at once i found tracks the booted tracks of my three allies shaking my lantern to make it flare higher i went deeper among the clumps my eyes quar tering the damp earth after a few mo ments i found what i had come to look for the marks were round and rather vague as to toepositions yet not so clear cut as to be made by hoofs rather they suggested a malformed stump or a palm with no fingers and they were deep enough to denote considerable weight the tracks of my own shoes next to them were rather shallower i bent for a close look then straightened up looked every where at once and held my torch above my head to shed light all around for i had suddenly felt eyes upon me i caught just a glimpse as of two points of light fading away into some leafage and in the direction of the clearing and toward them i made my way but there was nothing there and the only tracks underfoot were of shod human beings myself or one of the others i returned to my outward search following the round tracks they were plainly of only two feet there were no double impressions like those of a quadrupedbut i must have stalked along them for ten minutes when i realized that i had no way of telling whether they went forward or backward i might be going away from my enemy instead of toward it a close examina tion did me little good and i further pondered that the creature would lurk near the clearing not go so straight away thus arguing within myself i doubled back coming again close to the starting point i thought of a quick visit to the clearing and a comforting word or two with susan and zoberg surely i was al most there but why did not the fire gleam through the trees were they out of wood perplexed i quickened my pace a gnarled tree grew in my path its low branches heavily bearded with vines be yond this rose only the faintest of glows i paused to push aside some strands and peer the fire had almost died and by its light i but half saw two figures one tall and one slender standing together well to one side they faced each other and the tallera seeming statue of wetlook ing grayheld its companion by a shoul der the other gray hind was stroking the smaller ones head pouring grayness thereon i saw only this much without stop ping to judge or to wonder then i yelled and sprang into the clearing at my outcry the two fell apart and faced me the smallest was susan who took a step in my direction and gave a little smothered whimper as though she wras trying to speak through a blanket i ran to her side and with a rough sweep of my sleeve i cleared from her face and head a mass of slimy shiny jelly you i challenged the other shape what have you been trying to do to her for only a breathingspace it stood still as featureless and clumsy as a half formed figure of gray mud then dark ness sprang out upon it and hair eyes blazed at me green and fearsome a sharp muzzle opened to emit a snarl now i know you i hurled at it im going to kill you and i charged claws ripped at my head missed and tore the cloth of my coat one of my weird tales arms shot around a lean hairy middle with powerful muscles straining under its skin and i drove my other fist for where i judged the pit of the stomach to be grappled we fell and rolled over the beast smell i remembered was all about us and i knew that jaws were shov ing once again at my throat i jammed my forearm between them so far into the hinge of them that they could not close nor crush my other hand clutched the skin of the throat a great loose fistful drew it taut and began to twist with all my strength i heard a halfbroken yelp of strangled pain felt a slackening of the body that struggled against me knew that it was trying to get away but i man aged to roll on top straddling the thing youre not so good on defense i panted and brought my other hand to the throat for i had no other idea save to kill paws grasped and tore at my wrists there was shouting at my back in susans voice and several others hands caught me by the shoulders and tried to pull me up and away no i cried this is it the were wolf its doctor zoberg you idiot growled obryant in my ear come on let him up yes added judge pursuivant its doctor zoberg as you say but a moment ago it was the monster we have been hunting i had been dragged upright by now and so had zoberg he could only choke and glare for the time being his fingers to his halfcrushed throat pursuivant had moved within clutching distance of him and was eyeing him as a cat eyes a mouse like wills i only pretended to search then doubled back to watch went on the judge i saw zoberg and miss susan talking he spoke quietly rhythmically commandingly she went into half a trance and i knew she was hypnotized as the fire died down he began the change ectoplasm gushed out and over him before it took form he began to smear some upon her and mr wills here came out of the woods and at him obryant looked from the judge to zoberg then he fumbled with his un damaged hand in a hip pocket produced handcuffs and stepped forward the ac cused man grinned through his beard as if admitting defeat in some trifling game then he held out his wrists with an air of resignation and i who had manacled them once wondered again at their cord ed strength the irons clicked shut upon one then the other you know everything now said zo berg in a soft voice but a steady one i wasi ama wolf a wolf who hoped to mate with an angel his bright eyes rested upon susan who shrank back judge pursuivant took a step toward the prisoner there is no need for you to insult her he said zoberg grinned at him with every long tooth agleam do you want to hear my confession or dont you sure we want to hear it grunted obryant leave him alone judge and let him talk he glanced at me got any paper mr wills somebody better take this down in writing i produced a wad of notepaper and a stub pencil placing it upon my knee with the lantern for light i scribbled al most word for word the tale that doctor zoberg told and that is the end perhaps i was born what i am he abegan at least even as a lad i knew that there was a lust and a power for evil within me night called to me the hairy ones shall dance where it frightens most children i would slip out of my fathers house and run for miles under the trees or across fields with the moon for company this was in germany of course before the war during the war began judge pursuivant during the war when most men were fighting i was in prison again zoberg grinned briefly and without cheer i had found it easy and inspiring to kill persons with a sense of added strength following but they caught me and put me in what they called an asylum i was supposed to be crazy they confined me closely but i reading books in the library grew to know what the change was that came upon me at certain intervals i turned my attention to it and became able to control the change bringing it on or holding it off at will he looked at susan again but im ahead of my story once when i was at school i met a girlan american stu dent of science and philosophy she laughed at my wooing but talked to me about spirits and psychical phenomena that my dear susan was your mother when the end of the war brought so many new things it also brought a dif ferent viewpoint toward many inmates of asylums some viennese doctors and later sigmund freud himself found my case interesting of course they did not arrive at the real truth or they would not have procured my release after that i supplied writing swift ly you became an expert psychical in vestigator and journeyed to america yes to find the girl who had once laughed and studied with me after some years i came to this town simply to trace the legend of this devils croft and here i found she had lived and died and left behind a daughter that was her image judge pursuivant cleared his throat i suspect that youre leaving out part of your adventures doctor zoberg actually laughed ja i thought to spare you a few shocks but if you will have them you may i visited rus siaand in a medical commission of the soviet union investigated several score mysterious cases of peasants killed and eaten he licked his lips like a cat who thinks of meat in paris i founded and conducted a rather interest ing night school for the study of diabo lism in its relationship to science and in certain summer vacationists on long island were almost frightened out of their wits by a lurking thing that seemed half beast half man he chuck led your literary digest made much of it the lurking thing was of course myself we stared say why do you do these things the constable blurted zoberg turned to him head quizzically aslant why do you uphold your local laws or why does judge pursuivant study ancient philosophies or why do wills and susan turn soft eyes upon each other because the heart of each so in sists susan was clutching my arm her fin gers bit into my flesh as zobergs eyes sought her again i found the daughter of someone i once loved he went on with real gen tleness in his voice wills at least can see in her what i saw a new inspiration came to me a wish and a plan to have a comrade in my secret exploits a beastthing like yourself prompt ed the judge zoberg nodded a lupa to my lupus but this girlsusan girdhad not in herited the psychic possibilities of her mother what i shouted you yourself said weird tales that she was the greatest medium of all time i did say so but it was a lie why in heavens name it was my hope he broke in quiet ly to make of her a medium or a lycanthropecall the phenomenon which you will are you interested in my pro posed method he gazed mockingly around and his eyes rested finally upon me make full notes wills this will be interesting if not stupefying to the psychic research committees it is as you know a supernormal sub stance that is exuded to change the ap pearance of my body what i wondered would some of that substance do if smeared upon her i started to growl out a curse upon him but judge pursuivant rapt mo tioned for me to keep silent think back through all the demonol ogies you have read zoberg was urg ing what of the strange witch oint ments that spread over an ordinary hu man body gave it beastform and beast heart there again legend had basis in scientific fact by the thunder youre logical mut tered judge pursuivant and damnable i added go on doctor you were going to smear the changestuff upon susan but first i knew i must convince her that she had within her the essence of a wolf and so the séances she was no medium i said again i made her think she was i hypno tized her and myself did weird wonders in the dark room but she in a trance did not know i needed witnesses to con vince her so you invited mr wills supplied judge pursuivant yes and her father they had been prepared to accept her as medium and me as observer seeing a beastform they would tell her afterward that it was she zoberg i said between set teeth youre convicted out of your own mouth of rottenness that convinces me of the existence of the devil after whom this grove was named i wish to heaven that id killed you when we were fighting ach wills he chuckled youd have missed this most entertaining auto biographical lecture hes right grumbled obryant and let him go on the judge pleaded with me once sure of this power within her zoberg said deeply she would be prepared in heart and soul to change at touch of the ointmentthe ec toplasm then to me she must turn as a fellowcreature together throughout the world adventuring in a way unbeliev able his voice died and we let it he stood in the firelight head thrown back man acled hands folded he might have been a martyr instead of a fiend for whom a death at the stake would be too easy i can tell what spoiled the séance i told him after a moment gird sitting opposite saw that it was you not susan who had changed you had to kill him to keep him from telling there and then yes agreed zoberg after that you were arrested and later threatened i was in an awkward position susan must believe herself not you guilty that is why i have championed you throughout i went then to look for you and attacked me i added the beastself was ascendant i can not always control it completely he sighed when susan disappeared i went to look for her on the second eve ning when i came into this wood the w t the hairy ones shall dance change took place half automatically associations i suppose constable your brother happened upon me in an evil hour yep said obryant gruffly and that is the end zoberg said the end of the story and i suppose the end of me you bet it is the constable assured him you came with the judge to finish your rotten work but were finishing it for you one moment interjected judge pur suivant and his firelit face betrayed a perplexed frown the story fails to ex plain one important thing does it so prompted zoberg in clining toward him with a show of negli gent grace if you were able to free yourself and kill mr gird by heaven thats right i broke in you were chained zoberg to susan and to your chair id go bail for the strength and tightness of those handcuffs he grinned at each of us in turn and held out his hands with their manacles is it not obvious he inquired we looked at him a trifle blankly i suppose for he chuckled once again another employment of the ectoplasm that useful substance of change he said gently at will my arms and legs as sume thickness and hold the rings of the confining irons wide then when i wish they grow slender again and he gave his hands a sudden flirt and the bracelets fell from them on the in stant he pivoted and ran like a deer shoot cried the judge and obry ant whipped the big gun from his holster zoberg was almost within a vinelaced clump of bushes when obryant fired i heard a shrill scream and saw zoberg falter and drop to his hands and knees we were all starting forward i paused a moment to put susan behind me and in that moment obryant and pursuivant sprang ahead and came up on either side of zoberg he was still alive for he writhed up to a kneeling position and made a frantic clutch at the judges coat obryant so close that he barely raised his hand and arm fired a second time zoberg spun around somehow on his knees stiffened and screamed perhaps i should say that he howled in his voice was the inarticulate agony of a beast wounded to death then he collapsed both men stooped above him cautious but thorough in their examination final ly judge pursuivant straightened up and faced toward us keep miss susan there with you he warned me hes dead and not a pret ty sight slowly they came back to us pur suivant was thoughtful while obryant zobergs killer seemed cheerful for the first time since i had met him he even smiled at me as punch would smile after striking a particularly telling blow with his cudgel rubbing his pistol caressing ly with his palm he stowed it carefully away im glad thats over he admitted my brother can rest easy in his grave and we have our work cut out for us responded the judge we must de cide just how much of the truth to tell when we make a report obryant dipped his head in sage ac quiescence youre right he rumbled yes sir youre right would you believe me said the judge if i told you that i knew it was zoberg almost from the first but susan and i facing each other were beyond being surprized even at that the end w t guarded by mearle prout a brief tale of a murder and an attempted murderby the author of the house of the worm the sound of a shot suddenly broke the stillness of the may morning and echoed back from across the valley a puff of blue smoke arose from a clump of greenbriars and drifted away downwind out in the road abner simmons dropped the bag of grain he was carrying and with a look of dumb surprize sank in a quivering heap to the ground half his side had been shot away the greenbriars parted with a sudden life and jed tolliver emerged straighten ing his long form as he shambled toward the road as he walked he broke his doublebarreled shotgun flicked out the empty cartridge and blew through the barrel sending a thin stream of acrid smoke out of the chamber he stooped over his fallen enemy said id get you he reminded the other brutally he inserted a fresh cart ridge and closed the gun with a snap the man in the road rolled over with a convulsive movement and stared up at him that kid brother of yours is next and last jed continued then ill be through with the lot of you abner grinned it is an awful thing to see a dying man grin jed shuddered in spite of himself you cant jednot ezekiel it was not a pleading rather it was calm assured as though the other were stating a known fact jed shuddered again before he felt quick anger rising i got you didnt i he said ejecting a thick stream of tobacco juice what makes you think i wont get ezekiel the same way you wont jedyou cantbecause i wont let you he was fast weakening from the frightful flow of blood overcome from the effort of speaking abner closed his eyes and lay still a second later a sudden convulsive movement shook his body and his eyes opened again this time they were fixed and staring with a grunt of satisfaction jed shouldered his gun and started back up the mountain moving with the long ef fortless stride of the tennessee mountain eer he did not fear punishment for his crime here in the tennessee mountains the long arm of the law seldom reached the only thing to fear in a case of this kind was the dead mans relatives and now there was only oneezekiel a slim lad of twenty who could not even shoot expertly yes jed reflected as his long strides carried him through the sparse growth of cedar and blackjack this part of tennes see would soon again be a decent god fearing community foreigners the simmonses had been from somewhere back eastcarolina or virginia maybe they hadnt been like the mountain folk and what was that crazy talk abner had made hed stop jed from getting ezekiel how could he if he was dead guarded jed chuckled to himself here in tennes see folk didnt believe more than a week passed before jed again took his welloiled shotgun from its place on the wall and started over the mountain he was in no great hurry about ezekielinstead he rather enjoyed waiting ezekiel was the last of the three simmons brothers and knowing that the foreigner was over there and that he was going to kill him gave life a curious sort of zest likely the kid didnt even know who shot his brother jed laughed silently at the thought add ing to himself that the boy probably wouldnt do anything about it if he did know he wasnt like the mountain people but this morning all of jeds im patience had returned the sun shone hotly on the tennessee hills and raised an almost visible veil of vapor from the tiny branch which flowed through the hollow well hed waited long enough with a grimace of distaste at the three mile traipse across two mountains jed swung his gun over his shoulder and started down the slope when an hour and a half later he arrived at the small clearing which was the simmons place he was not as tired as he had expected to be the nervous exhilaration of the manhunt buoyed him up made him tensely aware of things around him he paused only a moment at the fringe of scrub oak that bordered the clearing then bending almost double he sprinted a hundred feet to the grapearbor safe inside the leafy bower jed leaned his gun against a supporting post and looked about here the vines had been trained over a rude wooden lattice so that a thick wall and roof of leaves now effectively hid him from anyone outside jed parted the leaves carefully and peered out a hundred feet behind him was the low wall of forest he had just left two hundred feet in front of him was the housea rude tworoom shack two hundred feet beyond that the wall of the forest began again jed looked at the house more closely there was no sign of movement but the thin line of smoke which curled from the chimney told him that ezekiel was inside probably prepar ing his midday meal with a sigh of con tentment he sat down and leaned back closer to his gun idly listening to the chatter of birds in the forest and the rustling of the leaves in the arbor how long jed sat there he did not know he was suddenly aroused from a semistupor by the sound of a banging door startled into instant activity he swung around to peer through the leaves ezekiel was leaving the house swinging in his hand an empty waterbucket going to the spring jed reckoned if so his path would take him within fifty feet of the arbor jed gloated with hands suddenly unsteady the man in the arbor laid his gun on the ground the muzzle barely extending through the leaves why take a chance he would waitat fifty feet he couldnt miss unmindful of his danger ezekiel came slowly down the path bearing diagonally nearer to the arbor jed suddenly wondered why he no longer heard the aimless chatter of birds in the forest why the light wind no longer stirred the broad leaves above him it was uncanny this noonday quiet impa tiently he shook off the feeling so i cant do it abner he whis pered to the empty air but somehow the words clutched at his throat and he wished he hadnt said it no matter a few seconds now weird tales jed cursed the trembling of his hands as he aimed what was the matter with him he could see ezekiels slender form now above the barrel of his gun he nerved himself to pull the trigger the top of his head suddenly gone cold jed dropped the gun and looked quickly around him no the day was bright as everyet he could have sworn half heartedly now he picked up the gun to sight at the form which had already passed the nearest point he had not been wrong a black nebulous cloud hovered over the barrel of his gun and created the illusion of darkest night shrieking a curse jed tolliver leapt upright and pointed not aimed the gun at where ezekiel should be he snapped both triggers simultaneously but as he fired something clutched at his arm and the hot lead sizzled harmlessly through the air shaking as with a chill blind rage within him struggling with black fear the mountaineer stood irresolutely within his leafy ambush he was quickly aroused to activity by a loud report and the crash of lead against the wooden lattice a sharp pain burned his left arm where one of the pellets had found its mark ezekiel had fled to the house and opened fire without waiting to reload his gun jed crashed through the side of the bower and fled to the safety of the trees as he entered buckshot spattered harmlessly around him safe within the sheltering growth jed halted to reload his gun damn you abner he shouted to the stunted oaks ill get him yet as he turned to go he thought he heard a low mocking laugh but reasoned later that it was only a squirrel chattering a protest at the sound of his voice jed reached home in a blue funk the long tramp across the mountains in the early summer heat had melted away most of his fears but his nerves were still badly shaken now that he could look at the incident in a sober light he re fused to credit his senses as the distance between himself and the scene increased he had come more and more to believe the occurrence an hallucination brought on by the long walk through the heat after all he recalled he had almost fal len asleep in the arbor while waiting for ezekiel to appear perhaps he had dreamed part of it however logical jed believed his ex planation he did not again go near the simmons place weeks passed always he promised himself that he would soon finish the task so ingloriously begun but day by day he waited until nearly three months had gone at first he had feared ezekiel had recognized him in those few seconds it had taken to sprint from the grapearbor to the cover of the woods later as he heard nothing of it he de cided he was safe from that side the end came in an unexpected manner one afternoon early in august jed had walked to the village he stayed longer than he had intended and shadows were already growing long when he started home not wishing to be out later than necessary he took a shortcut through the woods which would take him within a halfmile of the simmons place the sun was setting as he entered the simmons hollow a halfmile below the house he felt vaguely uneasy though he told himself he was not frightened he found himself wishing for the pro tection of his gun nervously his hand strayed to the huntingknife stuck in his belt and tested the keen edge walking diagonally across the hollow which was largely devoid of trees he guarded turned aside to go around a cluster of young cedars which was directly in his path suddenly he drew back sharply again his hand tested the keen edge of that knife but not this time from nerv ousness jed was not thinking now of defense two hundred feet beyond the cedars on the smooth unbroken grass floor of the hollow was a man milking his back was turned to the cedars but jed thought he recognized that slim youthful form he believed it was ezekiel stepping lightly one hand on his belt where he could immediately grasp the knife jed moved into the open half way across the level space his hand moved yet closer to the knife while the ghost of a grin curved his lips without a doubt it was ezekiel simmons the man milking did not look up the milk jetted into the halffilled bucket with a low murmur just loud enough to mask jeds guarded footsteps step by step jed advanced if only ezekiel did not see him if only the cow did not sense his presence and turn un expectedly step by step furtherjed was tense with excitement there was no midday sun this time to blind his eyes and fill his soul with a nameless fear nor would he be unnerved by the twilight stillness it was always still at sunset here in these mountains ten feet now the milk still swished into the pail uninterruptedly the steady grinding of the cows molars never ceased suddenly jed tugged at his belt and leapt forward got you he shouted aloud but the exultant cry died suddenly in to a moan of horror the arm bearing the knife poised high for the blow jed felt something like an electric shock course through its length instead of swinging forward to strike the man in front of him the knife turned in his hand his wrist and elbow bent at a crazy angle and the razoredge steel ripped through the cords of his neck staggered more by his realization of the awful consequences than by present pain jed sank to the grass while gouts of blood spurted from a torn jugular his first mad terror past he became aware that ezekiel was standing over him scorn darkening his features so it was you tolliver abner warned meabout you id have got you tooonly ab ner abner was a good brother he told meweeks before he diedthat if any thing happened hedguard me jed felt himself weaker his head was strangely without weight and objects around swam lazily in the pale twilight he lay back on the grass should have got you ezekiel shouldnt havemissed he murmured sleepily as the shadows gathered he raised his head slightly to listen was that a light mocking laugh he heard in the grass beside him he listened again before the darkness came down nohe could not be sure the teakwood box by johns harrington san pedro joe found the secret that was contained in that intricately carved oriental box better pay the cash snarled sallow san pedro joe into the telephone mouthpiece the speaker jerked his head to one side and glanced from the cramped phone booth into the almostdeserted drug store check ing to see whether his conversation had been heard it was late afternoona sul try and stuffy summer day that teakwood box dont mean much to me joe continued in a hoarse tone and if you want it pretty bad ill sell itotherwise the thing gets chucked out see mrs floyd wrights tiny illpainted cottage in a smelly los angeles suburb had been ransacked a few days previous ly leaving bedding overturned furniture stuffings tumbling everywhere the teakwood box to the fidgety old woman far overshadowed in importance the amount of cash and the few pieces of sil ver which had also been stolen oddly carved and strangely arresting the prize had been a gift to mrs wright from her husband recently killed in a factory ex plosion where he had been night watch man he had purchased the box during a vagabond trip to china in his boyhood days the teakwood container had never been opened by either mrs wright or her husband betty he used to say while dozing in the parlor and studying the box that thing is jinxed just like i was told its dangerous leave it alone there is a dreadful native curse on it i got the box from a streetpeddler in shanghai who told me he bought it from a priest he said there was a dire curse to anyone who opened the box but that it would bring power and good luck to the owner as long as he did not try to do so i always have said that the box was most likely stolen from a temple by the ped dler or by some other member of the streetscum parade wright would con clude it would have been difficult to open the box even if someone did want to pry into it because its lid was apparently op erated by a complex series of springs and pivoting levers the singularity of the object its weirdness and strange delicacy gave it a

half asleep yet again glowing awakening seemed in closed within the meticulously decorated teakwood though the wrights had been almost afraid of the box from the start they had nevertheless believed that the spirit which might lie within it would not hurt them if they did not molest it for they had lived good lives some day the spirit would awaken and strike but it would not be at a time when they were about death red grinning and yellowfanged was a part of the ex otic treasure it was not the death of god fearing men and women but the bloody merciless deity of those who belonged in the

affection her husband had placed on it when he was alive though he always feared the box he would sit and watch it for hours without uttering more than a phrase one time when his wife had re turned from shopping she found him standing in the little yard blanched and trembling never never can we sell or dispose of that box he cried the devil inside told me so if we did he would do some thing horrible mrs wright wondered whether her husband had concentrated for so long on the object that his imagination had given him that message but because of the frightened look in his eyes she accepted what he said and did not question him about it wright never spoke about the teakwood box after that but he sat with it oftener than before his face rather than appearing curious had a grim hyp notized look as he gazed in silence upon the treasure carefully dusted several times a week and kept glistening with polish the curio had rested in a place of honor on the liv ingroom mantelpiece where it some times glowed a mysterious uncanny lus ter when a few stray rays of the sun penetrated to it from the curtained win dows but mrs wright could not comply with the ransom demands of the thief who had snatched it and realized the esteem placed on the box by its owner because of the obvious care with which it was kept the old woman was sniffling softly into a tiny lace handker chief which she clutched in thin ivory colored hands one hundred and fifty bucks or noth in sneered san pedro joe these old people got on his nerves they were so damned irritating and slow but i cantcant get that much money trembled mrs wright her fin gers tightening around the phone re ceiver youre out of luck then old woman deridingly returned the thief and hung up ordinarily he would have dickered to get the best price possible for the stolen object even though it was lower than he first demanded but in this case it gave him a feeling of satisfaction to crush brutally the faltering womans hap piness san pedro joe slowly stepped out of the phone booth and quickened his pace as he neared the store entrance he spat at the curbing his pasty selfish face was set off by thin twisting lips the black suit he wore was illkept bulging in the wrong places it was young joes habit to drum his fingers on any surface convenient when he was uneasy and that was most of the time his watery cold blue eyes

to have much investigation concerning their losses he was like a cunning spider feeding on bewildered fluttering moths caught in his net in half an hour joe arrived at his apartment located in a battered two story stucco in the southwest part of los angeles a brief stretch of yellow dry grass ran between the sidewalk and the weird tales plasterchipped structure light from the disappearing sun was shining on the cheerless front windows leaving his poorlykept coupé at the curb he stepped quickly across the withered lawn and up the cement steps of the building to his rooms after a snack of cold beans and white bread gulped with some warmedover coffee joe brought the teakwood box out from the place where he had hidden it under the messy sink darkness had come and the moon had not yet risen billows of black angry clouds were scattered in the sky putting the box on the kitchen table he stood back and regarded the thing it appeared ominous and resentful on the scarred tabletop under the white ceiling light joe thought he sensed a feeling of unearthly life in the booty be fore him someone down the hall was coughing hoarsely and the thief felt chilled suddenly joe returned to himself and became intensely curious about that box he considered what he had found out about it from mrs wright who in her desire to get her treasure back had breathlessly poured out the whole story when questioned maybe mrs wrights old man had cached some precious stones or money in the container conjec tured joe and had fabricated the yarn about the curse in order to keep people from trying to open the box the thief flamed by his greed decided the teak wood curio deserved an investigation be fore he discarded it at first he picked up a hammer which was kept in one of the dishcloset draw ers but after a moments consideration he determiried to try and open the box by its mechanism perhaps he could sell it to an antiquedealer after examining what might be inside yet had that been the real reason for his decision to use care joe wished that fool down the hall would keep quiet for the first time in his life he felt uncertain confused san pedro joe was proud of his ability to do a neat job on breaking into houses opening strongboxes and his conceit prompted him again to forget his fore bodings and test his skill by attempting to discover the combination of the box otherwise being increasingly nervous he probably would not have taken the pains which he did to open it so carefully his fingers trembledhe licked dry swollen lips after working for some minutes he roughly pushed the box from him joe imagined the curse the words of evil an idol guardian might have incanted on the one who pried into the sacred box for perhaps it contained some treasured jew els or a temple secret rather than being simply a hidingplace for wrights pen nies the investigator eagerly impatiently bent over the shining teak wood again as though suddenly possessed and continued his manipulation of the curios carved knobs and queer levers for a mo ment he thought he detected a slight shrill cry followed by a tiny penetrating whistle sweat broke out on joes brow as he doggedly kept at his task fas cinated now unable to pause shortly he pressed an unobtrusive bump which had been revealed by sliding a ghoulish little figure ornamenting the containers front to one side the lid slowly raised up ward as though controlled by a hidden spring the crook nervously pressed harder on the button he had discovered in order to hasten the opening of the lid he was waiting for somethinghis fin ger seemed frozen to the box his whole body was stiffened sweat was trickling down his back yet he was somehow cold suddenly a sharp biting flame burned the teakwood box in his thumb as though he had put it in a fire of hot coals a strange numbness ran through his arm he stared down at the table to see a neatlyconcealed needle probably hollow slowly retreating into the side of the box in the same glance he saw that the teakwood curio was empty contained nothing blood was on his thumb dripping from under the fingernail where seemed to be an inflamed tiny wound he heard a peculiar spinestiffening cackle on the same penetrating high key as the whistle first it came spasmodically but broke down into a low gurgle a sucking sound the thiefs heart seemed to bloat and swell yet tried to beat faster joe

window adapted from the german of wilhelm von scholz by roy temple house what strange prescience had the bearded man of his approaching death an odd little story in the art gallery of a north ger man city hangs a lurid oil painting which represents two italians way laying and attacking a third i will tell you the history of the painting in the nineties of the last century a young german painter was living in the outskirts of rome in an isolated little house surrounded by a vineyard one fine bright moonlight night after sitting over the wine till a late hour with two or three friends down in the city he came home about midnight he had to walk some distance beyond the end of the streetcar line through a narrow road that ran between high walls he never came through that lane late at night with out a feeling of apprehension he was a poor man he never wore jewelry his modest brown cape and dilapidated broadbrimmed hat were very much like the clothing of many of his modest neighbors visibly not the appurtenances of a man of means and he had had no love affairs in rome so that it did not seem as if any sort of ambush was likely he thought a good deal about his fiancée back in germany and he almost always carried a letter from her in his left inside vest pocket just over his heart as he walked home he was in the habit of whistling to keep his courage up of talk ing aloud to himself bursting out every now and then with thats certainly a fact or yes i think thats what ill do and he was likely to call out at intervals to his little dog a spitz who never strayed far from his masters heels he always carried a revolver on his per son although in all the years since he had acquired it he had never once had occasion to fire it off but when he came near his garden gate he never failed to find himself shiv ering with apprehension till his slightly trembling fingers had the gate unlocked he could almost visualize a big fellow gliding around the corner and stepping out threateningly in front of him he always had his key in his hand before he had reached the gate and he always pushed the key into the lock with nerv ous haste on dark nights he would hold his lighted cigar toward the lock with the other hand then he would lock the gate behind him in a great hurry unlock his house door just as nervously light the candle which stood waiting for him to the left of the door on the uneven tile floor try the door which led into the groundfloor rooms all of them unoccu pied except the kitchen and utilized as lumberrooms to store his artists sup plies and climb the creaking stairs to the upper floor where were located his spa cious studio and his little bedroom the bedroom was scarcely more than an al cove and it always stood wide open into the studio so that as he lay in bed he could see the great wide window and the starry heavens outside his trip home on this particular eve ning had not been without disquieting in cidents nothing very definite had hap the head in the window pened and he might have attached no importance to anything that had occurred if he had not been made a little appre hensive by the eery turn the conversa tion in the artist group had taken his spitz had stopped and barked furiously into a lindentree alley a few hundred yards from his garden gate it was true that the dog had a nervous streak in him and often grew excited over nothing at all a little earlier as the artist was get ting off the streetcar a very suspicious looking and acting man in ragged work clothes had asked him how to reach the valle san giorgio a lonely little valley with a chapel in the center of it a sort of ravine which lay behind and below the eminence on which his house was built and which no human being in his senses would have thought of visiting at that hour of the night then as he came through the narrow street between the high walls he would have sworn he heard steps on the hard ground behind him the impression was so strong that he turned and looked back more than once but no one was visible and it was only while he himself was walking that he seemed to hear the steps they must have been only the echo of his own steps in the uncanny stillness of the night finally at a turn of the crooked little street he had come suddenly within a few feet of a man who was going in the same direction but more slowly the man turned and looked at him then walked slowly away on a path that branched off from the little street the painter had had only an indefinite im pression of the mans bearded face but his artist eye had taken in the squat heavy frame which stood out plainly in the moonlight the peculiar swing of the mans walk and even the wavering shad ow which showed rather distinctly on the wall beyond him before he turned into the footpath when he had himself come abreast the path and peered fear fully down it the man had disappeared there were no buildings along the path and it was distinctly visible for some dis tance it seemed as if the earth had swal lowed the man or he might have dodged behind a clump of bushes but why would he have done that it was strange for a few minutes the young painter had been almost uneasy then all at once the artist in him had gained the upper hand he realized that the shape and manner of the bearded pedestrian had been very much what he had had in mind for a figure in a violent night scene which he was planning to paint and he regretted that he had not seen the mans face more distinctly he began to lay plans for sketching what he remembered of the face and figure before he went to bed and in his cheerful planning he com pletely forgot his apprehensiontill his dog had begun to bark frantically at the entrance of the linden alley arrived at home the painter had hauled his preliminary sketch out of a corner set it up on an easel and rapidly drawn in with charcoal the outlines of the man with the beard he had origi nally planned to make this person the ag gressor in an encounter he had thought of him as rushing out from his conceal ment behind a wall and running with drawn sword at a favored rival who had just said goodbye to a lady at the gate of an imposing palazzo but some mys terious influence seemed to guide him into a change of plan he of the beard must needs be the victim not the attack er and he must be set upon by two men the painter took out a fresh sheet and sketched in the new idea it was curious how definitely the impression had come to him he knew exactly where to place each individual how to direct each mo weird tales tion but the face of the bearded de fender the man whose life was forfeit to these vicious assassins would not come clear to him finally he grew tired of searching undressed and went to bed tomorrow he said to himself when i am fresher i shall be able to think the thing out better he went to sleep at once and slept soundly but in the course of the nighthe had no idea how long he had been asleephe started up in bed with the definite impression that he had heard something a call a cry or voices talking together he listened complete silence if he had heard anything it must have been in his dream it did seem to him as if he had had a dream and that he had dreamed about something disturbing something alarming but he could not remember what the dream had been about he was in the act of lying down again when he glanced into his studio which lay bathed in the moonlight from the great window he saw his dog stand ing erect in the center of the room his head thrust forward and turned toward the window watching and listening in tently without barking he had never seen the animal act like that before the painter called softly the dog gave no sign of hearing him he did not change in the slightest his attitude of absorbed interest then the painter raised his eyes to the window at first it seemed to him as if he must be dreaming still he threw the bed clothes aside stared at the window brushed his hands across his eyes and gazed again there was no doubt about it the painters eyes were looking into the eyes of the bearded man whose con duct had puzzled him the night before it looked as if the man had climbed up and stood on something that lifted him breasthigh before the secondstory win dow the roughboned carelessly kept face with the tangled hair and beard was unmistakably the face he had caught a glimpse of on his way home a few hours before it was frightfully distorted the eyes were wide open and staring the lips were open and drawn back from the teethit seemed almost as if the man were uttering a terrified cry for help but not a sound was audible on the left temple there was an ugly wound with the hair matted over it but with the blood still trickling down over the face there was no sign of the hands the arms fell straight down from the shoulders it al most seemed to the painter as he studied the figure and its attitude a little more calmly as if someone had pushed a dead man up into the window from below then all at once the horrible apparition disappeared noiselessly and the painter saw the trees and the quiet sky behind and above them at that moment the dogs muscles re laxed from his position of tense watch fulness he ran to his master cowered against him as if he were seeking pro tection turned his head back toward the window then he sat down expectantly before the painter exactly as he was in the habit of doing when he saw the artist take down his hat and his caped cloak to go out for a moment the distracted artist could do nothing but stare at the rectan gle of moonlight where the ghastly fig ure had been then he realized the changed attitude of the dog and spoke to the animal when the little creature saw that he had his masters attention he stood up wagged his tail and looked around expectantly toward the stairway the artist took his revolver and went to the window the moonlit landscape was calm and silent not a sight or a sound the head in the window if a gang of assassins had held a mur dered man up to his window a minute or two before they could scarcely have made so complete a getaway in so short a time the shutters on the window below were closed and locked there was nothing to climb up by and except for the feeling that he had heard something in his dream the painter was sure that not a sound had reached him from outside the building the dog ran back and forth between the artist and the stairway animals have remarkable leadings and the painter thought seriously of making the round of the garden but it seemed to him as he thought it over that such a procedure would be useless at best and that at worst it would be courting trouble if bandits were about what could one timid citizen armed with an old revolver that had never been fired in its life do against them all that could be expected of him certainly was to watch from inside his house till morning he closed his win dow and ordered the dog back to his cushion just before he drew the window down he had had the impression that he heard steps run rapidly along the stone pave ment that lay just below it he raised it again and looked down no one was in sight and not a sound was to be heard he stood by the window struggling to get a grip on himself he wondered if he could be ill he knew that various de lusions come from physical causes within the one who experiences them he had tried so desperately hard to visualize the head which he needed for his picture that his effort combined with the effect of the heavy falerno wine he had drunk might easily have produced a psychic ef fect which caused him to see visions and hear sounds that had transpired only in his imagination he had almost con vinced himself that he had found the key to the enigma when his glance fell on his dog obediently crouching on his cushion but still wideeyed and excited it seemed to him exactly as if someone spoke out from right behind him but what about the dog does your psychopathic theory explain the way the dog is acting suddenly the painters mood of anxiety and puzzlement gave way to one of im patience he was tired and nervous he was disgusted with the whole annoying affair he dropped on his bed again and in a mood of something like defiance he flung off the perplexity and dropped into a heavy sleep nothing happened till morning when the bright sun shone into the window instead of the ghostly moon he was ready to laugh the whole matter off as a halftipsy dream and to class the dogs strange conduct with various other evidences of unaccountable nervousness which that animal had shown at various times he sat down at his easel and went seriously to work at his new sketch he discovered that he knew the bearded face now feature by feature and the task went smoothly it was marvelous how vividly the face and form of the heavy fellow came out under the artists eager fingers this would be his best picture he was sure of that as he was working he heard some body knock at the door downstairs he made a few rapid strokes still hastily kicked off his slippers and pulled on his shoes and went down it was doubtless the peasant woman he thought who brought him his milk every morning but who brought it at the most unaccountably irregular hours if she wasnt willing to follow a fairly even schedule there was no reason why he should discommode himself to keep her from waiting a min ute or two weird tales when he opened the door there was no woman there and no milkcan he strolled down the walk toward the foun tain at which the milkwoman often stopped to water her donkey as he came near the fountain he heard voices when he passed the clump of bushes that had hidden the place from his sight he dis covered an excited group arguing and gesticulating about some object which lay on the ground there were two police men in the group has something happened he in quired as he joined the circle they killed a man last night said one of the bystanders one of the police men asked the painter if he had seen or heard anything that might throw any light on the mystery he was about to tell his ghoststory when it occurred to him how improbable it was and he con tented himself with replying that as he had walked home late at night a man in front of him had turned into the little side path and that before he had left the streetcar a man had asked the way to the valle san giorgio would you know the man in front of you if you saw him again the painter was not sure but he thought he remembered certain things about him for example he remembered very distinctly that the man had a beard the policeman looked up quickly is this the man he asked and drew off the sack which had covered the head of the prostrate form the painter started back in terror and for a moment his voice failed him com pletely there was the head he had seen in the window the eyes still staring wide the matted hair clinging about the wound over the left temple the wild scraggly beard the look of anguish and appeal was still in the eyes that gazed up into the eyes of the painter as if the deed were not yet committed and the man were begging him to come to his aid and as the living man gazed with fas cinated horror into the eyes of the dead man the expression of the eyes seemed to change to one of reproach the little dog had been ready and anxious to dash out and help defend the victim of a band of assassins but his master had been too stupid too selfish too cowardly to come to the succor of a fellowbeing in dis tress the painter recovered his selfcontrol and said dully to the policeman yes i think that was the man did you know him asked one of the neighbors with whom the german painter had a bowing acquaintance and when the painter shook his head the voluble italian prattled on it is much better that the bandits made away with this man than if they had killed a gentleman like you he was and he touched his finger compassion ately to his forehead from the general discussion that fol lowed the artist learned that the dead man who for a good part of his life had been a shepherd in the alban hills was a strange dreamer of a fellow who claimed to have the gift of second sight to be able to foretell the future and to have the power to cure disease by prayer members of the group told various stories of strange proofs of his psychic powers notably of one instance in which he had described in great detail a fire which was raging at that same moment in a town a hundred miles away and of which he had no possible means of knowledge it is strange said one of the neigh bors thoughtfully that he didnt fore see what would happen to him when he came out here last night perhaps he did foresee it said one the head in the window of the policemen who had been looking through a handful of papers which had come from one of the dead mans pock ets among these papers many of them old and worn from long friction in the pocket was a clean sheet on which was printed out very carefully i am go ing a hard way perhaps i shall not come back but i am saving another mans life the murderers were caught a few days later they were two vaga bonds of known evil habits both of whom had already served prison sen tences when they were examined they confessed that they had intended to kill the painter and plunder his isolated house at their leisure but that in their excitement they had mistaken one man for another who was dressed very simi larly they had intended they said to break into the studio that same night but had been so frightened when the dying shepherd had called their attention to their blunder and had warned them solemnly never to carry out their murder ous plan against the painter that they had taken to their heels in a panic and so it comes that the picture of the halfcrazy italian shepherd who saved the life of the young german painter is hang ing today in a german art gallery weird story reprint the

that you were marriedthey all called you la belle livaudaise and you were the life of everythingand least of all i never suspected anyone had you en shrined in magnificence like this better think it over diive been through the mill and i know diane from the first had been fas cinated by the exotic atmosphere in which clarke had planted her after their marriage but in the end seeing how they had become a part of him she half consciously hated them and their ever lasting song of bokhara and herat of the hundred gardens an unheard song to which clarke listened and replied in un spoken syllables and thus it was that diane learned that to live in clarkes apartment would be to become an acces sory to those precious fabrics that were his hardridden hobby for no woman would fit into the dim smoky shadows of that titled salon unless bejeweled and diaphanously veiled she could dance with curious paces and gestures beneath the sullen glow of the great brazen mosque lamp as became the favorite of a khan in faroff tartary from the very begin ning diane fought to keep her individu ality untainted by the overwhelming per sonality of those damnably lovely fabrics from shiraz and the dusty plains of fenghan and diane was right for they dreamed those old weavers of the roses of kirman of the evening star that danced on the crest of mount zagros of dancing girls in the gardens of nai shapur of fountains that sprayed mistily in the moonlit valley of zarabshan and all this they wove into what we now learn to catalogue as sixteenth century persian or whatever our best guess may be into his masterwork the weaver wove his soul so that whoever lives with one of those imperishable sorceries that come out of the east must in the end feel its presence unless he be somewhat duller than the very wood of the loom on which it was woven look upon wine as often as you wish but beware of a bokhara when it is red red as the blood of slaughterred as the embers of a plundered citya red ness charged with the quartered octagons of turkestanfor in the end you will become enslaved to the silky splendor that once graced the tent floor of a tekke prince diane was right though diane never suspected even dimly what in the end really did happen to hammersmith clarke for naturally enough neither she nor anyone else saw or heard the yel low girl that is no one but clarke and he saw and heard too much had she suspectedbut she couldnt have for who would imagine fate rid ing to the crossroads in a truck of the american express company it just isnt done not until one looks back and sees that it could have happened in no other way but unheardof things happen in turk estan and while one may pause for an evenings glamor beside some moon kissed fountain in the valley of zarab shan and then march on forgetting there is that which does not forget being undying and everlasting so that though forgotten it reaches forth across time and space not only clinging to the pile of a w t weird tales rug from samarcand but resorting even to express trucks to carry it the last step toward capturing the forgetful one all this diane knew without knowing why she knew and it seemed so reason able that there was nothing incongruous in shuddering and saying as she often had im afraid of the damned things as the door clicked behind the de parting expressman clarke clipped the leaden seals of the cylindrical bale cut its stitching and thrilled at the thought of the rug he was about to un wrap for the bale was from siraganian of new york who by dint of persistent reaching into the east must finally have succeeded in executing clarkes impos sible order a tawny golden silkiness smiled from the gaping burlap sheath just a glimpse of that wonder in buff and cream with its lotusbud border and frets and meanders in blue and coral and peach told clarke that this of all things was as far as possible from what he had ordered siraganian to get cost what it might for in place of persian intricacies in deep wine reds and solemn green florid magnificence that isphahan had given to the world before the splendor died clarke was confronted by an ancient rug from samarcandsilken samarcand in the valley of zarabshan thicknapped and luxurious mysterious with its mongolian cloud bands and asymmetrical corner pieces bats and dragons and fivemedallioned firmaments of blue that could come from none but the vats of turkestan good god its silk marveled clarke as he stroked the lustrous pile silk and by the rod on a linen warp he wondered how siraganian could have made that incredible mistake send ing him such a rug in place of what he had ordered if it were a case of sending something just as goodan unheardof procedure with that armenian merchant princehe certainly had been crafty enough for no connoisseur who once touched that rich pile whose eyes were once dazzled by those insinuant colors whose senses were stricken by the sorcery of cabalistical designs could ever return it and say that he had ordered something else rather would he thank siraganian for his error a silk pile on a warp of blue linen and woven in the days when persian hafiz was called to account by that fierce mongol for a verse wherein the poet bartered the princes favorite cities samarcand and bokhara for the smile of a turki dancing girl and the mole on her left breast unbelievable fortune had sent him this incredible rug and then clarkes wondering tri umphant eyes clouded as he thought of a girl beside whom samarcand and bokhara were but the tinkle of brazen anklets a very long time ago when there was no diane when clarke pursued rugs for that same siraganian who now sought them for clarke egher an turki bedest ared dili mara muttered clarke forgetting all but the glamorous perils that had lured him far into lost cities and high adven ture hafiz was right and for a moment the rug from samarcand its five by seven feet of tawny silken perfection putting to con fusion the priceless feraghan on which it had been unrolled gleamed unregarded as clarkes mind whirled to the sonorous accent with which the divine hafiz had enslaved the east and its savage con querors egher an turki strange how after all this time one would remember it must be that one could never quite forget the girl from samarcand the telephone rang but clarke ig nored it until the jangling became too insistent when he muffled the bell with several towels and a small cushion too bad he apologized as he took the cord from his lounge robe and com pleted the throttling of the almost stifled annoyance but i simply cant be dis turbed in which he was wrong for to con template that wonder from samarcand was more disturbing than any voice that could creep in over the wire he fingered the rings of dull handhammered gold that were sewed to one of the salvaged sides he wondered what palace wall had been enriched by that precious fabric and with it all came the knowledge that that very rug had been a part of his own past the life that had been knotted into its pile and the sorcery that had been woven into its pattern were speaking to one of clarkes forgotten selves yet he was certain that he had never before seen it for one could never have forgotten such as this though seen but for an in stant truly the rug was a stranger but the presence that accompanied it was de manding recognition in the meanwhile diane tired of hear ing the operators they dont answer and abandoned her efforts to remind clarke of an engagement i wonder she mused as she finally set aside the useless telephone what deviltry my bien aimé is devising and then she sought the rendezvous unattended and made the customary apologies for clarices unaccountable absence he might have retreated into that dusky inner kingdom which from the very beginning he had held against diane a silence into which he plunged unac companied not lacking appreciative com pany but loving solitude and electing seclusion rather than the sharing of the fancies that twisted and the thoughts that writhed in his strange brain as diane made her wellrehearsed apologies and frothed behind her vi vacious mask clarke noted the manila envelope that was fastened to the web of the rug from samarcand and ad dressed to him a letter doubtless from siraganian we regret wrote the armenian that thus far we have had no success in finding at any cost a rug of the weave you ordered however we take pleasure in forwarding you this rug which a cara van stopping at meshed left with our agent in that city with instructions to for ward it to our new york office and thence to you we are pleased that your agent saw fit to use our facilities for for warding it to you and wish to congratu late you on having obtained such a price less specimen should you at any time care to dispose of it be so kind as to give us an option on it for we are in a position to offer you a better price than any dealer or collector in the united states the rug itself was improbable enough but siraganians letter an insoluble riddle it couldnt be a jest then who true enough colonel merberes expe dition must have passed through samar cand yarkand and kashgar on its way into the unknown stretches of chinese turkestan but his acquaintance with the colonel was slight and he had no friend in the colonels train and what obscure acquaintance of the wish you were here postcard banality would send a rug which in the old days served as a gift from one prince to another dianes arrival cut the thread of fancy oh ham but it is gorgeous en thused la belle livaudaise as she entered the roseate duskiness of clarkes studio and to herself another rival weird tales then she rehearsed the excuses she had offered for hams absence and hoped hed absentmindedly contradict her the first time he deigned to speak for himself that done one must consider the latest addition to the seraglio clarke detailed the story of the rug and its riddle but who in the world would send you such a gift wondered diane exactly no one très chère unless diane pointed out it might be one of your lost loves in those asiatic playgrounds youve never entirely left clarke laughed but his derision was unconvincing and diane knew that he had been deep in the blacknesses of asian nights knew that her arrival had been an intrusion that he was but a friendly stranger babbling to her a friendly stranger of loveliness whose intoxication forced him to speak of it to anyone even her the others were bad enough with their everlasting song of bokhara and herat of the hundred gardensan un heard song to which clarke listened and replied in unspoken syllables they were bad enough they and those monstrous fancies which at times he smilingly ex pressed with deliberate vagueness but this yellow witch from samarcand diane knew that more than a rug had emerged from that bale whose bur lap windingsheet still littered the floor at last it seemed that she was intrud ing on a têteàtête eavesdropping on a monologue so that when clarke would emerge from his reveries diane resented the inevitable thought that he was rob bing himself to keep her company but patience reaches its limit finally she saw it one night twinkle and smile through a lustrous haze that played over its surface smile the slow curved smile of a carminelipped woman through the veils of her mystery saw clarke sit ting there eyes shearing the veil and half smiling in return a devotee in the ecstatic contemplation of a goddess shrouded in altar fumes ham yes answered clarkes lips he had now perfected the trick of having his body act as his proxy are you taking me to that show tonight what show clarke the simulacrum stirred lazily in the depths of the cushion heaped lounge the truth of it is my dear he resumed after a pause during which some memory of the proposed entertainment must have returned truth of it is im awfully busy tonight busy sitting there staring at nothing and sipping pernod flared diane the wrath of months flashing forth then as she saw clarke settle back into the depths listen once for all this non sense has lasted too long i might as well have married a mummy either get that thing out of the house or ill leave you to your pious meditations indefinite ly what good lord diane whats this you heard me you used to be half human but now youre utterly impos sible and if you cant show me a little attention im leaving here and now for the past many weeks youve acted like a model for a petrified forest ever since that yellow beast yellow beast exactly that damned rug is driving me crazy is or has driven suggested clarke lies there like a beast of prey just ready to wake and you sit there night after night staring at it until you fall asleep in your chair does it go or do i the girl from samarcand what do you want me to do throw it away i dont care what you do with it only i wont stay in the house with it it gives me the creeps youve said en tirely too much in your sleep latelyfirst yellow rugs and now its a yellow girl im through clarkes brows rose in saracenic arches and then he smiled with surprizing friendliness and a touch of wonder di why didnt you tell me sooner i could understand your craving alligator pears at in the morningi might have understood that but hating a rug is really a new one on me no stupid its nothing like that i just hate the damned thing and no more to be said well lacking the infallible alibi clarke glared and assumed his fighting faceif you mean i choose between you and the rug ill call a taxi right now dont bother ill walk the door slammed clarke twisted his mustache and achieved a laugh not merry but still a laugh and then he sank back among the cushions yellow girl i thought you were fan tastic le vieux carre wondered when the next morning it was rumored that la belle livaudaise had been seen hurry ing down saint peter street without speaking to any one of the several ac quaintances she had met but when at the green shutter and the old quarter bookstore it was announced that diane was living in a loft of the pontalba building wonder ceased for dianes friend louise had been no less garrulous than she should have been so that the habitues of the french quarter were pre pared for the news and then it was said that to gain ad mittance to clarkes studio one must know the code of taps whereby someone who at times left a certain side door bear ing bottles of pernod announced his ar rival for clarke answered neither door bell nor telephone the vendor of pernod was certainly a discreet person yet even a discreet seller of absinthe could see no harm in mentioning that his patron found enormous fascination in watching the play of sunlight and the dance of moon beams on the golden buff pile of a rug that was more a sleeping breathing crea ture than any sane child of the loom finally the courier failed to gain ad mittance despite his tapping in code and this he thought worthy of dianes ear he starves himself petitesince three days now he has not admitted me all the while she lies there gleaming in the moon that awful rugmordieu it is terrible diane had stedfastly denied that which had been clamoring for recognition but when this last bit was added to what had gone before logic gave way and dianes fears asserted themselves that rug was haunted was bewitched was bedevilling clarke logic or no logic the fact was plain driven by that monstrous thought diane exhumed the little golden key ring and started up royal street deter mined to cross the barrier before it be came impassable but her determination wavered and before fitting the wellworn key into the lock she applied her ear to the keyhole listened and heard clarkes voice diane resisted the temptation to use her key and stage a scene that even in the imperturbable vieux carré would be sensational for at least a week then her pride conquered and she achieved a most credible smile of disdain weird tales sly devil pretending it was a rug he was so absorbed in and since it was but an amorous esca pade dianes unbelievable speculations were replaced by thoughts reasonable enough not to be terrifying that very night clarke was sitting crosslegged on the floor of his studio full under the red glow of a tall bronze mosque lamp before him shim mering in the moonlight that streamed in through the french windows lay the rug from samarcand mysterious and golden with its pale sapphire corner pieces glit tering like a distant sea viewed through a cleft between two mountain crests all the witchery and ecstasy that had ever been lost in the entire world were reassembled pulsing in the silken pile which he contemplated and this was the night the night of power when fate stalked through the corridors of the world like a colossus just risen from an ageold throne of granite resistless and unconquerable clarke had spent so many nights and days of staring that it was in evitable that there must be such a night he saw more than the wonder before him in place of the marvel woven by deft forgotten hands there gleamed en chantingly as through moontouched mist a garden in the valley of zarabshan then came a faint oddly accented drumming and piping music to whose tune dead years reassembled their bones and danced forth from their graves and their ghosts as they danced exhaled an overwhelming sweetness that made clarkes brain reel and glow and his blood surge madly in anticipation of that which he knew must follow then out of the blackness just beyond the range of the ruddy mosque lamp and full into the moonlight that marched slowly across the rug came a slim yellow girl diaphanously garbed and veiled her anklets clicked faintly and very faint was the tinkle of the pendant that adorned her unusual coiffure all these many days i have sought you my lord she began as she extended her arms in welcome but in vain until tonight when at last i parted the veil and crossed the border clarke nodded understandingly and looked full into her dark faintly slanted eyes and i have been thinking of you he began ever since someone sent me this rug on which you stand it is strange how this rug could bridge the gap of twenty years and bring into my very house a glimpse of the valley of zarab shan and stranger yet that you could esecape from your fathers house and find me here though strangest of all time has not touched you when by all reason you should be old and leathery and past forty yet you are lovelier now than you were then by that fountain in a garden near samarcand it is not strange contradicted the yellow girl as she pirouetted with dainty feet across the moonlapped silk for you see me now as i was when i wove my soul into this very rug clarke smiled incredulously which was illogical enough since compared with the girls presence nothing else should be incredible how can that be yellow girl seeing that we two met one evening twenty years ago whereas this rug was woven when the great khan sat enthroned in samarcand and reproved the persian hafiz for his careless disposal of the great khans favorite cities this was the joy of kings hundreds of years before you and i were born before the last time we were born corrected the yellow girl but the first timeat least the first time that i can phase turn to page weird tales dont take the chance while every live

state weird tales the girl from samarcand continued from page recollectthe barred windows of a princes palace failed to keep you from me and eunuchs with crescentbladed simitars likewise failed but in the end why must all loveliness have an enda bowstring for me and a swordstroke for you the yellow girl shuddered as she stroked her smooth throat with fingers that sought to wipe off the last lingering memory of a cord of hardspun silk and from the first continued the girl i knew what our doom would be so i started weaving and completed my task before they suspected us and the bowstring did its work my soul my self being woven cunningly and curiously into silk rich enough to hang on the wall of the khans palace waited patiently and wondered whether you and i could have our day again thus it was in the begin ning ah now it does come back to me interrupted clarke as in a dream dimly remembered how compactly and stiflingly they would wrap me in a bale of silk and carry me past the guards and into your presence and by what devious routes i would leave you yes and how painlessly swift is the stroke of a simitar the yellow girl shuddered a simitar truly wielded is really nothing after all continued clarke i might have been sawn asunder between planks well and that meeting in the garden these short twenty years ago was after all not our first it seems that i knew then that it was not the first though but for an evening yes just for an evening so to what end were we spared bowstrings and the stroke of swift simitars since we had but an evening and thinking of the empty years of luxurious imprisonment that fol lowed she smiled somberly for only an evening and then you forgot until this rugthis same rug i wove centuries agointerrupted your pleasant adventur ing and reminded you death stared me in the face the end of life more vainly lived than the first i knew that i was leaving this avatar after having lived but one stolen evening so i sent a trusted servant to carry this very rug to meshed for when we met in the garden you were hunting rugs for him who now seeks them for your delight and i knew that he would find you if you still lived thus it is that i have crossed the border and stand before you as i did once beforethis time on that very rug which i wove centuries ago while living in hope of another meeting and in dread of the bowstring i knew would in the end find me the moon patch had marched toward the end of the rug from samarcand and was cutting into the blue web at its end clarke knew that when there remained no more room for her tiny feet she would vanish not ever to reappear but clarke hoped against knowledge yellow girl he entreated my door will be barred to friend and ac quaintance alike if you will but return on whatever nights the moon creeps across our rug had diane listening at the door understood she would have used her key but diane merely heard and i shall wait for these nights as long as life remains in me for all that has happened since then is nothing and less than nothing and all has been a dream since that one night in a garden of zarabshan very little remained of the moon weird tales patch the yellow girl stepped a tiny pace forward to prolong her stay yet another few moments all but the moon lit strip of the rug from samarcand glowed bloodily in the flare of the brazen mosque lamp no forgetful lover chided the yel low girl i can not return i can not cross the border again in samarcand eight hundred years ago we mocked for a while the doom that hung over us and in the end called the bowstring but a caress of farewell again in the garden of zarabshan we met we parted and you forgot so this time i take no chances while i can not return you at least can follow me if you will for it is very easy she edged along the ever narrowing strip of moonbathed silk and with an embracing gesture lured clarke to rise and follow her it is so easy move lightly but be careful not to disturb your body or overbalance it had diane not turned away from the door were she not even now strolling insouciantly down royal street yellow girl you and i have had enough of farewells something left clarke tottered peri lously on the two handbreadths of moon light that remained then caught the yellow girl by the hand and took the lead the blue web of the rug from samar cand gleamed for another moment in the moonlight then sweltered in the red glow of the mosque lamp coming soon goetterdaemmerung by seabury quinn a strange tale of the future by the author of the de grandin stories lose unhealthy fat

print further offthetrail stories from time to time in this magazine this story was a reverent tale of the crucifixion a hetaera from the house of mary of magdala and santa claus though there were a few dissident voices of those who thought the santa claus element childish the chorus of praise made the vote overwhelming in its favor suited to a t william f zuckert jr of washington d c writes after ten years as a silent reader of wt i take this opportunity to drop a line to the eyrie as a whole i can find little or no criticism against our maga zine because personally it suits me to a t besides on the very rare occasions when i do have an infinitesimal gripe i say noth ing because i realize that there must have been plenty of readers who did enjoy the piece who am i to yelp i like the high literary quality of the tales with that subtle horror that sort of sneaks up on one now for a couple of orchids to the authors in the december issue i particularly enjoyed the seawitch by nictzin dyalhis in my humble estimation this yarn constitutes one of the smoothest bits that ive ever read it didnt hold a dull moment nor an arid paragraph from beginning to end this let ter would be incomplete without a mention of my favorite author and character i refer of course to seabury quinn with his inimi table jules de grandina grand pair whose adventures i hope to be able to follow as long as these old eyes can see the printed page flames of vengeance in the decem ber issue was grand but when the january issue came out with roads i got a real sock what a story i was almost on the last page before it dawned on me just who claudius really was that idea was a real inspiration and you gave it to us at exactly the proper time of year keep up the good work mr quinn and i can personally guarantee you at least one family of very avid readers i could go on for pages extolling the virtues of the various authors but that isnt very practical because perhaps you would like to squeeze in a letter from some other reader so i close now with a big cheer for virgil finlay and thanks for listening the light was green richard f behm writes from los an geles thank you for john speers story the light was green a long time has passed since i have read any fiction as un usual and fascinating as the stories written by mr speer it is very evident he does not write until he is definitely sure of the ground from which his inspiration for his story sprung a letter from miss hemken gertrude hemken writes from chicago roods this is by far the loveliest christ mas story i have ever read quinn couples the teutonic legends of the nativity so beau tifully but one thing wonders meklaus after a tricennium still had the fair hair and beard yet the santa claus we know is a whitehaired whitebearded old fellow course after two thousand years most any one would grow gray butnever mind somehow or other i was a mite disappointed in dorothy quick this time her witch was somehow so very like another enchantress in a wk story by an equally wk author i really dont care for these supple sirens and their frightening powers give me a couple of ripsnorters like conan and north west smithbrave lassies like jirel of joiry weird tales finlays full page is much more to my taste this time the spires and skyline look so other worldish well guess ill wait for another installment of the hairy ones shall dance before i commentsomehow that devils croft is enticing ragghwoof grrri like so very much this toean mat jan but i cannot pronounce such words sat isfactorily and so i am riled in spite of a cat taleand such a pretty white cat i have often wondered if a tiger would make a good pet and so the verrüchter austrian is now a block of ice in the black vastnesses of the voidand thus ends his the voyage of the neutralia i found the closing install ment rather flat except for the venusian centipedes and volcano doctor keller turned out a nice one with his valley of bones such i believe is entirely possible in this strange land of africa i was pleased to see your reprint of ethan brandi have read it so many times along with others of haw thornes tales both lusty and devout manly wade wellman writes from new york city let me vote for quinns roads as the most impressive thing in the january wt it gives me to think thus does not the world of fantasy hold its good powers as well as evil its saints and angels as well as its fiends and devils roads was both lusty and devout as a good christmas tale should be finlay frontispiece robert a madle writes from

reprints represent in theory and usually in practise the cream of bygone is sues i shouldnt be surprized if a demand soon arose for a rereprint section in which some of the reprints of eight and nine years ago might reappear once more you began reprinting from back numbers in when wt was only five years old now it has rounded out its fifteenth year and it might be reasoned that a story which was worth reprinting once five years after its first publication might merit another such honor ten years later overrated richard kraft of allenhurst new jersey writes to my mind the most overrated story you have ever published was quest of the starstone it was simply a cheap thriller and did not compare with paul ernsts dread summons or rex ernests the inn in the december issue edmond hamilton again writes a winner child of atlantis hamil ton is the best in the business and i enjoy his work immensely the seawitch was terrible i cant see what weird tales readers will find in it as it was slow and tiresome noth ing like that swell story of mary counsel mans in that issue the black stone statue virgil finlays drawings doctor karl k webber writes from flora illinois this is the first time i have writ ten you although i have been an avid reader of weird tales for about six years in the december issue the seawitch is tops with flames of vengeance a close sec ond and child of atlantis hot on the lat ters heels one thing must be kept in your publication and that is virgil finlays draw ing im a little bit of an artist myself and i recognize a masterful touch when i see it no one can approach his subtle mastery of pen and ink orchids to virgil a million congratulations julius hopkins writes from washington d c roads is one of the most highclass stories that wt has ever printed through out the language is elevating and not the usual pulpy kind prevalent in a great many tales written today i truly believe that any magazine would have been glad to have this story between its covers wt should be mighty proud to have been privileged to print it a million congratulations to you mr quinn for a really outstanding story norse mythology m w schauffler of larchmont new york writes the howard and quinn stories have been what i have bought the magazine for and i have been buying it for eight years one other thing which makes your magazine a pleasure is that almost always the mythology and other background data are accurate so please speak to nictzin dyalhis if you dont mind and ask him to check a little more carefully i dont know when i have liked a story better than the seawitch but the moment when his witch and his hero both agreed that ran was a god not a goddess wrecked the illusion of factuality for me to the end of the story and there were two other minor slips no viking was ever named gudrun any more than he was named eliza and for the same reasonit is a womans name neither was comnenus ever spelled with two nsdtough thats a small matter as for the vikings re frain to the rowingsong he probably knows more than i do about thati am not an authority on norse legends but i have a feeling that it isnt entirely or at least typ ically a sea refrain quinns masterpiece bernard austin dwyer writes from west shokan new york my first choice of stories in the january issue is roads by sea bury quinn this is truly quinns master piece i have never seen anything even re motely so good by him in my opinion it far overtops even the phantom farmhouse apart from the story itself which is delight ful and wonderfulthe fetching together of such ordinarily widely separated elements as christs crucifixion a blond heroic warrior from the north a harlot from the house of magdalene the eastern and western dynas ties and the middle ages the little carved sleighs the dwarf faery smiths of the moun tains and the legend of santa clausthe style itself is very beautiful i love especially the last few paragraphs with their flavor of the iron and heroic north the valhallalike feast how klaus laid aside his arms and the final piercing and beautiful paragraph but i love everythingthe story and the style from beginning to end this story will go down as one of the very best by any weird tales author ever to be published in weird tales it is a masterpiece fit to rank with howards kings of the night or lovecrafts whisperer in darkness i feel impelled to thank mr quinn heartily for giving me the opportunity to read so satisfactory wonder fully imaginative and beautiful a story that style is something to dream about next i will mention a very short poemlost dream dedicated to our departed master lovecraft by emil petaja may i express my appreciation of how that little poem coin cides with ones impressions of the works of lovecraft one fumbles in his scarlet cloak i see his slender fingers movehe turns a key a silver key of course congratu lations to mr petaja for his splendid little poem may we hope for more my next favorite story is toean matjan by vennette herrona very good story well tied togeth er and beautiful style it is exquisitely writ ten i dont know when i have read a more entertaining story written in better style in fact i like the style quite as well as that of roads only that it is of course shorter i am quite sure that i should not care to court that lady i like the witchs mark and the hairy ones shall dance in the latter it is already rather obvious that the wolfish ma terialization came from doctor zobergvide his thick sinewy wrists it is right enter taining let me too commend most warmly the inn in a recent issue splendid atmos phere compliment and complaint wilfred wright writes from toronto during the last fifteen years that i have been a consistent reader of wt i have only written twice to the eyrie submitting my comments but your january issue compels me to write for the third time to express a compliment and a complaint first the com pliment roads by seabury quinn stands out as the most beautiful piece of fantasy ever published in any magazine from early in the story the outcome was obvious yet at no time did it detract from the beauty or in terest of the compelling and reverent treat ment of a sacred theme mr quinn is in deed to be congratulated upon his ability and i wish to extend to him my personal thanks for enriching my christmas by his magnificent story now for the

comparatively large number of stories from weird tales that have been reprinted or awarded honorable mention in annual best fic tion anthologies you are assured of reading the best when you read weird tales the unique magazine weird tales appreciate it as a very splendid weird tale it should have been entered as a reprint as i read the same story in the magazine section of the toronto star weekly three or four months ago with the exception of the re print story i always had the impression that all stories published in weird tales were original and i would like to be informed regarding the editorial policy in this matter as for my voting for the best stories in the current issue it is on this occasion impos sible for with all appreciation for the other tales in this issue seabury quinns roads defies comparison toean matjan was sold to us as a new story which had seen publica tion in england only we did not know that it had been printed in canada like many other publications weird tales oc casionally buys outstanding stories that have already been printed in the british isles but we do not knowingly use stories that have been published in north americathe editor brickbats j vernon shea jr writes from pitts burgh i wish seabury quinn hadnt writ ten roads for that tale for children has no place in wt it made me squirm of the stories in the january issue i prefer toean matjan a beautifully written version of a familiar theme miss herron is a highly promising newcomer edmond hamilton had a novel idea in the house of living music but ruined it by his formula hand ling the witchs mark marks considerable of an advancement for dorothy quick but i for one am pretty fedup with witch women especially when they go through their alltoofamiliar routines i wish you would caution your authors against topical subjects as applied to weird tales they have not the immediacy the authors imagine them to have but intrude unpleasantly in a non realistic field thus the attempted lynching in the hairy ones shall dance which seems to be taken from the motion picture fury seemed wildly incongruous in wt dont misunderstand me i am very fond of realism in a realistic story but hardly con sider much realism fitting for wt a new reader margaret h gray writes from steuben ville ohio greetings from a compara tively new member of your circle of weird tales readers i have been reading your magazine for only one short year much to my chagrin i have just completed the jan uary edition and i say that there are entire ly too many days to wait until february the witchs mark was by far the best in this is sue perhaps i am prejudiced as i am brim ful of irish and scottish folklore but the translating of deidre and shamus into mod ern life is in my eyes a masterpiece some more stories just like it please dorothy quick by the way is she irish virgil finlays illustrations are still splendiferous thats my own invention and m brun dages cover picture is grand toean mat jan by vennette herron rates second in my list i love stories like this may we have some more if you please i am collecting all of those illustration passages from poetry so that i can frame them couldnt you make them in color i think i have asked too many questions already good luck wt and may the sun never set on your splendid magazine a posing tiger michael liene writes from hazleton pennsylvania toean matjan by vennette herron was a strange little tale beautifully written the tiger in the illustration looks suspiciously like the one used to advertise listerine mouth wash or some such or did this tiger take up posing for advertisements in the spare time he had aside from jealous ly guarding our heroine of the story were it not for quinns beautifully told story roads i would have given toean matjan first place in the january issuethe story i mean not the tiger gans t fields the hairy ones shall dance serial has start ed out quite thrillingly it leaves the reader all prepared for startling events which will either make or ruin the story but if the first installment is any indication of shud ders i just took my racoon coat out of storage he wants a sequel alvin v pershing writes from anderson indiana would it be proper to ask for a sequel to the seawitch that story was a tremendous knockout amazing and weird it was one of the best stories i have ever read virgils blackandwhite frontispiece was a real addition to the magazine quinn and howard j mackay tait writes from bridgetown weird tales nova scoria in my humble opinion the most thoroughly enjoyable stories that ap pear in wt are those by such writers as seabury quinn and robert e howard how i miss that boy in which there is a little humanity a little humor a little happiness poes works are abnormal the product ad mittedly so of a diseased mind they arent true to life they are literary lunacy analogous in art to the works of dali or in sculpture to those of epstein there is never any situation no matter how desperate in which all hope and humor are entirely ab sent i served four years with the canadian infantry during the war and although we lived in terror a great deal of the time particularly ii never once found myself in a position where it was all fear and horror in this months wt there is a story by nictzin dyalhis the seawitcb that i be lieve to be one of the best ever to appear in our magazine and my opinion is not in fluenced by the really splendid cover design by virgil finlaya vast improvement over some of the misproportioned females who have displayed their impossible charms on covers of the past even if the girl has mis placed her navel the story deals with the occult it has horror it has suspense but it also has love tenderness humor not funni ness and a delightfully unexpected happy ending another criticism i might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb i have to make of a great many of your stories al though not only of the poe style is directed at the obviously labored attempts at main taining an atmosphere of gloom and im pending evil throughout the narrative why should this be necessary because a man walking along a lonely country road in a rainstorm is to encounter half a mile far ther on a grisly werewolf is no reason that i can see for the limbs of the trees to ap pear like skeleton arms reaching out for him or for the raindrops to fall with the sound of hissing snakes bent upon his destruction or for the wind to howl at him with the voices of a thousand haunted spirits unless he is mentally abnormal neurotic or a con firmed and industrious disciple of bacchus a country road would be a country road and nothing more it may be the tradition to write weird stories in that way but it is il logical nevertheless horror rarely sets the stage before descending upon us i wish it did when it strikes it strikes suddenly next month the eyes of the mummy by robert bloch that young writing marvel robert bloch has

happiness we are switched to misery and back again almost without knowing how it all happened the trouble with striving constantly for this kind of atmosphere is that it defeats its own pur pose you are plunged into gloom with the storys first paragraph and are mentally pre pared for anything that may happen when i bought a volume of poes works some years ago i naturally waded through those deal ing in horror first waded is the mot juste by the time i had read three of them i was so saturated with their atmosphere that they had lost all value as shockers i have never finished the volume and i never will this is sacrilege but i cant help it people are constantly borrowing my bookssometimes they return thembut i have never had any one of them borrow the volume of poe al though it still retains its attractive redand black cover i dont believe people like that kind of literature they like horror mys tery even cruelty but they like it dished up palatably you can consign this to the edi torial wastebasket if you like but it is my sincere conviction that more stories of the seabury quinn type would sell more copies of wt concise comments t o mabbott writes from new york city my votes

santa claus eas ily won first place vennette herrons story about the weretiger came next w t coming next month at the core of the strange garden where a circular space was still vacant amid the crowding growths adompha came to a mound of loamy freshdug earth beside it wholly nude and pale and supine as if in death there lay the odalisque thulo neah near her various knives and other implements together with vials of liquid balsams and viscid gums that dwerulas used in his grafting had been emptied upon the ground from a leathern bag a plant known as the dedaim with a bulbous pulpy whitishgreen bole from whose center rose and radiated several leafless reptilian boughs dripped upon thulo neahs bosom an occasional drop of yellowishred ichor from incisions made in its smooth bark behind the loamy mound dwerulas rose to view with the suddenness of a demon emerging from his subterrene lair in his hands he held the spade with which he had just finished digging a deep and gravelike hole beside the regal stature and girth of adompha he seemed no more than a wizened dwarf his aspect bore all the marks of immense age as if dusty centuries had sered his flesh and sucked the blood from his veins his eyes glowed in the bottom of pitlike orbits his features were black and sunken as those of a longdead corpse his body was gnarled as some millennial desert cedar he stooped incessantly so that his lank knotty arms hung almost to the ground adompha marveled at the strength of those arms marveled that dwerulas could have wielded the heavy shovel so expeditious ly could have carried to the garden on his back the burden of those victims whose members he had utilized in his experiments the king had never demeaned himself to assist at such labors but after indicating from time to time the people whose disappearance would in no wise displease him had done nothing more than watch and supervise the baroque gardening is she dead adompha questioned eyeing the luxurious limbs and body of thuloneah without emotion nay said dwerulas in a voice harsh as a rusty coffinhinge but i have administered to her the drowsy and overpowering juice of the dedaim her heart beats impalpably her blood flows with the sluggishness of that mingled ichor she will not reawaken save as a part of the gardens life sharing its obscure sentience i wait now your further in structions what portion or portions her hands were very deft said adompha as if musing aloud in reply to the half uttered question they knew the subtle ways of love and were learned in all amorous arts i would have you preserve her hands but nothing else a strange story indeed is this written in the magic words of one of the greatest living masters of weird fiction what happened to thuloneah
