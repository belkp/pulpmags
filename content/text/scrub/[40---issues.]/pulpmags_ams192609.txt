general offices s park place new york n y extravagant fiction today cold fact tomorrow editorially speaking by hugo gernsback to their liking and we are certain that if the name of the magazine had been scientifiction they would not have been attracted to it at a newsstand and after all we really need not make any excuses for amazing stories because the title represents exactly what the stories really are there is a stand ing rule in our editorial offices that unless the story is amazing it should not be published in the maga zine to be sure the amazing quality is only one requisite because the story must contain science in every case a great many letters are also received from readers who wish to contribute material to amazing stories the formula in all cases is that first the story must be frankly amazing second it must con tain scientific background third it must possess originality at the present time we are booked far ahead for long stories of the novel type and there fore can only accept short new stories stories that do not run more than six to eight pages when print ed are most welcome providing they fill the above re quirements we believe the era of scientifiction is just commencing we are receiving a great many fine short stories and as time goes on we will pub lish more and more new material besides the classics which we are publishing now and for which we have many requests from readers the editors also wish it to be understood that this is your magazine in all respects they will always be guided by the wishes of the majority we will pub lish from time to time a sort of voting blank in which you may show your preference as to the type of stories published in the various issues you will find such a blank elsewhere in this issue at this point we wish to say that the voting con test which we conducted several months ago has now been closed the vote stood as follows leave the magazine monthly as it is now make it a semimonthly we will probably accede to the wishes of the read ers as soon as the circulation of the magazine has become stabilized which will probably be some time before the end of this year mr hugo gemsback speaks every monday at p m from wrny on various scientific and radio subjects number of letters have reached the editors desk recently from enthusiastic readers who find fault with the name of the publication namely amazing stories these readers would greatly prefer us to use the title scientifiction instead the message that these letters seem to convey is that the name really does not do the magazine justice and that many people get an erroneous impression as to the literary contents from this title several years ago when i first conceived the idea of publishing a scientifiction magazine a circular letter was sent to some people informing them that a new magazine by the name scientific tion was shortly to be launched the response was such that the idea was given up for two years the plain truth is that the word scientifiction while admittedly a good one scares off many people who would otherwise read the magazine before the name of amazing stories was first decided upon a prize contest was held but no better name than amazing stories out of a list of some names could be found the name scientific tion would undoubtedly frighten many readers who would perhaps otherwise be interested in this new type of fiction after mature thought the publish ers decided that the name which is now used was after all the best one to influence the masses because anything that smacks of science seems to be too deep for the average type of reader we knew that once we could make a new reader pick up amazing stories and read only one story our cause was won with that reader and this is in deed what happened although the magazine is not as yet six months old we are already printing copies per month and it also seems that when ever we get a new reader we keep him a totally unforeseen result of the name strange to say was that a great many women are already reading the new magazine this is most encouraging we know that they must have picked up amazing stories out of curiosity more than anything else and found it to this he was being towed as a balloon might be towed by men out of the open country into a town he approached it very slowly and very slowly the dim irradiation was gathered together into more definite shapes in the abyss a fivemile descent into the ocean nt stood in front of the steel gnawed a piece of pine fwhat do you think of it he asked lea said steevens in the tone of one who keeps an open mind i believe it will smashflat said the lieuten ant he seems to have calculated it all out pretty well said steevens still impartial but think of the pressure said the lieutenant at the surface of the water its fourteen pounds to the inch thirty feet down its double that sixty treble ninety four times nine hundred forty times five thousand three hundredthats a mile its two hundred and forty times fourteen pounds thatslets seethirty hundredweighta ton and a half steevens a ton and a half to the square inch and the ocean where hes going is five miles deep thats seven and a half sounds a lot said steevens but its jolly thick steel the lieutenant made no answer but resumed his pine splinter the object of their conversation was a huge ball of steel having an exterior diameter of perhaps nine feet it looked like the shot for some titanic piece of artillery it was elaborately nested in a monstrous scaffolding built into the framework of the vessel and the gigantic spars that were pre sently to sling it overboard gave the stern of the ship an appearance that had raised the curiosity of every decent sailor who had sighted it from the pool of london to the tropic of capricorn in two places one above the other the steel gave place to a couple of circular windows of enormously thick glass and one of these set in a steel frame of great solidity was now partially unscrewed both the men had seen the interior of this globe for the first time that morning it was elaborately padded with air cushions with little studs sunk between bulg ing pillows to work the simple mechanism of the affair everything was elaborately padded even the myers apparatus which was to absorb car bonic acid and replace the oxygen inspired by its tenant when he had crept in by the glass manhole and had been screwed in it was so elaborately pad ded that a man might have been fired from a gun in it with perfect safety and it had need to be for presently a man vras to crawl in through that glass manhole to be screwed up tightly and to be flung overboard and sink downdowndown for five miles even as the lieutenant said it had taken the strongest hold of his imagination it made him a bore at mess and he found steevens the new arrival aboard a god send to talk about it over and over again its my opinion said the lieutenant that that glass will simply bend in and bulge and smash un der a pressure of that sort daubrse has madei rocks run like water under big pressureand you mark my words if the glass did break in said steevens what then the water would shoot in like a jet of iron have you ever felt a straight jet of high pressure water it would hit as hard as a bullet it would simply smash him and flatten him it would tear down his throat and into his lungs it would blow his ears in what a detailed imagination you have pro tested steevens who saw things vividly its a simple statement of the inevitable said the lieutenant and the globe would just give out a few little bubbles and it would settle down comfortably against the day of judgment among the oozes and the bottom clay with poor elstead spread over his own smashed cushions like butter over bread he repeated this sentence as though he liked it very much like butter over bread he said having a look at the jigger said a voice and elstead stood behind them spick and span in white with a cigarette between his teeth and his eyes smiling out of the shadow of his ample hatbrim whats that about bread and butter weybridge grumbling as usual about insufficient pay of naval officers it wont be more than a day now before i start we are to get the slings ready today this clean sky and gentle swell is just the kind of thing for swinging off a dozen tons of lead and iron isnt it it wont affect you much said weybridge no seventy or eighty feet down and i shall be there in a dozen seconds theres not a particle mov ing though the wind shriek itself hoarse up above and the water lifts halfway to the clouds no down there he moved to the side of the ship and the other two followed him all three leant on their elbows and stared down into the yellowgreen water a description of the apparatus said elstead finishing his thought aloud are you dead certain that clockwork will act asked weybridge pres ently it has worked thirty five times said elstead its bound to work but if it doesnt why shouldnt it i wouldnt go down in that confounded thing said weybridge for twenty thousand pounds cheerful chap you are said elstead and spat sociably at a bubble below i dont understand yet how you mean to work the thing said steevens in the first place im screwed into the sphere said elstead and when ive turned the electric light off and on three times to show im cheerful im swung out over the stern by that crane with all those big lead sinkers slung below me the top lead cjcience informs us that all life originally came from the sea whether plant life or animal life all had its ut origin m the waters of the ocean mans ancestry can readily be traced back to the fish from our spinal column to our hair hair science teaches vs is nothing but a modified fish scale the thought that intelligent thinking beings could live at the bottom of the ocean should therefore not be scoffed at it is this theme that our famous author has chosen in this fascinating tale which you will follow with breathless interest down to the last word mumil g amazing stories weight has a roller carrying a hundred fathoms of strong cord rolled up and thats all that joins the sinkers to the sphere except the slings that will be cut when the affair is dropped we use cord rather than wire rope because its easier to cut and more buoyantnecessary points as you will see through each of these lead weights you notice there is a hole and an iron rod will be run through that and will project six feet on the lower side if that rod is rammed up from below it knocks up a lever and sets the clockwork in motion at the side of the cylinder on which the cord winds very well the whole affair is lowered gently into the water and the slings are cut the sphere floatswith the air in it its lighter than water but the lead weights go down straight and the cord runs out when the cord is all paid out the sphere will go down too pulled down by the cord but why the cord asked steevens why not fasten the weights directly to the sphere because of the smash down below the whole affair will go rushing down mile after mile at a headlong pace at last it would be knocked to pieces on the bottom if it wasnt for that cord but the weights will hit the bottom and directly they do the buoyancy of the sphere will come into play it will go on sinking slower and slower come to a stop at last and then begin to float upward again thats where the clockwork comes in directly the weights smash against the sea bottom the rod will be knocked through and will kick up the clock work and the cord will be rewound on the reel i shall be lugged down to the sea bottom there i shall stay for half an hourwith the electric light on looking about me then the clockwork wiil release a spring knife the cord will be cut and up i shall rush again like a sodawater bubble the cord it self will help the flotation and if you should chance to hit a ship said veybridge i should come up at such a pace i should go clean through it said elstead like a cannon ball you neednt worry about that and suppose some nimble crustacean should wriggle into your clockwork it would be a pressing sort of invitation for me to stop said elstead turning his back on the water and staring at the sphere starting the descent they had swung elstead overboard by eleven oclock the day was serenely bright and calm with the horizon lost in haze the electric glare in the little upper compartment beamed cheerfully three times then they let him down slowly to the surface of the water and a sailor in the rudder chains hung ready to cut the tackle that held the lead weights and the sphere together the globe which had looked so large on deck looked the smallest thing conceivable under the stern of the ship it rolled a little and its two dark windows which floated upper most seemed like eyes turned up in round wonder ment at the people who crowded the rail a voice wondered how elstead liked the rolling are you ready sang out the commander ay ay sir then let her go the rope of the tackle tightened against the blade and was cut and an eddy rolled over the globe in a grotesquely helpless fashion some one waved a handkerchief some one else tried an ineffectual cheer a middy was counting slowly eight nine ten another roll then with a jerk and a splash the thing righted itself it seemed to be stationary for a moment to grow rapidly smaller and then the water closed over it and it became visible enlarged by refraction and dimmer below the surface before one could count three it had disappeared there was a flicker of white light far down in the water that diminished to a speck and vanished then there was nothing but a depth of water going down into blackness through which a shark was swimming then suddenly the screw of the cruiser began to rotate the water was crickled the shark disappeared in a wrinkled confusion and a torrent of foam rush ed across the crystalline clearness that had swallow ed up elstead whats the idea said one ab to another were going to lay off about a couple of miles fear he should hit us when he comes up said his mate the ship steamed slowly to her new position aboard her almost every one who was unoccupied re mained watching the breathing swell into which the sphere had sunk for the next halfhour it is doubtful if a word was spoken that did not bear directly or indirectly on elstead the december sunswas now high in the sky and the heat very con siderable hell be cold enough down there said wey bridge they say that below a certain depth sea waters always just about freezing wherell he come up asked steevens ive lost my bearings thats the spot said the commander who prided himself on his omniscience he expended a precise finger southeastward and this i reckon is pretty nearly the moment he said hes been thirtyfive minutes how long does it take to reach the bottom of the ocean asked steevens for a depth of five miles and reckoningas we didan acceleration of two feet per second both ways is just about five minutes suspense and waiting sy fathoms above them to distinguish the indi vi iuals in those crowds a city of the abyss and its people the explorers end then slowly they pulled him down and as they did so the details of the place crept slowly upon his apprehension he saw that the courses of cbudy buildings were marked out with beaded lined of round objects and then he perceived that at sev eral points below him in broad open spaces were forms like the encrusted shapes of ships slowly and surely he was drawn down and the forms below him became brighter clearer more dis tinct he was being pulled down he perceived to wards the large building in the center of the town and he could catch a glimpse ever and again of the multitudinous forms that were lugging at his cord he was astonished to see that the rigging of one of the ships which formed such a prominent feature of the place was crowded with a host of gesticulating figures regarding him and then the walls of the great building rose about him silently and hid the city from his eyes and such walls they were of waterlogged wood and twisted wirerope and iron spars and copper and the bones and skulls of dead men the skulls ran in zigzag lines and spirals and fantastic curves over the building and in and out of their eyesock ets and over the whole surface of the place lurked and played a multitude of silvery little fishes suddenly his ears were filled with a low shouting and a noise like the violent blowing of horns and this gave place to a fantastic chant down the sphere sank past the huge pointed windows through which he saw vaguely a great number of these strange ghostlike people regarding him and at last he came to rest as it seemed on a kind of altar that stood in the centre of the place and now he was at such a level that he could see these strange people of the abyss plainly once more to his astonishment he perceived that they were prostrating themselves before him all but one dressed as it seemed in a robe of placoid scales and crowned with a luminous diadem who stood with his reptilian mouth opening and shutting as though he led the chanting of the worshippers a curious impulse made elstead turn on his small glowlamp again so that he became visible to these creatures of the abyss albeit the glare made them disappear forthwith into night at this sudden sight of him the chanting gave place to a tumult of exultant shouts and elstead being anxious to watch them turned his light off again and vanished from before their eyes but for a time he was too blind to make out what they were doing and when at last he could distinguish them they were kneel ing again and thus they continued worshipping him without rest or intermission for the space of three hours most circumstantial was elsteads account of this astounding city and its people these people of per petual night who have never seen sun or moon or stars green vegetation nor any living airbreath ing creatures who know nothing of fire nor any light but the phosphorescent light of living things startling as is his story it is yet more startling to find that scientific men of such eminence as adams and jenkins find nothing incredible in it they tell me they see no reason why intelligent waterbreathing vertebrated creatures inured to a low temperature and enormous pressure and of such a heavy structure that neither alive nor dead would they float might not live upon the bottom of the deep sea and quite unsuspected by us descendants like ourselves of the great theriomorphs of the new red sandstone age we should be known to them however as strange continued on page cfl columbus of s pace author of the moon metal the second deluge etc the creature wa crushing the plana bending its sides like pasteboard with that mighty trunk for my part i was paralyzed by the awful spectacle but edmunds sharp command brought me to my senses a columbus of space what went before rhe hero of the story edmund stonewall has discovered how to utilize atomic ener gy he constructs a car that can traverse interplanetary space actuated by this energy and two friends starts on a trip to the planet venus not disclosing to them his intention at first he reaches a rather desolate part of the planet here daylight never appears sees the almost ape like inhabitants cave dwellers who wish to sacri fice one of them to the gods and they rescue the proposed victim only by killing the high priest they get in among the valleys in a mountain of ice on the edge of the dark face of the planet tak ing with them some of the cave dwellers on sleds the car with sleds fastened alongside and all but one of the cavedwellers upon them is carried now along a sort of glacial stream but soon sleds and the unfortunate occupants disappear and our trav ellers are left with only one of the apelike cave dwellers juba as company now they reach the warm regions of venus where there is perpetual day and there find a highly developed race who communicate with each other by a species of tele pathy and our travelers are enchanted by the beau tiful appearance of the beings who are superior in every way to terrestrial mankind a columbus of space by garrett p serviss part ii chapter ix an astonishing reception at the capital didnt feel myself quite all the confi dence that i tried to express to henry for this scrape differed essentially from any that we had been in yet but still i relied a good deal upon edmunds resources it presently became evident that the man he had killed was a personage of importancean admiral perhaps anyway it was clear that they meant to make us pay for what we had done there was one thing however which gave me a little comfort and awoke the hope that we might yet escape this was the behavior of ala she seemed to be not much more than a girl in age but she was treated on all hands with the greatest respect her word was law that was evident the moment they began to come aboard our ship it was not only our crew if i may so call them that obeyed her but every body and it was delight ful to see the dignity with which she bore herself she was a very prin cess in manner and car riage and yet there was something peculiarly gentle in all her ways which made her irresistibly winning i could not think that as far as i might depend upon her she would approve the exaction of a very severe punishment for edmunds unintentional of fense and i was the more convinced of this when i reflected upon what i had noticed in their bearing toward one another during the trip considering where we were no doubt it may seem ridiculous to speak of such a thing as love but there is love at first sight on the earthwhy not there a world inhabited by such beings as we had encountered who certainly were human in their characteristics and almost more than human in their beauty while on the other hand edmund was as manly a representative of the race of adam as i have ever looked upon and he had the light of genius in his eyes anyway take it how you will i believed that a mutual attraction had been felt by these two in habitants of different worlds and i began to think that this very thing had been in edmunds mind when he forbade us to resist as soon as our captors found that we offered no resistance they partially released their grasp but we were all bound so that we could not escape having passed over the land we rose a little higher for there was a range of hills ahead of us and then flanked on both sides by other air ships we held our course toward the distant moun tains whether the sug gestion came from ed mund or not i cannot say but our car which had been towed over the sea was now lifted upon one of the larger airships and it continued to ac company us i felt very glad to see that all our hopes of ultimate escape centered upon our own original car floating aerial palaces in the course of several hours of very rapid travel ing we began to draw near the mountains and now those singular cobweblike objects which we had caught sight of in the far distance became very plain to view although prisoners we were not v this installment professor serviss introduces us info the daylight as well as the cbihsed hemisphere of the planet venus we become acquainted with the high culture of the injiahitaits of the planet with their thought reading ability with their prismatic silent but colorful language as well as the grotesque dangers of the twilight zone where prehistoric beasts as high as houses are still roaming in their virgin forests particular attention is called to professor servisss accurate astronomical and scientific knowledge and if the planet venus is indeed enveloped in a dense attnos phere as now believed by most scientists you may be certain that conditions exactly as described by the author prevail amazing stories kept separate and no attempt was made to prevent our conversing as the strange objects grew more distinct jack who had recovered his equanimity was as usual the first to speak by jove edmund he said heres a new chance for your genius for explaining mysteries jvhat are those things im surprised that you havent guessed was the reply its perfectly plain what they are not airships certainly not theyre palaces talaces why of course castles in spain i reckon said jack disdain fully no simply castles in the air why shouldnt they float such things here this atmosphere is exactly suited for them you see how easily these airplanes ride it is a region of atmospheric calm only the most gentle breezes are stirring i doubt if there is ever a high wind here its ex actly what we should expect of these people they are almost as much inhabitants of the air as of the land and could any idea be more beautiful than that nobody replied we were lost in admiration both of the idea and of the scene it seemed probable that edmund was right again as we continued to approach we became convinced that he was for the details of the airy architec ture began to be visible first we saw an immense number of towers looming up with stage above stage like the huge steel buildings of new york before they received their outer coverings but infinitely lighter and more delicate truly fairy constructions glittering with thousands of brilliant points then below these apparently anchoring the floating structures to the earth appeared long cables which from our distance resembled gossamer threads bespangled with dew still nearer and at last we believed that we could see people in the buoyant towers a few minutes later there was no doubt about it for the colors broke forth and that marvelous inter change of chromatic signals which had so astound ed and delighted us on nearing the coast was re sumed it is my belief said edmund that notwith standing the buoyancy of the air they are compel led to use power to keep those aerial edifices afloat you will see when we are nearer that every stage is furnished with revolving screws which help to hold them in position without that i am sure they would not stay up particularly when there are people upon them and so it turned out in a short time we were near enough to see the screws working in a maze of motion like the wings of a multitude of insects the resemblance to insects wings was increased by their gauzy structure and they flashed and glittered as if enameled the vast towers swayed slightly to and fro with a sinuous motion between us and the swimming palaces was an other range of hills and as we approached near enough to look over into the valley behind we ut tered a cry of surprise a vast city made its appearance a magnified coun terpart of the aerial city about it i have seen con stantinople in the morning sun from across the bosphorus i have beheld damascus with its spires i have admired the domes and minarets of cairo shining in the gold of an egyptian sunset but all of these spectacles combined with all that the imagination has pictured of such scenes and multiplied a thousandfold in beauty and complex ity would give but a faint idea of what was spread before us it is surely the capital said edmund there can be nothing greater than this the capital of the kingdom it was indeed the capital for in the midst of it of it rose an edifice of unparalleled splendor which could only be the palace of a mighty king above this magnificent building which gleamed with metallic reflections although it was as light and airy in construction as frostwork rose the loftiest of the aerial towers a hundred stories in height while the other craft fell back we kept on until we reached the principal stage of this tower from below ran a crowd of smaller airships which ran up and down the sides of the tower stopping at various stages discharging their living cargoes elevators said edmund sententiously glancing around we saw that the same scenes were occurring at all the neighboring towers they were filling up with people and the continual rising and descending of the little craft that bore them the holiday aspect of the gay colors everywhere dis played and the general brilliancy of the spectacle produced a deep impression upon us but the most astonishing effect still awaited us just as our vessel reached the landing stage the enormous tower from foot to apex broke out with all the hues of the prism like an enchanted rose tree covered with millions of brilliant flowers at the touch of a wand the effect was overwhelming the air became tremulous with rippling colors whose vibrant waves with quick succession of con cordant tints gave to the eye an exquisite pleasure akin to that which the ear receives from a carillon of bells our companions and the people crowded on the tower seemed transplanted with ecstatic delight the music of the spectrum cried edmund the diapason of color this is their national hymn written on a prismatic instead of a sonome tric staff and mark me this has a significance beyond your conjectures such a reception can only mean that our conductress is a person of the most exalted rank we were not long in doubt as to that our craft was made fast and ala was the first to step upon the landing stage and pass into the tower she was received on every hand with the most respectful salutations a tall young man as handsome as apollo met her with a profound genuflection and conducted her beyond our sight then we were led ashore the curiosity that we excited was immense they pressed and thronged about us men women and children speaking rapidly in their low tones and exchanging thoughts by glances of the eye a columbus of space we could fee what they said about us we knew that they regarded us as inhabitants of the mysterious unvisited side of their world and the contrast in appearance between juba and us amazed them as it had amazed their countrymen who first beheld us but they were not afforded much opportunity to study us for we were hustled through the throng without catching sight of ala again and presently we embarked with our captors on one of the ele vators and made a thrillingly rapid descent ar rived at the bottom we were led through some long stonewalled passages into a veritable dungeon and there they left us i wondered if this had been done by alas orders the reflection shook my confidence in my theory i wasnt prepared for this said edmund speak ing through the darkness for we could not see one another but i couldnt have been better provided if i had foreseen the emergency almost as he spoke a brilliant light illuminated the place he had turned on a pocket electric lamp we looked about and found that we were in a square chamber about fifteen feet on a side with walls of heavy closely dressed and matched stones they make these things solid enough down here aid jack however light and airy they may be ve in prison henry sank upon the floor the picture of dejec tion and despair i expected from him another outbreak like that in the icemountains but he spoke not a word his heart was too full for utterance i pitied him so much that it served to reanimate my spirits a little come now i said dont take it that way man have confidence in edmund he has never yet been beaten hes got his hands full this time i reckon jack broke in pessimistically what do you think ed mund can your interatomic energy bore a hole through these walls if i had anything to work with youd see ed mund replied but theres no occasion to worry well come out all right it was his universal remark when in difficulties and somehow it always enheartened us juba more accustomed than we were to such situations seemed to be the least disturbed member of the party he rolled his huge eyes around and then lay down on the floor and seemed at once to fall asleep thats a good idea said edmund smiling its a long time since weve had a nap lets all try a little sleep i may dream of some way out of this it was a fact that we were exhausted for want of sleep and in spite of our situation we fell into deep slumber as peaceful as if we had been in our beds at home edmund had turned out the lamp and the silence and the darkness were equally pro found planning an escape i have no idea how long i slept i only know that i awoke startled by the light and found them all on their feet except juba who sat on the floor blinking his big eyes edmund seeing me rise said at once ive found a way out im half disposed not to try it because i have an idea that well come out all right anyhow but when you are in a hole and providence throws you a rope perhaps its best to test it what have you found out something extremely simple this is no prison cell but a part of what we should call the engine rooms probably its a mere storeroom they have put us here for convenience trusting more to the darkness than to the lock for the corridors out side are as black as erebus and as crooked as a labyrinth how do you know because while you slept i investigated the lock is nothing the merest tyro could pick it fortunately they never guessed i had a lamp in my pocket around a corner a little way from our door there is another door opening into a passage that leads past a powerhouse that passage gives ac cess to a sort of garage of airplanes and when i stole into it five minutes ago there was not a soul in sight well simply slip out there and if i cant run away with one of their machines im no engineer i thought of ala again and edmunds expres sion of confidence in our ultimate safety made me hesitate to take this new risk but jack and henry were eager to get out and we decided to try motioning juba to follow we stole out and stepping noiselessly by the powerhouse where we saw several men at work we found ourselves among the airplanes edmund had no difficulty in opening a door which led out into a deserted court yard i never admired edmund more than when i saw the masterly way in which he manipulated one of the airplanes one would have said that it was his own inven tion so well did he handle it it rested on runners and all we had to do was to push it out of the door while edmund turned on the power we jumped aboard and in a moment were circling in the air at this instant we were seen there was a flash ing of signals and two airplanes shot into sight above us now for a chase said edmund we darted upward in a long curve the others turned and swooped upon us chapter x a parley ten miles high with a quick turn edmund dodged thel nearest pursuer and we rose so rapidly that in two seconds we were skirting the great tower then others saw us and forty air ships joined in the chase jacks spirits rose with the excitement sorry to run away from these venuses he said but no dungeons for me if you please were not away yet edmund responded over his shoulder indeed we were not amazing stories the airships swarmed out on every side like hornets from their nests the air seemed full of them i gave up all hope of escape but edmund was like a racer who hears the thunder of rival hoofs behind him he put on more and more speed until we had to hang to anything handy to prevent being blown off by the wind we made or whirled overboard on sharp turns crash we had run straight into a huge airplane that persisted in getting in our way she dipped and rolled like a floating log i saw the men on her deck tumble over one another as we shot by but fortunately none fell off i say fortunately be cause surely it would not have bettered our case to kill any more of them just now busy as he was dodging and turning edmund did not cease occasionally speaking to us theres just one chance to beat them he said and only one and im going to try it as quick as i can get out of this press i had no notion of what he meant but a few minutes later i divined his intention all the while i observed he was working higher and higher the spectacle of that magnificent city spreading every moment wider as we rose and changing shapes and colors like a view in a kaleidoscope would have held me enchained with admirationif i had had time to fix my attention upon it still we shot upward making the necessary circles as small as possible and so recklessly had edmund turned on the speed that at last it really began to look as if we should escape twothirds of our pursuers were far below our level but the others comprehended our plan and rose with us some endeavoring to get ahead and cross our bows while i saw that edmunds idea was to hold a skyward course i was far from guessing the partic ular reason he had for doing so finally jack spoke up see here edmund he said if you keep on going up instead of running off one way or another theyll corner you in the middle of the sky dont you see how they have circled out on all sides so as to surround us then when we get as high as we can go they will simply close in all round and well be in a trap oh no we wont said edmund i dont see why because they cant go as high as we can id like to know why they cant i guess they understand these things as well as you do can a fish live out of water asked edmund laughing what are you driving at why its plain enough these people are used to an atmosphere two or three times as dense as that which we have on the earth it doesnt trouble our breathing much having plenty of oxygen but we can go where they would gasp for breath be cause we can stand the rare air at a great height my only doubt is about the flying ability of the airplane but luckily this is a light car and be ing under way i think shell run as high as we need to go and stay there youll see them drop ping off pretty soon a strange flight and they did drop off with great rapidity their own strategy which jack had called attention to was simply a playing into our hands they really thought to catch us in the middle of a grad ually contracting circle when to their evident amazement we rose into a region of the atmos phere where they knew that they could not live edmund fairly roared with laughter when he saw the success of his ruse but there was one thing that he had forgotten and it struck to our hearts when we became aware of it poor juba he could endure this rare air no better than our pursuers already unnoticed in the excitement he had fallen upon the deck where he lay gasping like a newly landed sturgeon at last he ceased to struggle good heavens cried jack the poor fellow is dying we must save him said edmund but how you wouldnt go back down there if we drop down near the limit that stops the others said edmund hell revive and then we can dodge up and down enough to keep out of danger both ways no sooner said than done and we began to de scend i reflected that here was the only mistake that edmund had made during the whole trip i mean the mistake of bringing along the natives from the caverns it was their presence that had prevented us from sailing triumphantly over the crystal mountains at an elevation where there would have been no danger it was because of them that we had wrecked the car and now it was the presence of juba that prevented us from keeping in a safe place this wrought upon my mind so that finally i spoke about it to edmund instantly henry chimed in better let him die than lose our own lives stop said edmund sternly a thousand times i have cursed myself for my error i thought that those fellows would be of use instead they were an encumbrance but it was not their fault that they came it is i that am responsible for their fate and i shall never forgive myself neither shall i ever abandon the last one that is left id give up my own life rather that ended the discussion we continued to drop until with much chafing of his hairy hands and body and the aid of a little stimulant poured into his mouth from a pocket flask we brought poor juba round in the meantime the crowd of airships watching us from below began to close in their circle evi dently under the belief that we had been com pelled to descend on account of the rarity of the at mosphere and that at last they would have us sure it was impossible not to admire their preparations for catching the expected fish aerial tactics on the large scale there was such a multitude of the craft that they were able to form themselves into the semblance of a huge bagnet the edge carried as high as they could go while the sides and bottom were composed of airships packed as close almost as meshes this great net was a mile across a columbus of space edmund laughed again as he looked down into it no no messieurs he shouted were no gudgeons youll have to do better than that see here edmund cried jack suddenly why dont you make off and leave them by keeping just out of their reach as you have said we can easily escape and leave our own car was the reply jove said jack i never thought of that but see here in that case what did you run away for at all because said edmund quietly i thought it better to parley than to lie in prison parley how are you going to parley that remains to be seen but i guess well man age it we were now as i estimated about ten miles high when we were highest the great cloud dome that i have described was but a little above our heads and we might have gone up into it and been lost from sight our pursuers circled about to keep their posi tions a quarter of a mile or so below us they were evidently parleying on their side for waves of color flowed all about them and the spectacle was so brilliant that we almost forgot our situation while watching it i suppose youll play them a prismatic sym phony said henry mockingly perhaps who knows replied edmund coolly ive no doubt that the materials are aboardship a minute later he added if id been here a month id do it sure but i havent had time to study that subject yet we must manage otherwise while we had been talking edmund had not re laxed his vigilance and two or three times he baffled a sudden dart of the enemy by circling de risively high above their heads each time return ing to a lower level as soon as juba began to gasp at last we noticed a movement among the crowd below which betokened something important in a moment we saw what it was a gorgeous airplane by far the handsomest that we had seen had ar rived in the midst of the flotilla the others made way for it and it came on directly towards us as high as it could get immediately edmund dropped down as if to meet it i thought shed come i heard him mutter my heart jumped at the words and in an instant my theory had possession of me again i was sure that he had referred to ala and once more the conviction grew very strong within me that there was at least the beginning of an understanding be tween her and edmund i felt glad and even in our apparently desperate situation that feeling was not merely on account of the promise of escape it partook of the senti ment which every human being experiences when he sees two young peoples hearts opening to each other love will pull us through if nothing else can i said to myself but i gave no hint to jack or henry who would probably have laughed at me ala on her flying barge it was a very cleopatras barge that approached us and edmund didnt stop until we could see the eyes of the others then both airships as by common consent came to rest simply soaring in parallel circles to maintain their buoyancy ala stood forward on the deck with her female attendants about her exactly how they managed it i do not know but i have already told you of the strange power of mindreading or telepathy or whatever it was that these people possessed and that edmund had made some little progress in this mysterious meth od of thought transference he and ala looked at each other and i could see signs of pleasure in her face for half an hour or more we hung there slowly circling but without change of distance and all the time those two continued their silent converse occasionally emphasized by gestures which even we could understand finally it was plain that a con clusion had been reached there was a flashing of colors between alas airplane and the others and all began to descend we along with them after a while edmund turned to us and said well boys its coming out all right and isnt she a queen worthy of venus is she really a queen asked jack youll see edmund replied in his old manner smiling a little but let me tell you the rest then he went on to tell us that the trouble had all come as we had suspected out of his having killed a person of very great importance but we had never guessed how extremely important that person was from our own point of view he was a prince of venus my luck is almost as bad as that of cedipus said edmund but prince or not he acted like a blanked idiot and as you know i had to kill him of course you understand that there is a cer tain amount of guesswork in all this i have had to reason from analogy putting this and that to gether my conversation with ala was not exactly as free as a teteatite at home but the fact that she could read my thoughts with comparative ease helped us along because it was more important that she should understand our side of the story than that i should be able to understand hers i may be mistaken in the prince idea but i think not anyway the fellow was of that degree of importance that ala did not dare to interfere with their bringing us to book about it as i told you before i had confidence that once i could make clear my motives we should come out all right but when the chance of escape from the dungeon presented itself this idea of getting beyond their reach in the high air and holding a parley flashed into my mind and i determined to try it it ought to have been plain to them why you shot that chap said jack it was plain to ala edmund replied and i know that she intended to use the fact for our ex culpation but i was afraid of the others remem ber that we are nothing to them except objects of curiosity if it had been a common fellow that i had killed it might have been different and they amazing stories would have done a little reasoning among them selves but what are they going to do with us now i asked theyre going to bring us to a trial of some kind but dont forget that weve got a very powerful advocate chapter xi before the throne of venus one of the things which at first surprised me after our surrender was the fact that they did not throw a crew aboard our craft instead of allowing us to navigate it un guarded but this after edmund had told his story only tended to strengthen my faith in ala while we were dropping down toward the city with a great throng of airships attending us ed mund opened his heart concerning another curious point in the difficulties besetting us i suppose you noticed how close we were to the cloud dome he said well theres nothing sur prising in the existence of a shell of clouds sur rounding this part of venus astronomers on earth looking at her long ago suspected it and it strikes me as a providential thing for these people without it they could not endure the unending sun shine but its going to render it difficult for us to make them understand where we come from how so asked jack because they have never seen a star and they can have no idea of the existence of other planets the cloud dome floats above the level to which they can rise with safety so i am sure that they have never penetrated it even if they did get above it they would not see much on account of the sun shine there would still be enough air there to diffuse the rays and make objects in the heavens invisible but what difference does it make whether they know that we come from the earth or think that we are from the other side of their own planet it makes this difference edmund replied that if they could be made to understand that we are entirely foreign to their world they might treat us with greater consideration everything helps and i have no doubt that the inspiration is as active here as it is at home anyway i mean to do my best to make them understand where we come from when we returned to the great palace a change of treatment awaited us preparing to met the ruler instead of being conducted to a dungeon we were led into a splendid apartment and a re past was spread before us we had need of it for we had had nothing to eat since our escape the room in which we found ourselves had no windows but it was brilliantly lighted from the walls by something resembling the mercury vapor lamps we have at home edmund thought that they were based upon a isimilar principle we were placed at a table juba with us and food was set before us i observed that as among the inhabitants of the caverns the food consisted mainly of vegetables except that there were birds of a sort unknown to us but of an exquisite taste more interesting than the food however were those who served it they were beautiful girls attired after the manner of all the inhabitants here and extremely graceful in their movements jack was captivated at once jove he cried this is something like ed mund im obliged to you once more i wish i could speak the language you can said edmund but you dont know it they understand you better than you think and you would do well to keep a guard upon your self jack however was irrepressible he ogled the pretty waitresses and presently with an engag ing smileor what he intended as suchhe ven tured to touch one of them on the arm you should have seen the effect the girl drew herself up and escaped from his touch as if it had been that of a serpent then she looked at him how she did look it was a glance that shot straight through him but her resentment did not last a minute later she smiled and her beauty seemed more dazzling than before jack was quite overcome he made an awkward attempt to express an apology which was instantly comprehended and the behavior of the girl and of her companions indicated that while they would suffer no familiarity they were easily mollified and wished us no ill they gave very little attention to juba who nevertheless blinked at them from under his eye shades and was evidently more amazed by their beauty than we were you see said edmund that you are not among savages here new york restaurant man ners wont pass on venus suddenly jack whose thoughts were always jumping about turned from his admiration of the girls and exclaimed see here edmund why in the world didnt they shoot at us when we were running away there were enough of them to bring us down even if they had been bad marksmen they didnt shoot was the reply because theyve nothing to shoot with ive already told you that i think they are an unwarlike people but theyre not cowards youve seen evidence enough of that they were not terrified by my killing that fellow and i reckon that theyll fight if there should be occasion for fighting only i think that they are not natural slaughterers like us and i shouldnt be surprised if war is unknown on venus all the same im glad weve got our automatic pistols yet said jack yes edmund responded and we may have occasion for them and for the rifles too if we can get them back but it may be that theyll prove useful in a way very different from what you im agine we did not press edmund for an explanation of this remark but i was sure he had some particular reason for what he had said and i turned it over in my mind without arriving at any conclusion when out repast was finished a number of cops as jack gaily dubbed them came to conduct us from the refectory a columbus of space now for the supreme court or the kings bench said jack it was even as he had surmised we were led through a maze of passages and elegant chambers until we emerged into a vast and splendid apart ment it was nearly squareat least a hundred feet the longest wayand like the place where we had dined lighted from the walls and ceiling the floor seemed to be of rosecolored marble and the walls and ceiling were composed of equally rich ma terials most beautifully decorated but what ab solutely fascinated the eye in this great apartment was the play of living colors projected from a huge circle high on the wall at the farther end chromatic music ihromatic music again said edmund just as at a great reception on the earth an orchestra pours forth soft melodies to entrance the senses of the guests while not inhibiting their conversation so here this harmonic play of delight ful colors filled the air to the evident delectation of the brilliant throng that was assembled even ive felt the effect stealing deliciously through our nerves as a way was cleared for us everybody standing aside to make room when we advanced we caught sightat the head of the vista thus formed through the center of the apartmentof a mag nificent throne and seated upon it was ala then she must indeed be the queen but im mediately i noticed with some disappointment that she was not alone by her side and occupying another throne hardly less brilliant than hers was a tall man with fea tures like those of a greek statue of zeus and long curling hair as white as snow the severity of his aspect formed a discouraging contrast with the smiling beauty of the queen now you will understand of course that every thing that followed in the way of communication between these people and us was conducted by those peculiar methods of interchanging thoughts and ideas which i have before described there was no talking except in very low tones among the chief actors on the other side it was a repetition of what had occurred during the parley between the airplanes yet so expressive were the countenances before us and so transparent the meaning of the gestures that even jack henry and i could catch consider able of the drift while edmund seemed to under stand it astonishingly well what was visible re corded itself in my memory but the details of what occurred in the way of communication were re lated to me afterward by edmund for the sake of clearness i am going to treat it practically as if it had been a regular conversation while i may thus be compelled to use words which were not ac tually spoken yet the meaning was there as soon as our examination begun the colors ceased to play from the circle above the throne orchestra stopped whispered the irrepress ible jack in my ear the first person to speak if i may so put it was ala she fixed her eyes upon edmund in the pe uliar manner which we had already learned to rec as preliminary to a wordless conversation and her face became more expressive than that of the most perfect actress i have ever seen one could read upon it the question who are you and whence came you i was thrilled with pride as i glanced at edmund he stood alone close before the throne in an open space while we were placed a little at one side he carried himself erect without a sign of trepida tion with an air of complete confidence and self control and almost i thought of superiority the painting of columbus before isabella flashed up on my recollection though the circumstances were so different as the question beamed to him he lifted his hand and pointed significantly overhead evi dently he was going at once to proclaim our origin from another world i remembered what he had lately said about the difficulty of making these people comprehend such a thing and i thought i could detect the perplexity in alas mind edmunds gesture spoke plainly enough but in reading his thought she met an insuperable ob stacle she could not comprehend the idea of an other world in the sky juba comes to their assistance it was then that juba unexpectedly came to our aid he had been watching the proceedings with intense interest and i was delighted by the com prehension which he showed although possessing a much lower order of intelligence than the brilliant beings who surrounded us and nothing of their culture yet he was an inhabitant of their planet and who can tell what ancient ancestral lines may have connected them his people too shared in the singular power of communicating ideas without words which was characteristic of intellectual life on venus to him on the other hand there was little mystery m what edmund was trying to make known he was familiar with the starry sky and a worshipper of the earth with a boldness that surprised me he stepped to edmunds side and lifting the shades from his eyes joinedif i may so sayin the conversation ala and her whitehaired companion stared at him a little startled at first by his interference but it was clear in a minute that they understood him he made them at least partially comprehend that above the dome of clouds there was another world known to him and that we came from thence no doubt that thought had been in his mind be fore he also it was plain made them realize the fact that he himself belonged to their own planet to the dark mysterious side of itwhich they had vainly sought to penetrate wonder overspread their faces as the truth dawned upon them i could feel all eyes now turned upon us with re doubled interest and curiosity i believed that i could detect a deepening of color in alas cheeks as she again confronted edmunds glance thus the ice was broken and the fundamental idea being communicated it rested upon edmund alone to conduct the affair again i saw that the examination was taking another direction whether they were satisfied or not about our claims to he inhabitants of another world they were evidently not disposed to let us off on that ac m amazing stories count and i thought that the whitehaired zeus seemed especially insistent on this point and i de tested him for it i tried to imagine what he was but i couldnt satisfy myself king or judge or priest or what jack saw the new drift also and whispered to me the old scoundrel id like to try my pistol on him for the first time the old man who i must confess possessed a dignity of bearing that was extremely imposing looked edmund squarely in the eye and used some significant gestures edmund did not quail but the rest of us certainly did when a way was suddenly opened in the throng and the body of the fellow that had been shot lying on a rich bier was borne into the centre of the open space and set down at edmunds feet a beautiful heroine he glanced at it perfectly unmoved and then with a smile turned to look at ala her man ner assured me that she understood the justifica tion that he claimed for himself and that at least she approved it but old zeus was not to be placated that was plain by his look ala spoke to him earnestly call ing into action all the means of communicating thoughts ideas and arguments that they possessed in such abundance but he was immovable at length she turned to edmund and some communi cation took place between them which puzzled him for little while but suddenly a light broke over his countenance and turning aside his head he sent my hopes plump down to zero with ten solemn words the old judge is the father of the dead man then theres no hope for us i muttered wait and see was the reply everything depended upon ala assuming that she was interested in edmund and wished to save him had she the power to do it was she really queen as we had supposed and if so was her authority unlimited these questions raced through my mind while a conference took place round the throne several dignifiedlooking individuals with gems glittering on their togalike garments were called into con sultation there was plainly a division among them i could see that some sided with ala and others with the old man the features of the latter became more and more stern but as he continued to insist upon his re vengeful purpose a strange light began to glow in alas eyes her color deepened lines of strength appeared in her beautiful face one could feel the resistance that she offered rising to a passion and at last at a particularly savage communication from her relentless opponent she suddenly rose to her feet transformed the majestic splendor of her countenance was thrilling lifting her jeweled arms she command ed the attendants to remove the bier and was in stantly obeyed then she beckoned to edmund and as he approached the foot of the throne she de scended three steps rested her hand upon his shoulder and looked about her with an air which said plainer than words it is the power of my protection that environ him touch him you who dare chapter xii the value of a good fist the sensation produced by alas dramatic in terruption was indescribable everybody pressed nearer murmurs rose on all sides whether of approval or dissent i had no time to guess the whitehaired judge his face aflame with passion sprang to his feet with uplifted hand as if about to attack edmund instinctively i felt for my pistol but edmund as if he had divined my thought glanced sharply at me and shook his head we did not appreciate then what ala had done but we soon learned what it was her act and her gesture had conveyed to the minds of the others a meaning unguessed by us according to the immorial customs of her race in thus embracing edmund with her arm she had not merely taken him under her protectionshe had proclaimed to all the world that he ivas her chosen mate if we had known this at the beginning we should have been able to understand the tremend ous excitement in the assemblage and yet it ought to have been evident too from her expression if ever defiant selfsacrificing love wrote itself upon a womans face it was visible in hers she had need of all her resolution for the anger of the old man on the throne was nothing in comparison with the fury of a new actor who now thrust himself to the front it was the apollo like young man who had led her from the air ship on our first arrival at the aerial tower a rival suitor ingra ard an encounter no explanation were needed to enable us to un derstand the relation in which he stood to the parties he was evidently alas suitor and jeal ousy had turned him into a maniac he shouldered aside those who stood in his path and in an in stant confronted edmund he was more than six feet tali broadshouldered and had the powerful build of an athlete my heart leaped into my throat and again i gripped my pistci but edmunds recent warning restrained me then once more a glow of admir ation for cur leader ran through me he faced his formidable enemy without the slightest fear or flinching only i saw that his fists were clinched and the recollection flashed upon me that he had been the favorite pupil of the best boxing master in new york in a fraction of a second the two glared at each other while ala with a low cry sought to draw edmund away but the other sprang forward like a maddened bull whack edmunds right fist caught his opponent on the point of the jaw and the fellow shot back into the crowd and tumbled in a heap lightning is not quicker than was edmunds next move out with your pistols and follow me he shouted to us and seizing ala he pushed his way through the throng which gave back at his im a columbus of space petuous onset we were after him in an instant pistols in hand the sight of the latter had its effect they knew the power of the mysterious weapon and their momentary fear gave us an initial advantage still that would have availed us nothing in the end but for the fact which edmund had counted upon that there was a large portion of the as semblage who were our friendsor rather friends of alaand disposed to take her part edmund had noted where her advocates were most numerous in the throng and toward them he pushed in a few seconds they had closed round us the uproar became deafening i doubt if ever so much noise was made on venus before it seemed to drive the crowd wild but ala proved her queenly quality with a proud air she drew herself erect her eyes flashed and with a few commanding gestures she reduced those immediately about us to silence then at her order an escort was formed we were placed in the midst of it and slowly we marched through the press toward the entrance to the chamber in the queens audience chamber no resistance was offered the faces about us rather expressed astonishment than any in tention at interference glancing behind i saw the white head of the old man on the throne violently agitated but if he gave any orders concerning us they were not executed and without opposition we passed out of the door turning to the right we quickly entered an apartmentsmaller than the othersbut no less splendid here there was another throne ala ad vanced to it mounted the steps retaining edmunds hand and taking her seat calmly faced the specta tors while we stood close by at the foot of the throne i think it will be best in view of the dramatic events which were to follow to tell you in as few words as possible the result of the episode that i have just described the room in which we now found ourselves was the private audience chamber of the queen the apartment in which the examination had taken place was a kind of combination of a royal audi ence chamber and a supreme courtroom it seems that under the laws of venus there was a sort of joint jurisdiction between the queen and the su preme judge in all judicial cases the two presided together at least the queen had the right to preside with the judge whenever she chose it certainly did not strike me as a very wise arrangement for in case of disagreement how were they to arrive at a de cision without a third person to cast a deciding vote that however was none of our affair and it was lucky for us that on this occasion the queen had not only chosen to exercise her prerogative but had bent the law to her authority i suspect that it usually happened that way whenever her feelings were interested for a woman will have her way whether she lives on the earth or on venus owing probably to the fact that the victim of edmunds pistol was the son of the venerable su preme judge all of alas arguments in extenuation of the offense had been wasted until seeing the im minent dangerher love though perhaps hardly appreciated by herselfsuddenly flamed forth and she determined to save edmund at any cost our case a just one the essential justice of our case was so evident to any unprejudiced mind that the sympathy of the majority of the audience had really been with the queen all the time and to that fact we owed our escape the insane jealousy of alas unfortunate suitor had greatly complicated the situation and was to be a source of trouble for us in the future but his adherents were not numerous enough to threaten serious danger after we had once found refuge in the queens apartment her authority asserted itself in full force and as far as we were concerned the episode seemed to be closed after the excitement about the trial and the scene that followed it had died down we were as signed to a suite of apartments in the palace juba always remaining with us we were continually on our guard and all kept a sharp lookout for ingra the disappointed suitor and his emissaries be cause we had not the least doubt that he would have spies on our track and would make away with us if he could but for a long time we saw nothing of him without our calendar clock we lost track of the time for here where it was always daylight there was nothing to count by yet sleep as we found was no less necessary on venus than on the earth these people spent about as much time in bed as we do retiring for the purpose into unlighted apart ments of course we saw ala frequently and as it be came gradually easier for us to comprehend one another we learned many interesting things she had succeeded to the throne on the death of her mother who had been queen before her here there were no kings the succession passing always to women her father was also dead and she had no brothers or sisters a question of inheritance if she should die without leaving a daughter the throne would pass to a collateral line the question of her marriage was therefore of the first importance ingra the pretender to her hand was of royal blood and he had the backing of a strong faction he was alas third cousin and though a young man of great beauty she had no liking for him ala herself was an extraordinary person uni versally admired not only for her beauty and her kindly nature but even more for her intellectual gifts she possessed a great deal of enlightened curiosity and the expedition toward the mysteri ous land of night had been both led and planned by her as edmund had surmised the inhabitants of their side of venus were not a warlike people they all belonged to one race and one kingdom only a part of the daylight hemisphere was inhabited a broad ringshaped area with temperate climate ioo amazing stories lying between the land of storms and and ice on the one hand and the torrid circle on the other the torrid circle occupied the central part of the hemisphere and there the unbroken sunshine created a climate that was absolutely inhibitory to life so much it is necessary to premise for an under standing of the events that followed as the time passed we began to become anxious to learn what had been done with our car and in a minor degree we were interested concerning the automatic rifles which had been taken away from us at the start we knew that all of these things had been brought to the capital but we were ig norant of their location we were afraid too that they might fall into the hands of those who were inimical to us and be either destroyed or perman ently concealed as the intimacy between edmund and ala in creased and their unconcealed attachment became more pronounced in its expression the rest of us felt a little anxiety concerning its ultimate bearing upon our fate we had no idea of staying all our lives on venus but if edmund should decide to stay what would become of us at last we de termined to question him and jack volunteered to be the spokesman see here edmund he began this is loves young dream with a vengeance but you are getting all the best of it you may become king of the planet for aught i see but these houris are not too amiable to us and we rather think its time to talk about the earth again longing for new york cct think ive had enough of venus myself id a rather like to see old new york once more now what are you going to do about it how about the car i have only just learned where it is stored edmund replied and i was about to speak to you of it ala and i have a project for the carrying out of which the car will be necessary well go and have a look at it but first of all ive got to find some uranium to put it into shape again well i hope youll find your uranium said jack but what project are you talking about are you going to take ala back to the earth no edmund replied or at least not now weve got more exploring to do on venus you dont suppose im going to quit yet henry who had never expressed much admira tion for what we had seen fairly groaned edmund he said if i had a thousand million dollars id give you every cent to take me back home he meant it for i never sel a face so full of misery edmund however only smiled saying cheer up henry youll get back all right in time comewhat sort of stuff are you made of cant you appreciate the glory of being the first ex plorers of another world evidently henry could not and just at that mo ment i doubt if jack and i could either there was nothing for us to do however except to await edmunds movements we couldnt have navigated the car homeward if we had had it a short time afterward accompanied by ala twtf of her ladies in waiting and half a dozen stout fellows belonging to our guard we went to visit the car it was away up in the aerial tower where we had first landed but i was disappointed to see nothing of the rifles i hope they havent fallen into ingras hands i said to edmund if they have he replied theyll probably prove more dangerous to him than to anybody else even if he learned how to use them the extra am munition is all in the car nevertheless i knew that the rifles carried teii shots each in their chambers and i didnt like their disappearance more particularly after learn ing that ala was ignorant of their whereabouts plans for fixing the car after thoroughly examining the car edmund repeated that he needed only uranium to put the apparatus in firstrate condition he explained that the jar against the ice precipice or the violent fall had produced an atomic readjustment which could only be remedied with the aid of fresh ma terial of course i knew no more than the man in the moon what he meant but i was satisfied with the assurance that the thing could be fixed here a new difficulty rose at once ala evidently knew nothing about uranium and had no idea what it was that edmund wanted he succeeded only in making her comprehend that he must search for something in the ground uranium he said to us is sometimes found around silver or lead mines the first thing is to discover where they do their mining if we can find uranium all right if we cant we may as goodby to the earth for well have tq leave our tones on venns chapter viii at the tcv of a fearful enemy edmund had great difficulty in making ala comprehend that we wished to visit the places here they got their metals accordnr t long afterward we started in an airshipescrted ey four or five consortsfor an exploration of the mines ala as usual had her two favorite mais with her we went a bng distance from the capital up near the mountains they value gold on venus as much as we co n the earth and naturally they were eager first to shew u their goldmines the sight was amazing talk of california and australia of peru and south africa all of them put together never saw so much gold as we beheld in one of those mines i perceived that henrys mouth fairly watered at the sight edmund was intent only on his search and it wa delightful to see the tender interest in alas eyes as she followed him but he could find no tracs of what he wanted plague take it he exclaimed if i had only carried on my experiments a little longer before setting out i might have been able to get the power i want from any of the metals but now nothing but uranium will do a columbus of space we went from mine to mine with the same re sult finally we reached the silver mines and ed munds hopes brightened at last he uttered a great shout of joy heres pitchblende he said all i want now is an electric furnace i felt a load fall from my shoulders because we had already learned that chemistry was no un known science here there must be laboratories at the capital if not in the neighborhood of the mines themselves this latter conjecture proved to be correct and the fact saved us a great deal of trouble otherwise we should have been forced to transport tons of the pitchblende to the capital in order to extract uranium from it but there was another result which we did not anticipateit gave our enemies an opportunity to plot our destruction close by the mines there was a laboratory pro vided with an excellent electric furnace when ed mund saw it he expressed his surprise that chem ists so able and enterprising had not yet discovered the property of radioactivity possessed by uran ium and its compounds but they knew nothing about it and we did and that gave us a great ad vantage a region of wonderful beauty edmund set to work at once alas authority placing everything that he desired in his hands he shut everybody out of the laboratory except juba whom he found useful in various ways as for us he said laughing that we knew just enough to be stupid and useless i think we must have been more than a week there when a terrible thing occurred we were accustomed to take our recreation by long walks amid the delightful scenery in the neighborhood of the mines although we were among the foothills the elevation was not very great and the temperature was most agreeable nature was at her best the slopes and valley bottoms were clothed with vegetation of tropical luxuriance and beauty never have i seen such trees i did not recognize a single variety known to me at home and yet they were in no sense grotesque many of them were more graceful in form and foliage than any species of palm others were as massive as oaks and some as tall and stately as sequoias festoons of flower ing vines hung everywhereand the flowers one could never have believed it possible for such hues such shapes and such perfumes to exist to gether outside of a hothouse to walk through these scenes was like a stroll through paradise in one of our walks edmund being with us and ala and her maids also we ascended an eminence overlooking the charming valley of a little stream two or three miles from the mines there we sat down at the foot of a lofty tree to enjoy the view the air was deliciously soothing and in a little while edmund tired by his long exertionsfor he had been at work without rest for fortyeight hours fell asleep with his head on a flowery bank and aa sitting beside him a shadow deeper than that of the fol iage fell around us and a large airplane swifty descended in front of the bank in an instant twenty men had leaped from it and seized edmund jack henry and myself edmund was dazed with sleep and the rest of us were paralyzed with surprise so thatbefore any effectual resistance could be offeredwe found ourselves on the airplane and rapidly ascending through the air ala had sprung to her feet and was gesticulating wildly her maids were overcome with terror and juba who had not been touched by the abductors remained seated on the ground apparently dumfounded and without an idea in his shaggy head none of them could have done anything we rose so rapidly flying toward the mountains that in ten minutes even the tree under which we had sat was last to sight prisoners again glanced about among our captors expecting ttij see ingra he was not visible but a few min utes later he appeared with a derisive smile on his face evidently he had kept out of sight in order not to confront ala oh the detestation with which i beheld him if it had been in my power i would have ground him to powder my look i know expressed my fury but he stared at me with that maddening grin of successful cunning which turns an intelli gent and handsome face when it screens a wicked heart into the cruelest devils image he gloated over edmund also but edmund never even looked at him it was the second time that we had been taken like foolish mice in a trap and i raged at the thought edmund was perfectly cool as for jack his face showed that he felt as i did but he said noth ing and henry who at best seldom spoke was as silent and as pale as a ghost we were allowed to stand though our arms were bound behind us and even to walk about the deck the thought flashed upon me that ingra would be delighted if we should jump overboard for that would save him the trouble of putting an end to us several times he strode by and tried to catch ed munds eye but edmund ignored him as completely as if he had not existed as the great airplane swept on at terrific speed my thoughts turned back to ala what would she do what could she do she could not followat least not until after a fatal delayfor she would have to return afoot to the mines three miles away before she could find aid by that time we would be far out of sight among the mountains leaving no track in the air i fairly groaned at the thought of the absolute hopelessness of our situation but in thinking that ala could do nothing for us i underrated her abilities and the inspiring power of love fortunately after we had lost sight of the tree the airplane slowed up and came almost to rest we circled about for a while and ingra consulted with his coconspirators their gestures indicated that they were debat ing as to their course they pointed this way and that and finally drove the airplane to a great height to reconnoiter ahead the delay was providential amazing stories a pursuer while we were circling and while our captors were choosing their course my eye happened to catchaway off in the sky behind usa black speck barely visible in an instant i was all ex citement i pointed out the object to edmund for heavens sake he whispered glancing cautiously round dont let these brutes know what we see dont seem to notice it she is following us i said nothing to jack and henry who had not seen the object but i could not withdraw my eyes from it although i covered and concealed my glances and tried to seem occupied in looking an other way finally ingra apparently made up his mind and off we went again but by this time the speck had enlarged to a distinct black dot in the sky mani festly it was overtaking us and in a little while it had become so plain that the others caught sight of it ingra showed both surprise and anger at the sight his action was prompt he issued orders which in half a minute sent us spinning at incred ible speed at the same time he dropped lower in order that the airplane might be lost against the background of the mountains but that black dot followed and i thanked heaven as i saw that it did not grow smaller it even seemed to enlarge presently edmund who had now begun to watch it with his pocket binocular handed the glass to me saying simply look i looked and then handed the glass to jack and henry that they might share the pleasure which that sight gave we could make out clearly the out lines of an airplane we believed that we recog nized it as the one in which ala had brought us to the mines how its drivingscrews did spin heaven grant that no accident should befall its machinery it was a chance for life and love on one side and for revenge on the other and the speed was pushed up to the utmost limit surmises suddenly a shocking thought crossed my mind i tried to banish it for i feared that ingra might read it and act upon it suppose that he should hurl us overboard it was within his power to do so it would have been a quick and simple solution of the matter and that the idea apparently did not occur to him i could only ascribe to a protecting hand that guarded us even in this extremity on we rushed through the humming air and still we did not drop the pursuer minute by min ute the chasing airplane became more distinct against the bright background of the great cloud dome suddenly edmund touched me and called my attention to something ahead there he said theres their hope and our despair i looked and saw that in front of us the sky was dark great clouds were rolling up high above the mountains and the latter were shadowed by them we seemed to be approaching a region of twilight once within it we should be lost to sight it is the edge of the temperate zone said ed mund between that zone and the central circle of eternal unclouded sunshine lies a region of con tending aircurrents rains and storms not unlike that which we crossed this side of the crystal mountains having entered it we shall be as if be hind a curtain and they can work their will with us was it the knowledge of this fact that had re trained ingra from throwing us overboard was he meditating for us a more dreadful fate it was indeed a land of shadows that we now entered ahead we were passing the crest of the mountainrange which was nowhere of any great height and even in the gloom we could perceive that ahead of us the inclination of the ground was downward i i glanced eagerly downward to see if alas air plane was yet in pursuit yes there it was a dis tinct dot on the bright dome behind the upper part of which was now beginning to be obscured from our view by the roof of inky clouds that spread darkness round us we could see them very plainly but could they see us i tried to hope that they could but reason taught me that it must be impossible still they evidently were holding on their course and there was a gleam of hope in that ingras plotting but even this hope faded when ingra with dev ilish cunning as soon as we had entered deep into the gloom abruptly changed our course he knew well that we were now invisible to our pur suers but to prevent the bare possibility that they might be able to follow us if we maintained a straight course through the air he doubled like a hunted fox we watched for the effect upon the other air plane the change of our perspective revealed the fact that they were continuing straight on as be fore they had not seen us then and even if as must surely be the case they anticipated such a ruse as ingra had practised how could they baffle him and find our track again at last the spreading darkness swallowed from sight the arch of illumin ated sky behind and then we were alone in the gloom understand me this was not the deep night of the other side of the planet it was more truly what i have already called it twilighta dark twilight and as our eyes became accustomed to it we could see a little we had dropped down within a few hundred yards of the ground which had now become a level expanse and soon we began to notice that it was covered with small bodies of water interspersed with masses of trees and bushes it was in short a gigantic dismal swamp or everglade i shuddered as the evident design of ingra burst upon my consciousness he meant either to throw us in the morass or to leave us to starve in the midst of these fens his real design as you will see in a moment was even more diabolical the airplane gradually approached the ground just skimming the tops of strange trees the most a columbus of space horrible vegetable forms that i have ever seen at length we settled down upon a comparatively dry space perhaps a quarter of an acre in extent and there without warning we were seized and pushed off the airplane which instantly rose circling above us burning the bonds ingras staring face appeared for a moment and even in the gloom we could see the devilish glee that overspread it if our arms had not been bound trimph would have been ended then and there i saw edmund straining desperately at his bonds to reach his pistol but in ten seconds the airplane had risen beyond pistolshot quick said edmund hold your hand here i turned my back to him and stretched out my fingers not knowing yet what he wished take a match from this box which i have twisted out of my sidepocket he said and while i hold the box scratch it and for heavens sake hold the flames quick against the bonds around my wrists i managed to get hold of the match and finding with my fingers the box scratched as best i could but the match broke edmund with the skill of a prestidigitator got another match out of the box and pushed it into my fingers it failed again its got to be done edmund cried here jack you try again he succeeded in extracting a match and jack backed up in my place whether his hands happened to be less tightly bound or whether he had more skill and nerve on the second attempt it succeeded dont lose it cried edmund as the light flashed burn the cord jack tried the smell of burning flesh arose but edmund never winced in a few seconds the match went out another said edmund and the same operation was repeated a dozen separate attempts of this kind had been made when with a violent effort edmund snapped the charred cord and was free his hands and wrists were severely burned but paying no attention to them in a minute he had us all cut loose it was a mercy that they had not noticed the flame from the airplane for if they had undoubtedly they would have returned and made an end of us before we could have released our hands now gripping our pistols we felt less anxiety we could no longer see the airplane which had been swallowed up in the darkness but suddenly a loud splash in the water close by startled us a moment later this was followed by a second and a third splash we had dimly caught sight of some long slender objects apparently falling from the sky instantly edmund whose eyes were marvel sly quick sung out a monster on venus tts the rifles therifles yes ingra had teeffi and he has thrown them rboard and at the words edmund dashed into i r shallow water where the splashing had occur red in a minute he returned with one of our cruising rifles in his hand hunt for the others he exclaimed and we ran with him into the water and actually found the other two sticking in the mud for the water was not more than a foot deep heaven be praised said edmund this is a piece of luck i should think so said jack dryly its posi tively humorous in heavens name i exclaimed why did he throw them overboard not for us surely of course not said edmund its plain enough he had taken them but couldnt find out how to use them he did not want to carry this evidence of his guilt back with him and so it oc curred to him to get rid of them along with us no doubt when he cast them out the airplane was away and high up he never dreamed that they would fall within our reach but you observe the heavy wind that is blowing overhead the weapons are light and the wind carried them our way if the airplane had not been so high up they never would have reached us dumfounded the rest of us said nothing except jack who grumbled hanged if i dont think this kind of luck is uncanny i cannot be thankful enough for the return of the rifles said edmund presently we shall have use for them without them i doubt if it would ever have been possible for us to pull out of this trap it seems to me said jack that three pairs of sevenleague boots would be more to the purpose just now than three rifles what are you going to shoot edmund started to reply but was interrupted by another noisenot a splash this time but a heavy sonorous sighing sound in the gloom surrounded by the repulsive halfspectral forms of the mon strous vegetation of the swamp that mysterious sound which plainly denoted some giant kind of life fairly made us quake my heavens said jack what can that be well see replied edmund calmly and threw open his pocketlantern as the light streamed out there was a sudden rustle close by and an answer ing gleam which passed a shaft of light illumina tion over us with a united shout of joy we all cried out ala it was indeed she with her airplane within a dozen yards of us but her approach had been con cealed by the distorted limbs of the hideous vege tation that towered on three sides of us our shout of astonishment had not ceased to echo when out of the horrible tangle rose with a swift sinuous movement a long anacondalike arm flesh pink in the electric beam but covered with dark spikeedged spiracles it curled itself over the edge of the airplane and swiftly drew it downward amazing stories chapter xiv a strange victory the airplane tipped as it descended and with confused cries most of its crew tumbled off some falling into the water others disap pearing in the tangled vegetation the light went out but edmunds lamp continued to burn we could see ala as the machine sank lower and crashed through the branches clinging desperately to an upright on the inclined deck the awful arm was clasped about the steelwork within a foot of her with a terrible cry edmund dashed into the mat ted growths madly fighting his way through jack and i followed but henry sank upon the wet ground helpless through sheer terror thats the fate they intended for us edmund shouted but by heaven it shall not come to her if we had had far to go we should never have been able to get through that awful mass even in the excitement of the moment i shrank from the hateful touch of those twisted branches clammy as the skin of serpents but edmund regarded nothing except his pur pose he battled maniacally with the obstacles in his path leaving an opening for us at his heels through it all we hung on to our rifles feeling that this alone could save us i suppose it was not more than two minutes be fore we emerged into a comparatively open place and then the sight that met us in the midst of the opening but half visible in the gloom on huge squat legs stood such a mon ster as you have perhaps read of in books on pale ontology but the equal of this one no geologist ever imagined i dont know how large its body was but its gi gantic threecornered head looked as big as a beer vat and from the front of the head issued some thing resembling the trunk of an elephant but as large as a dozen the eye on that side of the head which was turned toward us glowed like an ember in the light of edmunds lamp the creature was crushing the airplane bending its sides like pasteboard with that mighty trunk for my part i was paralyzed by the awful spectacle but edmunds sharp command brought me to my senses hold the lamp mechanically i took it in my hand then i saw edmund aiming his rifle bang bang bang ten times the shots rang out zipping one on the heels of another and i knew that the chamber was exhausted give me your rifleto jack but it was unneeded at the very first shot i saw the monsters red eye go dull and i believe that every bullet entered his brain he was so huge and unwieldy that he couldnt fall like an ordinary ani mal he released the wrecked airplane threw his vast trunk heaving in agony and thrashing the branches over his head sank upon his immense knees and slowly rolled down in the sedgy mud without a moments hesitation edmund rushed forward and a minute later i saw him carrying ala the monster is dead she had fainted but was uninjured a little stimulant brought her round and lying in his arms she looked at him dazed at first and then with such an expression as i should like just once to encounter in a womans eyes while we were thus engaged juba appeared his white furry body thick with mud and his huge eyes actually comical in their mingled look of amaze ment and terror presently half a dozen of the men who had been thrown from the airplane fought their way to us quick now boys said edmund weve got to fix up a shelter still carrying ala he led the way to the air plane its light steel frame was badly bent in places but it had settled right side up and a short inspection showed that it was not a hopeless wreck if the machinery is not seriously injured said edmund we shall be all right but we cant get out of this straight away and i must have a safe and dry place for ala while i examine the thing and collect the survivors just look at that beast exclaimed jack point ing to the huge carcass of the slain monster better see if there are other live ones round re turned edmund sharply use your eyes and ears as you never did in your life while i look at the machinery gently placing ala in a secure place on the now level deck edmund began to explore the mechanism of the airplane in a few minutes he turned on its powerful electric light which lit up the strange scenery around us like a full moon you may draw the creatures upon us i said yes edmund replied but its just as likely to scare them off in any event ive got to have plenty of light wheres henry back there paralyzed with fear i replied go and find him one of you once more in the air jack and i looked at one another jack made a wry face and probably i did the same it mani festly had to be done however and taking the pocketlamp we gingerly crept back through the terrible thicket and found henry still seated on the ground he remained speechless as we led him to the airplane and seated him upon it so per fect a picture of abject fright i had never seen yet i pitied him from the bottom of my heart for henry had his good qualities in the meantime edmund pursued his investiga tions aided finally by the engineer of the craft and two or three of his assistants who guided by the light had struggled out of the swamp in perhaps an hours time the airplane was pronounced in fit condition for flight no more monster beasts had made their appearance although three or four times we had heard them moving about at no great dis tance and with beating hearts had gripped the two rifles that remained loaded jacks good nature was restored and he couldnt refrain from expressing again his opinion that the way those rifles had come back to us beat all the fishyarns he had ever heard now youd never have dared to invent a story like that he said to me a columbus of space i confessed that i wouldnt and added that i wouldnt have dared invent anything that had occur red on this expedition youd better be thankful for what has happened edmund interrupted and not be railing at provi dence when it interferes in your behalf when everything was ready we listened for a while to learn if any survivors yet remained un found finally hearing nothing edmund called out all aboard i never learned how many if any had been lost at any rate we were a company of fifteen in cluding juba when at last we circled up into the air and left that awful place ala as the nervous shock wore off resumed her queenly air but with it there was mingled an ex pression of fond admiration for edmund that warmed my heart if ever a couple were born for one another i thought they were yet they had been born a long way apart the return the crew of the airplane seemed to know the way well enough once we were aloft and after but a momentary hesitation our course was set and we began to speed at a great elevation finally we caught sight of the arc of daylight far away and it gradually rose and spread until we emerged from under the cap of dark vapors and the region of twilight into the now familiar land of the great seashelltinted clouddome edmund remained for a long time communing with ala but at last he approached us henry meanwhile had recovered a little equan imity i suppose edmund began that you would like to know how they found us upon my word i said i never thought about that in the confusion that we have gone through but yes indeed we should like to know how under heaven they ever managed it thereupon edmund sat down and told us the story as he had learned it from ala and the others it seemed that juba had finally been our savior though of course it was ala who had inspired and managed the whole thing when they saw us snatched away from under the tree they instantly comprehended ingras plot and calling upon the others to follow ala ran like a deer for the mines juba alone was able to keep up with her the two handmaidens being left far behind in the race fortunately most of the way was down hill i guess they made those three miles in less than fifteen minutes said edmund smiling with a fond glance at ala arrived at the mines ala instantly ordered her airplane under way with the best crew she could find at a moments notice she knew what to do first she had long since lost sight of us but she had noted the direction of our flight and her first measure was to rise rapidly to a great elevation so as to command a wide prospect at the same time in order not to lose valuable ground making toward the mountains ingras delay in choosing his course and his oversight in going to a great height aided our pur suers and they soon caught a glimpse of us a mere speck in the air miles and miles away ala immediately ordered top speed she drove the machine at such a rate that as edmund made out the story her engineer protested but she would listen to nothing faster and faster their drivingfans spun until they seemed about to whirl themselves off their shafts they soon had the satisfaction to see that they were gaining for alas airplane was one of the swiftest slowly they drew up on us until the twilight borders were reached and then their hopes quickly faded as we entered under the dark clouds we were swallowed from sight alas heart gave way and finally in an agony of despair she sank upon the deeck she knew too well the horrible fate that ingra had prepared for his rival juba to the rescue then it was that juba unexpectedly came to the rescue possessing already the basis of the wordless language that was employed by them he had little difficulty in learning how to communicate with alas people and seeing her despair and com prehending the purpose of the chase he now respect fully approached her and made her understand that he could see in the dark he had lived all his life in a land of shadow and of night and his eyes while half blinded in the light were exactly suited for the conditions that now confronted them he proved the truth of his assertion or tried to by pointing out the escaping craft averring that it was perfectly visible to him ala was filled with joy at this happy turn of events immediately she recovered her selfcommand and gave orders to all her crew that jubas directions should be implicitly followed with the shades removed from his great eyes juba took his place on the prow of the airplane and guided its course without the slightest delay without abating their fearful speed they plunged into the gloom straight on our track when ingra made his sudden change of course juba saw the manoeuver and turned it against its inventor for now ingra himself could not see his pursuer and could not know that he was still fol lowed the nose of the bloodhound is not more cer tain in the chase than were jubas eyes in that terrible flight through the darkness they continued to gain upon us so rapidly that they were close at hand when ingra rose from the swamp after pitching us out following jubas in dications the pilot was about to dash at the escap ing airplane when ala divining what had been done checked him and ordered him to seek the spot where she was sure that we had been left by ingras orders to be devoured by the monsters of the morass but even jubas eyes could not locate us hidden as we were on the dark swampy ground and amid the twisted vegetation having commanded the pilot to descend near the ground ala was begin ning a careful search which even yet might have failed when the sudden flashing out of edmunds lamp told them where we were i need not tell you how breathlessly we listened amazing stories to this narration when it was finished we all looked at juba with a kindly interest such as we had never before felt toward him but jacks in terest in and gratitude toward him ran into en thusiasm he sprang to his feet danced upon the deck to the amazement of our friends and approaching juba slapped him upon the back with a joyous laugh exclaiming good old boy come down to new york and ill take care of you chapter xv wild eden he stopped at the mines and edmund as coolly as if nothing had happened resumed his work in the laboratory what had passed between him and ala in regard to ingra and his coconspirators i do not know but i remember that sometimes there was a grim look on edmunds face when he sat silently meditating which i interpreted as an ill omen for his enemies several times an airplane was despatched to the capital apparently on a secret mission in an in credibly short time sufficient uranium had been ac cumulated to answer edmunds needs and then with the precious stuff on board we set out on our return on reaching the capital we had a magnificent reception the news of what had occurred had been noised abroad and alas friends were out in force to wel come her if ingras partizans were on hand they took good care not to let themselves be known alas popularity had immensely increased be cause her romance took the hearts of her people by storm edmunds stock rose and ours along with it i shall attempt no description of the reception only saying that it was similar in character to the one which had attended our first arrival though far more gorgeous in details edmund was too much absorbed in his work to waste time on these things he immediately sought the car and devoted himself to its preparation four or five days may have elapsed before he an nounced the completion of his work then he called us together i believe the car to be all right now he said and i am going to make a trial trip you can all go and ill take ala and one of her maids along leaving juba here exploring venus shall not soon forget that trip at the start we were delighted it semed like home to be once more inside the familiar car and to watch edmund manipulating the revolving knobs that governed the mysterious force henry begged edmund to take us back to the earth at once but edmund refused im not yet done with venus he said theres lots of things here that we havent seen now that weve got the car in shape we can make rapid work of it jacks spirits had risen to a high pitch with the knowledge that the means of return were once more in our hands and he joined in with edmund of course we wont go back yet he said i want to see edmund crowned king of the planet first an enormous crowd assembled to see us off i be lieve that the capital was more populous than lon don and everybody in it was on the alert when we launched the car from one of the upper stories of the great tower the air was crowded with gay airplanes and airships banners and streamers were displayed on all sides and the atmosphere bloomed with undulating colors the noise was exraordinary for venus and a universal cry of astonishment burst forth when the car without visible machinery swiftly rose into the air and circled ver the city the airplanes chased us like children following a street organ but soon edmund touched a knob and we shot up rocketlike leaving them all behind and below higher and higher we rose until the vast roof of the clouddome was reached from that im mense elevation the whole breadth of the inhabited zone appeared spread below us bordered with lumi nous clouds along both of its edges the metropo lis looked like a giant fowerbed and dotted over the country were smaller cities while innumerable air planes saiied about far beneath us like flocks of brilliantplumaged birds ala at the helm i studied alas face to note the effect upon her she shewed some surprise but more her countenance denoted admiration of edmund and her enthusiasm was fairly girlish yet her quick intelligence manifested itself also and she attended with keen interest when he showed her how the con trolli rg knobs were managed he even permitted her to turn some of the con trollers and her delight knew no bounds when she found how easily under his guidance she could direct our course now we shot along under the dome like a meteor now we darted downward and then we ventured a little way up into the clouds i was surprised though of course i ought not to have been to find that when we entered the cloud dome the darkness around us was hard noticeable the clouds although closepacked were filtered through with sunshine from above so that we seemed to be immersed in a rosepink mist ala exhibited no fear whatever and a length edmund proposed that we should rise up through the dome into outer space we did this rapidly so that in a tew minutea we emerged on the upper side and venus was changed into a vast white globe brilliant with sun light but as soft in appearance as a ball of wool the world below was completely hidden only one thing astonished alathe sun it was too blindingly brilliant to look upon but frequently i saw her turn in its direction with an expression that greatly puzzled me i did not understand it until afterward then now occurred one of those things which are bound to happen whenever tv j persons a much interested in one another as were ala and edmund are together and one of them tries to be particu larljr agreeable to the other a columbus of space apollo in the old legend was not guilty of a greater indiscretion when he allowed phaeton to take the reins of the horses of the sun than was edmund when ala a little vain of what she had learned asked to be allowed to guide the car he foolishly consented and the consequences were prompt in declaring themselves trouble with the car edmund had worked up to a pretty lively clip and we may have been making ten miles a minute when alas desire to try her hand alone was gratified she had hardly grasped one of the knobs when my consciousness went off skylarking and as i quickly found out the same thing happened to everyone in the car you will easily imagine what had occurredinadvertently ala had brought us to the rightabout which flung us off our feet with such violence that we were knocked senseless when i came to myself and got on my legs edmund had already recovered and was working desperately at the controllers i knew from the motion that he was trying to stop us the car shook as if it would fall to pieces jolt following jolt like an express train under emergency brakes blood was running down his face and with a quick motion he wiped it out of his eyes without ever ceasing his labor at the knobs seeing more by instinct than by looking that i had recovered he cried out for heavens sake albert look to ala she lay senseless near the center of the car while jack and henry had been pitched into a corner and the maid lay beside a bench i lifted ala and after being jerked from my feet two or three times succeeded in placing her on one of the benches against the wall i could see ed munds anxious glances over his shoulder but he could not quit his place nor for an instant remit his exertions beautiful ala never had the beauty of this queen of venus seemed so wonderful as when i thus bore her in my arms i even imagined that edmund must feel a pang of jealousy very gently i placed her upon the cushioned bench and seeing no blood on her white face and arms i believed that she had suffered no injury beyond a shock soon she opened her eyes and as they fell upon edmund i realized that i and my exertions in her behalf were already forgotten she immediately strove to rise pushing me away but edmund see ing the movement signaled her to remain where she was docilely she obeyed him and then for the first time she smiled at meonly to express her grati tude but it sent the blood into my face in the meantime jack henry and the maid had recovered none of them was seriously injured and they scrambled to their feet the car by this time had ceased its eccentric movements and a moment later it came to rest i felt that it had touched groundbut where zdmund instantly ran to alas side and began to c iress her hands thank heaven he said aloud and if she did not understand his words she knew well his meaning when we began to bind up the cut on his head i felt like an intruder and hurried to one of the windows the first glance outside filled me with astonishmentand well it might one would have said that we had descended into the midst of a garden of gorgeous orchids strange flowers of the most exquisite beauty and most ex traordinary shapes hung all about us some of them brushing against the window i called jack and henry to look at them and while we stood there gazing no one speaking a word a mass of foliage parted and there emerged into view a bird so dazzlingly splendid in color that we all three mut tered a simultaneous oh our exclamation attracted the attention of ala and edmund who at once came to the window no sooner had she looked out than ala joyfully clasped her hands and immediately addressed herself to make edmund understand her thoughts after a minute or two he said to us the birds of venus ccttte have had great luck in rushing back to w the surface of venus without knowing where we were going we have landed in what i make out from ala in a kind of wild eden famous for the beauty of its flowers and its birds she pro poses that we shall at once alight from the car in order to enjoy the singular sights and pleasures which this place affords we alighted accordingly and found ourselves in a perfect wilderness of the most beautiful flowering shrubs and trees pushing aside the branches we emerged into a kind of arbor as if it had been a park all about us the trees and bushes bent under loads of magnificent blossoms which filled the air with delicious fragrance birds were everywhere and they exhibited no fear simply keeping out of our reach their plumage was the most extraordinary i have ever seen many of them having long iri descent feathers depending from their wings and tails i noticed that ala frequently turned toward these birds with a look of ineffable pleasure at first i thought that she was simply admiring their colors and their graceful shapes and movements but soon i became convinced that she was not merely looking but listening this excited my astonishment for none of us could hear a sound except the occasional rustle of the branches edmund i said at last i believe that ala hears something that we do not of course she does he replied there is music here these birds are singing but our ears are not accunecf co tfieir meiocfy ion know the peculiarity of this atmosphere with regard to sound all these people have a horror of loud noises but their ears detect sounds that lie far beyond the range of vibrations with which ours are affected there is another thing he added a moment later which may surprise you but i am certain that it exists there is a direct relation between color and sound here the light waves in certain combinations produce soundwaves amazing stories the harmony of colors ccy can only explain fvhat i mean by reference to the telephone you know how by a telephone sounds are first transformed into electric vibrations and afterward reshaped into sonorous waves you know also that we have used a ray of light to send telephonic messages taking advantage of the sensi tiveness of certain substances and their power of varying in electric resistance in accord with the in tensity of the light that strikes them thus with a telephone at each end we can make a beam of light reproduce a human voice what we have done awkwardly and partially by the aid of imperfect mechanical contrivances nature has accomplished here in a perfect way by means of the peculiar composition of the air and some special construction of the auditory apparatus it is all in line with the strange power of mental communication which these people possess light and sound color and music are linked for them in a manner that we cannot comprehend their esthetic enjoyment must be marvelously in advance of ours it is plain to me now that the music of color which we saw at the palace was something far more complete and wonderful than we then im agined together with the pleasure which they derive from the harmonic combinations of shifting hues they experience at the same time the delight that comes from sounds which are associated with and awakened by those colors but are utterly in audible to us i believe that all of their senses are more com pletely and delicately developed than ours and that even the perfume of these flowers is more delightful to ala than to us by jove edmund cried jack who had been listening with amazement it is indeed a divine world to which you have brought us but i wish you would find a way to open up these delights to the rest of us its rather disappointing to be plunged into the midst of such things without be ing able to enjoy them his words thrilled me for i knew that he never fepoke thus without having a definite meaning be hind but see here jack continued i dont quite get hold of this thing these people talk you know then why dont they sing and why dont they get their music the way we do because was the reply as i have just ex plained to you they have a far higher and more delicate means of producing and receiving the har monics of sound they talk occasionally it is true just as you see that these birds utter low sounds from time to time but speech with them has not been developed as with us since they have not our need of it i am rather surprised to find that they talk at all i shouldnt wonder if their spoken language were simply a reflex of their written or printed language writing and printing i exclaimed do you think that there are such things here the libraries on the planet cct havent a doubt of it edmund replied so a intellectual a people must have a history and a literature but the order of development has been exactly the reverse of that with us they have first invented their signs for recording thought and then a simple spoken language has originated from those signs as to their speaking that is a thing inevitable every sentient being utters sounds it is a neces sary result of the experiencing of emotion and i dont believe that there is anywhere in the universe a race of beings more delicately organized in our emotional sense than these inhabitants of venus inasmuch as i intend to publish a book dealing with the scientific aspect of life on venus i shali not burden this story of our adventures with these details only saying now that it actually turned out as edmund had conjectured we found later that not only were writing and printing known and practised the characters much resembling that of the chinese but at the capital there were immense libraries containing literary works and histories of venus for hundreds of gen erations as soon as a comprehension of what edmund had told us dawned fully upon our minds we began to note more carefully the conduct of ala and we were quickly convinced of the substantial correctness of his inferences she sat on a flowery bank under the fragrant drooping branches and seemed entranced by aerial music which we could not hear while we thus lingered with strange thoughts throwing us into a dreamy mood i happened to fix my eyes upon an opening in the foliage directly behind edmund who had placed himself at alas side a curious gleam attracted my attention and looking sharply i recognized a pair of eyes intently watching us before i could open my lips or make a movement the face to which the eyes belonged appeared for the fraction of a second and then was withdrawn it was the handsome but evil countenance of ingra chapter xvi turning the tables for a moment i was too startled to be able to speak then knowing the need of caution i approached edmund and whispered in his ears we are entrapped ingra is behind you edmund did not change countenance he did not even alter the direction of his eyes hush he whispered in return make no sign but be ready for an emergency go to jack and henry in an indifferent manner and tell them what you have seen but say that i am prepared this time and that we shall not be caught tell them to keep perfectly cool i did as edmund directed jack showed no fear but henry was a little shaken we stood fast not knowing what it was best to do i saw no more of ingra but i knew that he was there plotting mis a columbus of space chief and no doubt with enough force at hand to overwhelm us i cursed the accident that had thrown us once more into his power without question he had come to this remote place to conceal himself while laying his plans and fate had thrown us into his very lair presently edmund calmly rose and taking ala by the hand indicated a wish to return to the car i could see that his eyes furtively surveyed the thicket although he hardly turned his head i drew my pistol and jack imitated me stop that edmund whispered sharply keep them within reach but dont use them except in an emergency and not then without a sign from me ala understood the situation and her cheeks paled a little as she followed edmund shoving through the underbrush the car was only four or five rods away but our path to it was obstructed by the vegetation and never in my life have i been more nervously apprenhensive i expected every second to feel a rough hand laid upon me but whatever ingras plans were he did not attack us during the anxious minutes while we were pushing our way to the car captured by ingra but just as we were on the point of entering the opeh door the blow fell there was a rush the branches parted and ingra with more than a dozen followers fell upon us the onset was so sud den and fierce that we were swept away from the door into a small comparatively open space at the side of the car since we were unable to enter the car this was the best thing that could have happened because it offered a little room to act together for defense ingras aids were all like himself tall and power ful but they carried no weapons as far as i could see not even bludgeons our pistols were in our pockets and they remained there during the first few minutes of the breathless struggle there were at last three men upon each of us and they gave us no time for anything but the quickest kind of sparring in this we were all adepts i have told you of edmunds skill jack was an equally hard hitter but owing to his bulk and weight net so quick i was only second to edmund in allaround work and even henry was better than the average in sparring though somewhat lacking in strength the efforts of our assailants was to grip and hold us and ours was to keep them off long enough to enable us to draw our weapons a keen regret darted through my mind that edmund had not per mitted us to keep the pistols in our hands yet they might have been knocked out in the sudden rush before we could have used them even in the midst of the desperate struggle i saw that edmund had leveled two of his assailants and then i was tripped and down i went what hap pened to the others during the half minute that i lay prostrate with my foes atop of me i do not know but when i felt myself pulled into a sitting posture with my arms held tightly behind a strange sight confronted me it was a sight that surprised my captors as much ss it did me to be cmtinmd r edmund was lying on the ground his arms above his head held by two of his assailants ingra waa standing by him leaning forward as if to strike with a long glittering knife in his handthe first weapon i had seen among themand ala who from the commencement of the fray i had not seen knelt by edmunds side with one hand upon his shoulder and the other extended in a gesture of command toward ingra the latter seemed frozen in his tracks the knife remained poised his body was thrown forward on one leg but his eyes met alas and quailed pocahontas on verfus so dramatic a pose i have never seen on any stage it was not the pleading look of pocahontas saving captain john smith from his savage enemies that i saw in alas face but the irresistible glance of an imperious will kneeling though she was her attitude and man ner were those of a queen who knows only obedience the whole force of her character was concentrated in her wonderful eyes not only ingra but his fol lowers were arrested as if they had been hypnotized not one of them made a motion jack and henry were also prostrate and guarded for we seemed all to have been overthrown almost at the same moment but their captor like mine remained motionless and staring with amazed looks evidently ala was speaking or had spoken in that voiceless language and her words if i may so say had a potency above all physical strength but the thought flashed through my head that this spell could not endure the passion of ingra was too fierce his provoca tion was too intense his own rank was too near that of the womans to permit of his being effectually and permanently restrained by her interference i expected each instant to see him dash aside the arm that ala interposed and finish his mur derous stroke the same thought must have oc curred to edmund and he at least never lost the fraction of a second in acting upon the impulses of his mind the sudden staying of the unremitting attack had furnished the opportunity so long desired and with a motion as quick as thought edmund wrench ed his right hand free from the now unnerved as sailant who had held it above his head and in another instant his pistol was aimed at ingraa heart quick i yelled imitating his act your pis tols i got mine from my pocket for the fellows iri their astonishment had let go of me and waiting for no further guidance from edmund i fired without particular aim the shot struck a tall chap at my feet and down he went the other who had held me gave back and i sprang upon my feet the whole situation was changed in a twinkling jack freed himself as i had done but without firing and henrys assailants retired from the muzzles of our pistols it was our turn now shall we shoot the dogs demanded jack no edmund replied simply scare them off but ill keep this fellow now that i have him the october issue j t maston received the hardest voltaic knock that had ever found the mouth of a philosopher the flash had run along his metal hook and spun him around like a teetotum the blackboard he struck with his back was hurled down in the corner sid the

heart unfathomable an immense enterprise an immense enterprise it was which this wealthy american widow had resolved to sup port with large sums of money the object of its promoters was as follows the arctic territories properly so called ac cording to the highest geographical authorities are bounded by the seventyeighth parallel and extend over fourteen hundred thousand square miles while the seas extend over seven hundred thousand within this parallel have intrepid modern dis coveries advanced nearly as far as the eightyfourth degree of latitude revealing many a coast hidden beyond the lofty chain of icebergs giving names to capes promontories gulfs and bays of these vast arctic highlands but beyond this eightyfourth parallel is a mystery the unrealizable desideratum of geographers no one yet knows if land or sea lies hidden in that space of six degrees that im passable barrier of polar ice in this year the united states govern ment had unexpectedly proposed to put up to auction the circumpolar regions then remaining undiscover ed having been urged to this extraordinary step by an american society which had been formed to obtain a concession of the apparently useless tract some years before the berlin conference had formulated a special code for the use of great powers wishing to appropriate the property of an other under pretext of colonization or opening up commercial routes but this code was not applica ble under the circumstances as the polar domain was not inhabited nevertheless as dealing with that which belongs to all the new society did not propose to take but to acquire in the united states there is no project so au dacious for which people cannot be found to guar antee the cost and find the working expenses this was well seen when a few years before the gun club of baltimore had entered on the task of despatch ing a projectile to the moon in the hope of ob taining direct communi cation with our satellite was it not these enter prising yankees who had furnished the larger part of the sums required by this interesting attempt and if it had succeeded would it not be owing to two members of the said club who had dared to face the risk of an entirely novel experiment if a lesseps were one day to propose to cut a gigantic canal through europe and asia from the shores of the atlantic to the china sea if a well sinker of genius were to offer to pierce the earth in the hopes of finding and utilizing the beds of sili cates supposed to be there in a fluid state if an enterprising electrician proposed to combine the cur rents disseminated over the surface of the globe so as to form an inexhaustible source of heat and light uf ax y fro fie are continually amusing themselves by poiriing out the advantages we would have on cart if planet were not inclined on its axis j degrees i his inclination gives us our seasons if there were ro svk inclination there would be no seasons under ike equator we would have perpetual summer about the tropic of cancer we would have moderate weather all year around and it would even be comfort able at the xorth and south poles we would have exactly twelve hours of daylight and twelve hours of night at every point on the globe is it possible by any human agency to right the axis of the earth to accomplish this in this story the versa tile jules verne tells us how such an attempt was made and what happened it is a most exciting as well as interesting story a classic in all respects amazing stories if a daring engineer were to have the idea of storing in vast receptacles the excess of summer tempera ture in order to transfer it to the frozen regions in the winter if a hydraulic specialist were to pro pose to utilize the force of the tide for the produc tio nof heat or power at will if companies were to be formed to carry out a hundred projects of this kindit is the americans who would be found at the head of the subscribers and rivers of dollars would flow into the pockets of the projectors as the great rivers of north america flow intoand are lost inthe ocean it was only natural that public opinion shold be much exercised at the announcement that the arctic regions were to be sold to the highest bidder par ticularly as no public subscription had been opened with a view to the purchase for all the capital had been subscribed in advance and it was left for time to show how is was proposed to utilize the territory when it had become the property of the purchaser utilize the arctic regions in truth such an idea could anly have originated in the brain of a mad man but nevertheless nothing could be more serious than the scheme a curious advertisement in fact a communication had been sent to many of the journals of both continents concluding with a demand for immediate inquiry on the part of those interested it was the new york herald that first published this curious farrago and the innumer able patrons of gordon bennett read on the morn ing of the th of november the following advertise ment which rapidly spread through the scientific and industrial world and became appreciated in very different ways notice to the inhabitants of the ter restrial globe the regions of the north pole situated within the eightyfourth degree of north latitude have not yet been utilized for the very good reason that they have not yet been discovered the furthest points attained by the navigators of different nations are as follows said to have been reached by the englishman perry in july in long e north of spitzenbergen said to have been reached by markham in the english expedition of sir john nares in may in long w north of grinnell land said to have been reached by lockwood and brain ard in the american expedition of lieutenant greely in may in long w in the north of nares land it can thus be considered that the region ex tending from the eightyfourth parallel to the pole is still undivided among the different states of the globe it is therefore excellently adapted for an nexation as a private estate after formal purchase in public auction the property belongs to nobody by right of oc cupation and the government of the united states of america having been applied to in the matter have undertaken to name an official auctioneer for the purpose of its disposal a company has been formed at baltimore under the title of the north polar practical association which proposes to acquire the region by purchase and thus obtain an indefeasible title to all the con tinents islands islets rocks seas lakes rivers and watercourses whatsoever of which this arctic terri tory is composed although these may be now cover ed with ice which ice may in summertime disap pear it is understood that this right will be perpetual and indefeasible even in the event of modification in any way whatsoeverof the geographical or meteorological conditions of the globe the project having herewith been brought to the knowledge of the people of the two worlds repre sentatives of all nations will be admitted to take part in the bidding and the property will be ad judged to the highest bidder the sale will take place on the rd of december of the present year in the auction mart at balti more maryland united states of america for further particulars apply to william s for ster provisional agent of the north polar practical association high street baltimore it may be that this communication will be consid ered as a madmans freak but at any rate it must be admitted that in its clearness and frankness it left nothing to be desired the serious part of it was that the federal government had undertaken to treat a sale by auction as a valid concession of these undicovered territories opinions on the matter were many some readers saw in it only one of those prodigious outbursts of american humbug which would exceed the limits of puffism if the depths of human credulity were not unfathomable others thought the proposition should be seriously entertained and these laid stress on the fact that the new company had not appealed to the public for funds it was with their own money that they sought to acquire the northern regions they did not seek to drain the dollars and banknotes of the simple into their coffers no all they asked was to pay with their own money for their circumpolar property this was indeed ex traordinary to those people who were fond of figures it seem ed that all the said company had to do was to buy the right of the first occupant but that was difficult as access to the pole appeared to be forbidden to man and the new company would necessarily act with prudence for too many legal precautions could hardly be taken it was noticed that the document contained si clause providing for future contingencies this clause gave rise to much contradictory interpreta tion for its precise meaning escaped the most sub tle minds it stipulated that the right would be per petual even in the event of modification in any way whatsoever of the geographical or meteorological conditions of the globe what was the meaning of this clause what contingency did it provide for how could the earth ever undergo a modification affecting its geography or meteorology especially in the territories in question  evidently said the knowing ones there is something in this explanations there were many to exercise the ingenuity of some and the curiosity of others the purchase of the north pole newspaper comment the philadelphia ledger made the following suggestion the future acquirers of the arctic regions have doubtless ascertained by calcula tion that the nucleus of a comet will shortly strike the earth in such a manner that the shock will pro duce the geographical and meteorological changes for which the clause provides this sounded scientific but it threw no light on the matter the idea of a shock from such a comet did not commend itself to the intelligent it seemed inadmissible that the concessionaries should have prepared for so hypothetical an eventuality perhaps said the new orleans delta the new company imagine that the precession of the equi noxes will produce the modification favorable to the utilization of their new property and why not asked the hamburger corres pondent if the movement modifies the parallelism of the axis of our spheroid in fact said the paris revue scientifique did not adhemar say in his book on the revolutions of the sea that the precession of the equinoxes com bined with the secular movement of the major axis of the terrestrial orbit would be of a nature to bring about after a long period a modification in the mean temperature of the different parts of the earth and in the quantity of ice accumulated at the poles that is not certain said the edinburgh guar dian and even if it were so would it not require a lapse of twelve thousand years for vega to become our polestar in accordance with the said phenom enon and for the arctic regions to undergo a change in climate well said the copenhagen dagblad in twelve thousand years it would be time enough to sub scribe the money meanwhile we do not intend to risk a krone but although the revue scientifique might be right with regard to adhemar it was probable that the north polar practical association had never reckoned on a modification due to the precession of the equinoxes and no one managed to discover the meaning of the clause or the cosmical change for which it provided to ascertain what it meant application might perhaps be made to the directorate of the new com pany why not apply to its chairman but the chairman was unknown unmentioned too were the secretary and directors there was nothing to show from whom the advertisement emanated it had been brought to the office of the new york herald by a certain william s forster of balti more a worthy agent for codfish acting for ardrinell and co of newfoundland and evidently a man of straw he was as mute on the subject as the fish consigned to his care and the cleverest of reporters and interviewers could get nothing out of him but if the promoters of this industrial enterprise persisted in keeping their identity a mystery their intentions were indicated clearly enough they intended to aequire the freehold of that por tion of the arctic regions bounded by the eighty fourth parallel of latitude with the north pole as the central point nothing was more certain than that among modern discoverers only perry markham lockwood and brainard had penetrated within a degree of this parallel other navigators of the arctic seas had all halted far below it payer in had stopped at to the north of franz joseph land and nova zembla de long in the jeannette expedition in had stopped at in the neighborhood of the islands which bear his name others by way of new siberia and greenland in the latitude of cape bismark had not advanced be yond the th th and th parallels so that by leaving a space of twentyfive minutes between lockwood and brainards and the men tioned in the prospectus the north polar practical association would not encroach on prior discoveries its project affected an absolutely virgin soil un trodden by human foot the area of the portion of the globe within this eightyfourth parallel is tolerably large from to there are six degrees which at sixty miles each give a radius of miles and a diameter of miles the circumference is thus miles and the area in round numbers square miles this is nearly a tenth of the whole of europea goodsized estate international questions are raised the advertisement it will have been noticed assumed the principle that regions not known geographically and belonging to nobody in particu lar belonged to the world at large that the major ity of the powers would admit this contention was supposable but it was possible that states border ing on these arctic regions or considering the regions as the prolongation of their dominions toward the north might claim a right of possession and their pretentions would be all the more justi fied by the discoveries that had been made having been chiefly due to these regions and of course the federal governent as nominators of the auctioneer would give these powers an opportunity of claiming compensation and satisfy the claim with the money realized by the sale at the same time as the par tisans of the north polar practical association continually insisted the property was uninhabited and as no one occupied it no one could oppose its being put up to auction the bordering states with rights not to be dis regarded were six in numbergreat britain the united states denmark sweden and norway hol land and russia but there were other countries that might put in a claim on the ground of dis coveries made by their navigators france might as usual have intervened on ac count of a few of her children having taken part in occasional expeditions there was the gallant bellot who died in near beechy island during the voyage of the phoenix sent in search of sir john franklin there was dr octave pavy who died in at cape sabine during the stay of the greely expedition at fort conger and there was the expedition in which took to the spitz bergen seas charles martins and marraier and bravais and their bold companions but france did not propose to meddle in the enterprise which was more industrial than scientific and at the amazing stories outset she abandoned any chance she might have of a slice of the polar cake it was the same with germany she could point to the spitzbergen expedition of frederick martens and to the expeditions in of the germania and hansa under koldewey and hegeman which reached cape bismarck on the greenland coast but notwithstanding these brilliant discoveries she de cided to make no increase to the germanic empire by means of a slice from the pole so it was with austriahungary which however had her claims on franz joseph land to the north ward of siberia as italy had no right of intervention she did not intervenewhich is not quite so obvious as it may appear the same happened with regard to the samoyeds of siberia the eskimos who are scattered along the northern regions of america the natives of greenland of labrador of the baffin parry archi pelago of the aleutian islands between asia and america and of russian alaska which became american in but these peoplethe undis puted aborigines of the northern regionshad no voice in the matter how could such poor folks manage to make a bid at the auction promoted by the north polar practical association and if they outbid the rest how could they pay in shell fish or walrus teeth or seal oil but surely they had some claim on this territory strange to say they were not even consulted in the matter such is the way of the world chapter ii to syndicate or not to syndicate if the new company acquired the arctic re gions these regions would owing to the com panys nationality become for all practical purposes a part of the united states what would the first inhabitant say would the other powers permit it the swedes and norwegians were the owners of the north cape situated within the seventieth parallel and made no secret that they considered they had rights extending beyond spitzbergen up to the pole itself had not kheilhau the norwegian and nordenskiold the celebrated swede contrib uted much to geographical progress in those re gions undoubtedly denmark was already master of iceland and the faroe isles besides the colonies in the arctic regions at disco in daviss straits at holstein borg proven godhaven and upernavik in baffin sea and on the western coast of greenland be sides had not behring a dane in the russian ser vice passed through in the straits now bearing his name and had he not thirteen years after ward died on the island also named after him and before him in had not jon munk explored the eastern coast of greenland and discovered many points up to then totally unknown was not den mark to have a voice in the matter there was holland too had not barents and heemskerk visited spitzbergen and nova zembla at the close of the sixteenth century was it not one of her children jan mayen whose audacious voyage in gave her possession of the island named after him situated within the seventyfirst parallel a conference of the powers and how about russia had not behring been under the orders of alexis tschirikof had not paulutski in sailed into the arctic seas had not martin spanberg and william walton adven tured in these unknown regions in and done notable exploring work in the straits between asia and america had not russia her siberian terri tories extending over a hundred and twenty degrees to the limits of kamtchaika along the asiatic lit toral peopled by samoyeds yakuts tchouktchis and others and bordering nearly half of the arctic ocean was there not on the seventyfifth parallel at less than nine hundred miles from the pole the liakhov archipelago discovered at the beginning of the eighteenth century and how about the united kingdom which pos sessed in canada a territory larger than the whole of the united states and whose navigators held the first place in the history of the frozen north had not the british a right to be heard in the matter but not unnaturally the british government con sidered that they had quite enough to do without troubling themselves about an advertisement in the new york herald the foreign office did not con sider the consignee of codfish even worthy of a pigeonhole and the colonial office seemed quite ignorant of his existence until the secretarys attention was called to the subject when the official reply was given that the matter was one of purely local interest in which her majestys government had no intention of concerning themselves in canada however some stir was made parti cularly among the french and at quebec a syn dicate was formed for the purpose of competing with the company at baltimore the other countries interested followed the canadian lead although the governments haughtily ignored the audacious proposition speculative individuals were found in holland scandinavia denmark and russia to ven ture sufficient funds for preliminary expenses with a view to acquire imaginary rights that might prove profitably transferable three weeks before the date fixed for the sale the representatives of the various syndicates arrived in the united states the only representative of the american company was the william s forster whose name figured in the advertisement of the th of november holland sent jacques jansen a councillor of the dutch east indies years of age squat broad and protuberant with short arms and little bow legs aluminum spectacles face round and red hair in a mop and grizzly whiskersa solid man not a little incredulous on the subject of an enterprise whose practical consequences he did not quite see the danish syndicate sent erik baldenak an ex subgovernor of the greenland colonies a man of middle height somewhat unequal about the shoul ders with a perceptible corporation a large head and eyes so shortsighted that everything he read he almost touched with his nose his instructions were to treat as beyond argument the rights of his coun try which was the legitimate proprietor of the polar regions the swedes and norwegians sent jan harold pro the purchase of the north pole fessor of cosmography at christiania who had been one of the warmest partisans of the nordenskiold expedition a true type of the norseman with clear fresh face and beard and hair of the color of the overripe corn haralds private opinion was that the polar cap was covered with the palaecrystic sea and therefore valueless but none the less he intended to do the best he could for those who employed him the representative of the russian financiers was colonel borie karkof half soldier half diplomatist tall stiff hairy bearded mustached very uncom fortable in his civilian clothes and unconsciously seeking for the handle of the sword he used to wear the colonel was very anxious to know what was con cealed in the proposition of the north polar practical association with a view to ascertaining if it would not give rise to international difficulties england having declined all participation in the matter the only representatives of the british empire were those from the quebec company these were major donellan a frenchcanadian whose ancestry is sufficiently apparent from his name and a compatriot of his named todrin donel lan was tall thin bony nervous and angular and of just such a figure as the parisian comic journals caricature as that of an englishman todrin was the very opposite of the major being short and thick set and talkative and amusing he was said to be of scotch descent but no trace of it was observable in his name his character or his appearance curious debates the representatives arrived at baltimore by different steamers they were each furnished with the needful credit to outbid their rivals up to a certain point but the limit differed in each case the canadian representatives had command of much the most liberal supplies and it seemed as though the struggle would resolve itself into a dol lar duel between the two american companies as soon as the delegates arrived they each tried to put themselves in communication with the north polar practical association unknown to the others their object was to discover the motives of the en terprise and the profit the association expected to make out of it but there was no trace of an office at baltimore the only address was that of william s forster high street and the worthy codfish agent pretended that he knew nothing about it the secret of the association was impenetrable the consequence was that the delegates met vis ited each other crossexamined each other and fin ally entered into communication with a view of tak ing united action against the baltimore company and one day on the nd of november they found themselves in conference at the wolseley hotel in the rooms of major donellan and todrin the meet ing being due to the diplomatic efforts of colonel boris karkof to begin with the conversation occupied itself with the advantages commercial or industrial which the association expected to obtain from its arctic domain professor harald inquired if any of his colleagues had been able to ascertain anything with regard to this point and all of them confes sed that they had endeavored to pump william s forster without success i failed said baldenak i did not succeed said jansen when i went said todrin i found a fat man in a black coat and wearing a stovepipe hat he had on a white apron and when i asked him about this affair he told me that the south star had just arrived from newfoundland with a full cargo of fine cod which he was prepared to sell me on advan tageous terms on behalf of messrs ardrinell and co eh eh said the councillor of the dutch east indies you had much better buy a full cargo of the fine cod than throw your money into the arctic sea thats not the question said the major we are not talking of codfish but of the polar ice capm which said todrin the codfishman wants to wear it will give him influenza said the russian that is not the question said the major for some reason or other this north polar practical as sociationmark the word practical gentlemen wishes to buy four hundred and seven thousand square miles around the north pole from the eightyfourth we know all that said professor harald but what we want to know is what do these people want to do with these territories if they are territories or these seas if they are seas that is not the question said donellan here is a company proposing to purchase a portion of the globe which by its geographical position seems to belong to canada to russia said karkof to holland said jansen to scandinavia said harald to denmark said baldenak gentlemen said todrin excuse me but that is not the question by our presence here we have admitted the principle that the circumpolar terri tories can be put up to auction and become the property of the highest bidder now as you have powers to draw to a certain amount why should you not join forces and control such a sum as the baltimore company will find it impossible to beat the delegates looked at one another a syndicate of syndicates in these days we syndicate as un concernedly as we breathe as we drink as we eat as we sleep why not syndicate still further but there was an objection or rather an explana tion was necessary and jansen interpreted the feel ing of the meeting when he asked and after yes after but it seems to me that canada said donel lan and russian said karof and holland said jansen and denmark said baldenak dont quarrel gentlemen said todrin what is the good let us form our syndicate and after said harald after said todrin nothing can be simpler gentlemen when you have bought the property it will remain indivisible among you and then for ade quate compensation you can transfer it to one of amazing stories the syndicates we represent but the baltimore com pany will be out of it it was a good proposal at least for the moment for in the future the delegates could quarrel among themselves for the final settlement anyway as todrin had justly remarked the baltimore company would be out of it that seems sensible said baldenak clever said karkof artful said harald sly said jansen quite canadian said donellan and so gentlemen said karkof it is perfectly understood that if we form a syndicate the rights of each will be entirely reserved agreed it only remained to discover what sums had been placed to the credit of the delegates by the several associations which amounts when totaled would probably exceed anything at the disposal of the north polar practical people the question was asked by todrin a prospective sale but then came a change over the scene there was complete silence no one would reply open his purse empty his pocket into the common cashbox tell in advance how much he had to bid withthere was no hurry to do that and if dis agreement arose later on if circumstances obliged the delegates to look after themselves if the diplo matic karkof were to feel hurt at the little wiles of jansen who might take offense at the clumsy artifi ces of baldenak who in turn became irritated at the ingenuities of harald who might decline to sup port the pretentious claims of donellan who would find himself compelled to intrigue against all his col leagues individually and collectivelyto proclaim the length of their purses was to reveal their game which above all things they desired to keep in the dark obviously there were only two ways of answering todrins indiscreet demand they might exagger ate their resources which would be embarrassing when they had to put the money down or they might minimize them in such a way as to turn the proposition into a joke this idea occurred to the dutchman gentlemen said he i regret that for the ac quisition of the arctic regions i am unable to dis pose of more than fifty gulden and said the russian all i have to venture is thirtyfive roubles i have twenty kroner said harald i have only fifteen said baldenak well said the major it is evident that the profit in this matter will be yours for all i have at my disposal is the miserable sum of thirty cents chapter iii the north pole is knocked down to the highest bidder that the sale on the rd of december should take place in the auction mart might appear strange as a rule only furniture instru ments pictures and objects of art were sold there but for this curious departure from the ordinary practice in the sale of land a precedent was discov erable as already a portion of our planet had changed hands under the hammer a few years before at san francisco in cali fornia an island in the pacific ocean spencer is land had been sold to the rich w w kolderup when he outbid j r taskinar of stockton spencer island was habitable it was only a few degrees from the californian coast it had forests water courses a fertile soil and fields and prairies fit for cultivation it was not an indefinite region covered perhaps with sea and perpetual ice which probably no one would ever occupy for spencer island four million dollars had been paid for the polar territories it was not to be expected that anything like that amount would be forthcoming nevertheless the strangeness of the affair had brought together a considerable crowd chiefly of lookerson to witness the result the sale was to take place at noon and all the morning the traffic in bolton street was seriously interfered with long before the hour fixed for the sale the room was full with the exception of a few seats railed off and reserved for the delegates and when bal denak karkof jansen harald donellan and todrin had taken these places they formed a com pact group shoulder to shoulder and looked as if they were a veritable storming column ready for the assault of the pole close to them was the consignee of codfish whose vulgar visage expressed the sublimest indif ference he looked the least excited of all the crowd and seemed to be thinking only of how he could profitably dispose of the cargoes now on their way to him from newfoundland who were the capitalists represented by this man with probably millions of dollars at his command there was nothing to show that j t maston and mrs scorbitt had anything to do with the affair how could it be supposed that they had they were there though but lost in the crowd and were surrounded by a few of the principal mem bers of the gun club apparently simply as specta tors and quite disinterested william s forster seemed to have not the least knowledge of their existence a curious auction sale as it was impossible to hand around the north pole for the purposes of examination a large map of the arctic regions had been hung behind the auctioneers desk seventeen degrees above the arctic circle a broad red line around the eighty fourth parallel marked off the portion of the globe which the north polar practical association had brought to the hammer according to the map the region was occupied by a sea covered with an ice cap of considerable thickness but that was the affair of the purchasers at least no one could complain that they had been deceived as to the nature of the goods as twelve oclock struck the autioneer andrew r gilmour entered by a little door behind his desk he surveyed the assembly for an instant through his glasses and then calling for silence by a tap from his hammer he addressed the crowd as follows gentlemen i have been instructed by the federal the purchase of the north pole government to offer for sale a property situated at the north pole bounded by the eightyfourth parallel of latitude and consisting of certain con tinents and seas either solid or liquidbut which i am not quite sure kindly cast your eyes on this map it has been compiled according to the latest information you will see that the area is approximately four hundred and seven thousand square miles to facilitate the sale it has been de cided that the biddings for this extensive region shall be made per square mile you will therefore understand that every cent bid will represent in round numbers cents and every dollar dollars must ask you to be silent gentle men if you please the appeal was not superfluous for the impa tience of the public was producing a graduallyin creasing tumult that would drown the voices of the bidders when tolerable quietness had been established thanks to the intervention of flint the auctioneers porter who roared like a siren on a foggy day gilmour continued before we begin the biddings i think it right to remind you of three things the property has only one boundary that of the eightyfourth de gree of north latitude it has a guaranteed title and it will remain the property of the purchasers no matter what geographical or meteorological modifications the future may produce always this curious observation now gentlemen said gilmour what offers and giving his hammer a preliminary shake he con tinued in a nasal tone we will start at ten cents the square mile ten cents the tenth of a dollar meant dollars for the lot whether gilmour had a purchaser at this price or not the amount was quickly increased by balde nak twenty cents he said thirty cents said jansen for the dutchmen thirtyfive said professor harald forty said the russian that meant dollars and yet the bidding had only begun the canadians had not even opened their mouths and william s forster seemed absorbed in the newfoundland mercury now gentlemen said gilmour any advance on forty cents forty cents come the polar cap is worth more than that it is what he would have added is unknown perhaps it was guaranteed pure ice but the dane inter rupted him with fifty cents which the dutchman at once capped with sixty sixty cents the square mile any advance on sixty cents these sixty cents made the respectable sum of dollars at jansens bid donellan raised his head and looked at todrin but at an almost imperceptible negative sign from him he remained silent all that forster did was to scrawl a few notes on the margin of his newspaper come gentlemen said the auctioneer wake up surely you are going to give more than that and the hammer began to move up and down as if in disgust at the weakness of the bidding seventy cents said harald in a voice that trembled a little eighty cents said karkof almost in the same breath a nod from todrin woke up the major as if he were on springs hundred cents said the canadian that meant dollars four hundred and seven thousand dollars a high price to pay for a collection of icebergs ice fields and icefloes and the representative of the north pole prac tical association did not even raise his eyes from his newspaper had he been instructed not to bid if he had waited for his competitors to bid their highest surely the moment had come in fact their look of dismay when the major fired his hundred cents showed that they had abandoned the battle the last bids c a hundred cents the square mile said the auctioneer any advance is that so is that so no advance and he took a firm grasp on his hammer and looked around him once he continued twice any advance a hundred and twenty cents said forster quietly as he turned over the page of his news paper and forty said the major and sixty drawled forster and eighty drawled the major quite as placidly a hundred and ninety said forster and five said the major as if it were a mere casual observation you might have heard an ant walk a bleak swim a moth fly a worm wriggle or a microbe wag its tailif it has a tail gilmour allowed a few moments to pass which seemed like centuries the consignee of codfish continued reading his newspaper and jotting down figures on the margin which had evidently nothing to do with the matter on hand had he reached the length of his tether had he made his last bid did this price of cents the square mile or dollars for the whole appear to him to have reached the last limit of absurdity one hundred and ninetyfive cents said the auctioneer going at one hundred and ninetyfive cents and he raised his hammer one hundred and ninetyfive cents going going and every eye was turned on the representative of the north polar practical association that extraordinary man drew a large handker chief from his pocket and hiding his face in it blew a long sonorous blast with his nose then j t maston looked at him and mrs scor bitts eyes took the same direction and by the paleness of their features it could be seen how keen was the excitement they were striving to subdue why did forster hesitate to outbid the major forster blew his nose a second time then with amazing stories an even louder blast he blew it a third time and between the blasts he quietly observed two hundred cents a shudder ran through the hall the major seemed overwhelmed and fell back against todrin at this price per square mile the arctic regions would cost dollars the can adian limit had evidently been passed two hundred cents said gilmour once twice any advance he continued the major looked at the professor and the col onel and the dutchman and the dane and the pro fessor and the colonel and the dutchman and the dane looked at the major going going said the auctioneer everyone looked at the codfish man gone and down went gilmours hammer the north polar practical association repre sented by william s forster had become the pro prietors of the north pole and its promising neigh borhood and when william s forster had to name the real purchasers he placidly drawled barbicane co chapter iv old acquaintances barbicane co the president of the gun club what was the gun club going to do with the north pole we shall see is it necessary formally to introduce impey barbicane the president of the gun club and cap tain nicholl and j t maston and tom hunter with the wooden legs and the brisk bilsby and colonel bloomsberry and their colleagues no although twenty years had elapsed since the atten tion of the world was concentrated on these remark able personages they had remained much as they were just as incomplete corporeally and just as obstreperous just as daring just as wrapped up in themselves as when they had embarked in their extraordinary adventure time had made no im pression on the gun club it respected them as people respect the obsolete cannon that are found in the museums of old arsenals if the gun club comprised members at its foundationthat is persons and not limbs for a number of these were missingif corres pondents were proud of their connection with the club the number had in no way decreased on the contrary thanks to the unprecedented attempt they had made to open communication with the moon as related in the moon voyage its celebrity had increased enormously it will be remembered that a few years after the war of secession certain members of the gun club tired of doing nothing had proposed to send a pro jectile to the moon by means of a monster colum biad a gun nine hundred feet long had been sol emnly cast at tampa town in the floridan penin sula and loaded with lbs of fulminating cotton shot out by this gun a cylindroconical shell of aluminium had been sent flying among the stars of the night under a pressure of six million millions this story will appear in an early issue of amazing stories of litres of gas owing to a deviation of the tra jectory the projectile had gone around the moor and fallen back to the earth dropping into the pa cific ocean in lat n long west when the frigate susquehanna had secured it to the great satisfaction of its passengers of its passengers two members of the gun club the president impey barbicane and captain nicholl with a hairbrained frenchman had taken passage in the projectile and had all returned from the voyage safe and sound but if the two ameri cans were then present ready to risk their lives in some new adventure it was not so with michael ar dan he had returned to europe and made a for tune and was now planting cabbages in his retire ment if the bestinformed reporters were to be be lieved barbicane and nicholl had also retired compara tively speaking but they had retired only to dream of some new enterprise of a similar character they were in no want of money from their last under taking there remained nearly two hundred thousand dollars out of the five millions and a half yielded by the public subscriptions of the old and new worlds and by exhibiting themselves in their aluminium projectile throughout the united states they had realized enough wealth and glory to satisfy the most exacting of human ambitions they would have been content if idleness had not been wearisome to them and it was probably in order to find some thing to do that they had now bought the arctic regions but it should not be forgotten that if they had paid for their purchase eight hundred thousand dol lars and more it was because evangelina scorbitt had advanced the balance they required although barbicane and nicholl enjoyed incom parable celebrity there was one who shared it with them this was j t maston the impetuous secre tary of the gun club was it not this able mathe matician who had made the calculations which had enabled the great experiment to be made if he had not accompanied his two colleagues on their ex traordinary voyage it was not from fear certainly not but the worthy gunner wanted a right arm and had a gutttapercha cranium owing to one of those accidents so common in warfare and if he had shown himself to the selenites it might have given them an erroneous idea of the inhabitants of the earth of which the moon after all is but the humble satellite to his profound regret j t maston had had to resign himself to staying at home but he was not idle after the construction of the immense tele scope on the summit of longs peak one of the highest of the rocky mountains he had transported himself there and from the moment he found the projectile describing its majestic trajectory in the sky he never left his post of observation at the eyepiece of the huge instrument he devoted himself to the task of following his friends as they jour neyed in their strange carriage through space rescue of the moon voyagers it might be thought that the bold voyagers were forever lost to earth the projectile drawn into a new orbit by the moon might gravitate eternally the purchase of the north pole around the queen of the night as a sort of sub batellite but no a deviation which by many was called providential had modified the projectiles di rection and after making the circle of the moon brought it back from that spheroid at a speed of miles an hour at the moment it plunged into the ocean luckily the liqiud mass of the pacific had broken the fall which had been perceived by the u s frigate susquehanna as soon as the news had reached j t maston he had set out in all haste from the observatory at longs peak to the rescue of his friends soundings were taken in the vicin ity of where the shell had been seen to fall and the devoted maston had not hesitated to go down in divers dress to find his friends but such trouble was unnecessary the projectile being of alumin ium displacing an amount of water greater than its own weight had returned to the surface of the pacific after a magnificent plunge and president barbicane captain nicholl and michael ardan were found in their floating prison playing dominoes the part that maston took in these extraordinary proceedings had brought him prominently to the front he was not handsome with his artificial cranium and his mechanical arm with its hook for a hand he was not young for fiftyeight years had chimed and struck at the date of our storys beginning but the originality of his character the vivacity of his intelligence the fire in his eye the impetuosity with which he had attacked everything had made him the beauideal of a man in the eyes of evangelina scorbitt his brain carefully pro tected beneath its guttapercha roof was intact and justly bore the reputation of being one of the most remarkable of the day mrs scorbittthough the least calculation gave her a headachehad a taste for mathematicians if she had not one for mathematics she looked upon them as upon beings of a peculiar and superior species heads where as knocked against xs like nuts in a bag brains which rejoiced in algebraic formulse hands which threw about triple integrals as an equilibrist plays with glasses and bottles in telligences which understood this sort of thing xyz dxdydz these were the wise men who appeared worthy of all the admiration of a woman attracted to them proportionately to their mass and in inverse ratio to the square of their distances and j t maston was bulky enough to exercise on her an irresistible attraction and as to the distance between them it would be simply zero if she succeeded in her plans it must be confessed that this gave some anxiety to the secretary of the gun club who had never sought happiness in such close approximations be sides evangelina scorbitt was no longer in her first youth but she was not a bad sort of person by any means and she would have wanted for nothing could she only see the day when she was introduced to the drawingrooms of baltimore as mrs j t maston the widows fortune was considerable not that she was as rich as gould mackaye vanderbilt or gordon bennett whose fortunes exceed millions and who could give alms to a rothschild not that she possessed the millions of mrs moses car per mrs stewart or mrs crocker nor was she as rich as mrs hammersley mrs hetty green mrs maffitt mrs marshall mrs paran stevens mrs mintbury and a few others but she was the pos sessor of four good millions of dollars which had come to her from john p scorbitt who had made a fortune by trade in fashionable sundries and salt pork and this fortune the generous widow would have been happy to employ for the advantage of j t maston to whom she would bring a treasure of tenderness yet more inexhaustible at mastons request she had cheerfully consent ed to put several hundreds of thousands of dollars at the disposal of the north polar practical asso ciation without even knowing what it was all about with j t maston concerned in it she felt assured that the work could not but be grandiose sublime superexcellent the past of the gun clubs secre tary was voucher enough for the future it may be guessed therefore if she lost confi dence when the auctioneers hammer knocked down the north pole to barbicane co while j t maston formed part of the co could she do other wise than applaud mrs scorbitts new estate and thus it happened that evangelina scorbitt found herself chief proprietor of the arctic regions within the eightyfourth parallel but what would she do with them or rather how was the company to get any benefit out of it that was the question and if in a pecuniary sense it had much interest for mrs scorbitt from a curiosity point of view it had quite as much inter est for the world at large the trusting widow had asked a few questions of maston before she advanced the funds but maston invariably maintained the closest reserve mrs scorbitt he remarked would know soon enough but not before the hour had come for she would be astonished at the object of the new association doubtless he was thinking of some undertaking which to quote jean jacques never had an example and never will have imitators of something des tined to leave far behind the attempt made by the gun club to open up communication with the moon when evangelina grew somewhat pressing in her inquiries j t maston had placed his hook on his halfclosed lips and remarked soothingly have confidence mrs scorbitt have confidence and if mrs scorbitt had confidence before the sale what immense joy she must have experienced at the result still she could not help asking the eminent mathematician what he was going to do next and though she smiled on him bewitchingly the eminent mathematician only replied as he cor dially shook her hand you will know very soon that shake of the hand immediately calmed the impatience of mrs scorbitt and a few days later there was another shake for the old and new worlds were considerably shakento say nothing of the shake that was comingwhen they learned the pro ject for which the north polar practical associa tion appealed to the public for subscriptions the company announced that it had acquired the territory for the purpose of workingthe coalfields at the north pole amazing stories chapter v the polar coalfield ut are there any coalfields at the pole such was the first question that presented jlj itself why should there be coal at the pole said some why should there not be said others coalbeds are found in many parts of the world there is coal in europe there is coal in america and in africa and in asia and in oceania as the globe is more and more explored beds of fossil fuel are revealed in strata of all ages there is true coal in the primary rocks and there is lignite in the secondaries and tertiaries england alone produces a hundred and sixty mil lions of tons a year the world consumes four hun dred million tons and with the requirements of in dustry there is no decrease but an increase in the consumption the substitution of electricity for steam as a motive power means the expenditure of coal just the same the industrial stomach can not live without coal industry is a carbonivorous animal and must have its proper food carbon is something else than a combustible it is the telluric substance from which science draws the major part of the products and byproducts used in the arts with the transformations to which it is subject in the crucibles of the laboratory you can dye sweeten perfume vaporize purify heat light and you can produce the diamond but the coalbeds from which our carbon at pres ent chiefly comes are not inexhaustible and the wellinformed people who are in fear for the future are looking about for new supplies wherever there is a probability of their existence but why should there be coal at the pole why replied the supporters of president bar bicane because in the carboniferous period ac cording to a wellknown theory the volume of the sun was such that the difference in temperature between the equator and the poles was inappreci able immense forests covered the northern re gions long before the appearance of man when our planet was subject to the prolonged influence of heat and humidity and this the journals reviews and magazines that supported the north polar practical associa tion insisted on in a thousand articles popular and scientific if these forests existed what more reas onable to suppose than that the weather the water and the warmth had conveited them into coalbeds but in addition to this there were certain facts which were undeniable and these were important enough to suggest that a search might be made for the mineral in the regions indicated so thought donellan and todrin as they sat to gether in a corner of the two friends well said todrin can barbicane be right it is veiy likely said the major but then there are fortunes to be made in open ing up the polar regions how about coal ssuredly said the major north amer ica has immense deposits of coal new dis coveries are often being announced and there are doubtless more to follow the arctic regions seem to be a part of the american continent geologically they are similar in formation and physiography greenland is a prolongation of the new world and certainly greenland belongs to america as the horses head which it looks like belongs to the animals body said todrin nordenskiold said donellan when he ex plored greenland found among the sandstones and schists intercalations of lignite with many forest plants even in the disko district streestrup dis covered eleven localities with abundant vestiges of the luxuriant vegetation which formerly encircled the pole but higher up asked todrin higher up or farther up to the northward said the major the presence of coal is extremely prob able and it only has to be looked for and if there is coal on the surface is it not reasonable to suppose that there is coal underneath the major was right he was thoroughly posted up in all that concerned the geology of the arctic regions and he would have held on for some time if he had not noticed that the people in the two friends were listening to him are you not surprised at one thing major what is that that in this affair in which you would expect to meet with engineers and navigators you have only to deal with artillerists what have they to do with the coalmines of the north pole that is rather surprising said the major and every morning the newspapers returned to this matter of the coalmines coalbeds said one what coalbeds what coalbeds replied another why those that nares found in and on the eighty second parallel when his people found the miocene flora rich in poplars beeches viburnums hazels and conifers and in added the scientific chronicler of the new york witness during the greelv ex pedition to lady franklin bay a bed of coal was discovered by our men at watercourse creek close to fort conger did not dr pavy rightly con sider that these carboniferous deposits were appar ently destined to be used some day for contending with the cold of that desolate region when these facts were brought forward it will be easily understood that impey barbicanes adver saries were hard up for a reply the partisans of the why should there be coal had to lower their flag to the partisans of why should there not be yes there was coal and probably a considerable amount of it the circumpolar area contained large deposits of the precious combustible on the site of the formerly luxuriant vegetation but if the ground were cut from under their feet regarding the existence of the coal the detractors took their revenge in attacking the question from another point be it so said the major one day in the rooms of the gun club itself when he discussed the mat ter with barbicane be it so i admit there is coal there i am convinced there is coal there but work it that we are going to do said barbicane tran quilly the purchase of the north pole get within the eightyfourth parallel beyond which no explorer has yet gone we will get beyond it go to the pole itself we are going there and in listening to the president of the gun club making these cool answers talking with such assurance expressing his opinion so haughtily and unmistakably the most obstinate began to hesi tate they felt they were in the presence of a man who had lost nothing of his former qualities calm cool with a mind eminently serious and concen trated exact as a chronometer adventurous and bringing the most practical ideas to bear on the most daring undertakings solid morally and phy sically he was deep in the water to employ a metaphor of napoleons and could hold his own against wind or tide his enemies and rivals knew that only too well he had stated that he would reach the north pole he would set foot where no human foot had been set before he would hoist the stars and stripes on one of the two spots of earth which re mained immovable while all the rest spun around in diurnal rotation caricatures here was a chance for the caricaturists in the windows of the shops and kiosks of the great cities of europe and america there appeared thousands of sketches and prints displaying impey barbicane seeking the most extravagant means of attaining his object here the daring american assisted by all the members of the gun club pickaxe in hand was driving a submarine tunnel through masses of ice which was to emerge at the very point of the axis here barbicane accompanied by j t maston a very good portraitand captain nicholl descend ed in a balloon on the point in question and after unheardof dangers succeeding in capturing a lump of coal weighing half a pound which was all the circumpolar deposit contained here j t maston who was as popular as bar bicane with the caricaturists had been seized by the magnetic attraction of the pole and wa fast held to the ground by his metal hook and it may be remarked here that the celebrated calculator was of too touchy a temperament to laugh at any jest at his personal peculiarities he was very much annoyed at it and it will be easily imag ined that mrs scorbitt was not the last to share in his just indignation another sketch in the brussels magic lantern represented impey barbicane and his codirectors working in the midst of flames like so many in combustible salamanders to melt the ice of the palseocrystic sea they had poured over it a sea of alcohol and then lighted the spirit so as to convert the polar basin into a bowl of punch and playing on the word punch the belgian designer had had the irreverence to represent the president of the gun club as a ridiculous punchinello but of all the caricatures that which obtained the most success was published by the parisian charivari under the signature of stop in the stomach of a whale comfortably furnished and padded impey barbicane and j t maston sat smok ing and playing chess waiting their arrival at their destination the new jonahs had not hesitated to avail themselves of an enormous marine mammifer and by this new mode of locomotion had passed under the icefloes to reach the inaccessible pole the phlegmatic president was not in the least incommoded by this intemperance of pen and pencil he let the world talk and sing and parody and caricature and he quietly went on with his work as soon as he had obtained the concession he had issued an appeal to the public for the subscrip tion of fifteen millions of dollars in hundreddollar shares such was the credit of barbicane co that applications flowed in wholesale but it is as well to say that nearly all the applications came from the united states so much the better said the supporters of the north polar practical assoiation the work will be entirely american the prospectus was so plausible the speculators believed so tenaciously in the realization of its promises and admitted so imperturbably the exis tence of the polar coalmines that the capital was subscribed three times over twothirds of the applications were declined with regret and on the th of december the capital of fifteen millions of dollars was fully paid up it was about thrice as much as the amount subscribed for the gun club when they made their great experi ment of sending a projectile from the earth to the moon chapter vi a telephonic conversation not only had barbicane announced that he would attain his objectand now the capi tal at his command enabled him to reach it without hindrancebut he would certainly not have appealed for funds if he were not certain of success the north pole was at last to be conquered by the audacious genius of man barbicane and his codirectors had the means of succeeding where so many others had failed they would do what had not been done by franklin kane nares or greely they would advance beyond the eightyfourth parallel they would take possession of the vast portion of the globe that had fallen to them under the hammer they would add to the american flag the fortythird star for the forty third state annexed to the american confederation rubbish said the european delegates and the means of conquering the polemeans that were practical logical indisputable and of a simplicity quite infantinewere the suggestions of j t maston it was in his brain where ideas were cooked in cerebral matter in a state of constant ebullition that there had been conceived this great geographical work and the means devised of bring ing it to a successful issue complicated mathematics the secretary of the gun club was a remarkable calculator the solution of the most complicated problems of mathematical science was but sport to him he laughed at difficulties whether in the science of magnitudes that is algebra or in tha science of numbers that is arithmetic and it was a treat to see him handle the symbols the conven amazing stories tional signs which form the algebraic notation whether letters of the alphabet representing quan tities or magnitudes or lines coupled or crossed which indicate the relation between the quantities and the operations to which they are submitted ah the coefficients the exponents the radicals the indices and the other arrangements adopted in that language how the signs leaped from the pen or rather from the piece of chalk which wriggled at the end of his metal hook for he preferred to work on a blackboard there on a surface of ten square yardsfor nothing less would do for j t mastonhe reveled in all the ardor of his algebra ical temperament they were no miserable little figures that he employed in his calculations no the figures were fantastic gigantic traced with a furious hand his s and s waltzed like shav ings in a whirlwind his s were like gibbets and only wanted a corpse to complete them his s were like spectacles and his s and s had flourishes interminable and the letters with which he built up his form ulffl the as and s and cs he used for his quan tities given or known and the as ya and zs he used for his quantities sought or unknown and es pecially his zs which twisted in zigzags like light ning flashes and what turns and twiggles there were in his fs his s his cos even a euclid or an archimedes would have been proud of them and as to his signs in pure unblurred chalk they were simply marvellous his showed the ad dition was unmistakable his though humbler was quite a work of art his x was as clear as a st andrews cross and as to his so rigorously equal were they as to indicate without a chance of mistake that j t maston lived in a country where equality was no vain formula his and his were really grand and as to his v the root of a quality or of a number it was really a triumph and when he completed the horizontal bar in this style v it seemed as if the indicatory vinculum would shoot clean off the blackboard and menace the world with inclusion within the maniacal equation but do not suppose that the mathematical intelli gence of j t maston was bounded by the horizon of elementary algebra no the differential calculus the integral calculus the calculus of variations were no strangers to him and with unshaking hand he dashed down the famous sign of integration the shape so terrible in its simplicity the f that speaks of an infinity of elements of the infin itely little and like it was his which represents the sum of a finite number of finite elements like it was his cc with which mathematicians indicate the variant like it were all the mysterious symbols employed in this language so unintelligible to ordinary mortals in short this astonishing man was capable of mounting the mathematical ladder to the very top most rung such was j t maston no wonder his colleagues had every confidence in him when he undertook to solve the wildest abracadabrant calculations that oc curred to their audacious brains no wonder that the gun club had confided to him the problem re garding the hurling of the projectiles from the earth to the moon no wonder that evangelina scorbitt was intoxicated with the glory and had conceived for him an admiration which perilously bordered on love but in the case under consideration the solution of the problem regarding the conquest of the north pole j t maston had no flight to take in the sub lime regions of analysis to allow the concession aries of the arctic regions to make use of their new possessions the secretary of the gun club had put a simple problem in mechanics to occupy his mind it was a complicated problem no doubt requiring ingenious and possibly novel formula but it could be done yes they could trust j t maston although the slightest slip might entail the loss of millions but never since his baby head had toyed with the first notions of arithmetic had he made a mistake never had he been the milllionth of an inch out in a matter of measurement and if he had made an error in the last of twenty places of decimals his guttapercha cranium would have burst its fixings it was important to insist on the remarkable mathematical powers of j t maston we have done so now we have to show him at work and to do that we must go back a few weeks about a month before the famous advertisement j t maston had been requested to work out the elements of the project of which he had suggested to his colleagues the marvelous consequences for many years he had lived at no franklin street one of the quietest streets in baltimore far from the business quarter for in commerce he took no interest far from the noise of the crowd for the mob he abhorred there he occupied a modest habitation known as ballistic cottage living on the pension he drew as an old artillery officer and on the salary paid him as the gun club secretary he lived alone with one servant firefire a name worthy of an artillery mans valet this negro was a servant of the first water and he served his master as faithfully as he would have served a gun the mathematician described jt maston was a confirmed bachelor being of opinion that bachelorhood is the only state worth caring about in this sublunary sphere he knew the slav proverb that a woman draws more with one hair than four oxen in a plow and he was on his guard if he was alone at ballistic cottage it was be cause he wished to be alone he had only to nod to change his solitude of one into a solitude of two and help himself to half the fortune of a millionaire there was no doubt of it mrs scorbitt would only have been too happy but j t maston was not going to be too happy and it seemed that these two people so admirably adapted to each otherin the widows opinionwould never understand each other the cottage was a very quiet one there was a groundfloor and a firstfloor the groundfloor had its veranda its receptionroom and diningroom and the kitchen in a small annex in the garden above them was a bedroom in front and a work room facing the garden away from the noise a buen retiro of the savant and the sage within whose walls the purchase of the north pole were solved calculations that would have raised the envy of a newton or a laplace different indeed was the home of mrs scorbitt in the fashionable quarter of new park with the balconies on its front covered with the fantastic sculpture of american architecture gothic and renascence jumbled together its enormous hall its picture galleries its double twisted staircase its numerous domestics its stables its coachhouses its gardens its lawns its trees its fountains and the tower which dominated its battlements from the summit of which fluttered in the breeze the blue and gold banner of the scorbitts three miles divided new park from ballistic cottage but a telephone wire united the two habit ations and at the ringing of the call between the mansion and the cottage conversation could be in stantly established if the talkers could not see each other they could hear each other and no one will be surprised to learn that evangelina scorbitt called j t maston much oftener before his tele phone than did j t maston summon evangelina scorbitt before hers the mathematician would leave his work not without some disgust to receive a friendly good morning and he would reply by a growl along the wire which he hoped would soften as it went and then he would return to his prob lems it was on the rd of october after a last and long conference that j t maston took leave of his colleagues to devote himself to his task it was the most important investigation he had ever under taken he had to calculate the mechanical formulas required for the advance on the pole and the eco nomical working of the coalbeds thereof he esti mated that it would take him rather more than a week to accomplish this mysterious task it was a complicated and delicate inquiry necessitating the resolution of a large number of equations dealing with mechanics analytical geometry of the three dimensions and spherical trigonometiy to be free from trouble it had been arranged that the secretary of the gun club should retire to his cottage and be visited and disturbed by no one this was a great trial for mrs scorbitt but she had to resign herself to it she and president barbi cane captain nicholl the brisk bilsby colonel bloomsberry and tom hunter with his wooden legs had called on maston in the afternoon to bid him farewell for a time you will succeed dear maston she said as she rose to go but be sure you dont make a mistake said bar bicane with a smile a mistake he exclaimed mrs scorbitt with horror at the thought with a grip of the hand from some a sigh from one wishes for success and recommendations not to overwork himself from others the mathematician saw his friends depart the door of ballistic cot tage was shut and firefire received orders to open it to no onenot even the president of the united states of america for the first two days of his seclusion j t mas ton thought over the problem without touching the chalk he read over certain works relative to the elements the earth its mass its density its volume its form its rotation on its axis and translation around its orbitelements which were to form the bases of his calculations the data for the calculations these are the principal ones which it is as well the reader should have before him form of the earth an elipsoid of revolution with a major diameter of g miles and a minor diameter of miles the difference between the two owing to the flattening of the spheroid at the poles being miles or one twohundredandnine tythird of its mean diameter circumference of the earth at the equator miles the meridonal circumference being miles surface of the earth square miles volume of the earth cubic miles density of the earth five and a half times that of water the mass being approximately tons duration of the earths journey around the sun days and a quarter constituting the solar year or more exactly days hours minutes thus giving the spheroid an average velocity of miles an hour rate of the earths rotation at the equator miles per hour the following were the units of length force time and inclination which j t maston required for his calculations the mile the ton the second and the angle at the center which cuts off in any circle an arc equal to the radius it was on the th of october at five oclock in the afternoonit is important to know the precise time in a work of such celebritythat j t maston after much reflecting began to write and to begin with he attacked the problem at its basethat is by the number representing the circumference of the earth which is one of its great circles viz the equator the blackboard was placed in an angle of the room on an easel of polished oak well in the light of one of the windows which opened on to the garden little sticks of chalk were placed on the shelf at the bottom of the board a sponge to wipeout with was in the calculators left hand his right hand or rather his hook was reserved for writing down the figures of his working he began by describing the circumference of the terrestrial spheroid at the equator the curve of the globe was marked by a plain line representing the front part of the curve and by a dotted line rep resenting the back half of the curve the axis was a perpendicular line cutting the equator and mark ed n s on the lefthand top corner of the board he wrote the number that he used to represent the earths circumference in metrical measurements he knew that thiswas an assumption admitted to be erroneous but it afforded a good round integer to begin with and the subsequent rectification of his calculations by the inclusion of the missing meters was but childsplay to so transcendental a mathe matician as j t maston he was so preoccupied that he had not noticed the state of the skywhich had changed considera bly during the afternoon for the last hour one of those great storms had been gathering which affect amazing stories the organizations of all living things livid clouds like whitish wool flocks had accumulated on the gray expanse and hung heavily over the city the roll of distant thunder was heard one or two flashes had already rent the atmosphere where the electric tension was at its highest j t maston more and more absorbed saw noth ing heard nothing suddenly an electric bell troubled the silence of the room with its hurried tinkling good exclaimed the mathematician if in terrupters cant get in by the door they come through the wire a fine invention for people who wish to be left alone ill see if i cant turn that current off while i am at work and stepping up to the telephone he asked who wants me i want a moments talk with you said a femi nine voice and who is speaking have you not recognized my voice dear mr maston it is mrs scorbitt mrs scorbitt she will not leave me a moments peace but the last words were prudently mut tered above the instrument so that the widow heard them not and j t maston seeing that he must say something civil replied ah it is you mrs scorbitt i dear mr maston and what does mrs scorbitt want with me to tell you that there is a storm coming your way well i cannot stop it an impending thunder storm ccx to but i wanted to ask if you had taken care to shut your window mrs scorbitt had hardly ended before a tremend ous clap of thunder filled the air it seemed as though a vast sheet of silk had been torn apart for an infinity of length the lightning had flashed down over ballistic cottage and conducted by the telephone wire had invaded the mathematicians room with a brutality quite electric j t maston bending over the mouthpiece of the instrument received the hardest voltaic knock that had ever found the mouth of a philosopher the flash had run along his metal hook and spun him around like a teetotum the blackboard he struck with his back was hurled down in the corner and the lightning disappeared out of the window stunned for a momentand it was a wonder it was no worsej t maston slowly rose and rubbed the different parts of his body to make sure he was not hurt then having lost none of his coolness as be seemed the ancient pointer of the columbiad he put his room in order picked up his easel hoisted up his blackboard gathered up the fragments of chalk scattered on the carpet and resumed his work which had been so rudely interrupted but he noticed that by the fall of the blackboard the figures he had written on the righthand top corner which represented in meters the approxi mate equatorial circumference of the earth had been partially erased he stretched his hook up to rewrite them when the bell sounded with a feverish tinkle again exclaimed j t maston and he went to the telephone who is there he asked mrs scorbitt and what does mrs scorbitt want did that horrible flash of lightning strike bal listic cottage i have every reason to believe so good heavens the lightning do not be uneasy mrs scorbitt you are not hurt dear mr maston not at all you are sure you have not been touched i am only touched by your thoughtfulness for me said the philosopher gallantly good evening dear mr maston good evening dear mrs scorbitt and he returned to his blackboard confound that excellent woman he said if she hadnt called me to the telephone i should not have run the chance of being struck by lightning and to insure being left in quiet he judiciously put the telephone out of action then he resumed his work from the number on the board he gradually built up a definitive formula and then noting it on the left he cleared away the working by which he had arrived at it and launch ed forth into an appalling series of figures and signs eight days later the wonderful calculation was finished and the secretary cf the gun club trium phantly bore off to his colleagues the s dution of the problem which they had awaited with a very natural impatience the practical means of arriving at the north pole to work its coalmines were mathematically estab lished then the company was formed under the title of the north polar practical association then the arctic regions were purchased under the auctioneers hammer and then the shares were offered to the world chapter vii barbicane makes a speech on the nd of december a general meeting was called of the shareholders of the north pole practical association to take place at the rooms of the gun club in union square and the square itself was hardly large enough to hold the crowd  usually the large hall of the club was decorated with weapons of all sorts appropriate to the noble profession of its members it was quite an artillery museum even the furniture itself the chairs and tables and couches was of the pattern of the mur derous engines which had sent to a better world so many worthy people whose secret desire had been to die of old age on this occasion the furniture had been removed this was not a warlike assembly it was an indus trial and pacific assembly over which barbicane was to preside the hall was full to suffocation and the crowd of those who could not get in stretched half across union square the members of the gun club who had held the first shares in the company had secured places around the platform among them even more triumphant than usual were colonel bloomsberry tom hunter with the wooden legs and the brisk bilsby a comfortable armchair had been reserved the gun which discharged the passengercarrying projectile of the moon story the purchase of the north pole for mrs scorbitt as was only right considering that she was the chief proprietor of the polar free hold and there were a number of other lady share holders belonging to all classes of the city whose bright bonnets and hats and feathers and ribbons were a welcome relief to the black coats of the noisy men that crowded under the glazed cupola of the hall the immense majority of shareholders were not so much supporters as personal friends of the di rectors but among the crowd were the represen tatives of the rival companies who had bid against forster at the auction sale and who now had taken shares in order to be qualified to vote and make mis chief at the meetings it can be easily imagined with what intense curiosity they awaited barbi canes address which would probably throw some light on the way in which the north pole was to be reached perhaps there was a difficulty there even greater than working the mines if any objections could be made we may be sure that baldenak kar kof jansen and harald were quite equal to making them and the major and his invaluable todrin would lose no chance of driving barbicane behind his last entrenchments a shareholders meeting it was eight oclock the hall the side ooms and the corridors of the gun club glowed with edison lamps ever since the doors had been opened to the public there had been an incessant uproar but as soon as the directors appeared all was silent at a table covered with a black cloth on the plat form barbicane nicholl and j t maston took up their positions in the fullest glare of the light as they did so three cheers punctuated by the needful hips broke forth and were echoed in the adjacent streets solemly j t maston and captain nicholl sat down in all the plentitude of their celebrity then barbicane who had remained standing put his right hand in his trousers pocket his left thumb in his waistcoat pocket and began to speak as fol lows fellow shareholders the directorate of the north polar practical association have called this meeting in the rooms of the gun club as they have something of importance to communicate to you you have learned from the newspapers that the object of our company is the opening up of the coal fields of the north pole the concession of which we have obtained the estate acquired in public auc tion is the property of the company and the capital which was all subscribed by the th of december last enables us to enter at once on an enterprise which will produce a rate of interest unknown up to now in any commercial or industrial operation whatever here the first murmur of approval for a moment interrupted the orator you are aware of how we came to discover that there were rich beds of coal and also possibly of fossil ivory in the circumpolar regions the state ments in the public press leave no doubt as to the existence of these coal strata now coal has become the source of all modern industry to say nothing of the fuel used for heat ing purposes or of its employment for the produc tion of steam and electricity i may direct your at tention to its derivatives the aniline colors the perfumes the picrates salicylic acid napthol phe nol antipyrin benzin naphthalin pyrogallic acid tannin saccharin tar asphalt pitch lubricating oils varnish yellow prussiate of potash cyanide bitters etc etc and after this enumeration which had been given with great rapidity the orator paused like an ex hausted runner to take a long breath then he con tinued it is indubitable that coal will in time be exhausted before five hundred years the mines in operation today three hundred shouted one of the crowd two hundred roared another let us say a delay more or less restricted said barbicane and put ourselves in a position to see what new coalfields then remain supposing that the present fields are exhausted at the close of this century here he paused to enable his audience to concen trate their attention then he continued now fellow shareholders follow me and let us start for the north pole and the audience rose as if to pack their baggage ready for shipboard an observation from major donellan put a sud den stop to this movement of enthusiasm before you start said he will you kindly in form the meeting how you intend going are you going by sea neither by sea nor by land nor by air said barbicane sweetly and the assembly sat down a prey to very par donable curiosity you are not without some knowledge continued the orator of the attempts that have been made to reach that inaccessible point of the terrestrial spheroid it is better however that i should remind you of a few of them it will be to render due honor to the bold pioneers who have survived and those who have succumbed in these expeditions unanimous approval from the entire audience ir respective of nationality early expedition to the arctic ctn resumed barbicane sir john frank i lin with the erebus and terror set out to find the northwest passage and nothing more was heard of him in the american kane and his lieutenant morton went in search of franklin they returned but their ship the advance did not return in sir leopold macclintock discovered a document from which it appeared that no survivor remained of the erebus and terror expedition in hayes left boston in the schooner unit ed states crossed the eightyfirst parallel and re turned in without being able to advance farth er notwithstanding the heroic efforts of his com panions in captains koldewey and hegeman both germans left bremerhaven in the hansa and ger mania the hansa was crushed in the ice a little below the seventyfirst parallel and the crew had to take to their boats to reach the coast of greenland the germania was more fortunate and returned to bremerhaven but she had not been able to get higher than the seventyseventh parallel in captain hall left new york in the steam er polaris four months afterward during the ter amazing stories rible winter he died a year later the polaris caught in the floes after reaching the eightysecond parallel was crushed by the ice eighteen of her men under lieutenant tyson took refuge on an ice floe and reached the continent after long drifting about in the arctic ocean in sir george nares left portsmouth with the alert and discovery it was in his memorable arctic campaign that winter quarters were estab lished between the eightysecond and eightythird parallels and that captain markham in a dash to the northward stopped within four hundred miles of the pole no one up to then having been so near in our great citizen gordon bennett here there were three cheers given for the pro prietor of the new york herald fitted out the jeanette which he confided to cap tain de long the jeanette left san francisco with thirtythree men passed through behring straits was caught by the ice at herald island and sank at bennett island near the seventyseventh parallel the men had only one resource to make southward with the boats or journey over the icefields misery decimated them de long died in october many others succumbed and twelve only returned from the expedition in lieutenant greely left st johns new foundland in the steamer proteus to establish a station on lady franklin bay a little below the eightysecond degree there he founded fort con ger whence he sent out expeditions west and north one of which under lieutenant lockwood and his companion brainard in may claims to have reached being fifteen miles nearer than markhams farthest that is the nearest yet ob tained it is the ultima thule of circumpolar car tography here there were loud cheers in honor of the am erican discoverers but said barbicane the expedition ended in disaster the proteus sank eightyfour men were left in frightful misery doctor pavy died greely was discovered by the thetis in with only six companions and one of these was lieutenant lock wood who soon succumbed adding another name to the sorrowful martyrology of arctic exploration there was respectful silence while barbicane paused then in a thrilling voice he resumed and so in spite of devotion and courage unparal leled the eightyfourth degree has never been passed and we may even assert that it never will be by means of ships or sledges it is not given to man to face such dangers and support such extremes of temperature it is by other means we must ad vance to the conquest of the pole from the subdued murmur of the audience it was evident that therein lay the interest of the commu nication what was this secret and how are you going to capture it asked the canadian before ten minutes are up you will know sir replied barbicane and in addressing the sharehold ers generally i say have confidence in us for the promoters of the affair are the same men who em barked in the cylindroconical the cylindroconical interrupted todrin dared to venture to the moon and have come back as we see added todrin not without signs of disapproval yes continued barbicane within the next ten minutes you will know what we propose a murmur of oh and eh and ah rose in answer to the reply it seemed as though the orator had said within the next ten minutes we shall be at the pole he continued and now is it a continent at the pole is it not a sea such as sir george nares called the palagocrystic sea the sea of ancient ice to that i say we do not think so that is not good enough said baldenak it is not a question of not thinking so but of being cer tain is there a virgin continent at the pole r any abruptness in my manner at our last interview i express my regret and so the meeting broke up chapter xvii professor rudges ultimatum through the action of admiral benson captain evered was not present at the meet ing to hear professor rudge who had desired his presence so that he might be there to answer questions on matters of fact within his knowledge his absence made no difference however as the need of additional testimony was not felt by any one as soon as the meeting was over professor rudge joined mr mansfield and spoke of the position of captain evered what he added is now going to be done station x a courtmartial said mansfield you must see that is inevitable benson wants his head on a charger at once i am afraid his connection with the service is over if he is put on halfpay he will be extremely lucky of course said professor rudge you will readily understand that holding the opinion i do i wish to save captain evered from what must appear to me an act of great injustice so far from thinking him worthy of punishment i am convinced that his action alone saved the situation in so far as it has been saved and but for him we should not be here now of course i quite see that said mr mansfield if after hearing me said rudge you now hold my views you must feel the same whether that is the case or not i do not ask but i do ask you as first lord to stop this courtmartial at least for the present you see said mr mansfield there are regular rules for all such cases my connection with either of the services is short and i know very little of such procedures of course i can see that evereds breach is glaring and then benson is such an un pleasant man to interfere with but if it were amatter of policy that said mr mansfield would be a different matter then bensons wishes could be set aside a decision is imperative tcttstell said rudge i consider it is my v v statement is now before you and the other members of the government and a decision on it one way or the other must be come to without delay is it policy to hold a courtmartial on evered while the question whether his action was necessary or not is sub judice and remember that the govern ment decision is not the final decision that time alone will showshow very soon i greatly fear what i ask therefore is that the courtmartial should be held over and evereds services retained until his judges will have solid grounds for their decision there is great point to your argument cer tainly said mr mansfield in a hesitating way put it before lord saxville said professor rudge and say that it is my earnest request say that evered acted under my advice and that i will stop at nothing to defend him be sure you say that mansfield was somewhat behind the scenes he smiled and promised captain evered of the sagitta as a result captain evered was placed under open arrest retaining for the time his post on the sagitta the members of the government evidently held a private meeting after hearing professor rudge for before the day was out each of the scientists received a request to draw up as soon as possible the following morning was suggesteda written statement of his opinion on the subject of pofessor rudges statement the scientists also had their meeting the result of which was that one gave it as his opinion that professor rudge was deluded in some way not clear admitting that it had been in circumstances and through a curious sequence of events that almost excused him one declined to express an opinion one way or the other untilthe present state of the radio or rather the cause of it had been solved giving it as his opinion that if professor rudge was correct the clamour on the radio would be found connected with it and therefore that the first thing to do before accepting hypotheses as facts was to solve that mystery the other four and they were those who were distinguished for common serse as well as science considered that professor rudge had made out a sufficient ease to justify the government in taking instant action as though its truth were incontest able their argument was that absolute proof as the phrase is used in science was not necessary to their conclusion for when so much was at stake action for safety was clearly indicated after his efforts professor rudge went home feeling the inevitable reaction every bodily com fort that affection could suggest was lavished upon him but he wanted something more it was one of those times when even the stoutest and most self reliant natures feel the need of some sympathetic soul that can understand and encourage he knew of none the secrecy imposed on him seemed in itself sufficient to preclude any idea of a confidant perhaps it was that thought that brought to his mind one who already knew much of the matter and who could ceitainly be trusted with the remaindermay treherne tomorrow she would be under his roof the thought somehow cheered and comforted him he felt it would be good to have some one not alone for the purpose of relieving him of much clerical work but to whom he could talk on matters about which to others his lips were sealed feeling relieved his courage reasserted itself and he went to his laboratory an idea had occurred to him he had a small radio installation at his house for experimental purposes and at this with receivers on he sat and listened the radio storm was still going on as unintelligible as ever it seemed nevertheless to have a new interest for him the investigation he was engaged on lasted for many hours it was almost dawn when he ultimately retired and his first act on waking was to return to his laboratory at length he seemed satisfied in the morning the prime minister and his col leagues had the six reports before them and a very short interchange of views showed lord saxville that there would be trouble from the divergence of views within the cabinet partly because he could not but be influenced by the majority of the reports and no doubt partly because he saw the party danger of delay he decided that the matter should be promptly dealt with he asked the more import ant members to meet him at the admiralty in two hours time for a further talk with professor rudge and the other six scientists amazing stories views of the scientists at this meeting lord saxville himself opened the proceedings gentlemen he said addressing himself directly to professor rudge and his confreres since we met yesterday we have received the reports you have sent us on the martian danger one of you declines to accept it professor stenham of oxford wants further evidence on a certain point that he thinks has relation to it but the other four strongly ad vise immediate action on such evidence as we already possess in face of such a majority to remain in active is impossible the primary purpose of this meeting is there fore not to decide if we shall act but to receive your advice as to what course that action should take it is not an ordinary matter and for its efficient handling it is evident that the most upto date knowledge on subjects which active politicians have i fear little time to study is indispensable i may doubtless take it that action means taking measures for the destruction of a being now on the island known as station x the destruction of a man on that island or any number of men would be a simple matter but the kernel of the whole affair before us is the as sertion of professor rudge that this being is not a man he tells us he is a martian and informs us that his powers are so vastly superhuman that a single error in our measures would inevitably be fatal and that every hours delay is dangerous tell us then gentlemen before we go further what on the supposition that professor rudge is right are the measures you advise saxville whispered the home secretary and wouldbe prime minister to the colleague sitting next him is supposed to be addressing himself solely to the scientists but you will notice how adroitly he is endeavouring to force our hands with his primary purpose of this meeting like mans field he is getting under the influence of this rudge perhaps rudge is himself the martian laughed the other gad said the home secretary it looks like it meanwhile professor rudge had begun to speak of the reports to which lord saxville has al luded it is an immense relief to me to find that four are everything i could ask and that it is in tended to act in accordance with them i now wish to refer to one of the other reports that of my friend professor stenham because the point it raises is a very reasonable one and because i believe i have found the answer to it he refers to the present interruption to radio communica tion it was a very shrewd suggestion that this was related to the martian invasion and it struck me so yesterday i have spent the night on it i have an instrument in my laboratory of my own invention which i had intended to hand to the world at the next meeting of the royal society with this it is an easy matter to detect at any moment the direction and length of the hertzian waves on which wireless depends i have spent over twelve hours in taking ob servations and my first showed that all the etheric waves came from the same direction i had anti cipated that having the idea that they perhaps came from station x but an observation taken one hour later showed that they all came from a new direction this seemed inexplicable for cer tainly station x had not moved every succeeding observation showed further divergence at the end of twelve hours their direction was exactly op posite to when i started venus in aries nphat gave me the clue following it i soon a found that although the line of direction made a constantly changing angle with the horizon it pointed to a fixed point in space the point is in aries i need not remind my conf reres here that at present venus is in aries the politicians present did not seem at once to see the drift of this but among the scientists there was a sudden movement of the keenest interest mcfaden banged his right fist into his left palm ma conscience hes got it he cried may i said lord saxville with a smile ask what it is that professor rudge has got the explanation said professor rudge is that the venerians are undoubtedly making this etheric disturbance i am the only man now on earth rendered capable of hearing their voices by the wonderful rapport they can establish and for that a station x installation would be required but they have found a means of hurling into space this con tinuous blast of etheric impulses they are of every possible wavelength that can give rise to sound in our instruments hence the impossibility of our radio stations intercommunicating what is their motive said lord saxville in my opinion said rudge it clearly indicates that the venerians have seen either that the martian is reconstructing or has reconstructed the instal lation of station x or that he has escaped or will escape from the island they are doing this to pre vent his communicating with mars or with ourselves by radio so that we may for a longer time have him alone to deal with and a better chance of victory in consequence that said mcfaden is so professor stenham rose and said in face of this discovery i desire my report to be amended to concur with those of my four friends the sixth man looked at the home secretary he appeared unhappy but did not speak what sir john sarkby really thought about the matter was only known to himself but his actions proved him determined to work solely for the furtherance of his personal ends with the powerful alliance of the learned pro fessors celestial friends he said quietly we shall now have ample time to consider our measures personally i very much deprecate any precipitate action we can discuss that said lord saxville after this meeting so far as deciding on a definite line of action is concerned said professor rudge your decision gentlemen i fear must be taken now lord saxville knit his brows i object said sir john sarkby to the use ol station x the word must from any man holding no office whatever professor rudges must tt is not i said professor rudge it is the a emergency that imposes the must that is for the government to judge it is but slightly altering lord saxvilles own words said professor rudge if i say it is rather in this instance for science to judge and for the government to act and if our action said the home secretary does not meet with your full approval if your decision does not meet with the full ap proval of myself and my colleagues said rudge in firm and level tones and if that decision is not taken now my measures are already complete for the whole matter before this day is out to be laid as fully before the french german italian united states and japanese governments as it is now be fore yourselves and at the same time he con tinued looking straight at the prime minister in the fullest detail given to the press of the world lord saxville knew that professor rudge was in a position to carry out his threat he had been informed that he was a wealthy man and was spending money freely that since he had landed there were constant emissaries between him and paris there was also a frequent exchange of code telegrams sir john sarkbys obvious desire was to sow dis sension among the cabinet in order to serve the ends he had in view lord saxville was already half convinced that professor rudge was right he knew also that there was a section of the cabinet headed by the home secretary that did not share this view the situa tion was full of difficulties and potential compli cations it was agreed that instructions should be given the admiralty to detach a portion of the china fleet for the purpose of reinforcing the sea lion and effectually surrounding and preventing intercourse with station x and with the use of observation balloons and aeroplanes destroying by bombard ment from a distance any one visible on the island these vessels were to remain at their posts until the arrival of professor rudge and then to be guided by his advice and direction these directions were given as soon as the meet ing was over and professor rudge was satisfied that all that could be done at the moment had been done immediately after the meeting the home secre tary buttonholed mr mansfield as the man respon sible for movements of the fleet to feel his way with him but found that the first lord was solid for the prime minister he then got together the other members of the goverment that were of his cabal with admiral benson and the one objector among the scientists a man who was selling his conscience and prosti tuting his knowledge and they held a consultation among themselves while they professed not to believe in the martian they were more than willing to make use of him for the purpose of the political rearrangement they desired several schemes for doing so were brought for ward and debated but the one finally adopted was startling in its boldness let us said the home secretary take rudge at his word and show him that things will not pan out as he thinks he will be on the high seas and we shall have a clear field let us without our selves appearing see to it that the press get hold of the story and that through it the public get it in its most ludicrous aspects in this way it will be possible to smother the whole thing saxville in cluded with ridicule once convinced that professor rudge might well be right lord saxville decided to let him have his own way miss rudge approves the sagitta with captain evered still in com mand was to take professor rudge back to station x for what he supposed was going to be his second and final round with his deadly foe it was sufficiently evident that no court could now punish captain evered for having done what a fleet was being despatched to do over again if necessary he was released from open arrest to the scandal of admiral benson furthermore captain evered was made commodore in command of the operations against the martian on returning to his home professor rudge found that may treherne had arrived for which he was thankful stanley said miss rudge dryly as he entered i approve of your taste in private secretaries and for some reason professor rudge felt himself flushing i felt sure you would he said at length she is certain to do her best and she is very capable she is very bright said miss rudge and re markably pretty i am glad to think youll get on together said rudge so am i was the response i was thinking of your future girls are very insidious i cant imagine what youre talking about was the professors response but listen i am leaving england again at once and i shall be away for a considerable time i hope youll make miss treherne feel at home here and miss rudge promised with alacrity calling may treherne into his laboratory later where he knew there could be no interruption pro fessor rudge told her what had happened she was amazed at what she heard for beyond the short cable message announcing macraes death she was ignorant of recent developments she listened with out interruption with chin on palm she sat and her eyes with dilated pupils watched the speaker as she drank in the facts tears once had to be brushed away but her attention did not wander and now miss treherne said professor rudge after he had finished i want you to take up your duties here and it will have to be in my absence you are going away at once she asked yes he said and your presence here is a great relief to me some one who will be watchful and loyal to my view may be required here while i am away i know you will do your best amazing stories i will do all i can she said and her tone carried conviction the worst part said rudge is that i have no confidence in the government and its members are divided among themselves i have spoken with pro fessor mcfaden and he and i are now absolutely at one in this affair keep in touch with him he is shrewd as well as reliable he then astonished may by telling her that was deposited in the bank in her name and handed her the checquebook spend it in this cause he said under mc fadens advice if and as required fight whoever opposes me dont let the money question bother you butmiss rudge said the woman in may my sister remains mistress of my house in that she is competent in this she would not be in the matter you deal with she would be worse than useless and fortunately she knows it let each of you keep to her own duties and all will go well may trehernes eyes shone she thought of her late position at sales ltd she was proud but a little nervous of her respon sibilities she had plenty of pluck but was glad of mcfaden as a counsellor the sagitta sailed professor rudges one prayer was that the voyage might be an uneventful one but the times were not uneventful she was not far on her course when trouble began at home thanks to selfseeking in high places this rapidly developed until it became the greatest horror of its kind that europe had ever experienced leaving details of that for the moment it may be mentioned that the first news of the panic and uproar came to the sagitta by the secret naval code while she was coaling at singapore professor rudge and the officers were horrified at the short epitome they got of events at home but while they were lamenting it a cable message from the admiral commanding on the china station was handed by captain evered the moment he had read it to professor rudge it at once drove all thoughts of what they had been speaking about out of his head it said sea lion not at station x no one apparently on island rudge went pale the paper fluttered to the deck my god evered he said we are too late chapter xviii panic when the sagitta with professor rudge on board left england it would have been dif ficult to define precisely the average opinion respecting the martian danger held by the compara tively few people who knew anything about it there were at least half a dozen who had no doubt what ever that humanity was now in the actual presence of the most awful peril that had ever threatened it these few included mcfaden and certainly two of his brother scientists there were one or two others among scientists and members of the cabinet who were sufficiently persuaded by the evidence to be anxious that every means should be employed to combat the danger among the rest opinions graduated until one came to the few who flatly denied the whole thing and while excusing their incredulity by asserting that rudge was mad were naturally too illogical to see that their solution if accepted scarcely weak ened the evidence things might have remained in that position and the public have been protected by their ignorance from the horrors that followed but for the action of certain opportunists who thought they saw a chance of personal profit the sagitta was scarcely out of the channel be fore paragraphs began to appear in the papers re specting rumours that a being from mars had ap peared on earth considerable ability was shown in making his appearance and wanderings highly ridiculous the subject lent itself well to the illustrated comic press he became a musichall gag and a subject of encore verses to popular songs have you seen the martian became a catch phrase not the slightest hint was allowed to creep into these references that politics was behind it all but the desired end was achieved all the world laughed truly all the world for the man from mars was as popular on the paris boulevards and in italy as in london in view of the more mercurial character of the people it was not surprising that the furore for the absurd martian rose to much greater heights abroad than in england no cinema programme was complete without him in some form or other this continental part had not been in the original scheme of the plotters the infection had simply crossed the channel and spread the conspirators were satisfied with the result of their plot and considered its aim achieved that end being of course to make the popular conception of the martian so completely and irretrievably ridicu lous as would make the governments action more than difficult to defend and bring it down in ruin it was therefore the time to strike and charge them with having taken the joke seriously and with the squandering of public funds over it fear following ridicule at first guarded hints appeared somewhat indefi nite but sufficient for their purpose of starting on the trail that everwakeful creature the inveter ate parliamentary sniper they had a glorious time without knowing or caring whose interests they were serving their questions became every day more and more embarrassing lord saxville suspected the source of his new trouble his instinct told him that very soon the enemys heavy batteries would be unmasked and an opportunity be asked for to discuss the charges of having moved a considerable fleet on a fantastical business instead of leaving it where it was really wanted and with blocking the wireless so as tem porarily to cover their stupidity he saw that unless something were done his down fall was certain the public was quite able to see that there must be something about which it had not been informed and lord saxville realized that it was not only necessary for his own safety to let some of the truth be known but that it was getting beyond his power to keep it back so another account of things began to get pub station x lished and the public pricked up its ears it recog nized at once a different tone in these statements the martian assumed another form no longer a myth but real another expression no longer comic but sinister and menacing but it was overdone just as the original idea to make everything ridiculous had been overdone so these later representations were deliberately de signed to throw up all in a lurid light there was little or no thought for the consequence it was simply politician against politician the result of the sudden revulsion of feeling was doubtless unforeseen and to a great extent unfore seeable the politician had saved his seat but neither attacker nor attacked had regarded the cost of their game statesmanship would have known that the actual position demanded a certain reti cence but it was bungled the demand now for full and exact information became irresistible the clamour throughout europe was not to be denied if there had been no lampooning and only the in formation necessary given with proper discretion the situation might well have remained under con trol as it was the people remembered that at the thing which now filled them with dread they had been encouraged to laugh it could not be expected that foreign govern ents would accept the martian seriously on such very questionable evidence as was yet before them so when they became aware that a considerable british fleet had been moved nobody knew where or why and that without control of the cables and the block possibly our block of the radio any thing might be happening their london embassies became busy may treherne and mcfaden feeling the need of shifting some of the re sponsibility at home and of having for the pur poses of the foreign office a more scientific ac count than it could prepare for itself lord saxville driven almost to his wits end sent a confidential messenger to professor budges house to ask who now represented him in this country the messenger was rather surprised to be re ceived by may treherne as the person he sought having learnt his errand may treherne asked if lord saxville would make an appointment to meet professor mcfaden and was told that he would be glad if the professor would call on him so soon as possible may went immediately to mcfaden and told him the prime minister wanted to see him at once why asked the professor i dont know exactly said may but it is about the martian well he said i suppose to hear is to obey will you come with me she declined the honour but you will be careful wont you professor they are so wily these politicians her anxiety lest in some way he should be over reached in downing street while acting for pro fessor rudge amused mcfaden considerably ill do my very best young lady he said i am sure you will she said professor rudge is so clever so strong so brave that any one must feel it an honour to act for him is that so said mcfaden dryly why of course it is so said may treherne with conviction for a moment she almost re pented her decision not to go too i will see you when i return said mcfaden and you shall learn what two able advocates rudge has left behind him two said may aye two said mcfaden lord saxville did not allude to foreign office difficulties to mcfaden he explained his wish that the professor should at once prepare a short treatise explaining in a scientific manner the present posi tion in respect to the martian afld dealing very fully with the evidence and above all let him have this so soon as possible he was also to embody this in articles suited to the scientific journals for the better and more gen eral information of the educated public an attempt has been made by certain people said lord saxville to misrepresent the facts and measures to correct this have followed with the re sult that the public is confused and alarmed i hope therefore you will publish the thing in a form adapted for the information of those capable of appreciating the evidence as distinguished from the ignorant and impulsive masses for these the in fluential public are also getting restive regarding neither of the accounts hitherto sent out as accept able will that asked mcfaden allay the alarm it will be for the government to deal with the symptoms of the rising panic i wish your pre sentment to convince the thinking section that the measures taken were justified and that everything necessary has been done mcfadens conviction cct doubt said mcfaden if we remain under j that impression long you think our measures inadequate i doubt said mcfaden if any measures with in our power would be adequate do you mean that this martian is going to suc ceed against a world in arms there was anxiety in lord saxvilles tone the world said mcfaden is not in arms that i am aware of after it reads my report perhaps it will consider it better that it should be you are not going to write an alarmist docu ment asked lord saxville anxiously i am going said mcfaden to write the facts unless my mind deceives me that will be a more alarmist document to the man who can think there are not manythan any or all of the cock andbull stories now current well said lord saxville extending his hand i hope you will let me have your statement as soon as possible tomorrow and that things are not quite so bad meanwhile as you fear professor mcfaden had not been slow to see that lord saxville was primarily fighting for his own hand but was also genuinely desirous of allaying the popular alarm and killing the various pernicious and exaggerated tales going about the vital and urgent business of fighting the martian had how ever retired into the background of his mind professor mcfaden was so far right the truth amazing stories had no element of reassurance or consolation in it he was a deep and clear thinker and had given time and study in visualizing the possible powers of the superman it had not left him an optimist it had not convinced him that enough was being done he kept his word to may treherne and reported his interview she discovered his doubts of success we have one element in our favour he said in that we have a good man at the helm in rudge within human limits he will not fail he seemed willing to talk for once and he had a sympathetic listener well professor mcfaden she said as he rose to go your sex i believe is inclined to deny mine reason but at least grants us instinct now your reason tells you that we are going to fail in spite of professor rudge but i have an instinct that tells me we shall win because of professor rudge well lassie he said in going then ill also be having an instinctthat if friend rudge does win yonder hell come back to meet wi another difficulty and be beaten to a frazzle as the yankee said he went away chuckling leaving may treherne with no idea of what he was talking about impending panic professor mcfadens articles appeared and their influence was marked they killed a great many wild and absurd rumours and thus did good but the people to whom they were really addressed were exasperated at having been played with and kept so long in the dark letters and articles appeared in all the big dailies wanting to know why facts had been suppressed while lampoons of so terrible a thing were being sent about why this incredible muddling etc etc the savants of the continent also did not dis semble their indignation at the way the english government had treated them and its easygoing way with the peril itself which after all was an international affair this matter they said is not a british ques tion it is a world question it is not for any one nation but for humanity to say what measures should be taken and it is urgent the daily press of every country now thoroughly informed of the facts filled its columns with details explanations political recriminations and advice pulpit and platform dealt with it and as its horror became more clearly realized its danger un derstood the world rang with it much that was written and said publicly al though true in the main part was highly injudi cious and the effect on the masses deplorable once the thing had really seized on the popular imagina ation nothing availed to stay the panic the very intangibility the ghastly character of this psychic threat so awful so imminent gripped even those whose temperament would have enabled them to meet an everyday material danger unmoved the power of this invader to seize on other per sonalities struck a note of terror that found an answering chord in minds even the most phlegmatic its effect on the nervous and hysterical was terrible all europe alarmed unfortunately among the densely ignorant peasantry of the south and east of europe there are several horrible superstitions of which the seizing and entering into possession of people by evil and unshriven spirits is a prominent part they were therefore the less inclined to wonder at or doubt this power of the martians and were ready in many cases to fight the foe with exorcising rites of the most fiendish description everywhere people began to look in the eyes even of their most intimate friends with a suspicion a question in their glance among the more super stitious section of the community if a person be haved in an aggressive nr eccentric manner his life was in peril in this connection there were daily happenings of a most deplorable natureassaults murders in order to stay the wild panic the utmost pub licity was given to the information that the danger was small because localized by the sea lion having now been reinforced by a fleet sufficient to prevent the escape of the martian from the island of station x the reassuring nature of this was qualified by the picture it drew of what must be the martians power when such measures were necessary then on the very heels of this the tidings came through that the martian had seized the sea lion and in full command of her crew had left the island for no one knew where without thought of the consequences this news was published the floodgates of panic and unreason were opened scenes were enacted that would have been almost incredible as occurring in mediseval or ancient times but which no one would have believed pos sible in ours along the east mediterranean lit toral and throughout the slavonic countries and in certain parts of southeast and eastern europe including russia itself the state of panic rose to its greatest heights here it was no longer a question of one martian but of thousandseverywhere hope of escape seemed to be relinquished the world was panicstricken people fought like cor nered animals pitched battles originating in some trifling incident no one knew what took place be tween contending mobs until streets ran blood the very scenes their own madness enacted confirmed each that he or alas she was fighting for life against martians in human form things did not come to this pass in the west of europe but in several countries it was a fact per haps not altogether to be wondered at in the at mosphere that surrounded them that the rulers as well as ruled lost their heads one thing was however settled at once without oppositionand it was the wisest decision that could have been arrived atthat there should be unity of direction in what concerned all equally and that while he was available professor rudges advice should be law mcfaden maintained an impassable exterior and tried to busy himself with other things but he knew it was a miserable failure station x may treherne and mcfaden again he the reputed misogynist fell into a habit of going round to great queen street and having a cup of tea may trehernes confidence and bright optimism comforted him it was impossible at this time to talk about any but one subject and here was the only place where he cared to talk about that if may trehernes brave spirit that shed and re fused all doubts and fears seemed good to cynical mcfaden it was still more so to miss rudge that good lady beginning by liking the girl soon passed all the stages of loving her what should i have done she said in a time like this if my brothermay god protect him had not provided me with may to cheer me she is a fine lass and sensible said mcfaden and her confidence is wonderful her confidence said miss rudge is in my brother i notice that said mcfaden dryly miss rudge caught the tone of the remark i was she said at first afraid for stanley not knowing what the girl was like and seeing that there must be about twenty years between them butnow i should think him lucky to have such a wife as may would make him may treherne would have been surprised had she heard this conversation and it would not have pleased her she believed herself now and for always true and devoted for life to the memory of her dead lover she had had little enough time to analyze her feelings and she was not introspective the truth was that her love for macrae had been half mother love she had now for the first time come into contact with a brave spirit kindred of her own she had felt the glow of its influence without comprehending if the sun shone the seed would grow her memory of the dead would not necessarily all die it would grow less a part of her life the moon shines by day but few see it chapter xix professor rudge lands at station x professor rudge at singapore recover ing from the shock he had received braced himself to meet the new situation he recog nized that it was now critical it was evident that once again the martian had taken a long stride forward moreover he had won and retained all the manifest advantages of the ini tiative he had this time left his opponents in the dark as to the exact nature of the blow he had struck or where the next might be expected i suppose there can be no doubt said captain evered that the martian is really responsible for the sea lions disappearance it is almost a certainty said rudge there was the dearest understanding with captain con nell that he should not leave the neighbourhood of the island nor communicate with it there is no doubt in my mind that it was on the latter point that the wily foe outwitted him in that case the situation we have now to deal with is a thousand times worse than if that unfortunate vessel had never been sent i fear we must reckon now with a martian in command of the sea lion the picture was sufficiently alarming and over the cable professor rudge learned of the effect of the news in europe and elsewhere it was even more terrible than he had expected the reason he was quick to appreciate was due to the public perception of the increased difficulty in dealing with the situation that had now arisen its effect from that cause was enhanced by its being universally felt that here was now an overt act that utterly removed the comforting idea that the thing might not after all be as bad as had been represented this further and conclusive proof of the reality of the danger against which they were called upon to act and the difficulty of deciding on the lines that action should take affected different statesmen in different ways the lethargic it roused to ner vous energy the naturally nervous it reduced to a state bordering on helplessness the first impulse everywhere was to get the advice of professor rudge as to the next thing to be done his reply was prompt let two of the fleet at station x remain to guard it and the remainder endeavour to get information of the direction taken by the sea lion above all every radio installation in the world must be instantly dismantled in case the venerians close their wireless barrage commodore evered agreed that by scattering news might be got from some merchant ship professor rudge found that he would have no difficulty in procuring the measures that he consid ered necessary in view of the internal state of each country apart from the danger and urgency of the thing to be dealt with no urging on his part was required professor rudge international adviser all were anxious to do everything possible in the endeavour to overcome this world menace and to seek rudges advice and assistance he could not but contrast the governments attitude now with that when he had first put the affair be fore them then he could only gain attention under threats now he was being overwhelmed with in quiries as to what should be done he was begged to remain in port so as to be in touch with the cable until everything had been arranged all foreign governments seemed to re gard him as their chief adviser as being the most likely to be able to divine the martians intentions this he utterly repudiated repeating to all that it would be absurd for any human being to pretend to be able to fathom the martians plans the thoughts of these beings he cabled to whitehall are undoubtedly so far above our reach that it is useless to make an endeavour to read their minds the only thing for us to do at pres ent is to seek the enemy in every direction to the utmost of our power and destroy him without par ley we know his object and we know his starting place the rest is surmise that is why i say we must seek in every direction it says much for the energy of the various gov amazing stories ernments that before many hours had passed vari ous units of the fleets were being despatched to their allotted stations with instructions to get in touch with each other so soon as possible to gather all information possible from merchant ships and every other source available and to use every en deavour to prevent the sea lion making any con tinental landing the burden of rudges responsibility the various fleets were allotted areas according to their position when the orders were given the japanese and british ships of the china squa dron were ordered to cover the north and asian coast line the fleets of american powers were to keep watch on the east pacific warships were rushed from the mediterranean to cover the african littoral european warships were sent some by suez some by the cape vessels of every size and accompanied with balloons and seaplanes rushed to their posts all the navies of the world were galvanized into sudden activity the unifying idea of the whole being to form as quickly as possible a vast ring enclosing as much of the paeific as possible with the object of enclosing the sea lion and finding her as soon as the plan was settled the sagitta proceeded with professor rudge on her journey to station x on hearing of the disappearance of the sea lion an idea had come to the professor and he was anxious to be at the island as soon as possible in his mind time was the essence of the thing in the conversations that took place on board he gave his views for what they were worth he was careful to explain how little their worth might be it was all hypothetical and the plans of the martian were an impenetrable mystery by some means beyond our power to guess at he said he may have got away from the island and the sea lion have gone in chase the sea lion may have been attacked and sunk and the martian and his two slaves be still in hiding on the island thirdly most dangerous and seemingly to us most probable of all the martian obtained command of the battle cruiser and has gone off in herwhere he also said that as the martians aim was to bring other martians in the same horrible way as he himself had arrived it seemed plausible to sup pose that he would desire to get where he would be safe from sea bombardment and have at com mand a sufficient population to be his slaves in the work of erecting a powerful radio station for com munication with his own world the ultimate pur pose would be to turn all into martians until an army of these existed before which anything in the nature of human opposition would be out of the question it was impossible to say if he had decided upon asia africa or america or upon any of the many large islands extending from southeastern asia he might even decide upon australia the fleets had therefore been sent to defend and cut off his access to all these coast lines would they be in time professor rudge kept as brave an exterior as he could assume but in his secret heart he was not sanguine he considered the chances were on the side of the martian stouthearted as he was he felt at times that the anxieties of the moment were too great for any mans shoulders to bear and without parallel in the worlds history in the past there had been some vital decisions when arms and valour had decided in a few hours the broad lines of history for centuries these had been such questions as to whether europe should grow into all we mean by that word a lamp by which all the world should be lit and led or be forever a mere appanage and dependency of asia never before had it been the case of a day or perhaps an hour deciding the fate of the whole human race professor rudge considered it fortunate that the large and efficient naval force of japan was prompt ly ready to reinforce our eastern squadrons as it seemed to him that china and india with their enormous populations must have great attractions for the martian once either of those countries was attained the martians victory was certain every available vessel was pressed into the ser vice even destroyers and submarines seaplanes were based in the larger warships and thus great ly extended their radius of observation suppression of private radios by the time the sagitta reached station x the combined sea and air fleets of the world had drawn a kind of cordon round a vast expanse of the pacific within which it was reasonable to suppose the sea lion existed no news had been received of her having appeared on any coast or having been sighted by any of those on the lookout for her afloat this was not conclusive that she hd not been seen for some of the ships were far from any cable station and it was strictly forbidden to carry radio in any case it would have been useless while this mysterious interruption lasted under professor rudges advice it was univer sally made a capital offence to have a radio in stalled big or little any person official or private was empowered and enjoined to shoot or in any way kill at sight any one contravening this order a large reward accompanied the rendering of this public service it was true that this order caused the deaths of many innocent people in the state of public feeling that was inevitable the danger was however so great so overwhelming that the order with all its drawbacks was considered more than justified be cause of the risk of the martian succeeding in cir cumventing the protective action of the venerians and so establishing rapport with some unfortunate operator somewhere thus nullifying all the efforts being made there was one exception to the wireless order on board the sagitta was a small installation under professor rudges own sole control this he had arranged for a purpose of his own so that it could be rendered efficient by touching a switch to the extent of just enabling him to hear the sound of the venerian interruption but nothing else in his dread of the martian he had arranged it so that should a single syllable come through the pressure of a finger would instantly cut the connection he had been busy during the voyage over this installation its beginning dating from when the station x news had been received that the sea lion had dis appeared an idea had come into his head that he spoke of to no one until station x was reached as the sagitta approached the island he had more than once put his ears to the receivers for a moment the gabble of the interruption he found still going on part of the sagittas new equipment for this voy age was a captive balloon of the long or observation type when only a couple of miles from the island professor rudge asked commodore evered not to approach nearer but to steam slowly round it he himself went to his radio and listened the inter ruption continued he listened will they invite me to land he thought it was what he had come for he was convinced the venerians were the cause of this etheric disturbance and that it was done on our behalf neither had he any doubt that the present position of the sagitta was being closely observed suddenly the interruption ceased hope once more lit the features that had lately grown so hag gard confidence returned the cessation of sound could be no coincidence northe thought crept in a martian trick the ether once more open he went on deck and found that under com modore evereds direction the gas cylinder had been brought out and the balloon was being in flated a keeneyed young officer volunteered to man it and with balloon aloft at a sufficient height to com mand the whole island the sagitta again steamed round it as soon as the balloon was hauled down the observer reported i cannot see any one on the island he said nor any obvious hidingplace but the rough sur face of the ground would make it possible for any one to hide without danger of being discovered the shell holes caused by the bombardment are quite visible the station buildings have not been re elected there appears to have been no attempt in that direction there has been something done to the installation though a lot of poles have been erected and the wiring looks quite in order it might now be a perfectly going concern for any thing one can see to the contrary the pleased look on professor rudges face still further increased he even rubbed his hands commodore he said i want you now to load and train your guns forward and steam slowly to within half a mile of the shore instruct your gun ners to fire at anything that moves also post some snipers in the fighting top i dont think we shall see anyone the island is i believe abandoned but we must reduce all risks to a minimum the sagitta slowly advanced there was an acute tension on board officers and crew knew that all the world was in uproar that mankind felt itself trembling on an insecure foothold on the brink of a bottomless abyss of ruin they knew that ahead of the sagitta behind the fringe of cliff lay the source and centreor what had recently been the centreof the terror when about half a mile distant the sagittas en gines were stopped it was evident to all that some thing had inspired the professor with confidence he was slightly flushed as he turned to the com modore evered he said i have something to tell you of the greatest importance unless my reading of it is completely wrong he drew him aside to where they could not be overheard while we were at singapore and the news that station x was apparently deserted was brought to us i wondered how this might affect the radio in terruption by the venerians that is why i rigged up this installation i knew that in the present relative position of the planets all our movements were being closely watched by our powerful allies their having started their radio interference im plied that the martian was refitting the wireless at station x would they continue their block if it should be true that the station was deserted and before any other should be erected if i approached the island in the absence of poor macrae i am now the only one with whom they can communicate would they if possible do so as we steamed round the island i awaited a sign that our position was noted and an encouragement to proceed they must be all aware of the dread we should have in doing so they look upon us as anything but a courageous race to put the matter to the final test i requested you to ap proach the island as though to land my hope is fulfilled the interruption is silent at this moment there is nothing to interfere with radio communication commodore evered appreciated the significance of this professor rudge a hero ccneeling went on the professor that the t need might arise i have written the fullest advice for the future under different contingencies so far as i can see them you will find this in my cabin addressed to you but youre not going to leave us said evered t am now going to land on the island was the reply to communicate if all goes well with the venerians tut that will not take long will it asked the commodore the conversation said professor rudge will i think for a good reason be short but i shall be permanently lost to you lost to ua was the surprised reply how lost to us please give the order was the quiet rejoinder time presses have a boat loaded with provisions sufficient for a month or two with a tent and camp bed food and water of course while this is be ing done i will explain to you my reading of the situation it is essential that we do not lose time the commodore looked at the professor for a second or two in surprise although he could not understand the drift of them he gave the neces sary orders professor rudge continued his explanation i land he said in the one hope of getting into communication once more with the venerian if i have read the signs correctly i shall do so if i amazing stories am wrong which well may be i shall he pausedbecome as macrae has become if this is some risky service then i insist on going said commodore evered larch can take my place there is nobody to take yours thats impossible said professor rudge as you would not be able to speak with the venerian then at least i can come and assist you no evered i thank you heartily but it would be the useless risk of a valuable life i must go alone but it beats me why you cannot get your con versation over while we wait for you and let us take you back that said professor rudge is the most im possible thing of all if the island is deserted and the installation in order or so that i can quickly put it so i shall have a communication to make you that i hope will save the present desperate situa tion for i confess although every one is now do ing his best i had very little hope our chances in consequence of the long start of the sea lion seemed very small if the island is not deserted and tell you it is quite possible then i shall meet the martian which happens may not be apparent to you therefore after i have landed you must not allow me to return or approach the sagitta any more than you would if you knew me to be the martian i shall take a line with me and if all goes well i shall fasten a bottle containing a note to the end of it in this there will be a place mentioned it will be where the martian is go there immediately with all the most powerful war vessels you can col lect en route see that you have more than ample force to deal with several sea lions let nothing escape sink burn and destroy all you find let no living creature evade destruction under any plea or pretence impress it on all it will be the one chance given us remember the stake evered i have not time to say more re member that if ever the moment comes of which i speak as god grant it may everything we hold dear in a fuller sense than ever the words were used before everything depends on your ruthless ness and thoroughness professor rudge was satisfied with the expression he saw on the commodores face and with the knowledge he had of his character and now he said in less forceful tones to the thing immediately before us remember if all goes well i shall not ask to be taken on board again dis regard any message of the kind i may send you or any wile of mine with that end in view if there is any advice or instruction contained in my note be yond the mention of a place probably indicated by latitude and longitude do not act on it remem ber also that the place i mention may be fraudu lent if so it will for a time weaken our total force by a few vessels but that risk is worth taking that is all and i see my boat is ready marooned on the island the professor went below for a few moments during which he wrecked his radio commodore evered as he shook hands with him said and they said professor that the human race lacked courage they said it to you they must be a peculiar people these venerian friends of ours professor rudge only smiled in answer the goodbye and good luck was soon spoken and the selfmarooned man pushed off alone with his laden boat they watched him land fasten his boat and scale the cliff in another second he was lost to view behind it chapter xx the fleet assembles for a few seconds the commodore gazed at the spot on the cliff where professor rudge had disappeared that he said is the real thing when he had scaled the steep cliff and lost sight of the sagitta and of the sea as he walked down the gentle incline of the island professor rudge was afraid he did not know who or what might be watch ing him like a spider watching an approaching fly he knew that somewhere in the world there was a mighty embodied spirit of evil not human vastly superhuman one whose dominant gaze he would be unable to meet in whose graspnot physical but spiritualhis spirit would be powerless a mere wisp of thistledown to be caught up hurled aside at that beings pleasure not knowing what any moment might produce he walked straight on a shiver ran along his spine causing his scalp to tingle he was in the presence or neighborhood of the uncanny still he walked straight on what he saw on the island tie little scene before him was very familiar one accustomed object was missingthe wooden bungalow some small fragments of it were scattered about but all else every other detail that met his eyes was subsidiary to the answer they received to the great question that had been worrying himthe radio a glance showed that it had been reerected the conclusion that it would be there he had ar rived at by deduction his coming to the island at all was the result of that reasoning the deduction simplicity itself but like many other simple pro cesses requiring the one man his argument was the martian is at station x the venerians are blocking the radio therefore there is again wire less at station x the labor for three pairs of hands must have been enormous almost unthinkable there must have been a powerful motive he could guess that motive poor wretches of the sea lion he noticed that very little of the wood of the bungalow now existed as he strode forward he wondered what had become of it fuel for some chemical work or to produce tantalum from some mineral for tube filaments the thought of tanta lum reminded him of the missing vacuum tubes he saw the system was different but he was con fident no mere vacuum tubes could be made to do his work certainly the effort to solve this was not essen station x tial at the moment indirectly it was beneficial as it diverted his thoughts on arriving at the spot where the radio operators seat and fittings had been and in other form still were he noticed near him a large tank filled with viscous fluid divided into small compartments he tested these fluids with finger and tongue some strongly alkaline the base soda others corrosively acid chlorine the active agent so that was how it had been done a martian battery there was a generator also a mystery totally unlike any machine of the kind he had ever seen here is a rich harvest thought the scientist if only we come through effective through the incautious movement of a finger in attaching the storage tank he very nearly received a charge that would have ended his life in a moment in the smallest possible space of time professor rudge had sufficiently mastered the arrangement put the receivers over his ears the great moment had arrived a violent shudder shook him from head to foot yet he did not now consciouslv feel fear although he noticed that his hand trembled as he opened his mouth to urter the wellknown call an involuntary glance round was taken somewhere in his brain sethizg seemed to say although in many details quite revel to him and heaven shield me from an answer at my elbow i the venerian to the rescue cc a re you there he said professor rudge had informed himself as to the exact positions of both venus and mars the former was approaching superior conjunction but still making a considerable angle with the sun her distance measured in etheric wave terms was six minutes mars was coming near although a long way from direct opposition one result of these relative positions was that the dark or night side of the earth was turned to mars the bright or day side to venus rudge saw that there might be an advantage in our doings being visible from the latter but not by our enemies the quickest answer he could receive to his call was in twelve minutes the earliest answer from mars would take more than double that but that did not affect him as he was not in the necessary rap port with any martian for a call from that distance to reach him but he knew that if the martian now somewhere on earth had his instrument ready his call might come through at any moment it was under such terrifying conditions that he prepared to keep his ears to the receivers twelve minutes with what fortitude he could but he had reckoned without the venerian when he had been waiting six minutes a voice came through the voicehow well he knew those silver tonesnever did voice sound so much like heavenly music as did this to professor rudge at the first sound of it he realized that he must have been closely observed his call had been awaited it said we have seen you come to the island with pleasure professor rudge it was well thought of and bravely done and gives your race still a chance when nothing else could first the present position the sea lion came within three miles of the island and the martian doubtless swam to her at night for we saw next morning that he was in command of her we have been erecting a plant for the emission of inter ference waves but it was not finished in time to prevent the horrible occurrence of that day this interference emission is not under sufficient control to be made a means of communication it can only prevent communication the sea lions crew are nearly all martians we blocked the communication before their evil work was quite completed for once they were taken by surprise finding what we were doing they evidently at once decided to begin elsewhere the erection of an installation that would overpower any attempt on our part to interfere we do not know what form this can take but know the martians well enough to be sure they will succeed evidently it requires connected positions further apart than is possible at station x they have consequently left on the sea lion for the larger is land at longitude latitude north write that at once longitude n lat they are now there erecting their plant if they finish it before they are interfered with the world is theirs and now secondly what you must do is to col lect with all speed at least ten times greater fight ing strength and go to the place named there must be no near approach to the sea lion nor to any martian by bombardment at greatest dis tance practicable destroy first the installation then all life on ship and island man and martian your fate depends on two thingsarriving at the place in time and the complete destruction of every living creature go at once if all goes well we can converse later you may lose by one day one minute even that is all the last word had scarcely been spoken when the jangle of the interference recommenced pro fessor rudge had no doubt that his return to the boat would be taken as sufficient sign that he had heard and understood and that if he remained a further opportunity would be given him that being unnecessary he put off the receivers and ran for the shore hope lent youth to his feet and thrilled every nerve the tremendous reaction he felt was the measure of his late depression he felt that this last chance had not been given to lose now there must not be a moments slack ening he did not forget that on every previous occasion every time of crisis the martian had not only extricated himself but had gained something there was no room for him to gain anything more unless the earth were to lose all man had his back to the wall arrived by his boat he wrote the venerians own words from memory they had burnt themselves into his mind he had made only one note the latitude and longitude of the island this he care fully copied alone at station x the paper was put into the bottle and flung in to the sea the halfmile of line was pulled in with his field glasses the professor watched the commodore read the note amazing stories i will judge by his promptness now he thought in ten seconds the screws were revolving he smiled it was a good omen a distant hand wave and the sagitta was on her course professor rudge saw her signal to the two other cruisers and saw them start in the same di rection the lonely watcher scaled the cliff again and watched them till they were mere specks on the horizon another minute and those too had dis appeared professor rudge would have given anything he possessed to be on board the sagitta he had seen no other way without undue risk but it was a hard fate that had kept him from the final scene and parted him from his companions he saw a long and anxious time ahead of him and considered the best medicine would be preoccupa tion he turned to the work of getting all his stores on the island and his tent pitched with muscles of iron and the agility of youth it did not mean so much as it would to most men over forty so well did his natural bent and the habit of many years serve him that his last thought that night was what a storehouse of science the work of the martian had now left to his investigation on board the sagitta commodore evered re received the bottle that was hauled aboard with eager hands and did not stop to draw the cork in two seconds he was devouring the contents his spirits bounded as he read the last word his hand was on the indicatorfull speed ahead now he said we have them signal the cruisers to keep company set a course to the iwnw then he turned and waved his farewell his one regret being the leaving of professor rudge be hind he did not require a chart to tell him that the place mentioned as the position of the sea lion was due north of him as the longitude given was practically the same as that of station x he guessed the place must be one of the rat islands of the aleutian group but found it was just south of them his plan was made with the promptness charac teristic of him to make at the sagittas best speed for japan knowing he would be sure to pick up her fleet en route to cable from japan for the fleet guarding the north american coast to join them with the utmost despatch at long lat n and then with the united fleets steam north together and attack the martians it would be the quickest way of assembling for the attack the greatest number of units available it would take a little longer than going straight from station x but that would be to go with a weak force he remembered rudges earnest admonition not to underrate his enemy of all enemies to underrate the martians was surely the last in any case he considered himself bound to re port at once and state the plan he was acting under pending orders while still a considerable distance from land about e long he encountered a japanese cruiser a unit of the fleet now guarding her eastern coasts he reported the facts to her commander and instructed him to inform the fleet with the utmost despatch and convey his orders that as many as possible should proceed to long lat while he went on to tokyo for the purpose of getting to the cable thus the world became aware of the result of the sagittas visit to station x the salutary ef fect was tremendous it calmed the overstrained nerves of humanity and greatly lessened the re sulting tumult the commodores plan was confirmed and all the warships then available in the north pacific were ordered to the rendezvous and to place themselves under his orders these included units of british united states russian and japanese nationality which the last named made the most powerful con tribution chapter xxi k battle of giants two days after the marooning of professor rudge and while he was engaged on his in vestigation of the martians work at station x he was astonished to hear the hum of an aero planes engines looking up he saw a seaplane fly ing toward the island in fact already over the cliff its observer had evidently already seen him for the machine was coming straight in his direc tion rudge watched to see the landing wonder ing how this was going to be effected on so rock strewn a surface the pilot seemed himself to have some doubts for he recrossed the cliff and pro ceeded to land on the narrow strip of sand between cliff and sea the pilot met the professor on the top of the cliff and saluting stiffly apologized if he were in truding and announced himself as an officer of the german air force attached to the cruiser visible from where they were standing about two miles from the island he explained that the use of the island being now no longer a secret the cruiser had been sent to pay it a visit and see if it could be of any use against the common enemy the reason given was so out of harmony with the situation at the moment that professor rudge at once rightly gauged it as a prying expedition your visit he said mentioning who he was then the best known name in all the world and im mediately obtaining another salute could scarcely in any circumstances have been of any use but might easily have been very disastrous as it is it can do no harm and i would like to go on board your cruiser to speak with the captain the airman turned facing the cruiser and began swinging his arms spelling out the request in two minutes a boat was lowered and after more salut ings carried professor rudge on board here there were further salutings until professor rudge began to wonder if they resulted in unusual mus cular development among germans of the military and aerial caste in his conversation with the captain of the cruis station x er he did not scruple to say that the visit showed a complete want of understanding of the character and powers of the martian he explained his own presence on the island gave the information of the augmented force of the enemy and their present whereabouts and the fight planned to take place there for their extermination into the doubts and queries that had caused this cruiser to be sent to station x there is no need to enter the report of the airman and professor rudges words appeared to have settled them the captain expressed his willingness to accom modate professor rudge on board and needed no pressing to steam at once for the island where the worlds fate would be decided this was all the professor wanted and more than he had dreamed of occurring he could almost forgive the real na ture of the visit in his joy at getting passage to where he wished to be he would not hear of going ashore again for his kit and with nothing but what he stood up in the vessel started professor rudge soon noticed that her speed was far less than that of the sagitta miles north of station x meanwhile miles to the north of sta tion x a fleet of fourteen war vessels rang ing from battleships to small cruisers was assem bling commodore evered found that starting with this force would save him a day and it seemed far more than sufficient against one battle cruiser for it included three battleships two battlecruisers six cruisers of powerful armament besides three smaller vessels it would also be followed in twentyfour hours by a considerable augmentation the commodore decided to remain on the sagitta his reasons were her speed and because in the novel nature of the coming contest he did not know what unprecedented service might be called for and he knew his crew and his ship and could depend on both there was none among the civilized nations ig norant of the martian and the danger he repre sented none the less there was surprise even among the officers of the fleet at the rendezvous on account of the size of the force assembled against so small a foe they were able to gauge only the material danger the force against them was the battle cruiser sea lion and to their minds that alone counted as soon as the fleet was assembled the com modore made the signal captains repair on board he explained his plans and handed to each a copy of his detailed general instructions so soon as all were again on their respective ships he made the signal to start for the martians island then about ten hours steaming for the saggita to the north it was then four bells in the morning watch in the afternoon of the same day a little after three bells the island was raised and the commo dore sent up a couple of seaplanes to reconnoitre but with strict orders not to approach nearer than four miles it was a good day for observation a clear sky and atmosphere no wind and a sea with out a ripple the observers reported that the sea lion was visible and that many people were scattered about the place working at something apparently con nected with a radio installation already existing one reason for the choice of this island by the martians was at once apparent in its peculiar shape and contour which the naval chart did not fully indicate it was seen to be a mountainous ridge of almost bare precipitous rock four miles long running in an east and west direction but somewhat curved the convex side to the north at its highest point it rose nearly a thousand feet above sealevel this was about a mile from its eastern end where it had nearly a mile in width and from which point a branch or offset divided from the island and ran in a westerly direction leaving a channel of several hundred yards in width and of considerable depth between it and the main part of the island this spur had little width but precipitous sides both inside and out and a razorlike edge at its summit something after the style of the needles but much longer than either of them it was in the inlet so formed that the sea lion was lying invisible except by aeroplane and im mune from direct bombardment the commodore placed his ships so as to encircle the island at a distance of five or six miles with intervals of something over two miles between each two he placed the sagitta due south and the place of each of the others was duly set out in the instruc tions west of the sagitta were two other cruis ers nos and facing the sea lion if she emerged from the inlet was the battleship no northwest of the island were ranged cruiser no battle cruiser no and cruiser no north ward cruiser no and battle cruiser no northeast cruiser no east battleship no southeast two cruisers nos and be tween cruiser no and the sagitta was placed the battleship no a ring of ships the considerations that had decided evered in this disposition were to have a ring of ships with strength fairly distributed to meet the sea lion as she came out for he was convinced that he would be able to drive her out and so compel her in spite of her speed and in whatever direction she might make to meet the close and direct fire of at least three or four of his squadron mean while he had two powerful battleships one east and one west where from the contour of the ground they could most effectively bombard her although indirectly the positions being taken up the first order was to destroy the radio installation and any other work visible on the island whether apparently radio or not the guns of the battleships and battle cruisers gave tongue and awoke the echoes of the island and an inlet that for thousands of years had lain a placid backwater of the worlds stage it now became the centre of mans destructive forces while this was in progress the commodore was disappointed by the answer to a question he put to the seaplane observers he learned that his first idea of sinking one of his ships to block the inlet would be ineffective through the depth of water the observers reported that all on the island ap amazing stories peared to have retired to their vessel they also signalled the hits soon the wireless installation was a tangle of ruin the sea lion made no reply or movement commodore evered was satisfied so far he con sidered the rest could only be a matter of time and that time was now not of the overwhelming im portance it had been he was rather disturbed by the absence of any response from the sea lion suddenly the might of the martians was made manifest two enormous columns of water and smoke rose from where a second before cruisers and had been followed by two terrific reports both vessels were blown up at the same moment by some underwater agency and sank almost in stantly as though their bottoms had been blown out nothing had been visible above water as the the commodore now saw the task before him in its true proportions he was fighting a foe of hidden and unknown powers he remembered professor rudges warning deciding that every other consideration must give way to the most effective bombardment of the sea lion he now ordered battle cruiser no and the two cruisers nos and to join the bat tleship no west of the island at a somewhat greater distance than before and proceed with the bombardment of the enemy he placed battle cruiser no and the two cruisers nos and east of the island with the battleship no with similar instructions as the two cruisers that had been torpedoed were struck simultaneously it suggested to evered that the underwater craft got between her intended cruiser ce cruiser battle cruise battle cruiser fe cruiser jo cruiser cruiser c c battlehrpy cruiser qs battleship cruiserqjj if cruiser cruiser battleship c sagitta the commodore placed his ships so as to encircle the island at a distance of five or six miles with intervals of something over two miles between each two cause of the disaster the fact of two explosions being simultaneous precluded the idea of a mine or an accident the cause was obviously a double torpedo attack but how had they been launched and from where as the only opening to the inlet was to the south of the island the cruisers to the north had ap peared to be in a comparatively safe position the high ridge opposite them had rendered them of little use in the bombardment and it had occurred to the commodore that they might have been of more use in strengthening the line on the other three sides a thrill of excitement passed through the squad ron the martians possessed a submarine victims and discharged her weapons at the same moment in opposite directions as some protec tion again this he placed the ships in each of the two groups en echelon and all the seaplanes were instructed to keep a special lookout for submarines the other three cruisers nos and the sagitta herself he retained south of the island as some force for the purpose of interception should the sea lion emerge and until the other warships could come up under the bombardment so inaugurated the sea lion must soon have suffered heavily had time been given but that would be reckoning without the martians j station x martian submarines in a few minutes one of the seaplanes re ported that a large oval object like a gigantic turtle of an estimated length of over twenty feet was moving along the sea bottom just outside the entrance to the inlet from which it seemed to have emerged it was now making away in a ssw direction the seaplanes were ordered to attack it with bombs but before any direct hit was made it had attained water of a depth sufficient to hide it from view there was no reason to suppose that it was damaged shortly afterwards it was reported that some damage to the upper works of the sea lion had been done it could not be well ascertained if this was of a serious nature without a nearer approach but the commodore would not allow any plane to fly over the island or in its close vicinity except at a great height the martians made no use of the small guns of the warship against the aircraft nor any reply to the bombardment without aircraft to guide them a hit on the warships would have been a matter of pure chance shortly before seven oclock however there was a fresh development a spherical ball about three feet in diameter of dull smoke color rose from the sea lion perpendicularly until it was quite five hundred feet above the vessel then it moved off on a horizontal course in a westerly direction its speed both in rising ari subsequently was not that of a projectile at the commencement of its lateral course it approximated to some ten miles per hour all eyes were fixed on it what new manifestation of power did it indicate it re sembled a large darkcolored toy balloon it had one peculiarity that differentiated it from any thing of the kind that had ever been seen it was obviously not carried along by the movement of the air after the manner of a balloon it seemed to be impelled by some unseen force it moved in a pe culiar jerky and jumpy manner like the limbs of an automaton what was the force controlling it what was its sinister mission the instinctive dread of the unknown was felt by all its wobbly movement up and down and from side to side was persistent its oscillation from the direct path was sometimes several feet these movements suggested that the ball was a heavy object pursuing some definite course if this were really so the mystery was height ened as it would be acting in defiance of gravita tion professor rudge had he been present would not have been unduly surprised to learn that the martians had mastered that problem perhaps the greatest of those lying just outside the boundary of mans present knowledge all eyes were turned on this strange object in less than a minute it was noticed that its speed gradually increased the wobbling continuing when about five miles from the island its course deviated a little south of west and its speed was now three to four times its initial rate for a moment it seemed to hesitate then to make up its mind and continued its jerky course in the direction of battleship no rifles and quick firing guns were turned against it but without result it reached a point directly over the battleship suddenly it stopped as though gripped by some invisible force the antigravitational action was withdrawn and it fell as a stone on the vessels deck the result was an explosion of terrific violence the battleship was rent to fragments by some new and terrible explosive no portion of her crew was ever seen again the two nearest cruisers nos and were so seriously damaged that they had to draw out of the circling line and were with difficulty kept afloat all hands on their decks had been blown to pieces this mysterious ball had attracted every eye until it fell on this the martians had apparently counted for they seized the opportunity to get out another of the curious slowmoving submarine ob jects out of the inlet a glimpse of one just dis appearing in the depths outside was caught by an airman but too late to do anything meanwhile two more balls had risen similar in size appearance and movement to the first captain evered signalled that all ships should concentrate their fire on this menace of the air meanwhile a fourth was rising a ball only one yard in diameter high in the air constantly wobbling to at least the extent of its own diameter and proceeding with irregular curv ing and constantly increasing movement is no easy object to hit just as the last ball had finished its perpendicu lar rise it was hit and immediately exploded fragments of the outer shell rained down upon and around the island for miles some fell on the ships proving to be iron about the thickness of boiler plate the other two balls found their goals as they increased in speed and could turn in their course it became impossible to avoid them their line of mo tion could evidently be modified as desired although always in a wobbling hesitating way it suggested that there was some one somewhere handling levers that decided their course in accordance with the reports of some observer the battleship no and cruiser no were the victims their destruction was as complete as that of the first battleship commodore evered kept calm but he found him self faced with possible defeat he had lost seven ships in a few minutes what further devilish con trivances had the martians to hurl at him he breathed a sigh of relief as minute after minute passed and no more balls rose he ordered the two cruisers and the remaining battleships east to resume the bombardment of the sea lion and the great battlecruiser no west to do the same the moment after the order was given the battle ship no was struck in the same way as the first two followed a moment later by the cruiser no they settled down at once in six or seven minutes they had both disappeared the battle the situation appeared almost hopeless no more balls were rising but evered remembered that there was yet certainly one more of the sub amazing stories marine things still unused outside the island and it was obvious that it was from these that the double torpedo attacks were made his impression of the method of the double torpedo discharge was now confirmed the airmen reported that the sea lion was being repeatedly hit and that her position must be any thing but comfortable the bombardment continued from the two power ful ships that were left one east one west and evered was about to take the desperate course of ordering the smaller of the cruisers left him no to sink herself in the entrance to the inlet in the forlorn hope of imprisoning the sea lion notwith standing the report of the airmen until help should arrive but it was too late the airmen reported the sea lion moving finding that she was being badly mauled in a position where she could not make efficient reply with her own guns or considering that the havoc she had wrought outside now made her chances good she had decided to come out at the best pace at which the turn could be safely negotiated she emerged a target for those of her enemies who could now bring their direct fire to bear these were to begin with the sagitta and the two cruisers nos and of the original line realizing that when coming out he would be for the moment at a disadvantage the martian com mander had planned a diversion the third of the underwater craft now fired her torpedoes a bright object in the water was seen to flash past the sagitta and at the same moment an explosion amid ships of cruiser no almost blew that vessel out of the water she sank at once immediately on receiving news that the sea lion was coming out the commodore had signalled the battleship and battlecruiser to come up with every ounce of steam their guns were soon centered on the sea lion and as soon as the latter was clear of the turn her guns began to thunder their reply while she made a southwesterly course at her ut most speed her direction took her very near the small cruiser no and that unfortunate vessel received the full weight of the sea lions metal as she passed she was reduced to a flaming and sinking wreck the sagittas escape from the torpedo that had been aimed at her had been doubtless in conse quence of the fact that she was in the act of turning as quickly as possible to keep ahead of the sea lion in the direction she was going they were both now going southwest speed was the only thing they had in common and in which they were about equal for in size armour and gun power there was no comparison the only two ships remaining that could hope to fight the sea lion one battleship and one battle cruiser were far astern and further every minute for neither had the speed of the escaping vessel sailing a parallel course the sagitta had the sea lion astern somewhat to starboard the sagitta could have received the same treatment as the last cruiser that had gone down but the sea lion ignoring her turned her great weapons on her two formidable pursuers their smokestacks showed that stokehold and engineroom were doing their utmost their black squads were sweating at their furnaces but the fact remained that they were being left nothing short of a lucky shot could have prevented the martian from achieving his object the momentary relief that the commodore had felt when it first appeared that his enemy had no more devilish novelties to surprise him with gave way to gloom as he watched the widening distance between pursuers and pursued for a moment he saw himself a beaten man but not yet for then was the situation saved by the quality that always distinguished everedquick and fearless decision then was justified his main reason for staying on the sagitta where the disci pline of years and the thorough knowledge of his captain that each member of his crew possessed ensured that any order he gave however unprece dented or incomprehensible would be obeyed and promptly the sea lions work he decided on a desperate venture he saw that the sea lion confident that the sagitta could be blasted out of existence in two minutes at any time when her two great pursuers had been effectu ally shaken off was giving the latter her whole at tention he deflected his course slightly so as to make it converge a little on that of the sea lion we the runaway skyscraper by murriy leinster an experiment in gyrohat by t

this coupon or copy it on a sheet of paper and mail it to amaz ing stories park place new york city my name and address  introduction almost years ago in august what yji may be termed a classic hoax was perpetrat ed upon the public at that time the younger herschel the famous astronomer was at the cape of good hope south africa and the hoax described the erection of a gigantic telescope wider his aus pices powerful enough to identify the poppies which were supposed to grow upon the moon the story was accepted by thousands of people as the truth we give at the end of story quotations from news papers of the period showing that the editors of the day in many cases commented upon it as absolutely credible and authentic but it was not long beforq its true nature was ascertained and the hoax re ceived the title which it has borne ever sincethe moon hoaxit has been reprinted in extenso with comments over and over again we take pleasure in presenting our readers with the full text in august the new york sun at that time a paper of rather small circulation published a description of alleged discoveries in the moon made by moans of a gigantic telescope the article was published in daily instalments during the last week of august and excited widespread attention and for all its absurdities was accepted as literally true by a great number of people in this country the circulation of the paper at once increased it is said to some which in those days zvas a very large figure we have had in our hands the original copies of the yearold paper in which the hoax appeared a little fourpage production containing certainly a minimum of news a large percentage of adver tisements and all printed in quite small typo the successive instalments of the article began in each issue on the front page on the right with a very in conspicuous heading for the new york sun of three generations ago was quite innocent of the use of our presentday scareheads the article was written by richard adams locke a wellknown newspaper writer of those days who managed in spite of numerous blundersintentional perhaps and impossibilities given in the text to produce a wonderfully picturesque article the ft lens of the telescope required a high degree of credibility to be believed in but when we are told that achromatism was reached by running two kinds of molten glass simultaneously into the mold the absurdity is so manifest that it is a wonder that locke had dared to unite it perfectly square crystals are pronounced to be amethyst this mineral is never square but hex agonal the paper is said to have been published in a sup plement of the edinburgh journal of science which in had ceased to be issued under that name then the identification of flovers in the moon the description of the peculiar formation of the eyelids of animals there and a mass of other absurdities arc such patent impossibilities that it seems incredible that the story was believed by thousands of people but perhaps the worst detail of all is a rather involv ed attempt to describe the magnification and projection of the focal image and its illumination as if that were possible by the oxyhydrogen light which curious suggestion is supposed to have made sir david brewster leap half way to the ceiling with delight this alone should have sufficed to show the absurdity of the whole one curious thing is a coincidence which ap proaches prophesy the lens is described as twen tyfour feet inches in diameter within a few days of this writing a report has been published that a inch reflecting telescope is proposed for the mount wilson observatory a reflecting mirror a foot greater in diameter than the fictitious refract ing lens of the moon hoax another such coincidence is that the telescope had no tube and this is in line with the modern construc tion of reflecting instruments the telescope of the moon hoax as far as the somewhat confused ac count can be understood was a combined refracting and reflecting instrument the foot objective was described as a refracting lens with an average thickness of about inches the lens vjas supposed to have been cast on jan uary to have been taken out of the mold not over ten days later and to have been finished and shipped on a vessel for the cape of good hope aboxit eight months later this would have been a wonderful record for speed of production great astronomical discoveries lately made by sir john herschel lld frs etc at the cape of good hope first published in the new york sun in august and september from the supplement to the edinburgh journal of science in this unusual addition to our journal we have the happiness of making known to the british public and thence to the whole civilized world recent discoveries in astronomy which will build an im perishable monument to the age in which we live and confer upon the present generation of the hu man race a proud distinction through all future time it has been poetically said that the stars of heaven are the hereditary regalia of man as the intellectual sovereign of the animal creation he may now fold the zodiack around him with a loftier consciousness of his mental supremacy it is impossible to contemplate any great astro nomical discovery without feeling closely allied to a sensation of awe and nearly akin to those with which a departed spirit may be supposed to discover the realities of a future state bound by the irrevoca ble laws of nature to the globe on which we live creatures close shut up in infinite expanse it seems like acquiring a fearful supernatural power when any remote mysterious works of the creator amazing stories yield tribute to our curiosity it seems almost a presumptuous usurpation of powers denied us by the divine will when man in the pride and confi dence of his skill steps forth far beyond the ap parently natural boundary of his privileges and demands the secrets and familiar fellowship of other worlds we are assured that when the immor tal philosopher to whom mankind is indebted for the thrilling wonders now first made known had at length adjusted his new and stupendous apparatus with a certainty of success he solemnly paused several hours before he commenced his observations that he might prepare his own mind for discover ies which he knew would fill the minds of myriads of his fellowmen with astonishment and secure his name a bright if not transcendent conjunction with that of his venerable father to all posterity and well might he pause from the hour the first hu man pair opened their eyes to the glories of the blue firmament above them there has been no accession to human knowledge at all comparable in sublime in terest to that which he has been the honored agent in supplying and we are taught to believe that when a work already preparing for the press in which his discoveries are embodied in detail shall be laid before the public they will be found of in comparable importance to some of the grandest operations of civilized life well might he pause i he was about to become the sole depository of won drous secrcts which had been hid from the eyes of all men that had lived since the birth of time he was about to crown himself with a diadem of knowl edge which would give him a conscious pre eminence above every individual of his species who then lived or who had lived in the generations that are passed away h e paused ere he broke the seal of the casket which contained it the author begins intro ducing his characters to render our enthu siasm intelligible we will state at once that by means of a telescope of vast dimen sions and an entirely new principle the younger herschel at his observa tory in the southern hemisphere has already made the most extraordi nary discoveries in every planet of our solar sys tem has discovered planets in other solar sys tems has obtained a distinct view of objects in the moon fully equal to that which the unaided eye commands of terrestrial objects at the distance of a hundred yards has affirmatively settled the ques tion whether this satellite be inhabited and by what order of beings has firmly established a new theory of cometary phenomena and has solved or cor rected nearly every leading problem of mathemat ical astronomy for our early and almost exclusive information concerning these facts we are indebted to the devot ed friendship of dr andrew grant the pupil of the elder and for several years past the inseparable coadjutor of the younger herschel the amanuensis of the latter at the cape of good hope and the indefatigable superintendent of his telescope dur ing the whole period of its construction and opera tion dr grant has been enabled to supply us with intelligence equal in general interest at least to that which dr herschel himself has transmitted to the royal society indeed our correspondent as sures us that the voluminous documents now before a committee of that institution contain little more than details and mathematical illustrations of the facts communicated to us in his own ample corres pondence for permission to indulge his friendship in communicating this invaluable information to us dr grant and ourselves are indebted to the mag nanimity of dr herschel who far above all mer cenary considerations has thus signally honored and rewarded his fellowlaborer in the field of science the engravings of lunar animals and other objects and of the phases of the several planets are accurate copies of drawings taken in the obser vatory by herbert home esq who accompanied the last powerful series of reflectors from london to the cape and superintended their erection and he has thus recorded the proofs of their triumphant success the engravings of the belts of jupiter is a reduced copy of an imperial folio drawing by dr herschel himself and contains the results of his latest observation of that planet the segment of the inner ring of saturn is from a large drawing by dr grant we first avail ourselves of the documents which contain a description and history of the instrument by which these stupendous discoveries have been made a knowledge of one is essential to the credibility of the other the younger herschels telescope it is well known that the great refracting tele scope of the late elder herschel with an object glass four feet in diam eter and a tube forty feet in length possesses a magnifying power of more than six thousand times but a small portion of this power was ever ad vantageously applied to the nearer astronomical objects for the deficiency of light from objects so highly magnified rendered them less distinct than when viewed with a power of a third or fourth of this extent accordingly the powers which he generally applied when observing the moon or planets and with which he made his most interesting discoveries ranged from and times although when inspecting the double and treble fixed stars and the more distant nebulas he frequently applied the full capacity of his instrument the law of optics that an object becomes dim in proportion as it is magnified seem ed from its exemplification in this powerful tele scope to form an insuperable boundary to further the moon hoax published several generations ago was perhaps the greatest scientific hoax that was ever perpetrated upon a credulous public at that time when there were no cablcs and no radio and communica tion was slow it was a simple matter to spring such a hoax where today it would not last twentyfour hours because verification or denial would speedily be brought about nevertheless the author of the moon hoax wrote a charming story that will live forever in it there is ex cellent science but in many spots we believe the author purposely planted a number of obvious mistakes which should hare been spotted at once by those well versed in science of the day this however did not occur and the story was swallowed hook line and sinker see how many mistakes you can find many moon stories have been published since the moon hoax but this remains one of the finest pieces of imagination that has ever appeared rht n y sun published this article without any illustrationsed the moon hoax discoveries in our solar system several years however prior to the death of this venerable as tronomer he conceived it practicable to construct an improved series of parabolic and spherical re flectors which by uniting all the meritorious points in the gregorian and newtonian instruments with the highly interesting achromatic discovery of dol land would to a great degree remove the formid able obstruction his plan evinced the most pro found research in optical science and the most dex terous ingenuity in mechanical contrivance but accumulating in firmities and eventually death prevented its ex perimental appli cation his son the present sir john herschel who had been nursed and cradl ed in the observa tory and a prac tical astronomer from his boyhood was so fully con vinced of the value of the theory that he determined upon testhig it at whatever cost within two years of his fathers death he com pleted his new ap paratus and adapted to the old telescope with nearly perfect success he found that the magnify i n g power of times when applied to the moon which was the severest cri terion that could be selected pro duced under these new reflec tors a focal ob ject of exquisite di sti net ness free from every achromatic obscurity and con taining the highest degree of light which the great speculum could collect from that luminary the enlargement of the angle of vision which was hus acquired is ascertained by dividing the moons distance from the observatory by the magnifying rower of the instrument and the former being miles and the latter times leaves a quotient of miles as the apparent distance of that planet from the eye of the observer now it is well known that no terrestrial object can be seen at a greater distance than this with the naked eye even from the most favorable elevations the rotundity of the earth prevents a more distant view than this with the most acute natural vision and from the highest eminences and generally objects seen at this distance are themselves elevat ed on mountain ous ridges it is not pretended moreover that this forty miles telescopic view of the moon present ed its objects with equal distinct ness though it did in equal size to those of the earth so remotely stationed discussing the telescopes power he elder herschel had never theless demon strated that with a power of times he could discern objects in this satellite of not more than yards in diam eter if therefore the full capacity of the instrument had been elicited by the new ap paratus of reflec tors constructed by his son it would follow in mathemetical ra tio that objects could be discerned of not more than yards in diam eter yet in either case they would be seen as mere feeble shapeless points with no greater conspicu ity than they would exhibit up on earth to the unaided eye at the distance of forty miles but although the rotundity of the earth pre sented no obstruction to a view of these astronomic al objects we believe sir john herschel never in sisted that he had carried out these extreme powers of the telescope in so full a ratio the deficiency of light though greatly economised and concentrated still

that the story stands unique as the greatest newspaper hoax ever perpetrated amazing stories magnitude of the focal image the advance he had made in the knowledge of this planet though mag nificent and sublime was but partial and unsatis factory he was it is true enabled to confirm some discoveries of former observers and to confute those of others the existence of volcanoes dis covered by his father and by schroeter of berlin and the changes observed by the latter in the valcano in the mare crisium or lucid lake were corrobor ated and illustrated as was also the prevalence of far more extensive volcanic phenomena the dis proportionate height attributed to the lunar moun tains was corrected for careful admeasurement whilst the celebrated conical hills encircling val leys of vast diameter and surrounding the lofty central hills were distinctly perceived the forma tion which professor frauenhofer uncharitably conjectured to be a lunar fortification he ascer tained to be a tabular buttress of a remarkably pyramidical mountain lines which had been whim sically pronounced roads and canals he found to be keen ridges of singularly regular rows of hills and that which schroeter imagined to be a great city in the neighborhood of marius he determined to be a valley of disjointed rocks scattered in fragments which averaged at least a thousand yards in diam eter thus the general geography of the planet in its grand outlines of cape continent mountain ocean and island was surveyed with greater par ticularity and accuracy than by any previous observer and the striking dissimilarity of many of its local features to any existing on our own globe was clearly demonstrated celestial distances and time the best enlarged maps of that luminary which have been published were constructed from this survey and neither the as tronomer nor the public ventured to hope for any great accession to their developments the utmost power of the largest telescope in the world had been exerted in a new and felicitous manner to obtain them and there was no reasonable expectation that a larger one would ever be con structed or that it could be advantageously used if it were a law of nature and the finitude of human skill seemed united in inflexible opposition to any further improvement in telescopic science as applicable to the known planets and satellites of the solar system for unless the sun could be pre vailed upon to extend a more liberal allowance of light in these bodies and they be induced to transfer it for the generous gratification of our curiosity what adequate substitute could be obtained tele scopes do not create light they cannot even trans mit unimpaired that which they receive that any thing further could be derived from human skill in the construction of instruments the labors of his illustrious predecessors and his own left the son of herschel no reason to hope huygens fontana gregory newton hadley bird short dolland herschel and many others all practical opticians had resorted to every material in any wise adapted to the composition either of lenses or reflectors and had exhausted every law of vision which study had developed and demonstrated in the construction of his last amazing specula sir john herschel had selected the most approved amalgams that the ad vanced stage of metallic chemistry had combined and had watched their growing brightness under the hands of the artificer with more anxious hope than ever lover watched the eye of his mistress and he had nothing further to expect than they had accomplished he had the satisfaction to know that if he could leap astride a cannon ball and travel upon its wings of fury for the respectable period of several millions of years he would not obtain a more enlarged view of the distant stars than he could now possess in a few minutes of time and that it would require an ultraiailroad speed of fifty miles an hour for nearly the livelong year to secure him a more favorable inspection of the gentle luminary of night the interesting ques tion however whether this light of the solemn forest of the treeless desert and of the deep blue ocean as it rolls whether this object of the lonely turret of the uplifted eye on the deserted battle field and of all the pilgrims of love and hope of misery and despair that have journeyed over the hills and valleys of this earth through all the eras of its unwritten history to those of its present voluminous record the exciting question whether this observed of all the sons of men from the days of eden to those of edinburgh be inhabited by beings like ourselves of consciousness and cur iosity was left for solution to the benevolent index of natural analogy or to the severe tradition that it is tenanted only by the hoary solitaire whom the criminal code of the nursery had banished thither for collecting fuel on the sabbathday a curious idea in telescopic practice the limits of discovery in the planetary bodies and in this one especially thus seemed to be immutably fixed and no expectation was ele vated for a period of several years but about three years ago in the course of a conversational discus sion with sir david brewster upon the merits of some ingenious suggestions by the latter in his ar ticle on optics in the edinburgh encyclopedia p for improvements in the newtonian reflectors sir john herschel adverted to the convenient sim plicity of the old astronomical telescopes that were without tubes and the objectglass of which placed upon a high pole threw its focal image to a distance of and even feet dr brewster readily ad mitted that a tube was not necessary provided the focal image were conveyed into a dark apartment and there properly received by reflectors sir john then said that if his fathers great telescope the tube alone of which though formed of the lightest suit able materials weighed lbs possessed an easy and steady mobility with its heavy observatory at tached an observatory movable without the in cumbrance of such a tube was obviously practical this also was admitted and the conversation be came directed to that allinvincible enemythe paucity of light in powerful magnifiers after a few moments silent thought sir john diffidently inquired whether it would not be possible to effect a transfusion of artificial light through the focal object of vision sir david somewhat startled at the originality of the idea paused awhile and then hesitatingly referred to the refrangibility of rays and the angle of incidence sir john grown more confident adduced the example of the newtonian this was written in in the first days of railroadsed the moon hoax reflector in which the refrangibility was corrected by the second speculum and the angle of incidence restored by the thud and continued he why cannot the illuminated microscope say the hydro oxygen be applied to render distinct and if nec essary even to magnify the focal object sir david sprung from his chair in an ecstacy of con viction and leaping halfway to the ceiling ex claimed thou art the man each philosopher anticipated the other in presenting the prompt il lustration that if the rays of the hydrooxygen microscope passed through a drop of water contain ing the larvje of a gnat and other objects invisible to the naked eye rendered them not only keenly but firmly magnified to dimensions of many feet so could the same artificial light passed through the faintest focal object of the telescope both distinctify to coin a new word for an extraordin ary occasion and magnify its feeblest component members the only apparent desideratum was a recipient for the focal image which should transfer it without refranging it to the surface on which it was to be viewed under the revivifying light of the microscopic reflectors in the various experi ments made during the few following weeks the co operative philosophers decided that a medium of the purest plate glass which it is said they ob tained by consent be it observed from the shop window of mons desanges the jeweller to his ex majesty charles x in high street was the most eligible they could discover it answered perfectly with a telescope which magnified times and a microscope of about thrice that power the great telescope provided for financially sir john herschel then conceived the stu pendous fabric of his present telescope the power of his fathers instrument would still leave him distant from his favorite planet nearly forty miles and he resolved to attempt a greater magnifier money the wings of science as the sinews of war seemed the only requisite and even the acquisition of this which is often more difficult than the task of sisy phus he determined to achieve fully sanc tioned by the high optical authority of sir david brewster he laid his plan before the royal society and particularly directed to it the attention of his royal highness the duke of sussex the ever muni ficent patron of science and the arts it was im mediately and enthusiastically approved by the committee chosen to investigate it and the chair man who was the royal president subscribed his name for a contribution of with a promise hat he would zealously submit the proposed instru ment as a fit object for the patronage of the privy purse he did so without delay and his majesty cn being informed that the estimated expense was naively inquired if the costly instrument wonld conduce to any improvement in navigation on being informed that it undoubtedly would the ailorking promised a carte blanche for the amount nch might be required the foot lens sir john herschel had submitted his plans and calculations in adaptation to an object glass of twentyfour feet in diameter just i times the size of his venerable fathers for casting this ponderous mass he selected the large glasshouse of messrs hartly and grant the brother of our invaluable friend dr grant at dumbarton the material chosen was an amalgamation of two parts of the best crown with one flint glass the use of which in separate lenses constituted the great ach romatic discovery of dolland it had been found however by accurate experiments that the amalgam would as completely triumph over every impediment both from refrangibility and discoloration as the separate lenses five furnaces of the metal care fully collected from productions of the manufactory in both the kinds of glass and known to be respec tively of nearly perfect homogenous quality were united by one grand conductor to the mould and on the third of january the first cast was ef fected after cooling eight days the mould was opened and the glass found to be greatly flawed within eighteen inches of the centre notwith standing this failure a new glass was more care fully cast on the th of the same month which on being opened during the first week of february was found to be immaculately perfect with the exception of two slight flaws so near the line of its circumfer ence that they would be covered by the copper ring in which it was designed to be enclosed the weight of this prodigious lens was lbs or nearly seven tons after being polished and its estimated magnifying power times it was therefore presumed to be capable of representing objects in our lunar satellite of little more than eighteen inches in diameter provided its focal image of them could be rendered distinct by the transfu sion of artificial light it was not however upon the mere illuminating power of the hydrooxygen microscope as applied to the focal pictures of this lens that the younger herschel depended for the realization of his ambitious theories and hopes he calculated largely upon the almost illimitable appli cability of this instrument as a second magnifier which would supersede the use and infinitely trans cend the powers of the highest magnifiers in re flecting telescopes so sanguinely indeed did he calculate upon the advantages of this splendid alliance that he ex pressed confidence in his ultimate ability to study even the entomology of the moon in case she contained insects upon her surface having wit nessed the completion of this great lens and its safe transportation to the metropolis his next care was the construction of a suitable microscope and of the mechanical framework for the horizontal and vertical action of the whole his plans in every branch of his undertaking having been intensely studied even to their minutest details were easily and rapidly executed he awaited only the appoint ed period at which he was to convey his magnificent apparatus to its destinction the british board of longitude interested in the work a correspondence had for some time passed between the boards of england france and austria with a view to im provements in the tables of longitude in the southern hemisphere which are found to be much less accurate than those of the northern the high opinion entertained by the british board amazing stories bf longitude of the principles of the new telescope and of the profound skill of its inventor determined the government to solicit his services in observing the transit of mercury over the suns disk which will take place on the th of november in the pre sent year and which as it will occur at h m s night conjunction mean time and at h m s middle true time will be invisible to nearly all the northern hemisphere the place at which the transits of mercury and of venus have generally been observed by the astronomers of europe when occurring under these circumstances is the cape of good hope and no transit of venus having occurred since the year and none being to occur before the accurate observation of the transits of mercury which occur more frequently has been found of great importance both to as tronomy and navigation to the latter useful art indeed the transits of mercury are nearly as im portant as those of venus for although those of the latter planet have the peculiar advantage of determining exactly the great solar parallax and thence the distances of all the planets from the sun yet the transits of mercury by exactly determining the place of its own node independently of the par allax of the great orb determine the parallax of the earth and moon and are therefore especially valua ble in lunar observations of longitude the cape of good hope has been found preferable in these observations to any other station in the hemi sphere the expedition which went to peru about the middle of the last century to ascertain in con junction with another in lapland the true figure of the earth found the attraction of the mountainous regions so strong as to cause the plumbline of one of their large instruments to deflect seven or eight seconds from the true perpendicular whilst the elevated plains at the cape unite all the advantages of a lucid atmosphere with an entire freedom from mountainous obstruction sir john herschel therefore not only accepted the appointment with high satisfaction but requested that it might com mence at least a year before the period of the tran sit to afford him time to bring his ponderous and complicated machinery into perfect adjustment and to extend his knowledge of the southern constella tions his wish was immediately assented to and his arrangements being completed he sailed from london on the th of september in company with dr andrew grant lieutenant drummond of the royal engineers fras and a large party of the best english mechanics they arrived after an expeditious and agreeable passage and im mediately proceeded to transport the lens and the frame of the large observatory to its destined site which was a piece of tableland of great extent and elevation about thirtyfive miles to the northeast of capetown and which is said to be the very spot on which de la caille in constructed his in valuable solar tables when he measured a degree of the meridian and made a great advance to exactitude in computing the solar parallax from that of mars and the moon sir john accomplished the ascent to the plains by means of two relief teams of oxen of eighteen each in about four days and aided by several companies of dutch boors pro ceeded at once to the erection of his gigantic fabric a general description of ttie plant at the caps good hope the ground plan of the structure is in some respects similar to that of the herschel telescope in england except that instead of circular foundations of brick work it consists of parallel circles of rail road iron upon wooden framework so constructed that the turnouts or rather turnins from the largest circle will conduct the observatory which moves upon them to the innermost circle which is the basis of the lensworks and to each of the circles that intervene the diameter of the small est circle is twentyeight feet that of the largest our correspondent has singularly forgotten to state though it may be in some measure computed from the angle of incidence projected by the lens and the space occupied by the observatory the latter is a wooden building fifty feet square and as many high with a flat roof and gutters of thin copper through the side proximate to the lens is an aperture four feet in diameter to receive its rays and through the roof another for the same purpose in meridional observations the lens which is inclosed in a frame of wood and braced to its corners by bars of copper is suspended upon an axis between two pillars which are nearly as high as those which supported the celebrated quadrant of uleg beg being one hundred and fifty feet these are united at the top and bottom by crosspieces and strengthened by a number of diagonal braces and between them is a double capstan for hoisting the lens from its horizontal line with the observatory to the height required by its focal distance when turned to the meridian and for elevating it to any intermediate degree of altitude that may be needed this last operation is beautifully regulated by an immense double sextant which is connected and moves with the axis of the lens and is regularly divided into degrees minutes and seconds and the horizontal circles of the observatory being also divided into degrees and minutely subdivided the whole instrument has the powers and regularly of the most improved theodolite having no tube it is connected with the observatory by two horizontal levers which pass underneath the floor of that building from the circular basis of the pillars thus keeping the lens always square with the observa tory and securing to both a uniform and simple movement by means of these levers too a rack and windlass the observatory is brought to any degree of approximation to the pillars that the alti tude of an observation may require and although when at its nearest station it cannot command an observation with the great lens within about fifteen degrees of the meridian it is supplied with an excel lent telescope of vast power constructed by the elder herschel by which every high degree can be surveyed the field of view therefore whether exhibited on the floor or on the wall of the apart ment has a diameter of nearly fifty feet and being circular it has therefore an area of nearly feet the place of all the horizontal movements having been accurately levelled by lieut drum mond with the improved level of his invention which bears his name and the wheels both of the observ atory and of the lensworks being facilitated by the moon hoax frictionrollers in patent axleboxes filled with oil the strength of one man applied to the extremity of the levers is sufficient to propel the whole structure upon either of the railroad circles and that of two men applied to the windlass is fully adeauate to bring the observatory to the basis of the pillars both of these movements however are now effected by a locomotive apparatus commanded within the apartment by a single person and showing by means of an ingenious index every inch of progres sion or retrogression the preservation of secrecy we have not thus particularly described the telescope of the younger herschel because we consider it the most magnificent speci men of philosophical mechanism of the present or any previous age but because we deemed an explicit description of its principles and powers an almost indispensable introduction to a statement of the sublime expansion of human knowledge which it has achieved it was not fully completed until the latter part of december when the series of large reflectors for the microscope arrived from england and it was brought into operation during the first week of the ensuing month and year but the secrecy which had been maintained with regard to its novelty its manufacture and its destination was not less rigid ly preserved for several months respecting the grandeur of its success whether the british gov ernment were sceptical concerning the promised splendor of its discoveries or wished them to be scrupulously veiled until they had accumulated a fullorbed glory for the nation and reign in which they originated is a question which we can only conjecturally solve but certain it is that the as tronomers royal patrons enjoined a masonic taciturnity upon him and his friends until he should have officially communicated the results of his great experiment accordingly the world heard nothing of him or his expedition until it was an nounced a few months since in the scientific journals of germany that sir john herschel at the cape of good hope had written to the astronomerroyal of vienna to inform him that the portentous comet predicted for the year which was to approach so near this trembling globe that we might hear the roaring of its fires had tuined upon another scent and would not even shake a hair of its tail upon our huntinggrounds at a loss to conceive by what extra authority he had made so bold a declaration the men of science in europe who were not acquainted with the secret regarded his post ponement as his discovery was termed with in credulous contumely and continued to terrorize upon the strength of former predictions new lunar discoveries until the th of january the observations were hiefly directed to the stars in the southern signs in hich without the aid of the hydrooxygen reflec tors a countless number of new stars and nebulas ere discovered but we shall defer our corres indents account of these to future pages for the purpose of no longer withholding from our readers e more generally and highly inteiesting dis xveries which were made in the lunar world and fr this purpose too we shall defer dr grants elaborate mathematical details of the corrections which sir john herschel has made in the best tables of the moons tropical sidereal and synodic revolu tions and of those phenomena of syzygies on which a great part of the established lunar theory depends it was about halfpast nine oclock on the night of the th the moon having then advanced within four days of her mean libration that the astrono mer adjusted his instruments for the inspection of her eastern limb the whole immense power of his telescope was applied and to its focal image about one half of the power of his microscope on removing the screen of the latter the field of view was covered throughout its entire area with a beautifully distinct and even vivid representation of basaltic rock its color was a greenish brown and the width of the columns as defined by their interstices on the canvas was invariably twenty eight inches no fracture whatever appeared in the mass first presented but in a few seconds a shelv ing pile appeared of five or six columns width which showed their figure to be hexagonal and their articulations similar to those of the basaltic form ation at staffa this precipitous shelf was pro fusely covered with a dark red flower precisely similar says dr grant to the papaver rhoeas or rosepoppy of our sublunary cornfields and this was the first organic production of nature in a foreign world ever revealed to the eyes of men the rapidity of the moons ascension or rather of the earths diurnal rotation being nearly equal to five hundred yards in a second would have effectually prevented the inspection or even the discovery of objects so minute as these but for the admirable mechanism which constantly regulates under the guidance of the sextant the required altitude of the lens but its operation was found to be so consummately perfect that the observers could detain the object upon the field of view for any period they might desire the trees on the moon and the beautiful shore the specimen of lunar vegitation however which they had already seen had decided a question of too exciting an interest to induce them to retard its exist it had demonstrated that the moon has an atmosphere constituted similarly to our own and capable of sustaining organized and therefore most probably animal life the basaltic rocks continued to pass over the inclined canvas plane through three suc cessive diameters when a verdant declivity of great beauty appeared wrhich occupied two more this was preceded by another mass of nearly the former height at the base of which they were at length delighted to perceive that novelty a lunar forest the trees says dr grant for a period of ten minutes were of one unvaried kind and unlike any i have seen except the largest kind of yews in the english churchyards which they in some re spects resemble these were followed by a level green plain which as measured by the painted circle on our canvass of fortynine feet must have been more than half a mile in breadth and then appeared as fine a forest of firs unequivocal firs as i have ever seen cherished in the bosom of my native mountains wearied with the long continuance of these we greatly reduced the magnifying power of amazing stories the microscope without eclipsing either of the reflectors and immediately perceived that we had been insensibly descending as it were a moun tainous district of a highly deversified and roman tic character and that we were on the verge of a lake or inland sea but of what relative locality or extent we were yet too greatly magnified to deter mine on introducing the feeblest acromatic lens we possessed we found that the water whose boundary we had just discovered answered in gen eral outline to the mare nubium of riccoli by which we detected that instead of commencing as we supposed on the eastern longitude of the planet some delay in the elevation of the great lens had thrown us nearly upon the axis of her equator however as she was a free country and we not as yet attached to any particular province and more over since we could at any moment occupy our intended position we again slid in our magic lenses to survey the shores of the mare nubium why riccoli so termed it unless in ridicule of cleomedes i know not for fairer shores never angels coasted on a tour of pleasure a beach of brilliant white sand girt with wild castellated rocks apparently of green marble varied at chasms occurring every two or three hundred feet with grotesque blocks of chalk or gypsum and feathered and festooned at the summit with the clustering foilage of unknown trees moved along the bright wall of our apart ment until we were speechless with admiration the water wherever we obtained a view of it was nearly as blue as that of the deep ocean and broke in large white billows upon the strand the action of very high tides was quite manifest upon the face of the cliff for more than a hundred miles yet diversified as the scenery was during this and a much greater distance we perceived no trace of animal existence notwithstanding we could com mand at will a perspective or a foreground view of the whole mr holmes indeed pronounced some white objects of a circular form which we saw at some distance in the interior of a cavern to be bona fide specimens of a large cornu ammonis but to me they appeared merely large pebbles which had been chafed and rolled there by the tides our chase of animal life was not yet to be rewarded beautiful landscape view t v aving continued his close inspection near g ly two hours during which we passed over a a a wide tract of country chiefly of a rug ged and volcanic character and having seen few ad ditional varieties of vegetation except some species of lichen which grew everywhere in great abund ance dr herschel proposed that we should take out all our lenses give a rapid speed to the panor ama and search for some of the principal valleys known to astronomers as the most likely method to reward our first nights observation with the dis covery of animated beings the lenses being re moved and the effulgence of our unutterably glori ous reflectors left undiminished we found in ac cordance with our calculations that our field of view comprehended about miles of the lunar surface with the distinctiveness of outline and detail which could be procured of a terrestrial object at the dis tance of two and a half miles an optical phenom enon which you would find demonstrated in note this afforded us the best landscape views we had hitherto obtained and although the accelerated mo tion was rather too great we enjoyed them with rapture several of those famous valleys which are bounded by lofty hills of so perfectly conical a form as to rend them less like works of nature than of art passed the canvas before we had time to check their flight but presently a train of scenery met our eye of features so entirely novel that dr herschel signalled for the lowest convenient grad ation of movement it was a lofty chain of obelisk shaped or very slender pyramids standing in ir regular groups each composed of about thirty or forty spires every one of which was perfectly square and as accurately truncated as the finest specimens of cornish crystal they were of a faint lilac hue and very resplendent i now thought that we had assuredly fallen on productions of art but dr herschel shrewdly remarked that if the luna rians could build thirty or forty miles of such monuments as these we should ere now have dis covered others of a less equivocal character he pronounced them quartz formations of probably the winecolored amethyst species and promised us from these and other proofs which he had obtained of the powerful action of laws of crystallization in this planet a rich field of mineralogical study enormous amethysts n introducing a lens his conjecture was fully confirmed they were mon strous amethysts of a diluted claret color glowing in the intensest light of the sun they varied in height from sixty to ninety feet though we saw several of a still more incred ible altitude they were observed in a succession of valleys divided by longitudinal lines of round breasted hills covered with verdure and nobly un dulated but what is most remarkable the valleys which contained these stupendous crystals were invariably barren and covered with stones of a fer ruginous hue which were probably iron pyrites we found that some of these curiosities were sit uated in a district elevated half a mile above the valley of the mare fcecunditatis of mayer and ric cioli the shores of which soon hove in view but never was a name more inappropriately bestowed from dan to beersheba all was barren barren the seaboard was entirely composed of chalk and flint and not a vestige of vegetation could be dis covered with our strongest glasses the whole breadth of the northern extremity of this sea which was about three hundred miles having crossed our plane we entered upon a wild mountainous region abounding with more extensive forests of larger trees than we had before seenthe species of which i have no good analogy to describe in general con tour they resembled our forest oak but they were much more superb in foliage having broad glossy leaves like that of the laurel and tresses of yellow flowers which hung in the open glades from the branches to the ground the beautiful cataracts in the valley h hese mountains passed we arrived at a i region which filled us with utter astonish j ment it was an oval valley surrounded except at a narrow opening towards the south by the moon hoax hills red as the purest vermilion and evidently crys tallized for wherever a precipitous chasm appeared and these chasms were very frequent and of immense depththe perpendicular sections pre sented conglomerated masses of polygon crystals evenly fitted to each other and arranged in deep strata which grew darker in color as they descend ed to the foundations of the precipices innumer able cascades were bursting forth from the breasts of every one of these cliffs and some so near their summits and with such great force as to form arches many yards in diameter i never was so vividly reminded of byrons simile the tail of the white horse in the revelation at the foot of this boundary of hills was a perfect zone of woods sur rounding the whole valley which was about eighteen or twenty miles wide at its greatest breadth and about thirty in length small collections of trees of every imaginable kind were scattered about the whole of the luxuriant area and here our magnifiers blest our panting hopes with specimens of conscious existence in the shade of the woods on the south eastern side we beheld continuous herds of brown quadrupeds having all the external characteristics of the bison but more diminutive than any species of the bos genus in our natural history its tail is like that of our bos grunniens but in its semicircular horns the hump on its shoulders and the depth of its dewlap and the length of its shaggy hair it closely resembled the species to which i first com pared it it had however one widely distinctive feature which we afterwards found common to nearly every lunar quadruped we have discovered namely a remarkable fleshy appendage over the eyes crossing the whole breadth of the forehead and united to the ears we could most distinctly per ceive this hairy veil which was shaped like the upper front outline of a cap known to the ladies as mary queen of scots cap lifted and lowered by means of the ears it immediately occurred to the acute mind of dr herschel that this was a provi dential contrivance to protect the eyes of the animal from the great extremes of light and darkness to which all the inhabitants of our side of the moon are periodically subjected birds and animals pphe next animal perceived would be class h ed on earth as a monster it was of a jl bluish lead color about the size of a goat with a head and beard like him and a single horn slightly inclined forward fiom the per pendicular the female was destitute of the horn and beard but had much longer tail it was gregarious and chiefly abounded on the acclivitous glades of the woods in elegence of symmetry it rivalled the antelope and like him it seemed an agile sprightly creature running with great speed and springing from the green turf with all the unaccountable antics of a young lamb or kit ten this beautiful creature afforded us the most exquisite amusement the mimicry of its move ments upon our white painted canvas was as faith ful and luminous as that of animals within a few yards of the camera obscura when seen pictured upon its tympan frequently when attempting to put our fingers upon its beard it would suddenly bound away into oblivion as if conscious of our earthly impertinence but then others would appear whom we could not prevent nibbling the herbage say or do what we would to them on examining the centre of this delightful valley we found a large branching river abounding with lovely islands and waterbirds of numerous kinds a species of grey pelican was the most numer ous but black and white cranes with unreasonably long legs and bill were also quite common we watched their pisciverous experiments a long time in hopes of catching sight of a lunar fish but although we were not gratified in this respect we could easily guess the purpose with which they plunged their long necks so deeply beneath the water near the upper extremity of one of these islands we obtained a glimpse of a strange am phibious creature of a spherical form which rolled with great velocity across the pebbly beach and was lost sight of in the strong current which set off from this angle of the island we were com pelled however to leave this prolific valley unex plored on account of clouds which were evidently accumulating in the lunar atmosphere our own being perfectly translucent but this was itself an interesting discovery for more distant observers had questioned or denied the existence of any humid atmosphere in this planet some cloudy nights interfere with the observation the moon being now low on her descent dr herschel inferred that the increasing refran gibility of her rays would prevent any satis factory protraction of our labors and our minds be ing actually fatigued with the excitement of the high enjoyments we had partaken we mutually agreed to call in the assistants at the lens and re ward their vigilant attention with congratulatory bumpers of the best east india particular it was not however without regret that we left the splen did valley of the red mountains which in compli ment to the arms of our royal patron we denomin ated the valley of the unicorn and it may be found in blunts map about midway between the mare foscunditatis and the mare nectar is the nights of the th and th being cloudy were unfavorable to observation but on those of the th and th further animal discoveries were made of the most exciting interest to every human being we give them in the graphic language of our accomplished correspondent the astonishing and beautiful discoveries which we had made during our first nights observation and the brilliant promise which they gave of the future rendered every moonlight hour too precious to reconcile us to the deprivation occasioned by these two cloudy evenings and they were borne with strictly philosophical patience notwithstand ing that our attention was closely occupied in super intending the erection of additional props and braces to the twentyfour feet lens which we found had somewhat vibrated in a high wind that arose in the morning of the th the night of the th january was one of pearly purity and loveli ness the moon ascended the firmament in gorgeous splendor and the stars retiring around her left her the unrivalled queen of the hemisphere this being the last night but one in the present month during which we should have an opportunity of inspecting amazing stories her western limb on account of the libration in longitude which would thence immediately ensue dr herschel informed us that he should direct our researches to the parts numbered and in blunts map and which are respectively known in the modern catalogue by the names of endymoin cleomedes langrenus and petavius to the care ful inspection of these and the regions between them and the extreme western rim he proposed to devote the whole of this highly favorable night the observation resumed and an extinct volcano is observed qpaking then our twentyfive miles breadth of her surface upon the field of view i and reducing it to a slow movement we soon found the first very singularly shaped object of our inquiry it is a highly mountainous district the loftier chains of which form three narrow ovals two of which approach each other in slender points and are united by one mas of hills of great length and elevation thus present ing a figure similar to that of a long skein of thread the bows of which have been gradually spread open from their connecting knot the third oval looks also like a skein and lies as if carelessly dropped from natures hand in connection with the other but that which might fancifully be supposed as having formed the second bow of this second skein is cut open and lies in scattered threads of smaller hills which cover a great extent of level territory the ground plan of these mountains is so remarkable that it has been accurately represented in almost every lineal map of the moon that has been drawn and in blunts which is the best it agrees exactly with my description within the grasp as it were of the broken bow of hills last mentioned stands an ovalshaped mountain enclosing a valley of an immense area and having on its western ridge a volcano in a state of terrific eruption to the northeast of this across the broken or what mr holmes called the vagabond mountains are three other detached oblong formations the largest and last of which is marked f in the catalogue and fancifully denominated the mare mortuum or more commonly the lake of death induced by a curiosity to devine the reason of so sombre a title rather than by any more philosophical motive we here first applied our hydrooxygen magnifiers to the focal image of the great lens our twentyfive miles portion of this great mountain circus had comprehended the whole of its area and of course the two conical hills which rise in it about five miles from each other but although his breadth of view had heretofore generally presented its ob jects as if seen within a terrestrial distance of two and a half miles we were in this instance unable to discern these central hills with any such degree of distinctness there did not appear to be any mist or smoke around them as in the case of the volcano which we had left in the southwest and yet they were comparatively indistinct upon the canvas on sliding in the gaslight lens the mystery was immediately solved they were old craters of extinct volcanoes from which still issued a heated though transparent exhalation that kept them in an apparently oscillatory or trembling mo tion most unfavorable to examination the extinct volcanoes of the moon he craters of both these hills as nearly as we could judge under this obstruction were i about fifteen fathoms deep devoid of any appearance of fire and of nearly a yellowish white color throughout the diameter of each was about nine diameters of our painted circle or nearly feet and the width of the rim surrounding them about feet yet notwith standing their narrow mouths these two chimneys of the subterranean deep had evidently filled the whole area of the valley in which they stood with the lava and ashes with which it was encumbered and even added to the height if not indeed caused the existence of the oval chain of mountains which surrounded it these mountains as subsequently measured from the level of some large lakes around them averaged the height of feet and dr herschel conjectured from this and the vast extent of their abutments which ran for many miles into the country around them that these volcanoes must have been in full activity for a million years lieut drummond however rather sup posed that the whole area of this oval valley was but the exhausted crater of one vast volcano which in expiring had left only these two imbecile repre sentatives of its power i believe dr herschel him self afterwards adopted this probable theory which is indeed confirmed by the universal geology of the planet there is scarcely a hundred miles of her surface not even excepting her largest seas and lakes in which circular or oval mountainous ridges may not be easily found and many very many of these having numerous enclosed hills in full volcanic operation which are now much lower than the sur rounding circles it admits of no doubt that each of these great formations is the remains of one vast mountain which has burnt itself out and left only these wide foundations of its ancient grandeur a direct proof of this is afforded in a tremendous volcano now in its prime which i shall hereafter notice what gave the name of the lake of death to the annular mountain i have just described was i suppose the dark appearance of the valley which it encloses and which to a more distant view than we obtained certainly exhibits the general aspect of the waters on this planet the surrounding coun try is fertile to excess between this circle and no endymion which we proposed first to examine we counted not less than twelve luxuriant forests divided by open plains which waved in an ocean of verdure and were probably prairies like those of north america in three of these we discovered numerous herds of quadrupeds similar to our friends the bisons in the valley of the unicorn but of much larger size and scarcely a piece of woodland occur red in our panorama which did not dazzle our vision with flocks of white or red birds upon the wing animals and a beautiful island a t length we carefully explored the endy jok mion we found each of the three l jl ovals volcanic and sterile within but without most rich throughout the level re gions around them in every imaginable production of a bounteous soil dr herschel has classified not less than thirtyeight species of forest trees and nearly twice this number of plants found in this the moon hoax tract alone which are widely different to those found in more equatorial latitudes of animals he classified nine species of mammalia and five of ovip ara among the former is a small kind of rein deer the elk the moose the horned bear and the biped beaver the last resembles the beaver of the earth in every other respect than in its destitution of a tail and its invariable habit of walking upon only two feet it carries its young in its arms like a human being and moves with an easy gliding mo tion its huts are constructed better and higher than those of many tribes of human savages and from the appearance of smoke in nearly all of them there is no doubt of its being acquainted with the use of lire still its head and body differ only in the points stated from that of the beaver and it was never seen except on the borders of lakes and rivers in which it has been observed to immerse for a per iod of several seconds thirty degrees farther south in no or cleo medes an immense annular mountain containing three distinct craters which have been so long ex tinguished that the whole valley around them which is eleven miles in extent is densely crowded with woods nearly to the summits of the hills not a rod of vacant land except the tops of these craters could be descried and no living creature except a large white bird resembling the stork at the southern extremity of this valley is a natural arch way or cavern feet high and wide through which runs a river which discharges itself over a precipice of grey rock feet in depth and then forms a branching stream through a beautiful cam paign district for many miles within twenty miles of this cataract is the largest lake or rather inland sea that has been found throughout the seven and a half millions of square miles which this illuminat ed side of the moon contains its width from east to west is miles and from north to south miles its shape to the northward is not unlike that of the bay of bengal and it is studded with small islands most of which are volcanic two of these on the eastern side are now violently erup tive but our lowest magnifyng power was too great to examine them with convenience on account of the cloud of smoke and ashes which beclouded our field of view as seen by lieut drummond through our reflecting telescope of times they exhibited great brilliancy in a bay on the western side of this sea is an island miles long of a crescent form crowded through its entire sweep with the most superb and wonderful natural beauties both of vegetation and geology its hills are pinnacled with tall quartz crystals of so rich a yellow and orange hue that we at first supposed them to be pointed flames of fire and they spring up thus from smooth round brows of hills which are covered as with a velvet mantle even in the enchanting little valleys of this winding island we could often see these splendid natural spires mount ing in the midst of deep green woods like church steeples in tfie vales of westmoreland strange animals and more beautiful crystal pinnacles tty t here first noticed the lunar palmtree which differs from that of our tro v v pical latitudes only in the peculiar ity of very large crimson flowers instead of the spadix protruded from the common calyx we however perceived no fruit on any specimens we saw a circumstance which we attempted to ac count for from the great theoretical extremes in the lunar climate on a curious kind of treemelori we nevertheless saw fruit in great abundance and in every stage of inception and maturity the gen eral color of these woods was a dark green though not without occasional admixtures of every tint of our forest seasons the hectic flush of autumn was often seen kindled upon the cheek of earliest spring and the gay drapery of summer in some places sur rounded trees leafless as the victims of winter it seemed as if all the seasons here united hands in a circle of perpetual harmony of animals we saw only an elegant striped quadruped about three feet high like a miniature zebra which was al ways in small herds on the green sward of the hills and two or three kinds of longtailed birds which we judged to be golden and blue pheasants on the shores however we saw countless multitudes of univalve shellfish and among them some huge flat ones which all three of my associates declared to be cornu ammonis and i confess i was here com pelled to abandon my sceptical substitution of peb bles the cliffs all along these shores were deeply undermined by tides they were very cavernous and yellow crystal stalactites larger than a mans thigh were shooting forth on all sides indeed every rood of this island appeared to be crystallized masses of fallen crystals were found on every beach we explored and beamed from every fractured head land it was more like a creation of an oriental fancy than a distant variety of nature brought by the powers of science to ocular demonstration the striking dissimilitude of this island to every other we had found on these waters and its near prox imity to the main land led us to suppose that it must at some time have been a part of it more espe cially as its crescent bay embraced the first of a chain of smaller ones which ran directly thither the first one was a pure quartz rock about three miles in circumference towering in naked majesty from the blue deep without either shore or shelter but it glowed in the sun almost like a sapphire as did all the lesser ones of whom it seemed the king our theory was speedily confirmed for all the shore of the main land was battlemented and spired with these unobtainable jewels of nature and as we brought our field of view to include the utmost rim of the illuminated boundary of the planet we could still see them blazing in crowded battalions as it were through a region of hundreds of miles in fact we could not conjecture where the gorgeous land of enchantment terminated for as the rotary motion of the planet bore these mountain summits from our view we became further remote from their western boundary near the edge of the moon and apparently quantities of metallic gold in the cliffs te were admonished by this to lose no time i in seeking the next proposed object of our v search the langrenus or no which is almost within the verge of the libration in longi tude and of which for this reason dr herschel entertained some singular expectations after a short delay in advancing the observa amazing stories tory upon the levers and in regulating the lens we found our object and surveyed it it was a dark narrow lake seventy miles long bounded on the east north and west by red mountains of the same character as those surrounding the valley of the unicorn from which it is distant to the southwest about miles this lake like that valley opens to the south upon a plain not more than ten miles wide which is here encircled by a truly magnificent amphitheatre of the loftiest order of lunar hills for a semicircle of six miles these hills are riven from their brow to their base as perpendicularly as the outer walls of the colosseum at rome but here exhibiting the sublime altitude of at least two thousand feet in one smooth unbroken surface how nature disposed of the huge mass which she thus prodigally carved out i know not but certain it is that there are no fragments of it left upon the plain which is a declivity without a single prom inence except a billowy tract of woodland that runs an many a wild vagary of breadth and course to the margin of the lake the tremendous height and expansion of this perpendicular mountain with its bright crimson front contrasted with the fringe of forest on its brow and the verdure of the open plain beneath filled our canvas with a landscape un surpassed in unique grandeur by any we had be held our twentyfive miles perspective included this remarkable mountain the plain a part of the lake and the last graduated summits of the range of hills by which the latter is nearly surrounded ve ardently wished that all the world could view a scene so strangely grand and our pulse beat high vith the hope of one day exhibiting it to our coun trymen in some part of our native land but we were at length compelled to destroy our picture as a whole for the purpose of magnifying its parts for scientific inspection our plain was of course im mediately covered with the ruby front of this mighty amphitheatre its tall figures leaping cas cades and rugged caverns as its almost inter minable sweep was measured off upon the canvas we frequently saw long lines of some yellow metal hanging from the crevices of the horizontal strata in wild network or straight pendant branches we of course concluded that this was virgin gold and we had no assaymaster to prove to the con trary more animals searching the plain over which we h h had observed the woods roving in all v shapes of clouds in the sky we were again delighted with the discovery of animals the first observed was a quadruped with an amazingly long neck head like a sheep bearing two long spiral horns white as pol ished ivory and standing in perpendicular par allel to each other its body was like that of the deer but its forelegs were most disproportionally long and its tail which was very bushy and of a snowy whiteness curled high over its rump and hung two or three feet by its side its colors were bright bay and white in brindled patches clearly defined but of no regular form it was found only in pairs in spaces between the woods and we had no opportunity of witnessing its speed or habits but a few minutes only elapsed before three speci mens of another animal appeared so well known to us all that we fairly laughed at the recognition of so familiar an acquaintance in so distant a land they were neither more nor less than three good large sheep which would not have disgraced the farms of leicestershire or the shambles of leaden hallmarket with the utmost scrutiny we could find no mark of distinction between these and those of our native soil they had not even the appendage over the eyes which i have described as common to lunar quadrupeds presently they appeared in great numbers and on reducing the lenses we found them in flocks over a great part of the valley i need not say how desirous we were of finding shep herds to these flocks and even a man with blue apron and rolled up sleeves would have been a wel come sight to us if not to the sheep but they fed in peace lords of their own pastures without either protector or destroyer in human shape the description becomes enthusiastic when winged inhabitants are seen tt e at length approached the level opening to the lake where the valley narrows to v a mile in width and displays scenery on both sides picturesque and romantic beyond the powers of prose description imagination borne on the wings of poetry could alone gather similes to portray the wild sublimity of this landscape where dark behemoth crags stood over the brows of lofty precipices as if a rampart in the sky and forests seemed suspended in mid air on the eastern side there was one soaring crag crested with trees which hung over in a curve like threefourths of a gothic arch and being of a rich crimson color its effect was most strange upon minds unaccustomed to the association of such grandeur with such beauty but whilst gazing upon them in a perspective of about half a mile we were thrilled with astonish ment to perceive four successive flocks of large winged creatures wholly unlike any kind of birds descend with a slow even motion from the cliffs on the western side and alight upon the plain they were first noticed by dr herschel who exclaimed now gentlemen my theories against your proofs which you have often found a pretty even bet we have here something worth looking at i was con fident that if ever we found beings in human shape it would be in this longitude and that they would be provided by their creator with some extraordin ary powers of locomotion first exchange for my number d this lens being soon introduced gave us a fine halfmile distance and we counted three parties of these creatures of twelve nine and fif teen in each walking erect towards a small wood near the base of the eastern precipices certainly they were like human being for their wings had now disappeared and their attitude in walking was both erect and dignified having observed them at this distance for some minutes we introduced lens h z which brought them to the apparent proximity of eighty yards the highest clear magnitude we possessed until the latter end of march when we effected an improvement in the gasburners about half of the first party had passed beyond our can vass but of all the others we had a perfectly distinct and deliberate view they averaged four feet in height were covered except on the face with short the moon hoax ana glossy coppercolored hair and had wings com posed of a thfn membrane without hair lying snugly upon their backs from the top of the should ers to the calves of the legs the face which was of a yellowish flesh color was a slight improvement upon that of the large orang outang being more open and intelligent in its expression and having a much greater expansion of forehead the mouth however was very prominent though somewhat relieved by a thick beard upon the lower jaw and by lips far more human than those of any species of the simia genus in general symmetry of body and limbs they were infinitely superior to the orang outang so much so that but for their long wings lieut drummond said they would look as well on a parade ground as seme of the old cockney militia the hair on the head was a darker color than that of the body closcly curled but apparently not woolly and arrange in two curious semicircles over the temples of the forehead their feet could only be seen as they were alternately lifted in walk ing but from what we could see of them in so transient a view they appeared thin and very pro tuberant at the heel more about the winged men and their actions tt hilst passing across the canvas and whenever we afterwards saw them these creatures were evidently engaged in con versation their gesticulation more particularly the varied action of their hands and arms appeared im passioned and emphatic we hence inferred that they were rational beings and although not perhaps of so high an order as others which we discovered the next month on the shores of the bay or rain bows that they were capable of producing works of art and contrivance the next view we obtained of them was still more favorable it was on the bor ders of a little lake or expanded stream which we then for the first time perceived running down the valley to a large lake and having on its eastern margin a small wood some of these creatures had crossed this water and were lying like spread eagles on the skirts of the woods we could then perceive that they pos sessed wings of great expansion and were similar in structure to those of the bat being a semitrans parent membrane expanded in curvilineal divisions by means of straight radii united at the back by the dorsal integuments but what astonished us very much was the circumstances of this membrane being continued from the shoulders to the legs united all the way down though gradually decreas ing in width the wings seemed completely under the command of volition for those of the creatures whom we saw bathing in the water spread instantly to their full width waved them as ducks do theirs to shake off the water and then as instantly closed them again in a compact form our further obser vation of the habits of these creatures who were of both sexes led to results so very remarkable that i prefer they should first be laid before the public in dr herschels own work where i have reason to know they are fully and faithfully stated however incredulously they may be received the three families then almost simultaneously spread their wings and were lost in the dark con fines of the canvass before we had time to breathe from our paralyzing astonishment we scientifi cally denominated them the vespertiliohomo or manbat and they are doubtless innocent and happy creatures notwithstanding that some of their amusements would but ill comport with our terres trial notions of decorum the valley itself we called the ruby colosseum in compliment to its stupendous southern boundary the six mile sweep of precipices two thousand feet high and the night or rather morning being far advanced we postponed our tour to petavius no until another opportunity we have of course faithfully obeyed dr grants private injunction to omit those highly curious passages in his correspondence which he wished us to suppress although we do not perceive the force of the reason assigned for it it is true the omit ted paragraphs contain facts which would be wholly incredible to readers who do not carefuily examine the principles and capacity of the instrument with which these marvellous discoveries have been made but so will nearly all of those which he has kindly per mitted us to publish and it was for this reason that we considered the explicit description which we hare given of the telescope so important a preliminary from these however and other prohibited c assages which will be published by dr herschel with the certificates of the civil and military authorties the colony and of several episcopal wesleys and other ministers who in the month of march last were permitted under stipulation of temp rary secrecy to visit the observatory and become eye witnesses of the wonders which they were recuastea to attest we are confident his forthcoming volumes will be at once the most sublime in science and the most intense in general interest that ever issued from the press  the description becomes more specific the night of the th displayed the moon in her mean libration or full but the somewhat humid state of the atmosphere being for sev eral hours less favorable to a minute inspection than to a general survey of her surface they were chiefly devoted to the latter purpose but shortly after midnight the last veil of mist was dissipated and the sky being as lucid as on the former evenings the attention of the astronomers was arrested by the remarkable outlines of the spot marked tycho no in blunts lunar chart and in this rerim they added treasures to human knowledge which angels might well desire to win many parts of the following extract will remain forever in the curr icles of time the surface of the moon when viewed in her mean libration even with telescopes of very limited power exhibits three oceans of vast breadth ard cir cumference independently of seven large collections of water which may be denominated seas of in ferior waters discoverable by the higher classes of instruments and usually called lakes the number is so great that no attempt has yet beer made to count them indeed such a task would be almost equal to that of enumerating the annular mountains which are found upon every part of her surface whether composed of land or water the largest of the three oceans occupies a considerable portion of the hemi sphere between the line of her northern axis and that of her eastern equator and even extends many amazing stories degrees south of the latter throughout its eastern boundary it so closely approaches that of the lunar sphere as to leave in many places merely a fringe of illuminated mountains which are here therefore strongly contradistinguished from the dark and shadowy aspect of the great deep but peninsulas promontories capes and islands and a thousand other terrestrial figures for which we can find no names in the poverty of our geographical nomencla ture aie found expanding sallying forth or glow ing in insular independence through all the bil lowy boundlessness of this magnificent ocean one of the most remarkable of these is a promontory without a name i believe in the lunar charts which starts from an island district denominated coper nicus by the old astronomers and abounding as we eventually discovered with great natural curiosities this promontory is indeed most singular its northern extremity is shaped much like an imperial crown having a swelling bow divided and tied down in its centre by a band of hills which is united with its forehead band or base the two open spaces formed by this division are two lakes each eighty miles wide and at the foot of these divided from them by the band of hills last mentioned is another lake larger than the two put together and nearly perfectly square this one is followed after an other hilly division by a lake of an irregular form and this one yet again by two narrow ones divided longitudinally which are attenuated northward to the main land thus this skeleton promontory of mountain ridges runs miles into the ocean with six capacious lakes enclosed within its stony ribs blunts
