wanted to buy me instead of the ribbon the highest law and anns struggle to escape it could more bitter choice be offered woman knowing her husband to be a thief she steadfastly refused to join his crooked game then came the awful moment when she had to choosehis life or that of another who was blood guiltless this is the story ann told me as she lay on the hospital cot the glory of her redgold hair spread like a living flame on the coarse white pillow her glowing green eyes staring straight ahead at the gray walls and her pale curiously beautiful face trans fixed with the new spiritual glow in the woman herself one day minnie kralze and i were standing behind our ribbon counter we were chinning over a dance minnie had attended the night before at web ster hallyou know that swell place where all the people who try to be like the artists in paris go in the middle of our talk there comes strolling down the aisle a big dark handsome man dressed up in the best a seventh avenue tailor could produce looking as if hed kinda lost his way in the department store and not knowing whether he wanted to right about face and beat it the highest law or sidle up to one of us clerks and get what he was looking for light your lamp on the picture post card whispers minnie to me i move over to him and ask him is there anything i can do for him he looked right down into my very soul and i got a kinda shock when i saw one of his big beautiful eyes was made of glass cept for that he was too goodlooking to live he asks for some ribbon he didnt know the color nor the width he wanted and that kinda puz zled me but i finally fitted him out with a bolt of baby blue and he stood there waiting for his change and sizing me up as though he wanted to buy me instead of the ribbon and me just falling dead in love with him at first sight finally he says looky here little lady do you ever go stepping how dye mean i stammered my heart beating such little tripham mer jumps i felt certain he heard them well says he youre a pippin for looks girlie any guyd be proud to be seen with you hanging on his arm i didnt realize it then but i do now that it was for just that reason hed come buying baby ribbon pete needed a girl to work with him and he figured the best place to pick a winner with an innocent face was in a base ment department store where the air was bad and the pay was poor he knew his fascinating manner and hand some face would make it easy for him to start a conversation with any dame he picked he didnt have to ask me twice to go out with him when the store closed i met him at the sixth avenue corner ofyou know near loews theatreand we went to the movies together then over to a dance place gee by the time hed said good night to me in the doorway of my boarding house on avenue a i loved him without him half trying to make me he was a swell dancer and a grand talker and with me lonesome and never having had a sweetheart in my whole lifewell you know the answer pete sure did rush me every night at closing hour for a week he met me and we had chow at the chinamans or we went to an italian joint around the corner i kept getting deeper and deeper in love with him but never a word did he say to show whether he cared a thing for me or not i used to go to mass in those days not that ma had ever been religious but i kinda needed something to bolster me up and lordy how i prayed for him to ask me to marry him then one night he didnt show up nor the next and i was just about crazy when a week went by and i didnt hear from him i didnt care whether i lived or died then one night there he was wait ing for me as usual miss me kid he asks giving my hand a squeeze oh pete i gasps whereve you been i missed you something fierce he told me hed been in jailjail it just made me sick the way he said it as though it wasnt a disgrace or any thing to be ashamed of he laughed about it and because i got white and kinda trembly he laughed some more but it didnt make me love him less the highest law i was too far gone for that and he saw how much i loved him for he put his arms around me and began to tell me he cared too he asked me to marry him and i consented knowing he was a thief i figured i would get him to reform and everything would he all right in a little while i see now how big a fool i was but i guess i was hypnotized anyway i quit my job at the store and pete took i used to get blue and pretty heart sick when i was by myself and one night when he was gone until the next morning and i didnt know whether the cops had got him for another crime i took a big drink from the bottle of whisky he always kept in the cupboard it made me sleep without the hor rible nightmares id been having it wasnt long before i was drinking it pretty often to keep from worrying they played poker while i sewed half dead for sleep me to the place where he was living on tenth avenue it wasnt so grand but it sure did look wonderful to me the landlady a big goodnatured irish woman hearing i was a bride put a vase of artificial flowers on the marble topped table and some lace tidies on the horsehair rocker and there was an old lace bedspread on the bed that made me think of mother and cry a little though i didnt let pete see me he was awfully good to me at first and i think he really loved me but i could not get anything out of him for all my coaxing him to go straight and thinking about the kind of life i was leading i didnt go to church any more for i was living with a thief not only that but pete began nagging the life out of me to help him whenever he made a haul that was how far off i was from making him want to reform if i hadnt felt i was living wrong getting my daily bread from a thief i spose i wouldnt a drunk i loved pete so much i couldnt leave him though id think about doing it and try to make up my mind to we had a lot of quarrels in those the highest law days for he got ugly at times after hed tried to ring me in on some of his thiev ing schemes where he needed a woman when i wouldnt help him hed get sore and he gave me a black eye many a time i guess he loved me though for no matter how often he threatened to quit me he always came back and would be so kind and loving it made it harder for me to refuse every time he had two pals who used to come over to see him of evenings and theyd sit by the table and play poker while i sewed or read the paper half dead with sleep wishing theyd go home and let me go to bed their names were tim callahan and shorty camp shorty was little and skinny and all withered up like a dried apple his eyes were little and squinty and what hair he had was gray like his eyes and his face was like crinkled gray leather it made me sick just to look at him the way he grinned at me and showed his yellow teeth he always looked so un clean i couldnt understand why pete ever had him around because pete was neat even when he was drinking tim callahan was almost as big as pete but he was an ugly hairy red irishman and generally half drunk both shorty and tim seemed to be afraid of pete though and did every thing he told them one night id been to a picture show and when i came home i found pete shorty and tim sitting in the corner as usual but they were talking in an undertone instead of playing cards and seemed awfully excited about some thing they had a newspaper spread out in front of them but when i came in pete crumpled the paper up and threw it in the wastebasket and began to laugh as though something funny had hap pened i dont know whybut i felt cer tain there was something in that paper they didnt want me to see i felt some thing terrible was going to happen pete had sworn to me once that hed never killed anyone and never would that was the one thing i was always afraid of pretty soon he and the others went out together and the minute they were gone i rummaged in the basket and found the newspaper pete had thrown away i spread it out and looked it all over but i couldnt find anything in it that looked suspicious though there was a red mark drawn around some headlines about a millionaire from texas who was stopping at the alcazar hotel his name was canfield george canfield and the paper said he was rich as croesus whoever that was pete caught me reading the article and got so mad i thought hed choke me why the are you snoopin about he snarled at me lemme tell you ann if you cant mind your own business you can pack your doll rags and beat it but when he discovered i didnt know what he was up to he changed his tone and seemed sorry for the way hed acted that was pete all overa devil one minute and a darling the next but it planted the seeds of a new fear in my mind what was he up to i had a feeling i couldnt shake off that some thing awful was going to happen it was just about that time i dis covered i was going to have a baby i loved babies and if pete hadnt been a thief id a been the happiest woman on the highest law earth but i wasnt knowin that my kid wouldnt have an honest daddy just about made me crazy i begged pete that night to give up this kind of life i got down on my knees to him and pleaded self living on the mother of a thiefs childmaybe my child would be a thief too suddenly i saw petes razor the old fashioned kind it was without the safety attachment and before i had i begged pete to give up this kind of life but he just laughed at me and said seeing as he had to have a family he would take care of it any way he saw fit the world whirled with me i didnt really know what i was doingfor after pete left me i drank a lot of whisky and kept feeling worse and worse till it seemed as if there wasnt anything for me to do but die i thought of my time to figure out anything i gave my wrist a slash with it that laid open an artery the next minute i began screaming and rushed out in the street that was all covered with snow i guess i fainted for when i came to i found myself lying on a stretcher in a sort of anteroom of a hospital where theyd brought me in an ambulance the highest law there were nurses there and a doctor and i heard them say theyd keep me under observation in the psychopathic ward till they found out if i was sane and anyway i was under arrest for trying to kill myself i was so weak i could only halfopen my eyes and listen but i couldnt say a word then i saw something that kind of wiped the blur away from my eyes and made me want to scream my pete and another stretcher and on it a blackhaired girl him go up to the doctor in the white uniform and i heard him say that the girl was his wife edna grey and that she had gone suddenly insane and ho wanted them to keep her there until her sanity was tested then he gave his name as howard grey and his address as riverside drive i fainted again it was night before i was conscious once more that something was my pete stand ing in the doorway though he wasnt looking at me he had his big over coat on and a slouch hat pulled down over his face so that it hid his glass eyebut i recognized him at once just behind him was another stretcher like the one i was lying on and in it was a girl with her eyes shut and her black hair all tumbled about a silk dressing gown she wore she was so white i thought maybe she was dead i tried to move and call to pete but i couldnt i just lay there and watched this time i saw i was in a big higli ceilinged room with graypainted walls and a cement floor without any carpets there was a dim light burning in the center just over my head and i could see a couple of windows nearby with bars over them all around me were white iron beds and on them were women some of them strapped down with twisted sheets most of them groaning and making a lot of horrible noises i found that my own hands were tied to my sides with sheets and the wrist id slashed hurt something fierce the highest law one woman over in the corner was swearing like a gutter rat and saying words i wouldnt a thought of using though i could see she was a nicelook ing old person even if her thin wisps of white hair were tied back with a calico string there was another woman right be side me who kept saying she was queen mary stuart and that elizabeth had no right to lock her up in a dungeon and she kept begging to be let out be fore her head was cut off booby hatch thinks i to myself too sick and miserable to care a whole lot what they did to me or where they put me or to be afraid of those crazy people id heard of this place from liz dob son who took too much dope once and had been taken here for a cure so i knew what i was in for but nothing seemed to matter to me theni just wished i was dead then i heard a faint awfully pitiful sobbing at my right elbow and twisting around in spite of my bandaged arms i saw lying in the cot right beside mine the blackhaired girl pete had brought in and claimed was his wife i was so jealous for a minute i thought maybe she was his wife and that he had been deceiving me when we went through with the ceremony but common sense told me that no woman of her kind would ever hitch up with him i couldnt say just how i knew she was class a real lady for i guess we all looked alike in the un bleached muslin slips they made us wear and with our hair braided into tight little queues and tied with rags but there was something different about this girl anyway something a lot different from me she had great big grayblue eyes that were staring right at me even though the tears were running down her cheeks cheeks thatll never be whiter when shes dead and her hands long and slim and tapering were choked up against her mouth as if she was trying with every bit of her to keep from screaming out loud i dont know much about crazy peo ple but she sure didnt look insane to me and i knew pete had some mighty goodor i guess i oughta say bad cause for having her shut up here but of course i hadnt the least idea in the world who she was just as i about made up my mind to speak to her a nurse in a blue uniform and white apron came along with a glass of medicine and said to her here mrs grey take this and youll go to sleep she never moved and the nurse gave her shoulder a shove to attract her at tention mrs grey she said again the girl looked up at her kinda startled why do you call me mrs grey she asked ive told you my name isnt grey its wallace the nurse just held the glass closer and said come on drink this it doesnt make any difference what your name is oh it does it does the girl cried and began to sob out loud wont you please tell harry where i am hell be so worried pleasepleaseplease call up the alcazar and tell him to come for me room fourteen fourplease call him wont you the nurse grabbed her then and forced the liquid down her throat spill ing it all over her gown then she made her lie back on the pillow where the poor kid lay sobbing like a baby the highest law whats the matter i whispered when the nurse went over to the scream ing old dame and told her to shut up what are you in for i dont know sobbed the girl that horrible glasseyed man brought me here oh my god then she went on to tell me some thing that made me so sick i just prayed to die she was a bride she said and she and as she was one man had threatened to kill the other if he didnt come across with the money she said but just as she opened her outer door the door leading into the other room swung open and a big graywhiskered man ran out into the corridor right behind him was a little skinny ratty looking man and a big dark one she called glasseyewho i knew must be my pete she said a blinding flash and a man fell right at her feet her husband were spending their honey moon seeing new york theyd just got in town and had taken a room at the alcazar hotel and while she was unpacking the trunks her husband harry she called himwent out to get some theater tickets it seemed there was a door in her room that led into the room next to it and while she was at work she suddenly heard some men quarreling next door the sound of the voices frightened her so also the things they said she started to go out into the hall undressed just as the big man cried out for help she saw a pistol a blinding flash she heard no noise but heard a groan from the graybearded man and he fell right over at her feet with the blood gushing out of his head before she could scream or move glasseye clapped his hand over her mouth and dragged her back into her own room she said the skinny man gave a pull at the dead man and got him inside at the same time then they slammed the door shut after them and dragged the highest law her into their room locking the door between it was all done so quickly she hardly knew what was happening to her but pete took a bottle of whisky out of his pocket and with her struggling and trying to break away he forced a lot of it down her throat she heard voices down the hall but their owners didnt come near dizzy more than half drunk with the stuff shed been compelled to drink she had to put on her coat and hat and then the men half dragged half carried her out of the room making her walk down the corridor with petes hand over her mouth but before she reached the stairs she fainted and didnt know anything more until she woke up in the cot there beside me and now no one would believe her story or even listen to her for that matter i did a lot of thinking after she stopped speaking i knew what had happened just as though pete himself had told me all about it he and that rat skinny had gone to canfields room to rob him and canfield must have caught them before they got away with the swag thered been a fight and pete had abducted the little bride because shed seen the murder and he wanted her outa the way until he and sknny could beat it he knew shed be safe for at least ten days in the psychopathic ward of the hopsital so hed called her his wife and had her shut up for a crazy woman with that poor kid lying there sob bing right by me i most hated pete for what hed done yet he was my man i loved him i didnt know what to do and everything she said made every one around her but me think she was insane at last i told her not to say a word to anyone else and that when i got out which i knew i would in a day or so when my man learned where i wasid go to her harry and have him come and get her that quieted her some though she said one thing more that made me shiver if they find the dead man in our room and harry there what will they do to harry he can prove hes innocent i said trying to comfort her and they cant do a thing to an innocent man she went to sleep at last but i lay there awake and heard the clock strike twelve then one and two and three and four no nearer to a decision what to do than when she first told me the story there was a gray light coming in through the barred windows before i went to sleep and it didnt seem as if id dozed ten minutes when i felt the nurse shaking me and telling me to drink the slush she called coffee it was in a tin cup and there was sugar left around the rim of it where it hadnt been washed off but she made me swallow it just the same and eat the hunk of bread she brought with it i finally managed it and washed my face in the water she fetched in the tin basin but the yellow soap sticking in the bottom of the pan hurt my eyes and made my face burn after that the nurse almost pulled me out of bed and told me i was wanted in the ante room i knew i was going to leave then so i told mrs wallace not to worry that the highest law id see everything came out all right with her she smiled wistfully as i said it i had a sort of trial or something anyway pete paid my line and took me home his face was as black as a thundercloud and i felt sick all over when i saw him what dye mean by messing your self up like that he growled point ing to my strappedup wrist when we got out on the street if youre gonna kill yourself why dont you make a good job of it while youre about it i didnt answer him i was think ing about the dead man and the girl they thought was crazy back there in the hospital when i got home i had a surprise pete had moved the trunks into the mid dle of the room and everything we owned was packed in them now he said seeing i looked startled forget youre sick and get a move on were sailing for south america tomorrow can they escape handsome pete has arranged for his getaway yet is there a higher law of duty to ones fellow man that will unseal the lips of ann and doom the man she loves a star that is steadily rising richard barthelmess richard barthelmess a few years ago was lillian gishs leading man at the time he created the notable role of the chinese boy in broken blossoms griffiths vivid photoplay made from thomas burke limehouses story the chink and the child today he is starring in inspiration pic tures and dorothy gish is his leading woman their first picture together again is fury but so popular are both of these artists of the silver screen that the question of which is star and which lead is relatively unimportant the public is now looking forward to the bright shawl for with such principals joseph hergesheimers story should prove as popular on the silver screen as it did in novel form big and brave as a herring a girl stowaways daring on the high seas a feighter on a long voyage is no place for a woman said the ships captain to his tearful bridetobe at parting but she disguised as a boy stowaway followedand learned the truth of those words i was to be married on the fifteenth of june that year and there never was a girl who looked forward to her wedding day with happier anticipa tion than i gordon perry was a seafaring man and at the age of twentyfive already captain of a three hundred ton brig the mary culver he was enjoying several weeks shore leave while the mary culver was put up for repairs so quite naturally we had selected this as the time for our wedding i was all aflutter over the prepara tions imagine then my dismay when on the seventh gordon was summoned to take immediate charge of another ship bound for havana and due to sail at dawn the next day rather than be married in haste i postponed the wedding but i was dreadfully disappointed it was so bitterly hard to be separated from gordon just then all at once it came to me that if i were to accompany him on the trip there need be no parting but he said decidedly that this was not to be thought ofa freighter on a long voyage was no place for a woman but being young and wilful and fearlessvery much in love too i did not give proper heed to his words i didnt go to sleep at all that night instead i lay across my bed chin propped upon both hands trying to form some plan by which i might out wit gordon and sail to havana with him in spite of his qualms finally an idea came to me which made my cheeks burn with excitement when everyone else in the house was asleep i stole softly up to the attic and there bv the light of a lamp searched until i found the garments which suited my purpose back in my room once more i slipped them on from shoes to jacket i would easily have passed for my own brother but abovethere were the heavy braids of hair wound about my head in a fever of haste i hacked at the long locks until only a shaggy thatch like a boys remained a few streaks of lampblack upon cheek and chin and i felt my disguise complete long before dawn i crept out of the house and in the guise of a ragged boy was picking my way toward the london docks big and brave as a herring i made the short journey without dif ficulty but when i reached the docks and found myself fairly in the midst of a great number of ships of every imag inable size and description i was all at once struck with a panic for try as i would i couldnt remem ber the name of the ship which gordon was to sail the excitement of the night had driven it completely out of my head the deck was alive with sailors and there were great noises of shouting and bustle of passing to and fro a group of women approached wives doubtless of some of the sailors and started to cross the gangplank in stantly i saw my chance falling in step behind them i made the deck with out hindrance a glance about showed me that gor don was not in sight bout at big and brave at a herring he be now the appalling thought came to me that the vessel might be miles away before that name came to mind i started walking about studying names of as many vessels as i could see all of a sudden i came upon one across the stern of which i spelled out edelthat was all she was lying in such a position that from where i stood i couldnt see the rest of the name but like a flash memory supplied it gordons ship was the edella and here by good luck she lay right before me the focsle hatch lay open and standing warily to one side i peered down only darkness and silence my heart beating high with triumph i scurried down the companion a streak of early morning sunshine sifting through the deadlights enabled me to get a fair view of the focsle and my straining eyes traveled up and down the rows of bunks searching for some place of concealment at length they fell upon a goodsized locker standing in the shadow under the bitts i flung up the lid big and brave as a herring but for a pile of old papers and a rusty lantern it was empty and i scrambled into it crouching down upon my knees to this day i can sense the musty odor of tar and old wood just as it came to me that morning so many years ago as i lay in the ships locker i had hardly more than settled my self when i heard a great hullabaloo of shouting and laughter both from the deck and from the wharf then the grat ing of the gangplank the creaking of the hawsers and the vessel quivered be neath me we were off my plan had been to make my pres ence known only after we were well under way and this as a matter of fact was what happened but not at all in the way i intended after the sleepless night just passed it needed only the darkness of the locker and the scantiness of air which filtered through a crack in the lid to send me off to sleep almost at once i dont know how long i lay there the next thing i was conscious of was a chorus of raucous voices then a hand upon the lockers lid in another minute i was hauled out blinking and bewildered upon the floor a rougherlooking group of men than those surrounding me i never saw in my life though it may be they were not different from the common run of seamen of that day one of them grasped me by the shoul der and held me up in the streak of sunlight for the rest to view what with the lampblack with which i had be smirched my face and the added mask of dust and cobwebs from the locker i must have presented a sorry enough appearance by the lord cried the seaman who held me if it aint a stowaway bout as big and brave as a herring he be guffawed another i wrenched myself free and faced the group take me to captain perry at once i commanded but no one moved and who might he be me hearty jeered a man who wore a black patch crookedly across one eye he spoke with a peculiar drawl and his name i afterward learned was ben cloaker hes the captain of this ship i cried hotly as youll learn to your sor row if you attempt to annoy me at that the whole crowd burst into a hoarse shout of laughter and someone with rough jocularity thumped me on the back with such a blow that i stag gered and caught at the nearest bunk for support then all at once i be came both angry and frightened and as the taunting faces drew in about me i struck out wildly with both fists the next thing i knew something heavya sea bool i afterward learned came hurtling through the air i dodged it a hand shot out and caught me under the chin with a force that turned me dizzy then a strong arm lifted me clear off my feet and held me kicking and struggling out of harms way lay off there you dirty swabs roared a voice do you want to kill the lad they fell back a little some mutter ing some guffawing at the picture of a slight wriggling figure held aloft in the big mans grasp put me down i screamed im going to find captain perry this in stant big and brave as a herring loony as a fool poor little devil spoke one out of the group a pale thin chested young fellow with a deep scar across his cheek the big man put me down with a brief shake come on now speak out have you got business with the capn i have and before i could so much as draw breath again i was being bundled un ceremoniously up the companion with the whole pack at my heels on deck all was activity a thickset man with a shock of untidy hair was thundering orders to some hands aft of the galley my big protector spoke up capn heres a young mischief maker as wants words with you and its loony in the head he is capn put in another the man who was addressed glared at them and the group fell back si lently then he turned to me but be fore he could speak i had lifted my chin defiantly i asked for gordon perry and no one else i said and who might he be the captain of this ship i blazed and heard a murmur behind me loony or no youll keep a civil tongue in your head you young son of a sealawyer im the master of this ship and you may lay to that a terrible fear leaped to my brain was it possible that this was not gor dons ship i could hardly find my voice isnt this the edella bound for havana i asked weaklyand felt all my courage oozing out from my finger tips as i read the answer in the mans face bound for havana right enough but this heres the edelise and its capn seeley youre answerable to and dont you forget that i didnt faint but i came near to it and i can see now how i owed even the precarious safety that followed to that deathly weakness which fell upon me for without it i would have blurted out my story in the first moment of amazement and i shudder to think of what would have lain in store for me instead when things cleared up again i found myself alone sitting flat on the deck leaning against the bul warks the men were gone about their duties and captain seeley was nowhere in sight a hammock was swung for me in the focsle that night half sick with loneliness and dismay i crept into it and by the dim wavering light of the slushlamp looked about the place on either side of me rose bunks one above the other not all of them were occupied but i made out on the upper at my right the form of the whitefaced youth with the scarred cheek whom i had noticed be fore and below him the man called cloaker for hours it seemed i lay there listening to the wash of the sea against the ships side the creaking of the sails the tramp of the watch above and all the sounds of a vessel at night that came so strangely to my ear thenthough they were to become familiar enough later on finally i did close my eyes and fall to dozing fitfully from one of these naps i was wak ened to alert consciousness by a sound it was so slight that had i been a little more instead of a little less than half big and brave as a herring asleep i should never have heard it at all someone was stealing cau tiously across the focsle floor toward me i heard the wary footfalls quite plainly but fear gripped me so that i did not dare even open my eyes at the side of my hammock the steps halted and i heard a mans breathing then a match was struck softly and i felt its feeble glow upon my face it traveled deliberately from neck to hair and back again i dont think i could have screamed if i had tried sheer terror had me by the throat my rigid limbs ached under the strain of holding them motionless and as for my heart thumping like mad against my ribs it seemed as though its pounding must actually cause the hammock to sway visibly the mans investigation though leisurely was not prolonged i heard him blow out the match presently and creep away as he had come all the rest of the night i lay there scarcely daring to breathe waiting for what the morning would bring day came at last and i found myself accepted in quite a matteroffact way as ships boy a more terrible position for a young girl could hardly be im aginedyet not half so terrible as it would have become had i for a mo ment dropped my disguise i was remembering too late gordons words that a freighter was no place for a woman it needed only a look at the faces of the seamen to convince me of the truth of that statement three times during the horrible days that followed i started toward the cap tains cabin with the truth upon my lips and three times i turned back si lently afraid to speak all the men with perhaps one ex ception thought me a bit crazy and this fact i believe saved me from many a blow that would otherwise have been mine but what a life it was with the work and the coarse food the wakeful nights andabove all the fear of discovery which never left me if i had not been a strong vigorous english girl i could never have come through it alive i hinted above that one of the sea men did not share his companions opinion as to my mental derangement this was ben cloaker and he was at once a constant puzzle and a terror to me he had a way of staring at me out of his one good eye and from under the crooked patch that half hid the other that made me want to scream a dozen times a day i would look up suddenly from my work or glance back as i stood leaning over the bulwarks watching the sea and find his gaze fixed upon me he was a silent fellow and his very silence made that eternal scrutiny seem the more ominous the feeling grew that it was cloaker who had spied upon me in the night and that he had suspicions which made my secret far from safe it was after we had been out some twelve days or more and were getting well toward the south that an incident came which turned into tragedy for me from the start we had had fair weather now it grew so intensely hot that i was obliged to discard all but the most essential of the garments i had worn aboarda pair of short frayed trousers and a cotton blouse one morning as i was pattering bare footed over the forward deck with an big and brave as a herring immense bucket of water in my hand i heard one of the seamen exclaim that a vessel was approaching i turned and shading my eyes looked out over the waves sure enough there to the northwas a patch of white sail between the blue of the sky and the deeper blue of the sea she was a long ceeded to slush off the deck with the spilled water and supposed the matter ended but it was not a little later i descended to the focsle and there unexpectedly encountered cloaker i was for darting up the com panion again at first sight of him he stood there gaping at the empty deck way off but gaining on us because both my mind and my eyes were still fixed on that other ship as i started forward i somehow stumbled over went the bucket and down went i flat on the deck with the water pouring over me at the moment i thought nothing of the accident beyond the fact that the mate who happened to be on the for ward deck at the time was cursing my carelessness roundly picking myself up in a hurry i pro but he caught my wrist and holding me so looked me up and down without a word for pitys sake i exclaimed ex asperated what are you staring at then suddenly i remembered that i was soaking wet i glanced down the drenched garments clung to me like my own skin every curve of my girlish figure was revealed let me go i cried in fright but he only grinned evilly i been quite awhile finding you out big and brave as a herring he drawled but you cant fool ben cloaker no more and he caught me to him with a hideous chuckle of pleasure let me go i screamed again twist ing for the moment out of his grasp im going to tell captain seeley the truth i stood gasping and sobbing with my back against the companion way he folded his arms and faced me his lip curling yes youll tell he jeered unfortunately these be seamen as aint got what you calls compny manners with a galnot aboard ship but youll tell you will then with an entire change of man ner he adopted a wheedling tone its lucky you be that not a soul aboard this here brig has eyes in his head but ol ben cloaker and he wont say a word you may lay to that so you lets well enough alone you does and nobody the wiser but you and me at that he lunged toward me but quick as a flash i ducked and was across the floor before he could turn then back and forth between the rows of bunks we dodged once i caught up a peajacket from a disordered bunk and flung it wildly at his face but divining my purpose he caught the thing easily in his hand with a laugh of triumph that i shall never forget in another moment he would have been upon me but as i ran my foot struck against a low stool that stood under the porthole with a swift backward kick i sent it spinning across the floor cloaker stumbled and fell flat it was an instant only before he was on his feet filling the place with the sound of his curses but in that instant i had made the companion and was rattling up i heard the mans quick breathing just behind as i gained the deck and started running aft i was on the left side of the focsle so that when i turned the deck house hid me for a moment from my pursuer as i rounded it out of the tail of my eye i caught a glimpse of the other ves sel she was overhauling us fast that one fleeting glance was enough to decide me flinging myself over the bulwarks i hung for an instant to the rail in that instant cloaker rounded the deck house after me grunting and puffing then he stopped with such a look of bewilderment on his face that fright ened as i was i could almost have laughed while he stood there gaping at the empty deck i loosed my hold upon the rail at the same time giving a vigorous push with my feet against the ships side to send me clear of it down down i went with the rush and roar of the water above my head and the pounding of it in my ears my eyes must have been open for i remem ber the great ghostly hull of the vessel looking like a huge shadow beside me as i came up the thought flashed into my mind that someone aboard the edelise might have heard the splash and endeavor to rescue me so gulping in one brief grateful breath of air i dove again to swim under water a distance of several yards when i rose to the surface gasping and exhausted the edelise was sailing blithely on her course the last i ever saw of ben cloaker was the picture i had of him then lean ing far over the starboard bulwarks shading his staring eyes with his hand big and brave as a herring i flopped over on my back to float for what with the mad chase on board the edelise and my plunge into the sea i was too spent for swimming lying there with face upturned the hot sun glared down so fiercely that i felt as if it was blinding me and i closed my eyes so i lay motionless the other the old stuff gave easily and now i had a signal flaga long ragged ribbon of cloth that fluttered from my free hand as high above the water as i could hold it out of all my life the moments which recur most vividly to my mind are those when in an agony of alternating hope mary cried a voice i knew until my breath came naturally once more and i felt strength returning when i opened my eyes again i gave a gasp of dismay the approaching ship was fairly abreast of meshe was passing an other moment and she would be beyond the reach of voice or signal i screamed and threw up one arm a wave hit me then and i went under choking and spluttering in less than a second i was up again swimming madly with one hand and tearing at the throat of my blouse with and despair i watched for some sign from the ship at length after i had all but given up it came a boat was lowered a few minutes later it was alongside me and i was hauled in over the gunwale hours perhaps later i awoke and found myself lying on a ships bunk a tall wellknit figure in a captains uniform stood over me i gave a little gasp and rubbed my eyes mary cried a voice i knew i stretched out my arms gordon uncle oscars house party the tale of an amateur siren she saw other girls drinking and necking she thought she would forget her strict new england upbringing and try their game so she did but it seems to take more than mere willingness to make a vamp i lived in one of those little new england towns where anything odd in manners speech or dress was considered actually wicked groundgrippers indescribably fussy looking hats untailored tailored suits prevailed and if one departed from such attire even slightlywell there was the deuce to pay i remember when i wore my first pair of gray spats i was walking down main street and whom should i bump into but grandmotherfunny little old grandmother who still wore a small bustle stiff rustling silk skirts and a wee flowered hat perched high up on her head grandmother gave me a horrified look and sailed by me with her chin in the air like a ship in full rigging later when i went to have tea with her she berated me soundly never never wear those shameful things again she expostulated how could i speak to you on the street when you wore spatsspats she wailed why child you looked like a bad girl i whistled in irritation grandmother shook a shriveled fore finger in my direction annalee she said reproachfully a whistling girl and a crowing hen it was from repression of this sort that i acquired a veritable passion for clothes occasionally mother and i went to new york for a few days we stayed at an hotel for women and took in the nice showspeter grim daddylong legs poor little rich girl but most of all i enjoyed our walks down fifth avenue at tea timethe shops the beautiful women and the dapper young men how i envied the women their cosmetics and perfumes and furs then one day we lunched at the waldorfan especial treat it was here in the ladies parlor that i met anabel i was looking wistfully into the show case at the little round boxes of rouge and powder at the varicolored bottles of scents all labeled from paris ana bel stood beside me and before i knew how it happened i was talking with her the next day we lunched together and our friendship such as it was be came cemented after that she visited me about twice a year it meant a rest for anabel and a fashionshow for me mother shook her head dubiously and although she did not actually for bid our companionship she never al lowed me to visit anabel and as for uncle oscars house party grandmotheri was always nervous when we walked up main street for fear of meeting the little old lady anabel sometimes came to visit me from new yorkanabel tall slender with great darkeyes and a surprising amount of beautiful clothes anabel herself was meaningless she had no intelligence she rode badly she danced badly but anabel was a model for clothes or rather she should have been a model for nabel never did any thing except to wear the latest creations her coming was like receiving one of those rare and expensive parisian fash ion books and now it was christmas vacation and anabel had come and gone she had brought me a negligee of chiffons it wasblue and lavender and maroon all fastened together with clusters of tiny tearoses there were sleeves and a train that trailed behind me halfway across the room and it was draped up in front so that my pretty legs were exposed halfway to the knee and to go with it were dainty silver slippers and yellow silk stockings my delight knew no bounds mother allowed me to accept it but never under any circumstances wear it except when youre alone in your bedroom she added so in the evening i would creep up to my room and donning my negligee i would pose before the mirror and al though i looked very lovelystill there was something wrong then one night i realized what it was it was my backgroundthe little bed covered with spotless white dimity the curtains ruffled and starched the bureau bare of adornments the pale wallpaper with its clusters of roses aad blue bows i shuddered and taking off the negli gee packed it away in my cedar chest to remain until i should have velvet hangings and silken cushions a long cheval glass and many many little toilette bottles and boxes then came the invitation to uncle oscars house party uncle oscar is con sidered the most shocking member of the family i was going to say the black sheep but that would be scarcely the thing to call him for uncle oscar is astonish ingly wealthy he has an enormous estate in new hampshire where there are lakes and deer and tennis courts and a putting green and on this estate there are stables where he raises horses and creamcolored cows and beautiful sav age bulls his house is wonderfula bachelor house with large halls painted with hunting scenes and great stone fire places uncle oscar can accommodate thirty guests shes seventeen now mother was saying to father and old enough to take care of herself besides jack westons going to be there and i want annalee to meet him hes uncle oscars partners son that evening i packed and hidden away at the bottom of the suitcase was my negligee uncle oscar met me at the sta tion where were other arriving guests and what a jolly party there was that first evening we sat at a long tablethere were twentyeight in all and in the center was a huge bowl of champagne punch which disappeared rapidly and was refilled as the evening advanced i contented myself with cider although i was tempted to taste uncle oscars house party the champagne punch but mother had warned me not to take wine of any sort your uncle is noted for his wine cellar she had said he and his friends drink far too muchits ruina tion to the soul dont take any anna lee now uncle oscar has a passion for fancy dress on the first night of each january house party he invites his com he smiled i was immediately attracted to him but jack paid no attention to me which irritated me considerably ill get him i told myself and right then i planned my campaign as the evening wore on the party grew merrier we danced and the girls entertained one by one i was thrilled beyond words i forgot myself i turned and glided toward jacksarah sat at a disdainful distance pany to appear in costume so the as sembly was a gay and colorful one most of the guests were from new york there was sally oshay from the fol lies and norma rose the famous mo tion picture vampire in fact most of the girls were professional next to me sat jack weston from princeton he was attired in a yellowandred domino and he drank punch as though it were water what a goodlooking fellow he was with his hair sleeked back and his broad muscular shoulders and how dazzlingly white his teeth were when my skirts which were neither long nor short and made me seem subtly lack ing in modishness i forgot my hair which was done in so plain a fashion my costume was that of a french maid i forgot myself and was content to sit quietly in a corner watching it was after three when we retired the next morning we had breakfast at ten thirty and afterward bundled in sweaters mackinaws mittens and gaiters we all went for a tramp around the estate through woods we walked over the uncle oscars house party crisp snow which was all hard on top and crackled as we stepped into it through fields of glittering ice and cold clear air it was lovely our walk ended at the cabin where we were to lunch the cabin was built of logs chinked with moss and excel sior inside the walls were hung with indian and mexican rugs and at the farthermost end was a colossal fireplace where logs were burning brightly and there were cocktails and cider and big brown turkeys served by uncle oscars butler we sat on cushioned benches before the fire and toasted our toes while we feasted all morning jack weston had been devoting himself to sarah huntington i had seen practically nothing of him sarah was just out of school and had stage aspirations she was one of those dreamylooking girls with continually halfclosed eyes and an air of languor i loathed her at first sight for i realized that she was all sham and pretense now she reclined gracefully on a cushion and gazed at jack with a too intent expression on her too much madeup countenance i watched them closely and i must confess with a strong feeling of jealousy suddenly sarahs eyes met mine and for a moment our glance held and ex changed emnity then sarahs lips parted slightly in a faint sneer and she ignored me i laughed aloud the blood of battle surged through my veins that afternoon there was a skating party we repaired to uncle oscars pond which was smooth and brushed clean of snow like a mirror of glass and now came my first victory i skated beautifully and sarah hunting ton did not skate at all she sat on the edge of the pond looking rather cold and uncomfortable jack weston stood by her and i could see that he was mad to be off i glided up to them smiling isnt this glorious i exclaimed jack looked up at me you bet he agreed do you skate much quite a bit i answered and i love to waltz there came a gleam of interest in his eyes lets send up to the house for the phonograph he suggested then we can dance and off he went like a shot for a moment i was left alone with sarah she looked coldly at me and again i smiled why dont you go back to the house and play bridge with the others who arent skating i suggested you must be frozen here sarah bit her underlip a clever suggestion she snapped no thanks im quite comfortable and she settled herself more firmly against a snowdrift just then came the strains of the blue danube and without more ado i turned and glided toward jack who was coming to meet me from the op posite end of the pond and we danced jack waltzed beautifully on skates and so did i before long we had a group of ad miring onlookers about us and then all the guests arrived to watch that is all except sarah who sat disdainfully at a distance with chattering teeth and frostbitten toes i was elated we all took a nap before dinner i was too excited to sleep so i put on my negligee and spent a half hour uncle oscars house party before the mirror curling my hair with the irons norma rose had lent me and experimenting with her cosmetics when i finished i was exquisite far more lovely than any of the other girls so i thought but i was restless and decided to ex plore the house so i left my room and trailed down the hall to the farthest room the door i approached the piano and seating myself ran my fingers idly over the keys then suddenly a drowsiness crept over me from the dimness and the silence and lay down on one of the great white skins before the fire a moment more and i slept when i awoke jack weston was leaning over me i started up with a little cry a moving frightened bundle was partly ajar and i entered it was the largest apartment i had ever seen in one corner a fire crackled merrily and on the hardwood floor were three great white bearskins with mounted snarling heads the shades were drawn the room almost dark and so quiet and peaceful it was as though people had long ago forgotten to enter it there were heavy rafters in the ceiling and a balcony encircling the entire room and in one corner stood a baby grand its only me he said your skat ing partner oh you frightened me ive been watching you for a long time he continued from the bal cony there are a lot of bunks up there i suppose uncle oscar had them made in case he had an overflow of company anyway i like this room so i slipped away from the crowd and came up i thought everyone was taking a nap i interrupted uncle oscars house party the girls are but the boys are down with uncle oscar in the bar i wish id thought to bring a highball with me i sat up suddenly conscious of my selfmy negligee my curly hair which fell in cascades over my neck and shoulders my time had come now i would vamp this handsome fellow id show sarah huntington a highball i murmured oh id like one too well if youll wait a moment ill go down and get you one jack weston jumped to his feet and strode off a few minutes later he reappeared with a bottle of old burbon two bottles of white rock and glasses we settled ourselves comfortably on the bearskin before the fire that first highball made me a bit dizzy it was so warm by the fire and besides i had never before even tasted of any intoxicant but i persisted if sarah could drink why so could i the second drink made me feel fool ish and soon i was laughing hysterical ly jack weston watched me from beneath lowered eyelashes with an expression of amazement on his hand some face then i snuggled closer to him and looked up at him in the manner i had observed sarah use i love booze and parties and danc ing dont you i cooed laying my head on jacks shoulder he nodded theyre all right he said care lessly there was an awkward silence as a vamp i was failing miserably but i was determined to succeed and i tried again i lifted my lips to within a tantalizing distance of his heres to love and life i mur mured raising my fifth glass of whisky andsoda in a toast suddenly i turned around there stood uncle oscar i jumped to my feet with a fright ened cry and ran toward the door uncle oscar followed me with an in credulous smile but i did not see the smile i thought he was angry and ran all the faster at the head of the stairs i tripped on my train and fell and somehow the carpet came un tacked and wound itself about me as i rolled downstairs when i reached the bottom i was completely immersed in ita moving frightened bundle by the time uncle oscar disen tangled me the whole party had assembled in the hall and were roaring with laughterthat is all except jack weston who stood a little apart an expression of mild disgust on his face and then i saw sarah huntington she had seen jacks disgust and was now grinning at me maliciously as though she would say now see youve made a little fool of yourself a tide of shame and anger swept over me they all thought i was beastly drank and they were right tears welled up in my eyes and coursed down over my cheeks im going home i wailed ii hate all of you again came the roar of laughter who would have thought it sarah huntington said sarcastically she looked so innocent and wouldnt take a drink last night why shes cuckoo actually cuckoo uncle oscars house party i stumbled to my feet and climbed upstairs to my room annalee uncle oscar called i say dont take it that waywhy its only a joke you know but i did not answer and slammed the door to i began to pack sob bing all the while i was so ashamed and my foolishness had lost me jack forever a few minutes later there was a knock on the door whos there i asked crossly its jack weston came the an swer wont you let me speak to you just a moment i opened the door a little way what is it i asked i came to say that im sorry he said you see i didnt know you had never had anything to drink before if i had known i wouldnt have let you take any there was a silence do you mind if i ask why you did take those highballs he asked finally i hung my head and stammered out the truth because i liked you and wanted to attract you sarah hunting ton and the others all drink and vamp and i thought that it was the thing to do jack weston whistled you were all wrong he told me i was aw fully keen about you after we got ac quainted on the pond this morning the others were amusing but you were a pal you were healthy and you arent really going home are you ive got to i answered i could never face the others again oh dont be silly they under stand andwell i did hope we could slip away and go skating this evening theres a full moon and it will be won derful wont you stay please i hesitated then i thought of sarah huntington how happy she would be if i went home and left jack all to her ill stay i murmured blushing slightly and then very softly i closed the door the queen of wheats a story of make believe meeting his eyes through the glass maisie between flips of the pancakes started a game of pretend with the goodlooking stranger little thinking where it might lead them both my breath came quickly i could feel my cheeks burn ing like fire but still he watched me i looked up and met his eyes through the pane of glass thoughtful brown eyes in a grave face that sent a wild pulse quivering in my throat he wasnt the usual type of man who watched me through the window he didnt try to smile at me to ogle me just looked at me gravely with those intense brown eyes look out kid theyll burn i heard some one hiss at my elbow i was back again back with my feet on the whitetiled floor in the white starched dress and the cap with its flaring wings with the white cotton glove on my right hand and the row three deep ten long of wheat cakes wheat cakes that i was dipping turn ing flipping with a light turn of my wrist on thick white plates hed be gone by now i looked up i saw him turn slowly in at the re volving door seat himself at the long table with its marble top and pull off his gloves say kid what do you think youre doing this aint no isle o dreams this is a pancake palace thus jo in kind harsh voice at my elbow im sorry jo im tired better take a turn at the tables i pulled off my white glove mechani cally drew off my stiff cap and faced him timidly thank you jo i faltered but now that i was face to face with romance i felt i could go no farther across there in the corner under the white clock beneath the nickel hooks for coats sat the man with the brown eyesand i was afraid i felt my heart pounding louder i put my hand to the ticket puncher at the queen of wheats my belt andwent over to the table in the earner your order he looked up his eyes were just as brown as i had thought them and a trifle sad his cheeks were thin and bronzed and when he spoke his voice was like velvetbrown velvet wheat cakes and coffee but i had not been a waitress for three months for nothing i knew that his gray suit was tailormade not bought in a store i had seen his fine brown hands the freshness of his linen the cigarette box he had opened set with a monogram in shining jewels i laid down his wheat cakes syrup butter coffee as softly as i could my fingers shook do you like it he said sud denly like it my eyes filled with tears in all those lonely months he was the first one who had asked me that i shook my head tried to wipe away a tear with the back of my hand but he saw me youre different he said slowly it was then it came to methe great the terrible lie why shouldnt i pretend to be different why shouldnt i let him think that i wasnt just maisie who lived in a dark room beneath the thunder of the elevated trains with the smell of cooking and airless rooms and the screams of the children down the hall how did you know i whispered then i stood up stiffly it would never do to let anyone see i might lose my job my precious job and jobs were scarce now when i came back to give him his ticket he asked me without raising his eyes would youtell meyour name not now i said i watched him go i saw him shrug into his coat and pick up his stick catch his soft hat by the crown and go toward the door i wanted to go too to tell him my name what had i done i would never see him again this wonderful man with the brown eyes that made my heart beat faster with the voice that sent a wild thrill through my breast i was very tired when i was through at last my feet ached my head drummed with the constant rattling noise of spoons and forks and knives crashing together so that when i struck the icy air i was almost dizzy i had five dollars left to live on next week i needed a new pair of shoes i ought to pay mrs flynn to night buti would do neither of those things i went into the first store that i saw a great aisle blazing with light and velvet soft beneath my feet i want a monogramed handker chief monograms miss youll have to order that the black silk salesgirl said scornfully i want it nowany monogram i felt my cheeks burn at her scrutiny well theres a few here returned she said and drew forth a handker chief with the initials r l f that will do i paid two of my precious dollars for it tucked it carefully into my battered handbag and went to the per fume counter my heart thumped as i laid out my last three dollars for a vial long as my finger that held ten drops of perfume it was french and bore the name of a famous parfumeur the queen of wheats i had spent my last cent i had to walk the forty blockshome i called it home when i first came to new york i thought it was wonderful to have money of my own and a room of my own and a home of my own but i had been here three months now i knew what it was to cry my self to sleep to wake in the night with my pillow wet with tears longing for someonejust anyone to speak to but i went to sleep that night with perhaps youll laugh the little crushed paper napkin that he had held in his fingers beneath my pil low when i touched it he was near me i could almost feel his eyes look ing deep into mine all next day i waited tremulously for him every time a man with a gray coat passed my breath came fast no he wasnt coming back then at seven oclock he came he took his place at the same table while my heart raced madly and i burned a row of wheat cakes jo will you let me go just to night jo i whispered youll lose your job kid if they ever get onto this he growled but he shoved on the white glove and took the pitcherful of batter from me i dont want anything to eati just want to look at you said the man with the brown eves ive been thinking of you all daydont run away pleaseyour eyes are like gray mist and your hair is like a cloud and your little mouth thereforgive me if youll just smile at me i wont say it again while i went to get his coffee and wheat cakes the blood drummed in my ears all the rattle and crash of china had become like a chorus of beauty ive been thinking of youall day i said it over and over again in my heart i punched his ticket and went back to him i slipped the handkerchief with its drop of french perfume out of my bosom and dropped it carelessly down on the table tomorrows sunday may i come to see you meet your mother and tell her i thought of the black hallway with the gas wheezing faintly and the stairs with the ragged carpet oh the smell of dust and cooking that drifted through those halls and my own room dark and airless with its nar row white cot no no no i whispered ill meet you somewhere at the museum at three i answered yes under my breath and left him it was not until he was gone that i remembered my handkerchief that was gonewith him what did he want of a little girl like me i was the queen of wheats thats what they called me jo and the boys who dished the soup and poured the coffee behind the counters queen of wheatsand he was a gen tleman they didnt marry girls like me i knew enough for that but just once just tomorrowthat would be the last time id see him unless i let him think that i was different too id have to make him think it i tended mrs flynns baby and she gave me a scrap of satin i sat up until two that morning making a hat that crushed down over my hair i prayed that it wouldnt be cold so that i could turn back the collar of my coat and the queen of wheats show my blouse with the crimpled white frill i had ironed in mrs flynns kitchen while she was out andi mustnt let him look at my shoes the soles were patchednot too well as i climbed the steps of the the car moved away slowly with the great lights on its polished guards and a chauffeur in tan livery driving i hid behind the great door trembling a little and when at last he pulled it open his face changed and he smiled and i saw his white even teeth he smiledthat was all museum my heart beat faster and faster i was afraid hed hear the heartbeats in my voice but he wasnt there i asked the guard at the door the time just three little one he said kindly he wasnt coming oh he wasnt coming then i saw a car stop at the curb a great shining car and he stepped out i dont think we said anything to each other he smiled that was all and tucked my hand into his arm and we went across the great corri dors where cold white figures of carved marble looked down on us we were alone that was all that mattered we found a bench and sat down on it and we turned and looked into each others eyes tell me youve been thinking of me he said slowly the queen of wheats have you i faltered he put his hand into his breast pocket and drew out my handkerchief i smelled the faint perfume violets and roses and honeysweet meadows today youre going to tell me your name r l frs for rosamond isnt it but why did you run away from home i had to i whispered the lie not daring to lift shamed lids youre used to open fireplaces and flowers and sunlight and ease they used to bring your breakfast to you on flowered plates with a sprig of sweet geranium on the tray i looked straight ahead of me i smelled the odor of damp floors and yellow soap in the farmhouse id called home until my mother died six years after father i saw the oilclothcov ered tablessmelled the vapor of the oil lamp dont look like that he said sud denly ioh for gods sake you little lovely thing dont think im a cad but i cant ask you to marry me i sat there very still it was as though he had torn out my heart and flung it down at his feet it was dim in the cool corridor across on her white pedestal a marble goddess looked down on us not more cold was her heart than mine was now ive got to go back i tried to say steadily but youll meet me again just once just once more say you will i was weak his voice drained all my strength away and the light in his eyes i looked up at him next i knew he was kissing me fire on my lips a flame wrapped me round then he caught both my wrists and held them tight i didnt want to leave himever but i said goodby at the top of the steps and promised that id meet him next day where it was all going to leadi didnt know i only knew i loved he was a rich man from a different world somewhere id read a story about a king and a beggar maid what happened then im not quite sure i was wrapped in a dizzy dream and as i crossed the street a sudden blinding force hit me i felt myself whirled into a black chasm i woke in a white room and i cried out and sat up i ached so there now youre all right a cool voice told me lie down like a good girl where in the hospital you had an acci dent but youre going to be all right little by little i pieced it together a motor car had run me down and i was getting well in the hospital i had been here three weeks two weeks of them my thoughts had been all hazy i wondered if all the other had been a dream a sick deliriumthe man with the brown eyes and the vel vet voice someone was speaking to me can you tell us now who you are and where you live the nurse asked tears squeezed from beneath my lids i make wheat cakes in the window of a restaurant with the white tiles im just

ing red roses and a frothy thing of lace and silk to wear about my shoul ders i thanked them timidly youre quite comfortable my dear the mother said i tried to thank her she had white hair and a beautiful voice i had never heard anyone talk like her before she had pearls in her ears and pearls at her neck and a great coat of fur that wrapped her softly her daughter had black hair and big black eyes and a white sullen face she pulled out a cigarette from a gold case at her wrist and said lifting her brows do you mind mimi i dont know whether shes quite well enough her mother said mimi

rustled out of the room leaving a faint scent of violets and cigarette smoke and sachet wrapped silks i lay there very still after they had gone smiling a little to myself holding my love tight to my heart what funny things theyd said pretty common little thing she is of course itll ruin his whole future it was as though i had dipped sud denly into icy water the water was coming closer about my

shall i forget the scent of crushed geranium it will always mean heartbreak and de spair and giving up for this world the thing you love the best for i had given him up he was a gentleman i knew from his voice and his hands and i had seen the cigarette case set with his monogram in jewels i used to send the roses and the orchids and the frail white lilies down the hall to the childrens ward i gave my frilled silk coat with its french rosebuds to the young mother in the next room whose husband came to see her every night she wanted to be pretty for him she whispered to me once but the little rosegeranium plant bloomed beside my bed i broke off one of its blooms for the old woman down the hall who came from the country to see if they could save her eyes sometimes i used to hold her rough ened hand while she talked to me rosegeranium on the window sill i had and aunt janes rocker beside it after the bakin was done of a saturdaywhite loaves with dimpled brown crusts and pies of sliced apple and cinnamon pumpkini used to sit down there to get my breath for a bit i can almost see it all dearie when i smell this crushed leaf in my hand the sun coming in warm on jere miahs seedlings and the cat on the old afghan in the corner jeremiah would come up the snowy walk and shout get a good dinner for me ma i got a heck of a lot a work to do somehow i felt if i could see the country after i left the hospital the wide sky and the fields and a farm house snuggled down by the road i might crowd out my heartache i said goodby to mimi and her mother and the old lady from the country and the mother with her downyheaded baby and went back to make wheat cakes they gave me back my job but i didnt hold it more than half a week listen here kid jo said to me that first day you better get some o that bloom that comes in a little round box and put it on them white cheeks and watch your step or youll get the goby i did try but day by day my feet dragged instead of getting quicker and i kept watching all the gray suited forms that came in and got mixed on what i was doing one night when i was putting on my coat and hat jo came up to me say the manager wants to see you now listen if you ever want any help you know who learned you how to turn your first row of wheats i felt weak and tired when i went to the manager he told me that they wouldnt need my services any more i looked in the mirror as i went out my eyes were too big for my face and i saw the tears trembling on the lashes oh god what would i do now i spent the next day looking for work and the next and the next and the next it was on the fourth morning that i met him my knees felt like water when i saw him coming i suppose it was weakness that made me go back to the window where i had worked to see who was queen of wheats now he tucked my hand into his arm without a word love was stronger than i were going to get breakfast first the queen of wheats he said and youre not going to say a word i found myself following him into a hotel dining room to a little table in the corner we were all alone i drank orange juice and ate oatmeal and cream and coffee i felt strength begin to steal back into my body rosamond he said earnestly just for todaythis one day will you come with me i would have gone with him to the ends of the world starved with him died with him he must have read it in my eyes i gave myself into his hands to the station in a train and then i was standing beside him on an icy plat form and he was speaking to me im going to take you to meet my mother must youmust i he almost lifted me into a sleigh that stood by the road and only when he had tucked the robe about me and i heard the high tinkling notes of sleigh bells did i understand all the rest had been a dream our breakfast together our trip on the cindery red velvet seat of the train now i was going to see his mother that would be the end i would read it in her eyes a pretty common little thing he was holding both my hands in his the sleigh stopped with a last peal of bells and i stepped out stiffly we were before a white house on the very side of the road where a bent apple tree covered with feathers of snow and the windowpanes glistening like isinglass in the frost looked like a christmas card he put his arm about me pounded on the door and i stood there breath less agonized praying that his mother would not answer then i was smiling up into the round applecheeked face of a little old woman with white hair brushed back into a wisp and two fat little hands on her broad comfortable woolen dress if it aint jim and his girl she put both her arms about me and kissed me jim drew me into the room with a shining franklin stove and the rag rugs and the carved organ in the corner he put both his arms on my shoul ders now little lovely thing you see my mother can you step down to marry me just a plain farmers boy whos gone to the city to make his way is it true jim i whispered but the case for your cigarettes with the diamonds and the big limousine jim colored dark red they gave it to me the case my boys after the war and the limousine why a chauffeur just picked me up i fooled youbut i had to have you i was afraid you wouldnt marry me if you knew but would you marry me if you knewthat my name is just maisie smith that i spent seventeen years on a farmon a much poorer farm than thisand thats all there is to know the tears were running over my cheeks jim pulled out his big fresh handkerchief and wiped my eyes then he kissed me first on one wet cheek and then the other thank god jim said thats all there is to know thrills thirty years ago a mothers lovestory we modern girls like pep wild youthwell its outward appearance was different thirty years ago but mother shocked grandmother just as much as you shock your parents today if you dont believe it just read this confession this talk of wild youth amuses me my own romance of the nine ties equaled for thrills any gin nourished jazzcrazy love affair of today and i am the mother of a daughter who considers me old fashioned when i voiced my disapproval of necking parties she said scornfully when you were a girl you just sat around on a cushion and waited for a nice man to come along and propose we modern girls like a little pep with our romance we like to have men quarreling over us and if we see a new man we like we go after him i smiled her last two sentences had rolled back the pages of memory and the picture i saw was not at all the prim midvictorian damsel she fancied these young girls of today might not be so selfconfident did they but realize that vamping and spooning did not originate with their own boastedly speedy generation they might heed our remonstrances if they knew that we mothers desire to protect them from the hard knocks we ourselves received i write this true tale in the hope that it may warn these foolish children i do not believe that mens natures have changed since the days of high bicycles bustles and burnsides i do not doubt that these flappers are flirting with fire as i did in my innocence they are tempting peril with their seeking of exciting romance just as i did thirty years ago when i was eighteen i returned home from college for sum mer vacation my mother wept at sight of me and my father stormed i had langtried my hairthat is a barber specializing in the new fad had shorn thrills thirty years ago my curls to a length of three inches over the front of my head leaving a neat length to knot behind after the fashion popularized by lily langtry the jersey lily in vain i protested that other girls at school were wearing their hair that way grandma kenton declared it was all on account of sending me to that fast girls and boys college instead of making me stay at the girls seminary my older brother harry defended me but my younger brother jack considered it a glorious joke come on kate dress like a boy you look like one he jeered i flared into a rage and told them they were all countrified and behind the times then i ordered my little roan dixie saddled and rode across the hills in quest of my chum nanny hiking my voluminous riding habit up to show a defiant inch of ankle june in the river hills of kentucky the ohio a ribbon of gray beyond deep green tobacco fields as i rode along i dreamed another rider beside me his arm about me as in the picture entitled springtime nanny who had been coerced back to the nearby seminary rendered homage to my fashionable coiffure was dully impressed by my collegeacquired worldliness my northern accent from way up above columbus ohio tell me what were the boys like she irrquired eagerly theyre nice i assured her so slick and dudish and citified there was onehe sat across from me in chapel his hair is golden and he has the cutest little burnsides he makes these country boys look like a row of beans oh kate ill bet youre in love nanny clapped her hands im not i protested selfcon sciously but glowing to my description his nose is sort of classical he looks like apollo kate did he kiss you noindeed i exclaimed and added sorrowfully i didnt even meet him nanny folded her arms across her tight gingham blouse and glared at me with infinite disgust kate kenton i never was so ashamed of anybody in my life she we mothers desire to protect our daughters said do you really mean to tell me you didnt manage to get introduced to him anybody would think you were a civil war sissie do you know this is the year when girls have a lit tle spunk but i did try i cried once when i had it all arranged the dean made me do an extra theme so i couldnt go to the party where he was to be and once tom came boging up to see me i was so mad at him i couldnt even take him to the promenade concert he looked so countrified thrills thirty years ago but you used to like tom maybe i did before i went away and learned a few things i said com placently well i dont blame you for being aggravated when he makes such a nuisance of himself agreed nanny and added with deep sarcasm i sup pose you at least found out the fair un knowns name i had and what was more i knew his home address from the student list we agreed that while we had this in formation there was hope but it took two weeks of cooperative scheming to hit upon our final masterly plan simple enough in consideration of the effects it was to have i would send him as if by mistake a letter indited to a fictitious girl friend a yellowed scrap of that letter still flaunts its ingenuous message in a box of keepsakesremnant of a ribbon tied mass of correspondence which at one time was thicker in volume nanny and i composing with laugh ing care fondly imagined our produc tion a triumph of duplicity after two pages of meaningless chatter came the casual allimportant paragraph by the way maude do you remem ber my telling you once i had an un known relative named clarke in ohio i have discovered a picture of a man named alfred clarke in the graduating class at fairfield isnt it odd i didnt meet him all the time i was at school he comes from bacyrus and i am con vinced he is one of the relatives be sides he looks interesting i am writ ing him to find out nannys final suggestion was a stroke of genius in went a small picture of megem of the rural photographers artseated upon a cardboard stone wall beside a painted fern radiant in my best satin basque with four yards of check ered silk sash my dark eyes and set smile looked out from a background of stormy clouds thatll fetch him pronounced nanny youre a pretty girl kate we sent the letter we waitedand at last came his answer it was only a formal note suggesting that obviously i must have gotten en velopes mixed he had read my letter of course and regretted that he could discover no traces of relationship but thought we might talk about that later meanwhile we could be friends he re turned the letter and the photograph but the photograph journeyed back upon request within a month for me that summer was not spaced by sunlit days and starlit nights but by the intervals between letters i sur rounded alfred clarke with a halo of romance he was a composite of ivan hoe launcelot and st elmo the re lationship fiction had disappeared as an excuse for letters he progressed to quotations of sentimental poetry love is like a red red rose come into the garden maude nanny considered it a mean trick that i refused to show her those later letters i considered them sacred tom curtis sweetheart of days before i went to college found small satisfaction in my company that summer he came over several eve nings a week as he had always done stiff in the agony of high leather shoes starched shirt and a tight striped suit which he considered dudish i scorned it for having four buttons while the college boys always wore five i can see his honest tanned face now thrills thirty years ago twisted earnestly as he played when you and i were young maggie or only a pansy blossom on the mouth organ for my amusement how mourn fully he would stare at me when i emerged from my superior preoccupa tion to say i had letters to write then my brothers and he would go out to the stable to tease the colored boy sam into a cakewalk or to put their clipwinged blackbird through its tricks not so long ago i had been anxious for those pleasures now i was grownup i was sure that i was feeling the grand passion of love harry scolded youre awfully highfalutin since you came home from school kate you oughtnt to be so mean to tom hes a good fellowsmart and ambi tious i elevated a disdainful nose he has no polish i said but even as i contrasted tom with my ideal alfred i had to admit that there was something appealing to me in the country boys straightforward brown eyes i felt i could trust him in any emergency one evening in a moment of kindli ness i consented to go walking with him out the road to the sugar maple grove immediately i realized that this was too much encouragement i knew by his weighted silence his rapid breathing that he was going to propose again so i settled myself wearily on a stump to hear him out as usual pops going to send me away to law school this fall he began awkwardly i just wanted to tell you kate i notice you dont care much for me lately but i thought that might make some difference im going to work hard and get an education im sure youll be successful i said wondering how i could hurt him least wont you get engaged to me kate he blurted out if i get to be a famous lawyer wont you marry me no tom i said melodramatically feeling the heroine of a novel i love another who is he tom wanted to know angrily he is a prince of dreams i an swered tom could not understand that he thought it a piece of girlish foolishness he said well i guess youll find me still hanging around when you get done dreaming kate i felt sorry for tom for a few hours then forgot all about him in the re ceipt of breathtaking news alfred wrote he was coming to see me en route to take a position in st louis he would arrive within a week on the steamboat from cincinnati i flew into a panic of preparation i must have a new fall dress of blue cash mere the parlor sofa must be re upholstered in red plush the house must be decorated with garden flowers sam must polish the phseton and dixies harness i must get new views for the stereopticon glass everything possible must be done to honor this visiting prince i boasted to mother of his excellent family knowing well how to win her favor who was so proud of her blue blood i told my father how ambitious alfred was of course i told neither of them the manner in which i had made his acquaintance nevertheless they remained unen thusiastic reserving their judgment on this stranger from a school which was thrills thirty years ago so fast that girls there langtried their hair i knew though that whatever their doubts they would receive alfred hos pitably i was not so sure of jack he was teasing me about my dude when on the day before alfreds arrival i surveyed the whitecolumned but nothing i imagined was half so thrilling as the events which were really to happen father announced that he would go with me to meet the boat at the river town five miles away he stated firmly that it was improper for a young lady to go journeying alone to meet a young man whom her parents did not know i worshiped and smiled my best smile porch with its vista of mahogany stair case mammys fresh apple pies and blackberry cakes myself in my new dressvery full of bustled skirt and skimpy of blouse with stylish epaulets of black braidi felt thoroughly satisfied i pictured the thrill of riding with him through the sugar maple grove where the first hint of autumn now reddened the leaves of sitting beside him on the sofa nnd making the perusal of my autograph album an excuse for holding hands i chafed against this restriction which i considered oldfashioned and severe we compromised father would take me to town and be introduced to alfred to pass upon him as suitable company then i would be permitted to drive my guest home in the phaeton and father would come back with sam in the buggy the arrival of the morning mail was an important event in chatham the whole town flocked to the wharf as to a grand reception i gloried in my con thrills thirty years ago spicuous positionkate kenton all dressed up to meet her city beau my heart beat as though it would burst through the boned blouse as i saw him walk across the gangplank there were the golden burnsides the handsome profile i had admired so ardently in chapel he seemed slim and superior to the surrounding rustics how aristocratic he was i gloated on every detail of his fashionable grace small black hat graystriped suit with its tight coat and trousers gold watch fob yellow chamois vest how i managed the introduction i dont know i was blushing furiously that is one trick this generation seems to have lostor perhaps the blush can not penetrate rouge alfred took dixies reins that wily horse realizing that the driving was in a strangers hands and one unskilled in the ways of equines took the oppor tunity to amble lazily along plucking at stray wisps of clover beside the road i was too much in awe of alfred to offer any suggestions about whipping dixie up so we moved along at a snails pace i knew that father and sam who had tactfully taken the longer road would reach home an hour before us alfred seemed perfectly at ease he smiled upon me complacently and talked a great dealall about himself he was going to be general manager of a wholesale woolen house in st louis he had belonged to five clubs at fair field i worshiped and smiled my best al luring smile i called it sparkingmy sideway glances and little smiles to day they call it vamping it had results then as now dixie meandering up the hill paused restfully in the shade of a tree alfreds arm slid about my waist and his golden burn sides tickled my cheek as he bent to ward me one kiss he whispered mark the difference between my daughter and me i was fright ened a kiss was a tremendously im portant thing to methe seal of an en gagement never to be lightly squand ered besides men didnt admire girls who gave kisses easily so much as i worshiped alfred i protested nervously you mustnt do that im not that kind of girl not thatwhat in the name of jehoshaphat did you write to me and ask me down here for then he inquired candidly i was horrified and yet i had to ad mit that alfred was justified in his opin ion since i had been so bold another fearit would be terrible to quarrel with my vaunted city beau even before we reached home i thought we could be friends i murmured ill be bumswizzled said alfred you fixed up that letter just to get ac quainted and now youre as cool as an old hen in a snowstorm i did not know what to say to that apparently he took heart from my si lence for this time he tightened his embrace and tried to snatch the kiss i slapped him sharply and then re coiled in terror at my deed he would be angry and leave and i would be dis graced i was unhappily conscious that we were in plain view of a nearby farm house i waited for alfred to descend from that buggy and start walking back to ward town i anticipated the jokes i would have to endure from my brothers instead he laughed a short ugly laugh that said plainly ill get even thrills thirty years ago had i only taken warning from the evil intent in that laugh but i was only sensible to the feeling of relief that he was not going to make a scene he picked up dixies reins and we went on in a painful silence maybe i had been foolish to refuse him that kiss tom had kissed me once i remembered the sweetness of that first shy kiss out in the orchard when i was so young and foolish that i thought i loved tom i stole shy glances at the handsome profile beside me and regretted the blow that had brought a dark flush to that admired cheek alfred did not betray his wrath upon presentation to my family he was a peerless chesterfield my mother de clared him refined and distinguished my father privately pronounced him a slick conceited dude jack mim icked his manner in mincing step be hind the woodhouse to the glee of the servants despite our strained relations i still considered him the acme of perfection probably sophisticated girls were glad to give him kisses probably he con sidered me a silly prig i tortured myself with such regrets but was far too shy to make any ad vances against his careful coolness doubtless alfred would have eaten his fill of kentucky fried chicken and gone his way had it not been for two circumstances that aggravated him to the villainous act of which i was the innocent victim i do not think that alfred was the real stuff of which villains are made he was too cowardly but he played his part melodramatically tom curtis was the first circum stance he inveigled alfred into a wrestling matchpopular sport of the country boysand tripped him to a heavy fall of course tom despised his rival alfred arose with a scowl he rel ished his bumped head and humiliation little i know now he had learned from jack that tom was my country beau i am sure that one of his motives was a subtle vengeance on tom who had hurt his pride the second circumstance was a rain storm which interrupted a picnic party and drove the two couplesalfred and me harry and nannyto shelter under the hanging rocks of a hillside in the twinkling of an eyealfreds eyesthe little flirtation i had thought so badly aground on the reefs of our initial quarrel took an astonish ing turn we pressed back against the cliff away from the driving storm we could hear the others voices from be yond a clump of bushes my pink gingham dress was soaked through and the wide skirt whipped about me like the folds of greek drapery i was pain fully aware that the stays of my tight boned blouse were outlined clearly in the wet cloth that my form was clearly moulded but i was not prepared for the effect upon alfred he had caught my hand in the scramble for shelter now he retained it and bent over me as grace fully as the cramped space would permit so youre not that kind of girl he smiled i blushed his eyes were appraising well little miss prunes and prisms youre a pretty girl and i think ill take that kiss i strained away from him listen pretty kate will you elope with me he whispered thrills thirty years ago i had not heard aright i could not believe that thus suddenly out of the blankness of disappointment had come this romantic proposal what i asked staring up at him now give me the kiss he seized me by the shoulders and kissed me long lingeringly my halfhearted struggles were as a pygmys i was overwhelmed thrilled by the adventure and i firmly believed that i was in love wewe mustnt i protested feebly were going to run away together arent we come on kate dear in a moment my cheek was upon the shoulder of his wet coat our troth was plighted our plans were briefly completed to elope that very night well get married in cincinnati wont we i whispered the only argument in my mind was whether or not it would be proper to wait until we reached there since we would have to be on the steamboat to gether all the next day all right assented alfred hur riedly as though that part didnt inter est him i remember that he drank three of fathers mint juleps after dinner enough to exhilarate even a seasoned kentuckian he whispered to me that he was celebrating and added that he would go to the crossroads store to buy a rope for our escape i was sure that i was the luckiest girl alive to have such a lover such a romance such an adventure how en vious nanny would be i slipped away to my room to pack i arranged a bundle of dainty handsewn linen petti coats and underwear cashmere hose my pink and white fascinator scarf my best plaid silk i was chewing a pen over the delicate task of composing a note to calm mothers hysterics when i heard swift footsteps on the stairs the door was flung open and alfred dashed in and closed it behind him i gasped his collar and tie were torn away his hair was disheveled and a swelling bruise was slowly but surely obscuring one beautiful gray eye weve got to go right away he panted whats the matter we cant i was incoherent in my surprise alfred snapped at me listendont ask questions i got into a fight with some bullies at the store i want to get out of this place as soon as possible i shrank away from him i dont want to go with you when you act like that i wailed he mustered a reassuring smile im sorry he soothed i am ex cited please come with me now we can go down the back stairs everyone is in front we can take the creek road i was prepared to follow alfred or rather that romance of which he was the symbol through any peril i tiptoed down the back stairs obedi ently quietly fearful of wakening the sleeping sam i led dixie out and we saddled her she stumbled down the rough creek road sadly overloaded by the double burden we did not make swift progress despite alfreds evident eagerness for haste there was plenty of time for me to think over my folly we had planned to elope at dawn to catch the early boat now we must be out all night that meant disgrace and if our absence were discovered thrills thirty years ago my father would be waiting at the boat that meant an end to eloping these fears i communicated to alfred who was lashing dixie along furiously theres no use hurrying i pointed out we cant get the boat till five anyway cant risk the boat said alfred shortly got to sleep out tonight and catch a train from maysville in the morning cant make this damned horse go any farther tonight he turned dixie into the black creek woods where a slim tracery of moonlight fell through ghostly trees i was fright ened at these gloomy surroundings and clung to alfred well have to find a farmhouse i cried if we find a farmhouse your father will find us said alfred no miss prisms here we stay perhaps my daughter would smile at my shock he could not have horrified me more had he asked me to commit a murder all the conventions i had been taught to hold sacred were violated i wont i said and jumped down into the crackling carpet of autumn leaves i wont do any such thing im going back home alfred was beside me he grasped my arms and held them tight no you dont he snarled see here young lady youve done enough to deserve anything i want to do now you got me down here by writing fake letters and let me be made fun of by a bunch of country jakes now youre going to stay right here with me be sides youre a darned pretty girl why the hurry my polished city beau was distress ingly transformed he pressed close against me and his breath was hot on my cheek there we struggled silently savagely in the darkness i bit his hand hit at him finally i was free and i ran tripping on roots hampered by my awkward bustle heed less of where i was going i could hear his footsteps crunching through the leaves after me i paused behind a tree and watched his dark silhouette go plunging on i dared not cry for help for i knew he would be the only one to hear i sat there beside the tree shaking with cold sick with disgust at my own silly mistakes again his footsteps approached blind with fear i ran once more and this time i found a path clear in the moonlight though half covered with leaves i picked up my skirts and sped along rounded a corner and almost col lided with a horseman one glance at his face in the moonlight sufficed to set me laughing and crying together it was tom i clung to his boots and begged him to take me home nor paused to con sider the fortunate coincidence that had brought him here he lifted me up before him and then only thenspoke he said in a quiet ominous voice where is that fellow how did you know i was aghast oh tom im ashamed i wonder if the true swain of a girl today would be as enraged as tom was did he suspect the same thing tom suspected ill kill him he muttered kate ill kill him for this nohehe didnt even get to kiss me tom i ran away he is some where in the woods tom vented his relief in a gusty sigh even as i spoke alfred stumbled out thrills thirty years ago tom returned smiling you didnt kill him i gasped before us he halted and stared then he wheeled about and took to his heels tom was off the horse and after him i heard the swish of thrashedup leaves the crash of branches tom returned smiling you didnt kill him i gasped no i only kicked him he said happily that was the last i ever heard of alfred save the word that a battered dusty youth had clambered on the steamboat bound for cincinnati i drew from tom after much ques tioning the story of how he discovered our elopementhe was not one to play the hero it seemed that alfred inspired by the mint juleps had bragged of his ability as a kidykiller to the group at the cross roads store had boasted he could elope with me when he wanted and added certain insinuations tom had heard and knocked him down then fearing he had escaped too easily tom rode over to my hometo find the elopers fled we modern girls like a little pep with our romance i smile when i think of my selfassured young daugh ters philosophy if we see a man we like we go after him i must repeat her flippancy to her father tom how he will laugh at it but i hope if she ever comes fool ishly to a moment of appalled disgust at her own shortsightedness she will find the real meaning of romanceas i dida romance that protects are you a lloyd fan this is harold lloyd as he appears in doctor jack his latest picture with the beautifully blond mildred davis if you are a lloyd fanas doubtless you areyou would find harold lloyd all you had expected if you met him in real life but one thing would be different they told me mr lloyd is in there and i entered a room in pathes office and looked all around and then my eyes rested on a slender smiling young man whose rather darkish rather sensitive features bore out something of the celtic in his name though absolutely nothing of that gets over in the harold lloyd we all know on the screen and of course he did not wear the glasses that are such a familiar part of his comedies harold lloyd when told he didnt look much like himself in real life admitted it was a fact that afforded him much amusement in hollywood for instance he can drop into any motion picture house where one of his comedies is being shown and hear everybodys comments on himself and his work without anybodys sus pecting that he is among those present he tells of an amusing incident in this connection once in a spirit of off of course screen comedy he applied to dorothy gish for a job as extra quite kindly and patiently miss gish explained to him that he did not look italian enough for the partand all the time at the back of the room a friend of mr lloyds was doubling with laughter while harold lloyd gravely prolonged the scene as long as possible another thing you would note at once in mr lloyd if you talked with him only a few minutes is his way of chatting easily and pleasantly on almost any subject except himselfnew york high buildings and slow traffic his admiration for mary pickford his conception of the masculine lead in the tailormade man which he thinks should show the irrepressible spirit to carry on that would make itself felt even in the company of people already unfavorably prejudiced and all prepared to be antagonistic and his conception of this role gives you a good picture of the personality of mr lloyd he confesses that he likes dancing and dances a great deal that his regulation attire consists of patent leather oxfords navy blue suit black tie and white shirt that the comedies that made him famous were made in two or three days for each picture one picture following another without interruption after weeks of this harold lloyd will tell you they had to rest awhile because they were oversupplied it doesnt occur to him that rest was necessary after those strenuous weeks he bids you goodby with that characteristic smile head thrown back and a glint of teeth and you take away the impression that harold lloyd is keenly interested in everybody that he considers each opinion offered never voicing dissent but carefully weighing each viewpoint offered him the price of a flophouse bunk told by a downandout eagerly a newspaper is caught up and padded under the coat when you see a shabby human wreck shuffle past on a bitter night dont you wonder what brought him to want this is the story one poor wretch tells do you know what a flop joint is was there ever a time in your life you walked the midnight streets endlessly jingling the few coins in your pocket debating whether to buy a bed for the night or hold the money for that muchdesired breakfast in the morning did you ever watch the stars slowly fade behind a murky wall of banking clouds while the chill wind shrieks through the deserted streets as the first snowflakes drift downadvance warn ing of the white pall that will soon cover the city to think of a bench in the park is sheer nonsense lynxeyed policemen prevent any doorway comfort saloons are a thing of the past and the allnight pool rooms and eating houses dont want you unless you can pay the flakes come in feathery puffs now the wind from across the court house park whistles through the bare trees and penetrates the thin clothes you wear bed or breakfastthe three nickels in your pocket will pay for one or the other a crumpled newspaper hurtles across the pavement that means a whole lot tonight eagerly it is caught up and padded under the ragged coat to help keep warm the flakes are thick now then a harder blast brings a hail of sleet and frozen drops pelt the face like bullets the price of a flophouse bunk there is no further choice a glass sign with red letters is the beacon of decision you will have to flop a giant man in blue with brass buttons bending before the onrushing storm hastens the affirmative you heard to day it was thirty days for street loiterers instead of the usual ten on the rock pile the three nickels drop on the counter as the grayhaired clerk hands out a key for the flop bunk it is warm here anyway and the newspaper under the torn coat is tossed in the wastebasket the paper was soaked halfway through an iron cot in a wirepartitioned celllike room no sheets or pillow cases grimy blankets and creaky springs but that warm air from the hissing steam radiators was the main thing the dull lead color paint of the walls the wire glass windows the one chair no tottels no mirror but it was warm i knew that sleep had better come quickly for it is no good lying on the lumpy straw mattresswondering for three years i have been flopping every day with a problem how to eat or where to sleep many days and nights pass without either my eyes are wideopen tonight the dull gray of the flop ceiling slowly melts as memory flits back and i am staring at the ceiling of my apartment in the majestic the wire partitions become the lincrusta walton panels and the battered chair my reading table by my brass bed those soft footfalls on the stone floor as the aged clerk shows another bum his flop is henry carrying away my clothes to be pressed and ready for morn ing that tattered coat of mine is the evening dress i have tossed on the chair as i went to bed to dream of arlene drexel yes this is roger sherwood lying here with not one cent to rub against another roger sherwood whom the society journals hinted would doubtless wed the beautiful drexel heiress why here now i often talk with the bums in the park sometimes i questioned the men in the workhouse when i had to stay there for short terms their stories while different in detail contain most of the essentials of my case pretense makebelieve reach ing out for the substance and grasping the phantom just where i got the notion i was cut out for a social career has al ways been a mystery to me from what source came the big ideas of splurge and show i never did know my folks were scarce more than la boring people in a quiet new england village my dreams started when i was still in school and during the adolescent period i chafed at the restraints of the small town and my folks poverty i devoured all the trashy literature i could get and imagination soared to the big cities with the white ways of brilliant lights i often wonder if the spoiling process did not start with my folks and teachers calling me the pretty kid i do know full well that in later years when gush ing women told me i was goodlooking i liked to hear it and rather expected it soon as i was old enough and had a little money despite the pleadings of my people i went to the city it had been a long cherished family plan that i should go to work in the local general store but the small town was a prison walled in to me the price of a flophouse bunk i finally secured a position in a whole sale house in the old section of the city the concern was composed of old fashioned business men who had in herited the place from father to son they employed a large number of peo ple and did a worldwide exporting trade there was little system but common honesty seemed to prevail throughout the establishment the senior member of the firm a man nearly seventy took a liking to me and promoted me rapidly from my modest boarding house i moved to a small hotel on the west side and enjoyed the luxury of a room with bath first as an interested spectator i mingled in the night life of the city then i met people and gradually had my regular haunts and the circle of those who in my mind were enjoying life to its utmost with this came the desire for clothes and style my savings dwindled as i ordered expensive outfits and equip the dull gray of the flop ceiling slowly melts lack of funds for the first few years kept me within a limit of decency as to doing much around town but i still dreamed and went about observing and growing in determination some day to break into the giddy whirl of the night life in less than five years i was made cashier and handled vast sums of money each day the old man was getting feeble now but still came down to the office daily my salary was sixty dollars a week and i had saved considerable money ment it fed my vanity to have the girls compliment my looks and suggest a new style to me with these new friends came others and thus invitations to homes i saw the value of having church affiliations and went to the most exclusive places of worship in the city there i met more folks and received more invitations i knew to hold these friends i must return their entertainment so i moved to the majestic hotel and engaged the services of a valet to look after my things the price of a flophouse bunk all this soon consumed my savings and fully intending to repay it from the next salary check i borrowed one hundred dollars from the cash drawer it was never missed as i had full charge of the money and did not have to give any account of details the old man or his son asked me each day how we stood in the bank how collections were and then forgot about it i did not figure i was stealing this money i even made out a charge slip row another hundred there was such a pile of bills in the drawer the five twenties did not seem to diminish it so i really felt it would not hurt much to use it awhile at intervals especially when alone at night the dread possibility of de tection would nearly overcome me and then some jaunty feeling would prevail that i was not stealing i felt sure some thing would turn up so i could pay it back i was fool enough to imagine the old and i am in my apartment and henry is carrying away my clothes of the amount but put it in my pocket instead of the drawer in my own mind i was strictly honest just tem porarily in need of funds to maintain my social position the next week i borrowed another hundred because i had been invited to attend a weekend party in the country and needed a lot of outing clothes it was at this party i met arlene drexel later i entertained her and a big crowd at the theater and had to bor man especially would be pleased to know he was my benefactor and rejoice in my social career more than glad to lend me the money if he knew of it the son i did not figure on as he was in the buying department and had very little to say around the office i was so convinced the old man would be proud of me when i finally did tell him i drewr a mental picture of him clasping my hand and with tears in his eyes begging me to consider the loan as canceled forever this is the fool way i excused my stealing the price of a flophouse bunk i joined many clubs every night i was in a dress suit and attending social affairs every week my apartment had a merry party of friends where elaborate meals and costly wines were served my wardrobe was the envy of the other men who in reality had ample wealth to spend if they so chose in a daze of attention flattery and luxury i hurtled along borrowing money by the handful each week the first hundred had grown to thousands and now i lost the sense of honor in figuring on its return and thought only how much more i could get without detection to arlene i told a fairy tale of wealthy relatives in new england i was just working downtown to learn business matters the better to handle my vast inheritance when the time came i got the story around some how to the men and surmised they be lieved it because they accepted me so willingly not knowing it was my good times they were after in fact i complimented myself i was an artist of pretense and fully believed myself it was all taken as gospel truth trembling in my arms at the mcnaughton house party arlene promised to be my wife i had won the heights of social prom inence soon as i was married i figured on putting up some big tale of temporary money stringency and securing a big sum from my wife or her father and thus make good with the concern then the old man of the concern died three days later a firm of profes sional auditors came to check up the books to settle the estate still deluding myself i blandly put my note in the safe deposit box of the safe and figured they would pass it as sufficient collateral for the shortage just before closing time a coldeyed grimvisaged man laid his hand on my shoulder and i was under arrest four years and six months i marched in the lock step and then was once more a free man but even worse than be hind the bars the grind of conscience kept right on the world was open for me to win my way but i had destroyed the one thingcharacterand hated myself it was no use the people did not want a convict here i am in a flop joint tonight and no breakfast tomorrow morning the boys in my home town are all still there happy contented working and being just what they are wanting to be what i was not caused all this pretense has brought me only the price of a flophouse bunk music hall artist dies almost in want those who knew marie lloyd the music hall artist who died recently assert she earned more money in the course of her career than any other actress not excluding sarah bernhardt her market value so to speak in the music halls was as high when she died as at any time in her life and normally she earned anywhere from to pounds a week her generosity was something fabulous she gave away hundreds of pounds as other people give away shillings it is said she kept a long list of pensioners to whom she gave a fixed sum each week keeping a big bag of silver for that purpose arid she died practically penniless seed of hate told by a french mother every war leaves its innocent victimsseed of the invaders hate not because auguste was french nor because he was german but because of the infinite possibilities of childhood in this little one the best in both nations came uppermost that sunday in may of the year was like all other sundays so it seemed to me from behind a curtained window in our redtiled cottage i furtively watched auguste my son he was trudging down the road his sabots puffing little clouds of dust from the dry ground he was bareheaded and the sleeves of his gray blouse were rolled up above his elbows for years now i had silently endured the weight of a great sorrow and my heart held an unquenchable hatred i had never experienced the happiness of an outward expression of affection toward auguste whenever we were alone mother and son i was silent or reserved among the neighbors i had schooled myself in a coldness which the situation demanded it was vestlemann the hun father of augustefrom him came my sorrow for him was my hatred loyalty to france forbade my showing affection toward a son from such a union but auguste was good to look upon strong in face and sturdier than most boys of seven though his flaxen hair and white eyebrows were evidence of his hun blood his patience before the insults of the villagers and his unfailing good nature had not caused them to forget his father they pitied me in my patient martyr dom marveled at my righteous hatred and approved of my rigid reserve toward auguste the great war was still a vivid mem oryand he the living reminder of it but that sunday afternoon i sat be hind the curtains watching him near hector pineairs field of ripen ing clover i saw auguste meet celestine souvegean and her little sister anne marie the smaller child was chasing a zigzagging yellow butterfly celes tine called sharply the little one ran panting back and clung to her sisters short skirts she turned a frightened face upon my auguste he hung his head just below philippe berube stood chatting with eloie bosquette the tan ners son seed of hate auguste jealously watched their ani mation and ringing laughter then philippe spied him whispered something to young bosquette they eyed him sharply as he passed the hot blood of shame and defiance rose to my cheeks at this even so hes better than they i thought was he to blame for any thing then i watched auguste turn slowly from the road following the softer meadow path and then up the rocky incline to the blasted walls of m de la chaubriands chateau since the great war the village had been entirely rebuilt with the excep tion of this ancient pile during the years its yawning ruins were to stand as a miserable witness of frances martrydrom here was my augustes favorite re treat here he found his only friends for the birds at least sang for him i turned from the window and that sunday afternoon i recalled the day a year or two before that he came running in it seemed a couple of rollicking girls driving cows from the meadows had snapped their fingers at him jeering bah you little boche it had been keen sport for them wondering my auguste had come home and asked me for an explanation nimporte i had replied coldly hurry with the cow now we had a sickly one in the south pasture then and then one day m fontaine the schoolmaster had dropped in he told me about my auguste and that lamor eaux boy auguste had accosted the other childforced to it i confess say jean why do they call me boche what is itthis name so m fontaine repeated their words to me its you youre a hun or so my mother says anyway is it an evil thing then jean surely the most on earth youre a german your father was a boche in the great war how is that auguste had per sisted wasnt he for france didnt he stick for our side mais non not frenchthats why he was a boche soldier i tell you but mamanshewe are french listen stupid young jean had been ready to whisper the damning words when m fontaine thought it time to interrupt he called sharply to jean so bit by bit the tragedy had been unfolded at last my auguste under stood all save my coldness it pressed on his heart that thing yet he took the blame of it himself oh how i hated myself but my duty to francewhat could i do no more did the poor child try to win a kind word or even a caress and all the while i worshiped himin secret that sunday afternoon in may i remembered the time my auguste slipped from the bridge that raw spring day into the swollen river near the falls and young bosquette had jumped in and pulled him out it was a brave thingfor folk might blame him afterwards coming home with au guste his clothes clutching his shiver ing body like icy fingers i heard young bosquettes mother scolding him across the way fi done was the bridge too nar row for the clumsy donkeys feet to haul out that son of a boche enough disgrace for us all indeed and i had scolded too over ruined seed of hate clothes later i hated myself and wept auguste never knew and once or twice during the earlier years on christmas eve my auguste had placed his sabots in the chimney place like any expectant french child surely le pêre noel would find some thing in his pack for him so thought my auguste but no le pêre noel had nothing for little huns it seemed not even a cotton handkerchief or a few bonbons after that auguste never bothered about his sabots in the chimney and then had come vestlemanns first visit it was night he stole in auguste in bed had wakened at my cry crept out and stood listening in the moonlight i saw him watching his father that fat face those arrogant nar row eyes and he listened to our talk surprised vestlemann had jerred poor welcome for your wandering one be still fool i had flared theyll tear you to pieces what do you want begone then vestlemann had whined you wont tell them give me to eat our little son what of him i saw my auguste slip back into the dark shadow and all those years he had been tast ing the bittersweet years that had been filling his heart to overflowing for my auguste had red blood in his veinsand his little heart was strong it was near revolt after all these years then had come that wonderful day a year ago auguste had been to his quiet retreat near the ruined chateau and thenvestlemann had come again i was alone he forced himself on me he talked vaunted himself and threatened i was silent here am i and here i stay he had announced now bring out that ugly boy his father will look at him auguste he isnt here i had an swered begone you before i call the people to hang you from a tree oh i weighed my words with hatred and then came my auguste into the cottage who is it this man he had de manded of me vestlemann i hissed he turned our little son is it he took augustes hand and looked searchingly into his face then cast a narrow eye over his wellknit figure why do you come here my auguste demanded moving over to my side how my heart fluttered with pride we dont want you continued my auguste be still i commanded for i feared the man but my eyes filled with tears as the boy stood defiantly between me and vestlemann be still yes the man shouted then he got to his feet and moved fat loose and ugly like a toad across the room back i cried come be again my friend he whined go away threatened auguste the mans face became purple as the boy stood defiantly in front of him you you boy he choked bring a drink for your father or or auguste did not move except that his breath came quicker the cognacthereon the shelf seed of hate i cried for the man was in a bad way for himen verité you mean it exclaimed my auguste doubting eyes searching my face yes he left the room at once brought back the bottle and put it upon the table there you he said scornfully then vestlemann grasped the bottle and gulped down some of the amber liquor his eyes opened wider and a crafty smile crept over his face were swollen he lunged and choked unable to speak reaching over the table he attempted to grasp auguste his rage uncontrolled the bottle crashed past his face not even grazing it and splintered into countless bits but vestlemann drew back as from a blow his cheeks reddened his breath coming in gasps then as i watched him powerless he suddenly straightened up pressed a hand to his head the blood had left his face i could see the cold dampness vestlemann drew back as from a blow she thereis crazy he stuttered she dont forget not her mendif ferent then he raised the bottle again to his thick lips how i loathed him charitable us men women bahbetween swallows then he set the empty bottle on the table and started slowly toward my auguste scowling suddenly he lunged forward trying to grasp the boy i cried out to warn him auguste sprang nimbly aside grabbed up the empty bottle from the table and drew back his arm ready to strike vestlemann had turned about to watch him the veins at his temples on his hands groping for the chair behind him he fell back his cheeks bellowed and puffed in his struggle for breath he made an effort to pull him self up then slid from the chair to the floor twitched stiffened relaxed he was dead apoplexy rage had been his undoing but the strain of it auguste got his senses back first he stole to the body on the floor peered at it then ran out of the cottage calling for help i followed after him jean lubin came quickly from his door across the way they buried vestlemann near the seed of hate ruins of m de la chaubriands chateau everybody said it was the hand of god but they gazed kindly at auguste and thats the story no more fur tive glances through the curtains to watch my auguste now on sun days he sits on the doorstep before the cottage instead of stealing away by him self and then i come and sit beside him taking his hand in mine he rests his flaxen head upon my shoulder then we sit in silence while the neighbors gather timidly about and linger awhile saying little understanding much laurette taylor will be seen soon in the screen version of peg o my heart tell your troubles to the trouble doctors department trouble the trouble with most of us is that we think happiness is something to snatch at we think a force blind as a throw of

plantsand ahem let us say flowers because people includes the fair and femi nine sex toounfold or rather their natures should unfold and develop when you and i come to a standstill dont developthen we stop seeing and wanting clearly instead of want ing the things that make us happy or at least contented citizens of the world we want something or somebody who or which may be all wrong for our own peace of mind so all of you who love somebody who it seems does not care for you as you wish or somebody who belongs to another or somebody who leaves you in doubtthe thing to do is this for the time being center your attention on something else say to yourself that you will spend your time developing and improving yourself making your self into the sort of person who is lov able and take a little time and find out how many different possibilities there are of enjoyment in this world which after all is the only world of which we have any very definite knowl edge improve yourself watch your own

sign some initial or identifying name your own is not necessaryand then watch the next three or four numbers of this magazine the trouble doctor will have his answer printed right under your question questioni am sixteen years of age and am dearly in love with a young man nineteen who says he loves me in return but wants to go away to get education or learn a trade and i am awfully afraid if he goes he wont come back would i be doing wrong in trying to keep him here tedy galveston answerthe difference between selfish and unselfish love is this when you love another selfishly you are thinking of yourself first and when you think first of the wel fare of another your love is un selfish now if you persuade a young man to give up his plans for the future if you hamper his ambitions it looks as though you are thinking of yourself first and as for his feeling toward you changing while he is away why he could change while he is right in the same town as you why not take the chance questionwhen i was sixteen i met a man whom i later learned to love dearly my first love he was always declaring his love for me and urging me to marry him when he was free which i consented to do but he began drifting away from me yet always declaring his love for me i am eighteen years old now and in order to forget my heartache and bruised pride i married a man who loves me dearly after my marriage the first man still said he loved me i am desperately unhappy as i love this other man who also is married now my husband loves me and trusts me so much but havent i right to happiness my heart is just breaking when i hear of this other man whom i still love but cannot have what shall i do will i ever find happiness with the man i love brown eyes calif answeryou have a right to hap piness surely as has everybody yet i cant see that it is your husband who stands in the way of your attaining it it looks to me as if the obstacle in the way of your contentment is this other man when you were free he had an opportunity to marry you yet he did not take advantage of it and no mat ter what you think the mere fact that you married another goes to prove that you were not altogether satisfied with this first man your marriage was an attempt to forget this first man well go on with the effort in that direction how can you help doubting this other mans declaration of love when it is not reinforced by plans on his part to secure legal freedom for himself and you too no i cannot see where this other man could make you happy cant you see that he is playing doginthemanger questioni am a girl of nineteen and i have a very good position but i want to go to a business college what would you advise me to do m r chattanooga tenn answerthere must be in your town a good night school with business courses why not keep your position if you need the money and go to school nights you might have to cut out some pleasure to do so yet you would find it worth while questioni am very much in love with a sailor boy whom i met about six weeks ago he comes to see me whenever his ship lands he is twentyfour and i am seven teen do you think my age makes any difference how can i find out if he loves me in return and how may i win his love r t wash answernot so much your age but your attitude makes a difference it is the natural law for a girl to in spire a man with a desire to win her and whenever the girl is the one who wishes to do the winning she is all too apt to find the man does not rightly value her affection now i would ad vise you and all girls who feel as you say you do about any man to just tell your troubles to the trouble doctor make yourself forget about the man in question dont say you cant just make use of your pride and let the man feel that you are the one to be won hell like you all the better if this is so that doesnt mean that you have to be proud and stiff it means it is the girls place to learn how to be attractive and wait for the man to make it quite clear that he is attracted questioni am a girl nineteen years of age my mother died when i was twelve years old so i have just been knocked from pillar to post ever since with no one to care for me but three years ago i met a wealthy young fellow four years my senior and fell in love with him i am not happy although he gives me everything a girl could wish for and is very good to me he has promised to marry me several times but when the time comes he never mentions it and it seems that i cant stand it any longer this way but i dont want to give him up so please tell me what to do for i am so very distressed unhappy answerlearn how to support yourself in doing so you will come in contact with other people and the chances are that in time this man will seem less necessary to you as it is it looks as if you are mortgaging your future for the sake of a doubtful present happiness you are so young that you should have all sorts of possibilities if you work now to make your future what you want if you can bring yourself to break with this man it will be for the best and sometimes a man will marry a girl who comes from a different sta tion of life if its a question of mar riage or losing her that had better be your attitude anyhow questioni am a girl seventeen years old there is a boy whom i care for very much i went with him for a whole year and now we do not go togetherthe reason i do not know he still talks to me and dances with me there is another boy i like also and i think he cares for me but i dont seem to get around him in the right way i have been in his company also but at times he seems to be jealous and likes to say smart things and then hell come up to me and say are you mad which do you advise me to go with the second boy likes to be coaxed and petted we have had two quarrels the first time i made up and the last time he made up should i keep up his friendship jakaline answerdont take this boyand girl goingwith so seriously you are at the age where you ought to be going out with any boy of whom your parents approve dont allow any of them to be serious with youyet you are too young be friends by all means with both but not sentimental with either keep at the back of your mind the image of the man youll fall in love with really by and by when you are older save your sentiment for that time let the others like you but keep them at arms length let them do the guessing questioni am a young girl seven teen years and am very much in love with a young man of twenty i have one more year of high school he says he loves me but i am in doubt how am i to know whether he means what he says he tells everyone about me and calls me his girl i go with other boys they also tell me how much they think of me and invite me to go places but i always refuse as i feel that i ought not to when this young man thinks so much of me how can you tell whether a young man really cares for you jacks girl answerwhen you are engaged to a man and see him planning his future so as to be able to take care of a wife and family you can know then he really loves you your jack prob ably means what he says but you are both too young to know your own minds yet maybe you

wife a soulsearching confession of the woman who was to blame for the gradual disintegration and final ruin of the man she loveda human document that should serve as a warning i am a good woman tender kind and sympathetic heartbroken at sight of pain from childhood i have wept at sight of an animal in dis tress and have hurried to relieve it have picked insects out of the water that i saw struggling because i could not bear to see them suffer and yet deliberately with inten tional and systematic cruelty i drove my husband eventually to his death setting this down in words is the hardest thing i have ever attempted it is like wrenching out a wall disclos ing ugly crawling things behind it that cry out at the light i have never con fided in anyone i could not unbare my guilt but now i am going to do it my friends do not dream of my secret gnawing at my heart they sympa thize with me in my loss speak of how griefstricken i am how greatly i must have loved the man whose name i bore with whom i lived for fifteen years fifteen years i had a long time in which to work my will and i loved him more than any thing in the world that is the ter rible tragedy of it all i loved him because of that i made him suffer i am sorry sorrier than i can ever tell now that it is too late to undo what has happened but i went on i could not stop until i had killed that which i held most dear i had no causeno excuse he was faithful and he loved me only that is what tortures me now the knowledge that he loved me in spite of every thing are there women like me i wonder who deliberately hurt the ones they care for most who find a kind of terrible pleasure in seeing that they can hurt those they love is it because it proves their power and thus is the source of a kind of morbid cruel satisfaction oh if anyone who reads this is doing the thing i did illtreating by words or deeds one she loves i implore her to stop before it is too late to make amends to do more than cry out with empty arms as i am doing now god forgive me my husband was a physician eight years older than i of great gifts and the love that kills a disposition that was calm and excep tionally sweet to me he was like a god i was young when i married only sixteen my mother and father had died when i was little and i had small opportunity for schooling because of my lack of education i resented my husbands love for books he was especially fond of stevenson thackeray james and would take up something from his library when he would come home from an arduous case because he said it rested him and he would want to share them by reading to me some passage that he loved t hated them refusing to listen i was jealous of those booksthey came between us i thought so i refused to look at them resenting the time he spent with them i had one talentcooking and keep ing house and there grew up between us a kind of warfare i played my talent against his love for reading trying to turn him from books by cooking up delicious things talking of events of the day but when i saw angrily that he was not really interested my jealousy raged then i would accuse him of neglect tormenting myself refusing to listen when he protested his innocence after such an accusation then began our scenes tearing nervewracking scenes that grew and grew when he came home i would up braid him conjure up imaginary in dignities that he had heaped upon me i was jealous of every moment of the day when he was away from me pictur ing all sorts of horrors that might come to pass i had read stories of unfaith fulness on the part of physicians and i expected it in my own life i would go on and on talking some times way into the night only stopping when i saw that his nerves were on edge that his face was white and tor tured then something in me would be as suaged and we would make it upfor that time with fewer and fewer intervals be tween those scenes continued with re lentless and bitter persistence the months went by my husbands practice increased rapidly i had a lovely home he bought me everything i wanted to make me happy but he was more and more away from me with increasing demands upon his time as was natural i did not try to understand i saw only neglect in his absences he was handsome of fine physique and charm ing manner i knew he was attractive to others that he must be and so when other women would tell me of their regard for himwomen whose children he had saved who had per haps been saved from death by him i would smile replying to their praise of him with forced words of enthusi asm with all the time jealousy tearing at my heart my mind painted for me lurid pic tures of his visits with other women their confidences the opportunities he had for a more intimate relationship i began conjuring up all sorts of horrors a call would come in the night and i would lie sullenly in bed while he dressed for a journey out into the coun try perhaps imagining the possible scene to which he was going another womanand my husband caring for her she could demand his time and at tention as though she were his wife oh it was horrible the love that kills but i went on with my feverish fan tasiesworking myself into a frenzy i know now that i should have been a nurse instead of a girl young and so lacking in understanding the woman a physician should marry is a nurse for she is the only one who can fully realize his work who can help him in it instead of hindering for she understands but i i could notthough in my saner moments i tried to reason with myself believe that his visits and the neces sary time spent in his office with women patients could be impersonal it seemed to me only an avenue of temp tation bringing all sorts of suggestion and evil when he would hire a nurse from a neighboring city i would watch to catch a glimpse of her secretly happy if she were unattractive but my misery was fed to untoward proportions if she were at all goodlooking and always i suffered more than i can tell my husbands practice was very heavy sometimes he scarcely took time to eat and i never knew when he would be with me and so i hated his work when he came home from a twelve or fifteenmile trip on some case to which he had been called in the night i was waiting for him to upbraid him ac cuse him endlessly heap suspicions upon him sometimes for hours i would make him sit and listen to me even though i knew that he was almost breaking down under the strain of his work and tortured nerves i would keep on and on through all my words he would say nothing only listen miserably or try wearily to pacify me to explain he was kind and patient always but i would not listenuntil ex hausted myself and satisfied i would stop and let him go to sleep all this sounds as though i were without mercy or human kindness but that is not so i was considerate a devoted friend to everyone outside my home in it i was another person and i became that against my will i did not want to nag to hurt but i could not stop i had to go onal though i suffered too more perhaps than he no one who did as i did can help suffering when she sees that she is plunging toward the abyss that will bury her own happiness that she must stop before she is carried over the precipice during all those scenes i knew that i was unjust that my husband was in nocent of any wrong but the jealousy that consumed me seemed like a fever that had to take its course go on until something in me stopped eased satis fied after two years of this i saw my husband happy again a child was coming to us and he was glad he had always wanted children but i saw in his new tenderness towardme only another indignity his love was not really for mebut for the child that was to be i reproachcd him for that pushed him away in hysterical frenzy when he tried to comfort me and when i saw that i could not make him as unhappy as i wished i was furious when the baby came our scenes be gan again it seemed now that the baby whom i loved had come between us if my husband came into the room and glanced first toward the child i would accuse him of caring more for it than he did for me the love that kills five years went by and then i went away with my little girl for a visit to california and there in the flower loveliness of the country i wrestled with myself i came back softened my soul crying out for forgiveness i begged it from my husband how happy he was his love that had never died leaped up again with almost pathetic intensity it seemed as though he had been starved for all those years but now was filled our real honeymoon began and we were utterly content happier together than we had ever been before then one day someone asked me if i knew that during my absence in the west my husband had been seen in a neighboring city with a woman i questioned him fury rising in my heart and with deep abasement he confessed she was a nurse he had met once in a hospital he cared nothing for her but she had said she loved him our life had seemed hopeless to gether and when i went away he had been desolate by chance he had met this woman again and the thing had come about he begged forgiveness my whole body seemed to change to ice as i listened i turned away from him as i would from a terrible monster from something unclean it didnt matter that i had been to blame that i had cast him away from me that i had made our life together wretched when i went to california i said that i was going away forever but now i was outraged filled with righteous in dignation at his sin tears and upbraidings followed again this time with renewed fury for now i had a real basis for my anger and i never let him forget it and so i made him pay for that one lapse with his life with almost a fiendish delight i made him suffernight after night month after month but no one knew it outside of our home i was very care ful i was a devoted wife apparently no one dreamed that the life of this popular physician was not entirely happyuntil at last someone noticed that he was not himself his hand was shaky he was unable to continue a surgical operation he broke down and was taken to a hospital in a neighboring city when he came home shaken and white i nursed him frightened re solving that hereafter i would forget the past and be again as i was after my return from california but it was too late my husband was taking morphine he had been taking it for months it had been the cause of his breakdown and at last the truth came out at first i found he had begun months before taking only a little to quiet his nerves to enable him to go on with his work it is easy for a physician to get mor phine and he had not dreamed of course that it would get a hold upon him i questioned him he admitted that it was true he was taking the drug i commanded him to stop de nounced him pleaded with him ter rified and then the truth came to me in blinding horror that it was too late it had got too great a hold on him he could not stop he must go on we now lived on what he had made in the past for his practice ceased and he could not attend to it did not try to he did not seem to care but shut himself up taking the drug in great quantities day after day content to sit no jan the love that kills for hours in inertia and i watched him trying now with all my heart to help him i cared for him body and soul pray ing on my knees to god to save him i could do nothing and so day after day i sat watch ing him sitting deathly white a wreck of his former self smiling unseeingly at the wall people spoke of what a noble woman i was to stay with such a man who had forgotten his manhood and himself they felt sorry for me i was a martyr patient forgivinga woman to be praised yes i slaved for him physically after it was too lateafter i had killed his soul and all i have now is the memory of my own cruelty to bear me company memory is the most torturing thing in the whole world i know nero william fox special production poppæa my road to the stars by a girl who ran away to the movies pam has run away to go in the movies ted bromley a chance acquaintance has painted a glowing picture for

to escape adam as well as her disagreeable cousin martha she works in a neighboring town until she saves money enough to reach new york she goes to a studio just across the river and is given a chance for ted bromleys sake everybody speaks of him in the past tenseespecially gloria mundi the star who after pam has innocently spoiled a scene for her demands that the new extra be discharged bryam hogan the chief however keeps pam one day she learns ted bromley is still livingthough he has an injured spine that affects his sight and also his understanding she takes a room adjoining his in order to take care of him the landlady tells her he will not last long i carefully pushed back the bolt and opening the door gently i stared in the room was about the same size as mine but it reeked with fumes of alcohol it was furnished with only a bend a bureau and one chair i turned my eyes and gazed at the wreck of the man who lay there my road to the stars it was ted bromley there was an uneven beard and a mustache marring the clean lines of his face and a bandage over his eyes further disfigured him pity sur mounted a sensitive shrinking from his unkempt appearance he raised a fist and shook it in my direction get out of here he cried ted dont you know me i had called him that to myself for so long that i did not realize it was the first time i had ever used his first name in speaking to him his lips suddenly curved into a smile that brought back something of the old boyishness gloria he called softly then his voice broke you have come to me and the wretches told me you wouldnt gloriahe thought i was gloria mundi yes as gunning had said teds brain was as clouded as his eyes were blurred i stood perfectly still a moment then i told myself that if he were dying it would ease his last hours to think the girl he loved had come to him so i let him hold his trembling arms about me i let him rest his cheek against mine i felt my face wet with the tears that wet his face i took cour age from the fact that he did not try to kiss me he fumbled with the band age struggled to take it off but i caught his hands and he let them lie passive in mine i soothed him as i would have done a child finally he quieted down and having exacted my promise that i would not leave him allowed me to get some things i had brought along for just this purposeclean sheets for his bed soap and scrubbing brush an tiseptics and toilet water it was eight oclock when i unbolted the door between our rooms it was after ten before i finished cleaning up his place i had washed his hands too and bathed his hot forehead with scented water he was quite docile now as he lay back content between clean sheets presently he fell asleep in the morning i saw nora kelly and told her i had heard him groaning and i had opened the door and dis covered he was an old friend and i wanted to help take care of him if possible she demurred at first said it wasnt natural for a young girl to want to look after a brokendown wreck but in the end she gave way and i carried out my plan i went to sallies hat occasionally for a change of clothing and for a real bath but i passed most of my time in the squalid room adjoining ted bromleys i arranged with nora to give him the personal attentions i couldnt and i paid her to look after him while i was at work teds mental condition was touching he still thought i was gloria and clung to me pitiably maternal tenderness was the only emotion he called forth in me now two weeks drifted by and i had to confess that i had accomplished noth ing in the way of an improvement in his condition but at least i had made him more comfortable and eased his mind one evening i was sitting beside his bed reading to him as i often did though i do not believe he took in the sense of what i read i looked up and saw peter gunning staring at me from my road to the stars the open doorway his face very grave he had returned a day ahead of schedule and had come up that night to inquire about ted nora had told him of me its gloria you seeand shes come to take care of ted i said warn ingly fearing he might blurt out my name for ted to hear gunning motioned to me to follow him outside and we two stood under the gas jet in nora kellys hall gun ning grasped my arms firmly above the elbows by god he said his chest heav ing its magnificent but it isnt done still youve shown me that we gave up too soon ive been talking to nora and shes told me how you manage him now you go back to sallie to night and tomorrow well have a spe cialist in and see if he doesnt change his mind about ted i forced myself to meet gunnings eyes what im doing for ted is some thing personali cant leave him well move him to a sanitarium where hell get the proper care but even then i shook my head no sanitarium could take hold nowperhaps later when he is more lucid you mean when he wakes up to the fact that youre not gloria yes you see he loves her so ter ribly that he does things to please her he doesnt care for himself but if she wants him to live hell try its very pathetic mr gunningmy voice broke as i recalled the times when the man in the room back there promised to accomplish miracles if only gloria mundi would promise to stay beside him now and when he finds out that youre not gloria i managed a little smile hell be so much stronger that hell fight on to show her he doesnt care peter gunning swore under his breath ever thought how all this could affect your future he asked presently my future i repeated stupidly yes how the man that some day youre going to marry will like it when he hears you lived in a room next to bromleys with an open door be tween oh you neednt look like thatof course i understand that you did it in the purest spirit of pity but how many others will take that view i grew cold all over but i kept my voice quiet im not thinking of marriage mr gunning would you marry ted he shot his question at me as gloria mundi but it was not the first time i had thought of such a thing you think youd have no chance as pamela crowell i know it peter gunning suddenly clasped my hand so hard in his it almost hurt then he spoke again and his own voice was husky its splendid my dear child but we cant allow you to mess up your life in this way he let me alone that night he went back with me to teds room and to my secret gratification ted was more tractable than i had seen him since he had passed into my care he knew gunning and he talked sensibly for awhile but he soon tired and gun ning got up to go my road to the stars as he bent over the bed ted whis pered got anything for me old man i saw gunning shoot me a quick glance of inquiry i nodded i did not pretend that i thought i had gotten the better of teds appetite for drink thought you wouldnt need it now youve got gloria teds features softened until he looked a moment like the charming youth i had known and loved shes the breath of life to me old man but there are times whenyou know how it is and he tried to smile i saw the flask pass from one hand to the other and i made up my mind to get hold of it which i did shortly after gunning left i diluted the mix ture i have him freely with water but as i held the glass to his lips he suddenly pushed out his hand and put it from him let me see if i can sleep without it tonight gloryi havent asked you before but if youd kiss me oncejust on the cheeki think i wouldnt miss the damned stuff for a moment i feared that the touch of my lips would reveal to him that i was not the woman he loved then i told myself that perhaps he wouldnt know i bent my head and brushed his thin cheek lightly praying as i did so he sank back against the pillows and his eyes closed and that night slept without once asking for his usual drink the next day sallie was waiting for me in my dressing room youre crazy she greeted me crazy as they make em you couldnt owe any man the debt youre paying ted and youre just laying up trouble for yourself glorias bound to hear some day you used her as an alibi and shell take it out on you you dont know glorias tongue and you dont know men ted wont be grate ful when he comes to hes going to hate you like poison for fooling him and hes going to slide downhill so fast that not even mundi on her knees can stop him take it from me kid youre in wrong and pull out at once she paused long enough to light a cigarette and give me a chance to reply ive thought of everything sallie teds probable lack of gratitude gloria mundis anger and the trouble im lay ing up for myself but im going through with this thing sallie blew a cloud of smoke at me besides its compromising and if it leaks out hogan wont stand for it why should he hear of it you know its all right and so does mr gun ning and really i dont care about any one elses opinion youre hopeless she stormed at me funny youre only a little thing and you look mild enough and yet youre as obstinate as a mule i saw she was weakening even as peter gunning had weakened last night i thought i had won them both over but i did not know how gun ning worked the following day when i got back to noras flat she told me two doctors had been there to look at ted and they were going to take him to the hospital and operate there was a pressure on his spine and if that could be removed his general condition had improved so much there was a chance that he would not only recover mentally but be able to walk and see again as well as ever i was stunned by the good news and my road to the stars i tried to tell myself that i wouldnt care how much he hated me so long as he was himself again sunday came between that day and the one on which the doctors took him from me i never left him for twenty four hours i sat by his bed long after he had fallen asleep and i tried to im agine the emptiness in my life after he was gone he was to be under treatment and ob servation for a couple of weeks before to go under the surgeons knife the actors who worked with me the direc tors who supervised me and even the chief who was upstairs part of every day were dim and shadowy personages who could not absorb my thoughts there were all sorts of rumors flying about the studio and they reached me in little gusts mostly through sallie and roger gordon who had once worked with mundi and retained a bit ter memory of her temper i learned visions of ted waiting for the surgeons knife the operation it was decided that i should not see him during that time and they pacified ted by telling him that he would be restored to gloria a man on the way to perfect health gunning was not satisfied with some of the scenes taken under foleys direc tion and i was kept at the studio work ing until i was ready to drop with fatigue i moved about those days as if i were in a dream nothing was very real to me no one mattered but a man lying on a narrow hospital bed and waiting gloria had quarreled with hoganit was said she finally demanded a wed ding ring in some way she blamed me said i had put a jinx on her and that she wouldnt rest until i was dis missed from the company sallie brought me this bit of informa tion but added your position is sure as long as you handle the old ruffian carefully hell swallow all the flattery you can pour out and you can always open your eyes and look innocent and aggrieved if he tries to presume you see its gone around the studio my road to the stars that youve done a lot for ted brom ley and bryam hogan isnt the type of man who can believe in disinterested friendship if you gave tedwell de votionwhy shouldnt you give some to him my tip is smile sweetly at hogan and keep your distance and keep out of the glory of the worlds wayshes bent on raising the deuce but the day before ted was to be operated upon as accident would have it i ran into gloria in the narrow corridor on which our dressing rooms opened she stopped me with one moment miss crowell i was too wrought up over teds con dition to fear the woman who looked at me with a baleful fire in her dark eyes even then i could admire her beauty and i found it hard to believe that she had sprung from the dregs on the lower east side and climbed by her own ef forts to the top of her profession tall and slender and willowy with long graceful arms a superb head crowned with thick masses of blueblack hair long dark eyes shaded by thick black lashes a wide curved mouth and two rows of white teeth that were so even people were apt to think them false this was the woman i had thought to depose from her pedestal in ted brom leys heart what had i to offer in comparison with her beauty like that of a fullblown rose sadly i told my self no man could turn from gloria mundi to me unless she were willing to let him go and he found relief from her cruelty in my humble love she was wearing a gorgeous em broidered kimono rose satin embroid ered in gold and silver dragons which set off her brilliant loveliness i had on a short khaki skirt stained and torn a silk shirt with a handkerchief knotted about my throatthe costume i wore in the playmate her eyes ran over me and rested for a moment on my hands my poor scarred hands which still showed signs of rough work she smiled a hard brilliant smile and i braced myself for her attack what do you think all this posing is going to get you she demanded in a voice which was the only thing that betrayed common origin posing i repeated never mind the pretense youre welcome to bromleygawd knows i never was serious in stringing him along he had an idea he could write a masterpiece for me but of course that was a pipe dream i hear you pretended to be mei could sue you for that i guess but ill let it pass but now not content with trying to replace me with ted you want to worm your way into bryam hogans good graces i want to warn you you can cut out trying to copy everything i ever did the chief didnt take you on to be my under study get me her face convulsed with such a look that i feared personal violence and please get me miss mundi i answered coldly dropping into her method of speaking i dont covet your place with mr bromley or with mr hogan i think the studio is big enough for each of us to go our own way and the less we see of each other the better pleased ill be i was too exasperated to be conciliatory and to my amazement she stared back at me as much surprised as if one of the supers had dared to defy her think a lot of yourself dont you she sneered i attempted to pass but she seized hold of me and her fingers hurt my road to the stars i meant what i saidyoure wel come around this studio to anything i dont want and she laughed rudely but im not yet ready to step out of the place the chief has made for me so fade out of his line of vision or ill break you i was glad to shut the door of my dressing room but i could not shut out the memory of gloria mundis face as she had threatened to break me if i interfered with her ambitions i had no wish to do so bryam hogan forty and coarsegrained did not appeal to me he was the only person on the placeexcept mundiwhom i could not regard in a friendly fashion i had learned to accept peter gunnings short phrases as indicative of his absorption in his work i had learned to steer tim foley from sentimental vaporings which he somehow thought went with the game i had come to offer an ear into which roger gordon could pour a stream of discontent without really tak ing it in i tried to be nice to the cam era men to the electricians to the work men about the place and i felt that they liked me for they always greeted me with a nod and they never grum bled at being ordered to rebuild one of my setsthough i had heard them swear at being asked to make over a room or a garden for gloria mundi i even got on with eddie rolfe with all his temperament but there was a look in bryam hogans eyes which disturbed me and i was very careful to avoid more than the briefest exchange of greetings with him although i knew the next morn ing that they were wheeling ted into the operating room at eleven oclock i got myself up in my khaki skirt laced my long boots smeared a little dirt on one cheek and went up stairs to play a silly scene with roger gordon i was nervous and showed it but gunning was very patient with me and when we laid off at noon he linked his arm through mine and we went down stairs together he led me along the other corridor to his office and he pushed me gently into his armchair before he lifted the receiver from the hook lets hear the news he said he avoided looking at me for which i was very grateful for i felt i had grown white even under the thick coating of the slightly yellowish powder i used for makeup it seemed an eternity before he got the hospital asked for teds special nurse i leaned close hoping to overhear it was good news the operation had been successful and ted was resting as comfortably as they could expect i collapsed the strain had been too great and now that it was easing i gave way to my emotions and burst into tears gunning stretched out a hand and clasped mine and i let my head rest on his shoulder with no thought except that he understood my breaking down but there were others who could not see how natural it was for him to com fort me and suddenly i heard a voice boom out what do you mean by this gun ning why have you two left a set and come down here together from over gunnings shoulder i glimpsed hogan in the doorway his face twisted in an angry scowl gunning put me from him gently and said in a curiously quiet voice my road to the stars bromley was operated upon today chief and hes going to get well no good reason as far as i can see for you and miss crowell to be embrac ing you know i wont stand for that sort of thing between my actresses and their directors peter gunning had been a high priced director when bryam hogan was still making soap and i wondered how he would take the insult hurled at him in this fashion he answered no i suppose you think yourself entitled to a monopoly on that sort of thing hogans temper blazed up his fists were readier than his tongue and now he lunged out and struck with terrific force i expected to see peter gunning crumple under such a blow but to my surprise he got to his feet the next moment they were fighting like mad i screamed my overwrought nerves could not stand the sight and the next moment the tiny office was crowded with onlookers hogan and gunning were separated but not pacified come on outside and well finish this gunning was breathing heav ily one eye was closed but he was eager to continue the fight hogan seemed to have enough well settle it in my office he re torted this will cost you your job not necessarily nothing in my contract about personal rows but im leaving when my year is updont care for the atmosphere here sallie pushed through the group of men she had a bottle of witch hazel in her hand and a towel first aid she cried one of the other girls took me away and after a time sallie came to me there i was lying in an easy chair my head throbbing and my thoughts confused but sallie helped me to dress and called a taxi to take us to the ferry on the way down i pulled myself to gether and asked will pete really lose his job lord no sallie returned cheer fully whats a black eye or two in a studio but pete is leaving anyway when his contract expires and i shouldnt wonder if he took us with him im for pete every day in the week i was too and i hastened to say it the news from the hospital con tinued hopeful but of course they wouldnt let any of us see ted at the studio work went on without any reference to the fight but the next afternoon as i was leaving i passed by the anteroom to hogans office and the door was open hogan was inside and he called to me i had to stop and obey a rather per emptory summons to step in i had seen the chiefs den before but a glance around made me realize the room looked singularly empty glorias pictures had all disappeared the ones that had hung on the walls and those on the desk even the colored photographs mounted in silver were gone perhaps her rumored desire to become the next mrs hogan had found no echo in the chiefs wishes hogan was sitting in front of his desk he motioned me to a chair i preferred to stand to make the inter view as brief as possible but that was not his plan before i realized his intention he had reached out swung me up on the flat topped table before him and held me there with his hands clinching my shoulder my road to the stars i hastily decided not to antagonize my employer if i could escape without being forced to do so girlie you are the demure kind al ways had me guessing but youre all alikeat least kipling says so now listen to me be nice and ill lift you to the top of the ladder his eyes bored into mine but i ignored real meaning i answered nothing he seemed to enjoy the situation see here ill lay the cards on the table we needed someone to play lees roles and while you do show promise youre no alice leeyet whether youre starred or not depends upon yourself ive never had a chance to talk to you about your future so well do it now ill meet you at the ferry no use starting tongues wragging by leaving here together well run up to arrowhead for tea agreeable i hesitated would you be angry if i said no mr hogan perhaps id be poor company ive been so upset over mr bromley it was a weak excuse but the best i could think of want me to think he means as much as that to you i wanted to resent that but i dared not he was very good to me he gave me my start and i gave you your real chance dont you owe me anything the best i have to giveto my work his grasp had relaxed on my shoul der and i took advantage of it to slip to the floor then help came eddie rolfe walked into the office unan nounced a sheaf of letters in his hand hogan said irritably dont go miss crowell i want to talk to you after ive signed these but rolfes lips formed two words beat it and i followed his advice after my little scene in hogans office i was certainly unprepared for the truce that ensued the chief still came upstairs while we were at work but his visits were brief and he made no attempt to talk to me alone gunning rushed the finish of the pic ture he took us upstate for the out ofdoors scenes and being away from the city was just what i needed at that time we were out on location for ten days and by that time ted was con valescing in the westchester hills the day after we returned gunning went up to see him and the morning after he sent for me to let me know ted was getting on in every way the operation had been a complete success the removal of the pressure on the spine would give him back the use of his legs and allow his brain to function normally ted knew now that i had masqueraded as gloria and he sent me a message of gratitude he was very glad to learn that i was making good but he did not ask to see me gently gunning explained that he seemed overwhelmed by his indebted ness to me but its not a bad thing for ted pam its supplying the incentive to work he told me he was planning a scenario and dictating it now he wants to finish it and sell it in order to pay us all back the money we laid out for him i didnt discourage him a healthy horror of debt is a fine sign that hes come to himself i had been telling myself for weeks my road to the stars that teds recovery was all i prayed for and that i never expected more than his gratitude but it was cold comfort to receive even that through the words of another i hid my chagrin but i got away as quickly as possible i wanted to be alone to myself at last i admit ted that i loved ted bromley and that nothing but his love in return could content me but i could not take a step to gain that love i was invited into the projection room to see some of the scenes from the playmate run off it was the first time i saw myself on the small screen in front of which the directors and the men who cut and assembled the picture gathered they were there to see what was good what must be done over and what could be left out it surprised me to learn that many of what i had thought my best scenes were ruthlessly cut as not necessary to the story now as i groped my way into the darkened room a hand reached up and pulled me into a seat i shrank away as i saw it was hogan he noticed my movement and he growled out are you afraid i dont bite in the darkness i managed a smile im not so sure i ventured there thats bettermore human he leaned closer i dont know what there is about you girlie but i like you let me take you around i like my stars to be seen around town want to take dinner with me some night i promise not to serve you up for dessert though by gad sometimes you look sweet enough someone banged the door i looked up it was eddie rolfe he slipped into the seat beside me and again saved me from an awkward scene with the chief there was a difference of opinion about one scene and the lights were flashed on gunning appealed to hogan to back him up i took ad vantage of the confusion to leave the room afterwards i heard hogan asked for me and wanted to send for me but rolfe told him i had gone home for awhile things seemed at a stand still work went on in a leisurely fashion gloria mundis picture was finished but i heard that she called the chief up daily he sent for me one day to talk over a new contract eddie rolfe brought me the message and added ill stick around to see he doesnt put anything over on you hes going to offer you three hundred a week for two more pictures sallie had told me to hold out for five hundred but i was only too glad to get three especially as peter gun ning was going to europe to look over the film situation in germany and would not direct for a year at least he advised me to stay on with the sun burst people i could get my training there as well as elsewhere i turned to rolfe gratefully stand by and tell me where to sign i begged and then i followed him to the office i had learned to dread but as we approached it we heard voices one angry the other short and i held back i had no wish to risk another encounter with gloria mundi who had evidently come over hunting trouble but eddie rolfe thought it time for a showdown like most of the others around the studio he had no use at all for gloria mundi he seized me firmly by the hand and pulled me for my road to the stars ward gloria from the inside office saw us she held something in her hand now she screamed out something and raised her arm but almost instantly rolfe sprang at her gave her wrist a turn that changed the nature of her cry and a bottle fell to the floor and smashed she began to whimper it was only wateri was bluffing honest i was i stood rooted to the spot hardly realizing what i had escaped that mad dened by seeing herself as she supposed dropped from her place of power gloria had come over to put an end to my career forever rolfe glanced from the woman he still held to hogan and his face was white and set this lets us all out dont it chief he demanded but hogan answered shortly all lets hush the whole thing up glory said it was water didnt she i got away i did not want to stay and listen the next day i signed my contract and hogan made it only a businesslike short interview things ran smoothly after that gloria began a new picture that called for canadian scenes and hogan went out with the company sallie went too and she wrote me from banff hogans leaving for home next week so watch out honey girl she con cluded i had no more fears i thought hogan had given up all thoughts of me he liked women who fell into his hands i had not asked for a rest between pictures i was only too anxious to keep on working it gave me so much less time for thought foley brought me out in another of the scripts designed for alice lee and we started to work on it it was two months since teds opera tion and still i had had no direct word from him and now that peter gunning had sailed for europe i did not even have a third persons account of him all i knew was that he was still in the westchester hills and getting along eddie rolfe and i had struck up a sort of friendship he asked nothing but my company at dinner occasionally and i was glad to go with him and get away from my own somber thoughts i lived too much alone and i knew it wasnt good for me the new picture called for some night scenes and foley staged these in the lot where i had first worked and come under the fire of gloria mundis dis pleasure this time my leading man was percy gaunt an englishman a delightful person to play with the effect of the lot lighted with huge arc lamps was weird at night but it was a novelty to me and i did not mind how long it took to run off these scenes the third day we finished fairly early but dusk had fallen and as i stepped out of the circle of powerful lights cast by the big lamps i saw rolfe coming towards me something in his manner spelled excitement whats it eddie i asked wearily hoping it was not another summons to hogans officei had noticed him on the lot a short time before someone asking to see youbrom ley and say pam hes looking great walks with a cane but soon my road to the stars hopes to discard it sold a scenario to the famous films and has an order for another shall i stick around for a minute everything whirled be fore my eyes but i quickly pulled my self together thanks eddie i said but it isnt necessarywith ted bromley thought you might like me to drive you home not tonight i wanted to get rid of him i had no great hopes from this first meeting with ted but i could not go from it to another man where is mr bromley saw him talking to the chief a min ute ago oh there he is i followed the direction of his glance and saw a man in a gray suit limping toward us eddie rolfe melted away and i stood still waiting until ted bromley should join me as he came closer i could see that he was thinner than of old paler but there was complete sanity in his hazel eyes and a forward thrust to his clear cut chin this was what i had wanted more than anything else in the world i reminded myself but somehow it didnt make me happy as it should have done he held out his hand words are poor things to express thanks for what you did for me pam i shall go on being grateful to you all my life he said his tones were deeper than formerly and an under current of sadness ran through them i lifted my eyes to his and i read the death sentence to my hopes he brought me gratitudeand nothing more i wish you wouldnt feel that way about it i owe you my chance here so i think that ought to wipe the slate clean between us i answered brightly a faint personal interest showed in his eyes i knew youd make good and i dont need to tell you im glad i hear great things of youyoure selling scenarios im not fit for the road with my game left leg so i might as well use my time somehow youre looking fine like it over here yes but i miss peter gunning hes the best ever well youre anxious to be out of your costume and on your waywe were walking towards the studio may i take you home he was trying to be polite and i could not bear it its not necessary i told him curtly but he would not have it that way were friends arent we pam i nodded if that was all he wanted i would accept he walked with me to the entrance and left me at the end of the corridor that led to my room and said he would wait while i changed into street clothes as i unfastened my frock with fingers that trembled i thought how dear he looked more of a man than i remembered him he had touched the depths and emerged better and stronger and i had had my share in that surely that knowledge was its own reward i had on my street suit but my hair was still down preparatory to doing it up again and it fell in a cloud about my shoulders i glanced into the mirror and then i stiffened with unreasoning horror as i saw the door between my room and the next open slowly and a mans form block the doorway it was bryam hogan and he came swiftly toward me my road to the stars pam and his voice was hoarse i wont give you up to bromley he doesnt want you as i do pam he grasped my shoulder so that it hurt you can have anything you wish ill even marry you if you say so shock left me nerveless motionless i could not even remember that ted pamim coming it was ted and i heard his cane thumping along the passageway outside hogan released me bromley he said in an ugly tone i could crush him with one hand but it wouldnt be worth the row i think if youre wise you wont tell him shock left me motionless was nearby and would come if i called him i was in bryam hogans arms my hair falling over his shoulders des perately i fought back from his lips that sought mine let me go i panted trying to fight him off i was young and strong i struck him a sharp blow over his eyes and then ray courage ebbed and i shrieked wildly the truth then he passed through the door by which he had entered just as ted wrenched open my door and caught me in his arms i did not lose consciousness but i felt limp and i relaxed against him too weak too overwrought to do more than cling to him who was it tell meanyone who belonged here he saw the marks on my throat the my road to the stars imprint of fingers and his voice was stern but i recalled seeing hogan and gunning fight and i had no wish to expose ted just convalescent to the chiefs broad fists no someone got in by mistake i whispered someone who never be longed here and i told myself that was true hogan belonged in soap not in pictures i began to cry softly later ted told me that he had sud denly realized it was very sweet to hold me in his arms like this my face against his shoulder my hair streaming over his breast to feel that i clung to him that i needed him that i turned to him for protection he had thought before only of the debt he owed for devotion to him now he was only conscious that i pam was the woman motif who had set fire to the smoldering embers and again lighted the creative flame in his soul dear little pam he murmured will you bear with me a little while till i prove myself worthy it wont take very long i knew then that a miracle had oc curred and my daydream come true ted was turning to me for the love
