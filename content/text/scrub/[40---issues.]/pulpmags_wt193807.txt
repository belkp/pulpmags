prowess of a doughty swordsman in old atlantis under all graves they murmur they murmur and rebel down to the buried kingdoms creep and like a lost rain roar and weep oer the red heavens of hell chesterton two streams of blood trickled slowly across the rough boards of the floor one of them emerged from a gaping wound in the throat of a prostrate armorclad body the other dripped from a chink in the battered cuirass and the swaying light of a hang ing lamp cast grotesque shadows over the corpse and the two men who crouched on their hams watching it they were both very drunk one of them a tall extreme ly slender man whose bronzed body seemed boneless so supple was it mur mured i win lycon the blood wavers strangely but the stream i spilt will reach this crack first he indicated a space be tween two planks with the point of his rapier lycons childlike eyes widened in astonishment he was short thickset with a remarkably simian face set atop his broad shoulders he swayed slightly as he gasped by ishtar the blood runs up hill elak the slender man chuckled after all the mead you swilled the ocean might run uphill well the wagers won i get the loot he got up and stepped over to the dead man swiftly he searched him and suddenly muttered an explosive curse the swines as bare as a bacchic vestal he has no purse lycon smiled broadly and looked more than ever like an undersized hairless ape the gods watch over me he said in satisfaction of all the millions in atlantis you had to pick a fight with a pauper elak groaned now well have to flee san mu as your quarrels have forced us to flee poseidonia and kornak and the sanmu mead is the best in the land if you had to cause trouble why not choose a fat usurer wed have been paid for our trouble then at least the gods watch over me lycon re iterated leaning forward and then rock ing back chuckling to himself he leaned too far and fell on his nose where he re mained without moving something dropped from the bosom of his tunic and fell with a metallic sound to the oaken floor lycon snored elak smiling unpleasantly appropri ated the purse and investigated its con tents your fingers are swifter than mine he told the recumbent lycon but i can hold more mead than you next time dont try to cheat one who has more brains in his big toe than you have in all your misshapen body scavenging little ape getup the innkeeper is returning with soldiers he thrust the purse into the wallet at his belt and kicked lycon heartily but the small thief failed to awaken cursing with a will elak hoisted the body of the other to his shoulders and staggered spawn of dagon toward the back of the tavern the dis tant sound of shouting from the street outside grew louder and elak thought he could hear the querulous complaints of the innkeeper there will be a reckoning lycon he promised bitterly ishtar yes youll learn he pushed through a golden drapery and hurried along a corridorkicked open an oaken door and came out in the alley behind the tavern above cold stars glittered frostily and an icy wind blew on elaks sweating face sobering him somewhat lycon stirred and writhed in his arms more grog he muttered oh gods is there no more grog a maudlin tear fell hotly on elaks neck and the latter for a moment entertained the not un pleasant idea of dropping lycon and leav ing him for the irate guards the soldiers of sanmu were not renowned for their softheartedness and tales of what they sometimes did to their captives were un pleasantly explicit ishtar elak breathed what wizardrys this weird tales however he ran along the alley in stead blundered into a brawny form that sprang out of the darkness abruptly and saw a snarling bearded face indistinct in the vague starlight he dropped lycon and whipped out his rapier already the soldier was plunging forward his great sword rushing down then it happened elak saw the guards mouth open in a square of amaze ment saw horror spring into the cold eyes the mans face was a mask of abysmal fear he flung himself back desperatelythe swordtip just missed elaks face the soldier raced away into the shadows with a snakelike movement elak turned rapier ready he caught a blur of swift motion the man facing him had lifted quick hands to his face and dropped them as suddenly but there was no menace in the gesture nevertheless elak felt a chill of inexpli cable uneasiness crawl down his back as he faced his rescuer the soldiers of sanmu were courageous if lacking in human kindness what had frightened the attacking guard he eyed the other he saw a medium sized man clad in voluminous gray gar ments that were almost invisible in the gloomsaw a white face with regular statuesque features a black hollow sprang into existence within the white mask as a soft voice whispered youd escape from the guards no need for your rapierim a friend who thebut theres no time for talk thanks and goodbye elak stooped and hoisted lycon to his shoulders again the little man was blinking and murmuring soft appeals for more mead and the hasty thunder of mailed feet grew louder while torchlight swiftly approaching cast gleams of light about the trio in here the grayclad man whis pered youll be safe now elak saw that in the stone wall beside him a black rectangle gaped he sprang through the portal without hesitation the other fol lowed and instantly they were in utter blackness as an unseen door swung creak ingly on rusty hinges elak felt a soft hand touch his own or was it a hand for a second he had the incredible feeling that the thing whose flesh he had touched did not be long to any human bodyit was too soft too cold his skin crawled at the feel of the thing it was withdrawn and a fold of gray cloth swung against his palm he gripped it follow silently gripping the guides garment bearing lycon on his shoulders elak moved forward how the other could find his way through the blackness elak did not know unless he knew the way by heart yet the passageif passage it wasturned and twisted endlessly as it went down presently elak had the feel ing that he was moving through a larger space a cave perhaps his footsteps sounded differently somehow and through the darkness vague whisperings came to him whispers in no language he knew the murmurous sibilants rustled out strangely making elaks brows contract and his free hand go involuntarily to the hilt of his rapier he snarled whos here the invisible guide cried out in the mysterious tongue instantly the whisper ings stopped you are among friends a voice said softly from the blackness we are al most at our destination a few more steps a few more steps and light blazed up spawn of dagon they stood in a small rectangular cham ber hollowed out of the rock the ni trous walls gleamed dankly in the glow of an oil lamp and a little stream ran across the rock floor of the cave and lost itself amid chuckles of goblin laughter in a small hole at the base of the wall two doors were visible the grayclad man was closing one of them a crude table and a few chairs were all the furnishings of the room elak strained his ears he heard something something that should not be heard in inland sanmu he could not be mis taken the sound of waves lapping soft ly in the distance and occasionally a roaring crash as of breakers smashing on a rocky shore he dumped lycon unceremoniously in one of the chairs the little man fell forward on the table pillowing his head in his arms sadly he muttered is there no mead in atlantis i die elak my belly is an arid desert across which the armies of eblis march he sobbed unhappily for a moment and fell asleep elak ostentatiously unsheathed his ra pier and laid it on the table his slender fingers closed on the hilt an explanation he said is due where are we i am gesti said the grayclad one his face seemed chalkwhite in the light of the oil lamp his eyes deeply sunken were covered with a curious glaze i saved you from the guards eh youll not deny that you have my thanks elak said well i need the aid of a brave man and ill pay well if youre interested good if not ill see you leave sanmu safely elak considered its true weve little money he thought of the purse in his wallet and grinned wryly not enough to last us long at any rate perhaps were interested although he hesitated well i could bear to know how you got rid of the soldier so quickly back in the alley behind the tavern i do not think that matters gesti whispered in his sibilant voice the guards are superstitious and its easy to play on their weakness let that suf fice the cold glazed eyes met elaks squarely and a little warning note seemed to clang in his brain there was danger here yet danger had seldom given him pause he said what will you pay a thousand golden pieces fifty thousand cups of mead lycon murmured sleepily accept it elak ill await you here there was little affection in the glance elak cast at his companion youll get none of it he promised not a gold piece he turned to gesti whats to be done for this reward gestis immobile face watched him cryptically kill zend elak said killzend zend the wizard of atlantis are you afraid gesti asked tone lessly i am lycon said without lifting his head from his arms however if elak is not he may slay zend and ill wait here ignoring him elak said ive heard strange things of zend his powers are not human indeed hes not been seen in the streets of sanmu for ten years men say hes immortal menare fools and in gestis voice there was a contempt that made elak stare at him sharply it was as though gesti was commenting on some weird tales race alien to him the grayclad man went on hurriedly as though sensing the trend of elaks thoughts we have driven a passage under zends palace we can break through at any time that we shall do tonight two tasks i give you kill zend shatter the red sphere elak said youre cryptic what red sphere it lies in the topmost minaret of his palace his magic comes from it there is rich loot in the palace elakif thats your name so the little man called you elak or dunce or robber of drunken men lycon said absently feeling the bosom of his tunic all alike call him by any of those names and youll be right where is my gold elak but without waiting for an answer he slumped down in his chair his eyes clos ing and his mouth dropping open as he snored presently he fell off the chair and rolled under the table where he slumbered what the devil can i do with him elak asked i cant take him with me hed leave him here gesti said elaks cold eyes probed the other hell be safe quite safe none in sanmu but our band knows of this underground way what band is that elak asked gesti said nothing for a time then his soft voice whispered need you know a political group banded together to overthrow the king of sanmu and zend from whom he gets his power have you morequestions no then follow gesti led elak to one of the oaken doors it swung open and they moved forward up a winding passage in the dark elak stumbled over a step he felt the cloth of gestis garment touch his hand and gripped it in the blackness they ascended a staircase cut out of the rock halfway up gesti paused i can go no further he whispered the way is straight at the end of the stairway there is a trapdoor of stone open it youll be in zends place here is a weapon for you he thrust a tube of cold metal into elaks hand simply squeeze its sides pointing the smaller end at zend you understand elak nodded and although gesti could scarcely have seen the movement in the darkness he whispered good da gon guard you he turned away elak heard the soft rush of his descent dying in the distance he began to mount the stairs wonder ingly dagonwas gesti a worshipper of the forbidden evil god of ocean po seidon a benignant seagod was adored in marble temples all over the land but the dark worship of dagon had been banned for generations there were tales of another race whose god dagon was a race that had not sprung from human or even earthly loins gripping the odd weapon elak felt his way upward at length his head banged painfully against stone and curs ing softly he felt about in the darkness it was the trapdoor of which gesti had spoken two bolts slid back in welloiled grooves and the door lifted easily as elak thrust his shoulders against it he clambered up in semidarkness finding himself in a small bare room through which light filtered from a nar row windowslit high in the wall a mouse squeaking fearfully fled as he scrambled to his feet apparently the room was little used elak moved stealth ily to the door it swung open a little under his cau spawn of dagon tious hand a corridor stretched before him dimly lit by cold blue radiance that came from tiny gems set in the ceiling at intervals elak followed the upward slant of the passage the red sphere gesti had mentioned was in the topmost min aret up then in a niche in the wall elak saw the head the shock of it turned him cold with amazement a bodiless head set upright on a golden pedestal within a little alcoveits cheeks sunken hair lank and disheveledbut eyes bright with in credible life those eyes watched him ishtar elak breathed what wiz ardrys this he soon found out the pallid lips of the horror writhed and twisted and from them came a high skirling cry of warn ing zend zend a stranger walks your elaks rapier flew there was scarcely any blood he dragged the blade from the eyesocket whispering prayers to all the gods and goddesses he could remem ber the lean jaw dropped and a black ened and swollen tongue lolled from be tween the teeth a red shrunken eyelid dropped over the eye elak had not pierced there was no sound save for elaks hastened breathing he eyed the mon strous thing in the alcove and then con fident that it was no longer a menace lengthened his steps up the passage had zend heard the warning of his sentinel if so danger lurked all about him a silver curtain slashed with a black pattern hung across the corridor elak parted it and watching he froze in every muscle a dwarf no more than four feet tall with a disproportionately large head and a gray wrinkled skin was trotting briskly toward him from the tales he had heard elak imagined the dwarf to be zend behind the wizard strode a halfnaked giant who carried over his shoulder the limp form of a girl elak spun about realizing that he had delayed too long zend was parting the silver curtain as elak raced back down the corridor at his side a black rectangle loomed a passage he had overlooked apparently when he had passed it before he sprang into its shielding darkness when zend passed he would strike down the wizard and take his chances with the giant re membering the smooth hard muscles that had rippled under the deadwhite skin of the man elak was not so sure that his chances would be worth much he real ized now that the giant had seemed fa miliar then he knew two days ago he had seen a mana condemned criminalbe headed in the temple of posedion there could be no mistake the giant was the same man brought back to life by zends evil necromancy ishtar elak whispered sweating id be better off in the hands of the guards how could he slay a man who was already dead elak hesitated his rapier half drawn there was no use borrowing trouble he would keep safely out of sight until zend was separated from his ghastly servitor and then it would be an easy matter to put six inches of steel through the wiz ards body elak was never one for tak ing unnecessary risks as he had a whole some regard for his hide he heard a shuffling of feet and drew back within the sidepassage to let zend pass but the wizard turned suddenly and began to mount the steeply sloping corridor where elak lurked in zends hand was a softly glowing gem that illuminated the pas sage though not brightly elak fled the passage was steep and narrow and it ended at last before a blank wall behind him a steady padding weird tales of feet grew louder in the distance he felt around desperately in the dark if there was a hidden spring in the walls he failed to find it a grin lighted his face as he realized how narrow the passage was if he could do it he pleaced his palms flat against the wall and with his bare feet found an easy purchase on the opposite one face down swiftly with his muscles cracking under the strain he walked up the wall until he was safely above the head of even the giant there he stopped sweating and glanced down only an enormously strong man could have done it and if elak had weighed a little more it would have been impossible his shoulders and thighs ached as he strained to hold his position without mov ing the trio were approaching if they should glance up elak was ready to drop and use his blade or the strange weapon gesti had given him but apparently they did not notice him hidden as he was in the shadows of the high ceiling he caught a glimpse of the girl the giant carried a luscious wench but of course zend would undoubtedly choose only the most attractive maidens for his necromancy and sorcery if that deadalive monster werent here he ruminated id be tempted to fall on zends head no doubt the girl would be grateful she was at the moment unconscious long black lashes lay on creampale cheeks and dark ringlets swayed as the giant lurched on zends hand fumbled out touched the wall the smooth sur face of stone lifted and the gray dwarf pattered into the dimness beyond the giant followed and the door dropped again with a low curse of relief elak swung noiselessly to the floor and rubbed his hands on his leather tunic they were bleeding and only the hardness of his soles had saved his feet from a similar fate after a brief wait elak fumbled in the darkness and found the concealed spring the door lifted with a whispering rush of sound elak found himself in a short corridor that ended in another blackslashed silver curtain he moved forward noticing with relief that the door remained open behind him beyond the silver curtain was a room huge highdomed with great open windows through which the chill night wind blew strongly the room blazed with the coruscating brilliance of the glowing gems which were set in walls and ceiling in bizarre arabesque patterns through one window elak saw the yel low globe of the moon which was just rising three archways curtained broke the smooth expanse of the farther wall the chamber itself richly furnished with rugs and silks and ornaments was empty of occupants elak noiselessly covered the distance to the archways and peered through the curtain of the first blazing white light blinded him he had a flashing indistinct vision of tre mendous forces leashed cyclopean straining mightily to burst the bonds that held them yet actually he saw nothing merely an empty room but empty he knew that it was not power unimagin able surged from beyond the archway shuddering through every atom of elaks body glittering steel walls reflected his startled face and on the floor in the very center of the room he saw a small mudcolored stone that was all yet about the stone surged a tide of power that made elak drop the curtain and back away his eyes wide with fear very quickly he turned spawn of dagon to the next curtainpeered apprehen sively beyond it here was a small room cluttered with alembics retorts and other of zends magical paraphernalia the pallid giant stood silently in a corner on a low table was stretched the girl still unconscious above her hovered the gray dwarf a crystal vial in one hand he tilted it a drop fell elak heard zends harsh voice a new servant a new soul to serve me when her soul is freed i shall send it to antares there is a planet there where ive heard much sorcery ex ists mayhap i can learn a few more secrets elak turned to the last alcove he lifted the curtain saw a steep stairway from it rosered light blazed down he remembered gestis words shatter the red sphere his magic comes from it good hed break the sphere first and then with no magic to protect him zend would be easy prey with a lithe bound elak began to mount the stairs behind him came a guttural cry eblis ishtar and poseidon elak said hastily protect me now he was at the top of the staircase in a high domed room through which moonlight crept from narrow windows it was the room of the sphere glowing shining with lambent rose red radiance the great sphere lay in a silver cradle metallic tubes and wires trailing from it to vanish into the walls half as tall as elaks body it was its brilliance soft but hypnotically intense and he stood for a moment motionless staring behind him feet clattered on the stair he turned saw the pallid giant lum bering up a livid scar circled the dead white neck he had been right then this was the criminal he had seen exe cutedbrought back to life by zends necromancy in the face of real danger elak forgot the gods and drew his rapier prayers he had found would not halt a daggers blow or a stranglers hands without a sound the giant sprang for elak who dodged under the great clutch ing paws and sent his rapiers point deep within the deadwhite breast it bent dangerously he whipped it out just in time to save it from snapping and it sang shrilly as it vibrated elaks oppo nent seemed unhurt yet the rapier had pierced his heart he bled not at all the battle was not a long one and it ended at a window the two men went reeling and swaying about the room rip ping wires and tubes from their places in the fury of their struggle abruptly the red light of the globe dimmed went out simultaneously elak felt the giants cold arms go about his waist before they could tighten he dropped the moon peered in at a narrow win dow just beside him and he flung him self desperately against the giants legs wrenching with all his strength the undead creature toppled he came down as a tree falls without striving to break the force of the impact his hands went out clutchingly for elaks throat but elak was shoving frantically at the white cold muscular body forcing it out the narrow window it overbal anced toppledand fell the giant made no outcry after a moment a heavy thud was audible elak got up and recovered his rapier loudly thanking ishtar for his deliverance for he thought a little politeness costs nothing and even though my own skill and not ishtars hand saved me one never knows too there were other dangers to face and if the gods are ca pricious the goddesses are certainly even more so a loud shriek from below made him weird tales go quickly down the stairway rapier ready zend was running toward him his gray face a mask of fear the dwarf hesitated at sight of him spun about as a low rumble of voices came from near by at the foot of the stairway elak waited from the passage by which elak had entered the great room a horde of night mare beings spewed in their van came gesti gray garments flapping white face immobile as ever behind him sheer hor ror squirmed and leaped and tumbled with a shock of loathing elak remem bered the whispering voices he had heard in the underground cavernand knew now what manner of creatures had spok en thus a race that had not sprung from hu man or even earthly loins their faces were hideous staring masks fishlike in contour with parrotlike beaks and great staring eyes covered with a filmy glaze their bodies were amor phous things half solid and half gela tinous ooze like the iridescent slime of jellyfish writhing tentacles sprouted ir regularly from the ghastly bodies of the things they were the offspring of no sane universe and they came in a blas phemous hissing rush across the room the rapier stabbed out vainly and clat tered to the stones as elak went down he struggled futilely for a moment hearing the harsh agonized shrieks of the wizard cold tentacles were all about him blinding him in their constricting coils then suddenly the weight that held him helpless was gone his legs and arms he discovered were tightly bound with cords he fought vainly to escape then lay quietly beside him he saw the wizard lay tightly trussed the nightmare beings were moving in an orderly rush toward the room in which elak had sensed the surges of tremendous power where lay the little brown stone they vanished beyond the curtain and beside elak and the wizard there remained only gesti he stood looking down at the two his white face immobile what treachery is this elak asked with no great hopefulness set me free and give me my gold but gesti merely said you wont need it you will die very soon eh why fresh human blood is needed thats why we didnt kill you or zend we need your blood well be ready soon an outburst of sibilant whispers came from beyond the silver drape elak said unsteadily what manner of demons are those the wizard gasped you ask him did you not know gesti lifted gloved hands and re moved his face elak bit his lips to choke back a scream now he knew why gestis face had seemed so immobile it was a mask behind it were the parrotlike beak and fishlike eyes elak now knew all too well the gray robes sloughed off the gloves dropped from the limber tips of tentacles from the horrible beak came the sibilant whisper of the monster now you know whom you served the thing that had called itself gesti turned and progressedthat was the only way to describe its method of moving to the curtain behind which its fellows had vanished it joined them zend was staring at elak you did not know you served them and yet did not know by ishtar no elak swore dyou think id have let thosethosewhat are they what are they going to do roll over here zend commanded maybe i can loosen your bonds spawn of dagon elak obeyed and the wizards fingers worked deftly i doubtno human hands tied these knots but what are they elak asked again tell me before i go mad thinking hell has loosed its legions on atlantis they are the children of dagon zend said their dwellingplace is in the great deeps of the ocean have you never heard of the unearthly ones who worship dagon yes but i never believed oh theres truth in the tale eons and unimaginable eons ago before man kind existed on earth only the waters existed there was no land and from the slime there sprang up a race of be ings which dwelt in the sunken abysses of the ocean inhuman creatures that wor shipped dagon their god when eventual ly the waters receded and great continents arose these beings were driven down to the lowest depths their mighty king dom that had once stretched from pole to pole was shrunken as the huge land masses lifted mankind camebut from whence i do not knowand civiliza tions arose hold still these cursed knots i dont understand all of that elak said wincing as the wizards nail dug into his wrist but go on these things hate man for they feel that man has usurped their kingdom their greatest hope is to sink the conti nents again so that the seas will roll over all the earth and not a human being will survive their power will embrace the whole world as it once did eons ago they are not human you see and they worship dagon they want no other gods worshipped on earth ishtar dark eblis even poseidon of the sunlit seas they will achieve their desire now i fear not if i can get free elak said how do the knots hold they hold the wizard said discour agedly but one strand is loose my fingers are raw thethe red globe is broken no elak said some cords were torn loose as i fought with your slave and the light went out of it why the gods be thanked zend said fervently if i can repair the damage and light the globe again the children of dagon will die thats the purpose of it the rays it emits destroy their bodies which are otherwise invulnerable or al most so if i hadnt had the globe theyd have invaded my palace and killed me long ago they have a tunnel under the cellars elak said i see but they dared not invade the palace while the globe shone for the lightrays would have killed them curse these knots if they accomplish their pur pose whats that elak askedbut he had already guessed the answer to sink atlantis this islandconti nent would have gone down beneath the sea long ago if i hadnt pitted my magic and my science against that of the chil dren of dagon they are masters of the earthquake and atlantis rests on none too solid a foundation their power is sufficient to sink atlantis for ever beneath the sea but within that roomzend nodded toward the curtain that hid the seabred horrorsin that room there is power far stronger than theirs i have drawn strength from the stars and the cosmic sources beyond the universe you know nothing of my power it is enough more than enoughto keep atlantis steady on its foundation impregnable against the attacks of dagons breed they have destroyed other lands before atlantis weird tales hot blood dripped on elaks hands as the wizard tore at the cords aye other lands there were races that dwelt on earth before man came my powers have shown me a sun lit island that once reared far to the south an island where dwelt a race of beings tall as trees whose flesh was hard as stone and whose shape was so strange you could scarcely comprehend it the waters rose and covered that island and its people died i have seen a gigantic mountain that speared up from a waste of tossing waters in earths youth and in the towers and minarets that crowned its summit dwelt beings like sphinxes with the heads of beasts and gods and whose broad wings could not save them when the cataclysm came for ruin came to the city of the sphinxes and it sank beneath the oceandestroyed by the chil dren of dagon and there was hold elaks breathless whisper halted the wizards voice hold i see rescue zend eh the wizard screwed his head around until he too saw the short ape featured man who was running silently across the room knife in hand it was lycon whom elak had left slumbering in the underground den of gesti the knife flashed and elak and zend were free elak said swiftly up the stairs wizard repair your magic globe since you say its light will kill these hor rors well hold the stairway without a word the gray dwarf sped silently up the steps and was gone elak turned to lycon how the devil lycon blinked wide blue eyes i scarcely know elak only when you were carrying me out of the tavern and the soldier screamed and ran away i saw something that made me so drunk i couldnt remember what it was i remem bered only a few minutes ago back down stairs somewhere a face that looked like a gargoyles with a terrible great beak and eyes like midgard serpents and i remembered id seen gesti put a mask over the awful face just before you turned there in the alley so i knew gesti was probably a demon and so you came here elak com mented softly well its a good thing for me you did iwhats the matter lycons blue eyes were bulging is this your demon the little man asked pointing elak turned and smiled grimly fac ing him her face puzzled and frightened was the girl on whom zend had been experimentingthe maiden whose soul he had been about to unleash to serve him when elak had arrived her eyes were open now velvetsoft and dark and her white body gleamed against the silver black drape apparently she had awakened and had arisen from her hard couch elaks hand went up in a warning ges ture commanding silence but it was too late the girl said who are you zend kidnapped me are you come to set me free where with a bound elak reached her dragged her back thrust her up the stair way his rapier flashed in his hand over his shoulder he cast a wolfish smile if we live youll escape zend and his magic he told the girl hearing an outburst of sibilant cries and the rushing murmur of the attacking horde yet he did not turn whats your name he asked coryllis ware elak lycon shouted elak turned to see the little mans sword flash out shearing a questing ten tacle in two the severed end dropped writhing and coiling in hideous knots spawn of dagon the frightful devilmasks of monsters glared into elaks eyes the children of dagon came sweeping in a resistless rush cold eyes glazed and glaring tentacles questing iridescent bodies shifting and pulsing like jellyand elak and lycon and the girl coryllis were caught by their fearful wave and forced back up the staircase snarling inarticulate curses lycon swung his sword but it was caught and dragged from his hand by a muscular tentacle elak tried to shield coryllis with his own body he felt himself going down smothering beneath the oppres sive weight of cold hideous bodies that writhed and twisted with dreadful life he struck out desperatelyand felt a hard cold surface melting like snow beneath his hands the weight that held him down was dissipatingthe things were retreating flowing back racing and flopping and tumbling down the stairs shrieking an insane shrill cry they blackened and melted into shapeless puddles of slime that trickled like a little gray stream down the stairway elak realized what had happened a rosered light was glowing in the air all about him the wizard had repaired his magic globe and the power of its rays was destroying the nightmare menace that had crept up from the deeps in a heartbeat it was over there was no trace of the horde that had attacked them gray puddles of oozeno more elak realized that he was cursing softly and abruptly changed it to a prayer with great earnestness he thanked ishtar for his deliverance lycon recovered his sword and handed elak his rapier what now he asked were off were taking coryllis with ustheres no need to linger here true we helped the wizardbut we fought him first he may remember that theres no need to test his gratefulness and wed be fools to do it he picked up coryllis who had quietly fainted and quickly followed lycon down the steps they hurried across the great room and into the depths of the corridor beyond and five minutes later they were sprawled at full length under a tree in one of sanmus numerous parks elak had snatched a silken robe from a bal cony as he passed beneath and coryllis had draped it about her slim body the stars glittered frostily overhead uncon cerned with the fate of atlantisstars that would be shining thousands of years hence when atlantis was not even a memory no thought of this came to elak now he wiped his rapier with a tuft of grass while lycon who had already cleaned his blade stood up and shading his eyes with his palm peered across the park he muttered something under his breath and set off at a steady lope elak stared after him wheres he going theres aby ishtar hes going in a grog shop but he has no money how a shocked thought came to him and he felt hastily in his wallet then he cursed the drunken little ape when he slashed my bonds in the wizards pal ace he stole the purse ill elak sprang to his feet and took a stride forward soft arms gripped his leg he looked down eh let him go coryllis said smiling hes earned his mead yesbut what about me i let him go coryllis murmured and ever after that lycon was to wonder why elak never upbraided him about the stolen purse fortunes fools

silver plating upon tree and bough and twig on rock and scanty frostscarred turf struck a thou sand glittering reflections from the stars that glinted diamondbright against the purple heavens and picked dazzling high lights from the million tiny facets of the hoarfrosts rime so bitter cold it was that whipsharp crackings sounded from the frozen tarns where ice twice frozen ruptured into spiderwebs of splayedout fissures the dry dead leaves that clung like corpses hanged in chains upon the oaktrees branches beat against each other with a clacking rustle like the brittle crackle of a crumpled parchment the horses hooves struck on the frozen earth as on the flints of a paved street the horseman hunched his shoulders forward in the rising wind and dropped his bridle on the saddlebow as he beat his hands together to restore stagnated circulation from crown to knee he was enveloped in an almost shapeless garment made of sheepskin with the wool turned in a sort of loose surtout topped by a hood which hid his features as a friars countenance is hidden by his raised capoch his legs were cased in boots of spanish leather decorated at the heels with starshaped brazen rowels behind his left knee swung the metal sheath of a long sword his palms struck on each other sharply presently their tempo quickened beating out the rhythm of a song nicolete o le gent cors por vos sui venuz en bos his voice rang through the frostbound uplands and echoed back among the stark tree boles bel compaignet dieus ait ancassinet like an echo to his final note there came an answering voice but not in song it was knifesharp edged with terror shrill uncontrolled despairing the cry of one who has the terrible foreknowl edge of swift doom upon her yet offers up a last despairing prayer for help al though the possibility of help is hopeless silhouetted like a shadow in a lantern show against the cold effulgence of the moonlight a figure raced across the hill brow running with such light swift grace the horseman could have sworn its feet scarce spurned the frostrimed rocks yet even as he watched he saw the runner reel and stumble then dash on again but more slowly with less surefooted certainty the fugitive was tiring rapidly now an eery longdrawn howl came quavering through the quiet night and across the hilltop swept three furry shapes widejawed loosetongued eyes gleaming with a light as green as jeal ousys consuming fire if the hunted ran fortunes fools as though she rode the wind the hunters traveled as though borne by lightning and every leap they took made shorter the short gap that stretched between them and their quarry no huntingdogs these no sleuths or boarhounds the watching rider knew their cry he had not hunted in the forests of the languedoc for nothing lupins by the holy child he ex claimed softly wolves the hunted woman stumbled to her knees then caught herself and raced with tripping feet along the frostpaved path way leading down the mountainside the horse shied violently as she fell almost between his forelegs struggled to her knees and held her hands up piteously succor she begged between retch ing sobs help me beau sir or i per ish beneath her tippet of bright fur her bosom heaved tumultuously her suppli cating hands were trembling as with palsy he could hear her fighting to re gain her breath in hard gasps dom dio mistress hast brought thy goods to the right market he replied as he swung a leg across his saddlebow the horse gave a sharp neigh of terror as the gray pursuers swept down on them against the blackness of the entranceway the woman showed in aureate silhouette weird tales but the man showed neither fear nor hesitancy and art thou hungered sire lupus he demanded as the foremost wolf leaped at him taste this twill satisfy thy appetite methinks his sword flashed forward like a streak of frozen lightning and the great wolf fell back with a strangling cry so human it seemed it could not possibly have come from lupine throat then rolled and thrashed about with impotently clawing forepaws as though it choked upon a bone but it was no bone that throttled back its gurgling cries as the everwiden ing pool of blood about the furry head attested across the writhing body of their mate the two remaining wolves leaped like twin missiles from an arbalest one from the right the other from the left with the swordsman as the apex of their tri angle when he closes for the kill the wolf is silent but these were not as other wolves for as they leapt they gave tongue and one of them laughed like a man and one seemed growling curses in a guttural tongue but both bared long white tusks as cruel and sharp as paynim simitars the man dropped back a pace half turning in his stride so that his angle shifted and the wolf upon his right was nearer than its fellow the creature lowered its head as though it had ob served the fate its first companion suf fered and was not minded that the swords point should be thrust into its gaping mouth but if the beast was cun ning the swordsman had more skill for instead of thrusting with his point he lowered his blade and swung it upward and the sharp steel struck the leaping monster just behind the point where legs and body join so that mans weight and wolfs leap blent to give more power to the blow and fur and hide and belly were ripped open like a muslin sack slit with a knife and blood and entrails gushed out on the frozen ground and sent a thin white steam up in the moonlight now the final wolf was on him and its mouth snapped like the jaws of a sprung trap as it laid its forepaws on his shoul ders and worried at his throat ha wouldst thou by the tresses of the sainted maid gasped the man as he writhed beneath the wolfs great bulk the monster fought with human cun ning putting forepaws on his arms to pinion them to earth while it tore and ripped at the fleece hood which wound his neck in its protective softness they wrestled thus an instant then the mans hand disappeared in the loose sleeve of his coat and flashed out quickly with a short curved knife the beasts cry height ened to a scream of pure anguish as the knifeblade ripped from groin to brisket then sheared a transverse cut across its belly so that the figure of the rood was carved upon the monsters underside byr lady had thought that i was finished with the world madomna he said as he kicked the dying wolf aside and got unsteadily upon his feet myself have hunted wolves almost since i ex changed my swaddlingclothes for breeks but never have i met a wolf that fought like these i know not if theyre more like wolves that fight like men than men who fight like wolves of his companion he could see but little and that little gave him cause for wonder like his her face was hidden by a furlined hood and a tippet of rich fur hung down her shoulders and joined across her bosom with a pin of hammered gold shaped like a coiling serpent a coat of wolfskin reached her knees and from knee to ankle her slim legs were wrapped in layer on layer of scarlet cloth on feet so small they might have been a childs she wore a pair of feltsoled shoes bound w t fortunes fools to her ankles sandal fashion with long strips of gilded leather but whether she were fair or dark or young or old he could but guess since her sable hood con cealed her features he only knew her eyes shone greenly like a cats at night whenever a stray beam of moonlight pierced the little cavern of her camail and when they rested on him in calm speculation he felt small ripples of swift chill run up his neck and through his scalpthe eery warning feeling he had known when walking in the forest he had almost trod unwittingly into an ad ders den in obedience to his whistle his fright ened horse came to him and he vaulted to the saddle the woman placed her foot on his and leaped effortlessly to the steeds back where she sat behind him pillionwise her arms about his middle her furframed face across his shoulder the spicy bracing tang of mint was on her breath from her fur garments came a subtle luring scent of mingled myrrh and sandal that made him think of the bazars beyond the bosporus where mer chants from arabia and cathay brought stuffs so precious that a single invoice equaled a kings ransom meseemeth i arrived in good time for your purpose domna he remarked as they clattered past the stiffening bodies of the wolves and mounted the hard winding trail what didst thou in the wilds on such a night i sought aflower a flower domna marye in gods good name what sort of flower grows i this cruel air nor een the blanchflors of the snows could lift its head in such a biting cold i sought a flower she insisted i have need of it only in the dead of winter does it bloom and then by moon light only i strayed beyond the castle gates to seek the blossom and count ottos huntsmen were on quest but for you beau sire i had been killed a purring undertone sardonically provoca tive cynically seductive seemed to under lie her slowly pronounced words and run from syllable to syllable he pondered her reply at length what sort of men be these who course with wolves for dogs and in the dead of night they do not course with wolves mes sire no then by the devils teeth he broke his query half pronounced and instead whither would you we should go he asked a vague uneasiness possessed him a feeling of malaise that seemed to blow a warning trumpet in his inward ear the womans arms were wound about him tightly and beneath the soft fur of her surtout he could feel the supple play of muscles firm and hard as though they were a youths there is no shelter but the wolfberg and that belike is worse than none for thee the wolfbergwolves hill he replied this everlasting emphasis on wolves annoyed him wolves coursing in the moonlight running women down like rabbits attacking travelers in the hills the very castle of the local noble named for them ah pah he blew his breath out gustily sayest thou then let us go there quickly myself am nearly frozen to the bone and thou must be near per ishing stray dogs are given bones to gnaw and place beside the fire in chris tian homes surely this count otto cannot offer less to us otto von wolfberg the wolfberg limned its turrets black against the pallid moonlight it crowned the highest peak that pierced the barren countryside commanding from wt weird tales its lookout view of both the highway and the river so that no merchant floating goods to market and no farmer with wains of provender for man and beast could pass without the counts permission and the payment of such boot as he was pleased to levy it had no barbican or out works nor any moat or drawbridge for the hill fell steeply on three sides so that nothing without wings might scale its height while approach was by a cause way barely wide enough for two mailed men to ride abreast who sought to singe count ottos beard must come upon him two by two and brave a storm of arrows from the loopholes set above the gate then batter down a coulisse made of timbers thick as a mans girth and studded with great harrow spikes of sharpened iron around the castles base a stain of shadow showed as black as ink but through the tunneled entrance way a light gleamed feebly and by it could be seen a dolphinheaded horn chained to the post beside the postern the rider blew a blast upon the trum pet then as there came no answer to his hail sucked in his breath and sounded such a call as set the echoes bellowing among the crags the tread of ironshod feet came clumping down the passageway in answer to his second hail a bearded unkempt face scowled at him through the wicket what wantst thou sirrah the porter growled we feed no beggars here this is no hospice his eye fell on the woman and a grimace of amusement spread across his porcine features ha lady basta hast been picking florets in the gentle night he queried jocularly these hills be dangerous for rare mor sels wot ye not open up thy gate thou cropeared knave the rider interrupted or by ve ronique herveil ill have thee whipped for incivility go tell thy master an he be not in his cups too deep to understand the niceties of gentle usage that a knight and lady wait without and mark ye fel low let him understand that though i wait i do not wait with patience surprizingly the porter broke into a loud guffaw but he swung the postern back and louted low as the horseman and his saddlemate rode down the entry to the courtyard be not afeared she whispered as they left the tunnel and halted while a hostler shambled forward for his bridle i thank thee civilly for thy good service and will protect thee if harm comes afearedi he laughed as he swung her to the ground marry while my sword hangs at my side i have small fear of anything thy sword may not be always ready to thy hand she murmured as a pike blade swung a glimmering arc behind him and he fell face forward to the kid ney stones otto von wolfberg twelfth owner of the title and least favored of a line to all of whom the gift of beauty was denied sat in his hall at meat the table was ten ells in length and spread with plate of gold and silver cream of the spoil a dozen generations of the wolfs breed levied on the commerce of the high way and the river beside him right and left his captains and commanders sat an uncouth loutish lot with unshorn hair and beards that grew as rankly as a churls all were men of mighty stat ure greatboned wideshouldered barrel chested with hands as huge and red as freshsmoked hams shockheaded pages passed the wine and beer horns and shoved platters bearing meats before the company to every man a joint of beef or leg of mutton or a haunch of halfbaked brawn or venison but there was neither bread nor green thing on the table no fortunes fools cabbages no sweets no food that grew upon the fields or in the forest only meat and that so lightly cooked that it was almost raw at the lower tables were the men at arms coarse of body and unkempt as those who sat above them and the air was heavy with the shouting of obsceni ties and the bellowing of drunken laugh ter the rushes on the floor had not been changed for days and suckedout marrow bones and bits of rotting food lay in them festering like offal on a swill heap frowzy slatterns some thin as witches some obscenely fat some almost tooth less some with more hair on lips and chin that any stripling in his sixteenth year could boast shared the halfcooked meat and sour beer and matched gross jest with ribald answer but no brats ran squalling round the tables or fought for marrowbones or chunks of meat among the rushes through the stench of putrefying food and unwashed bodies ran another odor a rancid acrid smell to make the nostrils quiver and bring tear drops smarting to the eyes it was not the odor of the ken nel for there were no dogs to be seen yet it was something similar only stronger heavier and vaguely terrifying the hubbub was so great that it was not until the provost guardsmen dragged their prisoner halfway to the table dais that otto noticed them and brought his fist down on the board with a dishrat tling thump to enjoin silence otto of the wolves hill did not rule by love his frown was a sword and his sword was death even the most drunken of the company faltered into silence as the counts fist smote the oaken board and the guardsmen hauled their captive to the well before the dais in silence still as mid night in a churchyard what have we here count otto roared glowering ogrishly at the captive stranger speak fellow and declare thy self who art thou and how darest thou trespass upon our demesne they had stripped him of his sheepskin surtout while he lay unconscious in the courtyard and now he stood in small clothes a soft suede jerkin of light brown laced high about his neck and topped with a brass gorget at the throat snugly fitting breeches of the same soft leather cased his legs tall boots of cordovan were pulled well up his thighs he was a slightly built small man with fair soft hair that hung in rippling waves about his neck and ears and gave him from the side and back a youthful almost femi nine appearance but looked at from the front he showed no trace of femininity for his upper lip was adorned with a pair of fierce mustachios reaching almost past his cheeks and twisted in the spanish fash ion into hornlike points upon his point ed chin a tuft of wheatblond pointed beard thrust truculently out his brows in contrast to his hair were vivid black and arched so sharply that they gave his face a rather mocking questioning ex pression deep set his little round blue eyes might have seemed humorous had it not been for the curiously cold directness of their gaze bound though he was and still half fainting from the pike blow which had rendered him unconscious in the courtyard he stood with martially squared shoulders and gave count otto glare for baleful glare come sirrah speak or must i twist an answer from ye wi the rack roared otto rising halfway from his seat who art thou cold hatred blazed like frigid light ning in the captives eyes i hight ra mon nazara y de grandin gentleman of provence and knight of aragon and here before thy varlets trulls and lickspittles i brand thee traitor to thy chivalry if such thou ever had otto von wolfberg and weird tales tell thee to thy ugly face thou art a rogue and villain in the silence that ensued the moving of a foot among the stinking rushes rus tled like a gale among the oaks and the swiftly indrawn breath of slut and squire and man at arms was like a wind among the crags for never within memory had any man dared twit illfavored otto with his ugliness now by the mass you mew a right brave song for such a little cat my mal kin ottos thick lips bared strong white teeth beneath his unkempt mus tache but there was no trace of smile in his hard eyes even though a roar of gusty laughter swept the hall in applause of his sally yea and the cat hath claws to back his mew de grandin answered as the laughter quieted do but unloose my hands and give me back my weapons and ill engage to write his title as a churl on any of ye on thee von wolfberg or on that oneeyed oaf who sits upon thy right or on the poxmarked boor upon thy left or on yon tangleheaded lout straight down the table swept his cold contemptuous glance pausing on the cap tains and lieutenants one by one and for each he had some stinging word of insult as he challenged him to combat at last when he had called the roll of those at the high table he cast a scornful glance across the men at arms and shouted if any of ye lousebit underlings dare take the gage your betters fear to lift step forward boldly and declare yourselves only sullen murmurs answered him and what lack ye guts to fight he mocked fie on ye for the dastard cravens that ye be ottos fanglike teeth flashed in a sav age grin had thought to have thy head struck off but since thourt such a strut ting little cockerel thoult have a cocker els fate conrad millers sonhe turned to the gigantic oneeyed captain seated at his leftget thee down and wring me yonder chickens neck while i be bound de grandin asked sarcastically surely such a bulk of bone and brawn cannot fear of meor does he tremble lest i strangle him barehanded unloose him bade the count and stand between him and the door to catch him as he flees but de grandin made no move to run as his great antagonist advanced he fell into a stooping crouch and blue eyes blazing circled slowly around until his back was to the table and his opponent facing it with a bellow conrad rushed and aimed a blow with his great fist sufficient to have felled an ox but the blow went wild as the small provencal dodged nim bly and conrad cannoned on unable to regain his balance as he neared the table his opponent thrust his foot out tripping him so that he fell head foremost up against the heavy oaken bancal and sprawled full length face downward on the floor unconscious as a poleaxed beef one cried de grandin hast other champions to send against me otto wolf berg or wilt thou fight for thine own honor if so be thou hast such the gleeful shouts with which the rabble had watched conrad millers son set on his small antagonist were hushed and through the hall there was no murmur of applause for the small pro vencals agility a compact otto came the prisoners challenge do thou appoint three others choose them as thou wiltand send them to do battle with me with such weapons as they may select i will under take to overcast them all should they prevail thoult have revenge for this hu miliationhe stirred the still uncon scious conrad with his bootand some fortunes fools small sport as well if i overcome them i go my way in peace what sayest thou the wolf does not make compacts with the rabbit otto wolfberg snarled tie him up again some of you to the dungeons wi him two men at arms went down one gasping with sick anguish as de grandins boot heel caught him in the stomach an other with a bloody mouth where a small fist had mashed his lips against his teeth but the struggle was unequal and within a minute they had laid him with his face against the floor hands bound behind him clothes gaping in a dozen places but cursing with such poisonous bitterness that at last a guardsman stuffed a knot of rushes in his mouth even then his eyes were venomously bright and not until they thrust a pikestaff through his back bent elbows were they able to propel him toward the door for more than one stout ruffian felt his boot when they had bound his hands halfway to the door they halted as a tinkle of small cymbals sounded at the entrance and all heads craned that way against the blackness of the entranceway a woman showed in aureate silhouette from chin to instep she was sheathed in gleaming golden tissue its clinging folds no more obscuring her long slender lines than an apples skin conceals its shape slim neck and tapering shoulders high outwardpointing breasts sleek hips beau tifully turned legs were outlined as in plastic gold which seemed to flow and ripple with each supple movement she moved with a slow gliding effortless precision taking short smooth steps which suggested somehow that her ankles had been fettered with a weightless gyve be hind her head like the nimbus of a saint she held a tambourine which she fluttered till its brazen cymbals rang a high thin laughing note de grandin started as he saw her face veiled and only half guessed at it had been mysterious intriguing naked it was utterly inscrutable immobile as a carven ivory mask it was bonewhite calm bland contemptuous with upwardslant ing eyes slashed scarlet mouth brows black as jet and delicately arched as though they had been laid on with a stick of sharpened charcoal her hair was black as ravens plumage but dull as burntout candlewicks and seemed to soak the flambeaux flickering light up as black sand might soak up blood giving back no answering gleam no hint of scin tillation smoothly parted in the middle it was drawn tight across her ears and twisted at her skull base in a heavy knot of dull matte ebony recognition flooded through his brain he had journeyed to byzantium with ve netian merchants seen the fabled hippo drome and visited the bucoleon and seen its great rooms walled with damask and floored with ivory inlaid with silver wo men like no others in the world graced the city of the caesars darkskinned persians ruddymaned circassians greeks as beau tiful as the figures carved upon the cameos they wore he had seen the travelers from cathay too and riding on their wiry little ponies mongols from the gobi slim highshouldered men with braided hair and drooping fierce mus taches arrayed in lacquered leather ar mor inlaid with bright gold and in their wake were women such as this a woman of the tartars what did she in this den of less than semicivilized almayns she passed so close she might have brushed him with her trailing gown of golden thread but though she looked at him with mossgreen eyes there was no recognition in her glance for captive and for captors she seemed to hold a cold aloof contempt as though she were a princess stepping through a foul street weird tales and they the muck that strewed the pav ingflints for a moment she gazed at the wolf berg chief as she stood in the well before his table then aloofly icily as though she were alone and did it for her own amusement she began to dance like a birch tree when the leaves are new and lacy green and sweet winds blow through whispering branches she swayed and undulated while the tambourine be hind her matte black head shrilled softly in repressed crescendos then beat by plangent beat the music deepened till it seemed to mimic distant thunder in the hills and growled a warning of approach ing storm the little cymbals in the hoops ring fell together titteringly softly softly the patter of spring raindrops sounded through the brandies of the swaying trees then the rhythm changed the roll of tartar kettledrums came booming from the vellum head the beat of unshod hooves upon the frozen earth the thunder of the golden hordes resistless charge the rumble of war chariots the clash of arms the lust of fighting men the madness that per cussion long continued breeds beat in the brains of every man within the hall and hands reached out unconsciously for swords or tightened suddenly on dagger hilts now she held the tambourine at arms length before her and round its vibrant rim her fingers raced and fluttered in a wild staccato stuttering tremolo while her serpentsupple body shivered in a sym pathetic ecstasy her shoulders shook and shuddered to the throbbing of the puls ing roaring rhythm of the beaten instru ment she was quivering faster faster her shoulders jerked and rolled con vulsively twitching back and forth not only shoulders but entire torso writhed and shook she seemed dancing with her chest her lungs her abdomen she whirled the tambourine high overhead in her right hand and its cymbals shrieked as if in breathless laughter of unholy glee with her left hand long slimfingered white as ivory tipped with points of coral she rent her golden gown from throat to waist a narrow strip of pale white body showed through the wounded garment as she writhed more violently as if in mor tal agony and from the riven golden gown there was a gleam of pointed breast ivory white rosetipped peering out an instant then disappearing like a fright ened pinknosed kitten a deafening roar of approbation sounded from the feasters but otto wolfberg gave no sign he was gazing at her glassyeyed his mouth half open his face as blank as that of any drunkard in his final cups saliva trickled from the corners of his lips his barrel chest was heaving with quick labored breathing like the respiration of a runner nearly spent or the retching of a swimmer who has almost ceased to battle with an over whelming current suddenly her maddened swaying ceased stockstill she stopped cutting off the frenzied motion as if she had been turned to stone then goldsheathed arms shot right andleft out from her rigid body and with a jerking quiver she threw her shoulders back and her young firm breasts burst from the chrysalis of her torn gown bright as ivory against gold beautiful almost beyond imagining an instant she posed thus then with a mad crash dashed her hand straight through the tambourine and flung the ruined in strument upon the table before otto wolfberg the roar that greeted the finale of her dance was like the bellow of a mountain torrent when the ice jam breaks in spring but she paid it no attention calm aloof composed oblivious she turned and glided from the room with that short fortunes fools flowing step which somehow seemed sug gestive of bound ankles and like the shadow of a shifting shadow or the fig ment of a halfremembered dream at waking she was gone seen from a dungeon window they took de grandin to a cell that looked through ironlatticed win dows to the base court but before they fastened shackles on his wrists they stripped him to his shirt and hose and left him cursing like a hissing serpent in the almost zero cold of the stonefloored stonewalled stoneceiled room the algid floor tiles chilled him to the bone each time he stepped and in a little time the iron loops about his wrists turned almost white with frost and burned his flesh like fire his skin began to itch and prickle as gooseflesh formed upon it and his teeth were chattering like the beating of a drum at muster roll as he felt his way across the almost pitchblack dun geon presently his foot struck rotting straw and he dropped upon the stinking heap and pulled its filthencrusted shreds about him as if he were a dog that sought cold comfort in its heatless kennel the night dragged by on leaden feet some where in the castle was a horologue that beat the hours out upon a brazen gong and the intervals between its bellings seemed as long as years with endless days but in spite of chill and wrath and in jured pride he fell asleep at last and cold gray daylight fingered at his cell bars when he woke to hear the castle tocsin beating out a dirge shivering he got upon his feet and looked out into the courtyard a little cavalcade of men at arms was entering the gate and six of them bore litters formed of pikestaves crossed with boughs of evergreen on the litters lay three corpses stark stonestiff and naked and as the funeral procession passed his window he could see the wounds upon them one showed a sword mark on the throat a little wound that pierced the skin close by the neck base and round it was a frozen necklace of bright blood blood smeared the corpses lips and beard too and told a tale that any leech or veteran of the battlefield could read as plainly as a priest could read a hornbook the sword that killed the man had en tered through his mouth and struck down through his neck the body on the second hurdle bore a cut almost an ell in length beginning at the level of the arms and running down until it struck the navel the final litter bore a corpse on which the midas hand of winter had laid fingers in the instant of death agony freezing into immobility the writhing limbs and tortured features holding in stonehard embrace the twisted arms and drawnup legs the hands that pressed with impotent futility against the knifehewn abdomen from which the frostglazed entrails gushed tracing with a transverse line the vertical and horizontal cuts made by a knifeblade on the thorax and abdomen dom dio gasped de grandin as he looked the wounds upon those human bodies are such as i inflicted on the beasts that beset domna basta yesternight sancta dei genitrixit cannot be and yet he dropped down to the straw again and scratched a heap of stubble over him the misery of cold was sharper than his curiosity no food was thrown into his dun geon and by nightfall the torment of hunger had been added to the scourge of freezing miserably he huddled in the straw heap almost too weak to move so cold that he could hardly feel the pangs of gnawing famishment but he leaped up from his bed as the sound of wailing weird tales voices came to him across the base court through the window of his dungeon he beheld a little knot of miserable creatures herded by a company of men at arms like him they had been stripped down to their shirts and as their naked feet trod frostbit pavingstones they winced and skipped and hopped about in dread ful parody of dancing their jailers roared with laughter and prodded them with pikebutts as they drove them to the center of the court one of the captives an aged man with thin gray beard and scanty locks fell to his knees and though the burning of the icy stones wrung groans from him he raised his hands in prayer mater purissima speculum justitiae mater castissima mater inviolata he besought and ora pro nobis cho rused all the others in an agony of hope lessness and woe now the men at arms were on them beating shoving kicking they flogged the aged man up from his knees and drove him toward the castle gateway herding his companions after him then at a signal they wheeled round and ran dodging through a doorway making fast the portal after them like echoes from the banging door there came a chorus of deep growlings and wild howls and from another door a pack of wolves came rushing out into the court gaunt gray greeneyed with gleaming tusks and lolling tongues they dashed across the frosted stones their long nails clicking on the flints a thousand feet or less they had to run to be upon the shivering almost naked wretches by the gateway and as they raced across the court they passed so close beside de grandins window he could hear their panting breath pant ing and something more he could have sworn he heard one wolf growl to its fellow poor sport tonight they will not travel far the harried prisoners ran with panic stimulated feet out in the desert of the frostbound mountains and untimbered rocks and after them the wolf pack scurried with yelps and howls of savage exultation mo dio through chattering teeth de grandin swore men coursed with wolves herded into dungeons like rab bits in a warren that they may be the quarry of fourfooted beasts he shook the dungeon bars in fury hear me ye saints of paradise grant i may work justice on these monsters and i will plant your altars thick with candles long as my swordblade aye for every one i slay a brace of candles swordblade long attend me holy onesa pair of candles for each one i slay tall candles of smooth wax as fair and straight as easter lilies candles which shall burn so brightly that a halfblind priest may see to read his office by their glow you can not refuse such an offer but act quickly sacred ones or i may die before i have a chance to keep my vow as with most provençals mingled al mayn and moorish blood ran in his veins strengthening and spicing the main strain of languedoc and like most provençals and gascons he had learned much from the moslems at bottom he believed in good and evil and in very little else but this never kept him from communing with the saints in almost jovial comradery addressing them with all the blunt direct ness that he used to fellow soldiers mak ing outandout commercial compacts with them or at times when things were more than usually desperate laying them a wager of his life against their sanctity more than once he was assailed by doubts concerning saints existence but this did not prevent his praying to them on occa sion the blessed saints were patient lis fortunes fools teners and did not force unwelcome coun sel on him so now he prayed with all the fervor of an orthodox believer ex patiating on the beauty of the candles he would give as if he were a prentice hawk ing wares behind a fair booth and they indifferent or unwilling customers perhaps it was his fervid salesmanship perhaps the sainted host took pity on his misery at any rate while he was still en gaged in invocation a rattle sounded at the dungeon door two in a tower beau sire messire de grandin came a guarded whisper from the wicket aye he returned alert who calls tis i basta messire come quickly while the chance remains there was a snap and squeaking from the unoiled lock and hinges and the heavy oaken door swung back slim hands were on his hands slim fingers fluttered at the gyves upon his wrists a key was thrust into their locks and in a moment he was free quick but be silent she admonished and he felt a cloak draped round his shoulders and a hand grasped his to lead him toward the door like a blind man following his guide he crept along the inky passage mounted stairs as dark as erebus sneaked through halflit corridors then climbed a final flight of winding stairs which seemed to lead up to the mountains of the moon so endless was their spiral at last his leader paused before a door and fingered at some secret mechanism then stood aside to let him pass the blazing brightness of the candle light confounded him at first but as his eyes adjusted themselves to the glare he saw they stood in a small circular com partment hung with tapestry and carpeted with bearskins two chairs of carven wood stood by the walls and on one of them was flung a furlined robe of heavy woolen stuff with a pair of monkish sandals underneath but most important was the object in the center of the room a wine cask sawn in half and almost filled with steaming water beside it was a lit tle dish of almond meal a hyssop of sweet fern leaves and a pile of linen towels twill thaw the dungeons chill away she told him as she nodded to ward the tub when thou hast bathed i have that which will break thy fast above i wait thee there as on the night he met her her fea tures were obscured by a drawn hood and her body was enveloped in a loose gown of brown stuff shaped like a friars habit as she stepped he saw her feet were cased in velvet shoes that made her tread as silent as a cats gramercy domna mia he returned tis like heaven after pur gatory to be thus entreated methinks that i shall sleep more peacefully tonight than last her green eyes gleamed sardonically from the shadow of her cowl as she turned to mount the flight of narrow winding steps that led up from the cham ber de grandin wallowed in the steaming water to his hearts content lathering himself with suds of almond meal and scrubbing vigorously with the fern leaves by the time he dried himself upon the towels of coarse linen he was in a glow and despite the need for caution he began to hum a snatch of song isot ma drue isot ma mie en vous ma mort en vous ma vie like a summer breeze that stirs the greenwood in the long still days when lovers wander with joined hands beneath weird tales the verdant bowers came the couplet cap ping his belle amie ainsi va de nous ni vous sans moi ni moi sans vous lenfer you know it too eyes shining writh delight a boyish laugh upon his lips de grandin threw the furlined robe around him thrust his feet into the sandal straps and bounded up the stairs he shoved the brocade curtain at the doorway back and leaped across the threshold then stopped as suddenly as if he had encountered a stone wall domna marye he exclaimed and let the breath out slowly through his teeth the room in which he stood was cir cular conforming to the rondure of the tower and not of any great size its walls were without windows or even loopholes and covered with a yellow brocade gold embroidered the floor was spread with deerskin of a light fawn shade and in the center stood a wide low couch on which a coverlet of baby wolfskins al most silvergray in hue was laid a candle of sweetscented wax emitted a soft light caught and reflected in a ceiling mirror of venetian glass beside the bed was a small table with a top of tight stretched pigskin which bore a silver plat ter heaped with fooda bowl of steam ing mortrew a salmon pasty cubes of game soused in the juice of muscatels and ginger cakes soaked in liqueurs and glass goblets of sweet wines from cypress sicily and hungary throughout the place there hung a curious clinging eva nescent odor which seemed to come and go like zephyrs through an open window and which mounted to his head like strong spiced grecian wine but all of this was only the jewel casket the setting for the gem on which his eyes were fixed the lady basta had put off her loosely draping cloak and velvet shoon now she was cased in a slim gown of bright ver milion that sheathed her slender body as a scabbard sheaths a sword her little feet were bare and white as lily petals their tiny nails as pink as rose leaves so must have looked the feet of lady enid as she paced beside sir geraint when he rode forth to do battle for the three pronged lance hight sparrow hawk if she had been bewitching wrapped in folds of clinging gold she was utterly exquisite in her clinging gown of tartar red with the ivory of her changeless face above the snowwhite of her tiny feet beneath de grandins pagan soul that wor shipped beauty for its own sweet sake wherever found was thrilled down to the bases of its being he felt himself go weak with longing so intense it was akin to breathless adoration as she raised her self into a sitting posture with her arms behind her hands resting on the wolf skin coverlet smooth white impassive as a mask her face seemed strangely alien to the slimlined redsheathed body set beneath it the smile upon her vivid scarlet lips was delicately aloof ironical she knew her charm this passionlesslypassionate seductress her irresistible allure for men was like an instrument she played on with a sure skilled touch and yet she was con temptuous of it her oblique moss green eyes were like a cats their pupils black enormous almost empty of expres sion her teeth were very small and very white and evenvery sharp too thought de grandin as her red lips parted slightly and she smiled at him half closed her eyes and threw her head back gently she drew her childsmall pinknailed feet up from the deerskin rug swung them upon the bed and with a lithe con tortion got up to her knees he watched the play of muscles under her closefitting robe they rippled like a wrestlers like the finely drawn strong sinews of a prac fortunes fools tised acrobat seductive she might be alluring as a houri out of mahounds paradise but alien characteristics marked her she was atalanta champion of the race and trojan helen in one form a combination of the chaste diana and the wanton

gesture of her pinktipped hand she indicated the small table by the wall de grandin fell to with a will beauty was a thing to fall down be fore and worship certainly but an empty bellied worshipper was languid in his reverence and he had not tasted food for thirty hours he downed a goblet of red cyprian wine and a glass of golden wine from sicily to keep it company wiped his lips upon a wisp of damask and helped himself prodigiously to salmon pasty feet tucked demurely under her hands demurely folded in her lap the lady basta watched him as he ate dost know the character of thine hosts here

simon de mont fort and his butchers swept across the pleasant land as they had been a bloody plague we fought them off we pro vençals and pedro the good king of aragon rode in the field beside us with his chivalry but we might as well have tried to beat the rising tide back with our swords our foemen showed no mercy captured knights were crucified on their own olive trees or dragged to death at horses tails seven thousand helpless babes and women suffered massacre when de montfort stormed the town of beziè res and beneath their flailing swords and pounding hooves the music of our trouba

contents in her cupped palm it was thick as soured cream and black as ink she gazed into the little sable pool a moment and he saw her eyes grow fixed and glazed with opal lights in their green depths her lips were moving soundlessly like those of one who kneels in silent prayer before an altar at last she spoke in a hushed voice soft and murmurous as water flow ing in a covered runnel i see thee well beloved and at ease in thine own castle and round thee cluster sons and daughters to do thee honor in thy age a woman sits at thy right hand but i cannot see her face mayhap be cause i strive so

amazed it had not seemed to him that she was ca pable of emotionexcept perhaps to hateyet now her eyes were like twin pools of melted glass their mossgreen depths suffused with tears he roused upon an elbow marry but thou readst a brave tale of the bye and bye he whispered what sayest thou of the here and now she gave a laugh the first that he had heard her utterlow and ripplingsweet but with a

him he was snugly comfortable beneath the wolfskin coverlet and he had not known snug comfort in a long time also his dreams had been most pleasant of the gay court at toulouse of song contests and knightly jousts and tournaments and fair women with pale hands and through them all mingling with the happy visions of the times long lost there ran the figure of a lissome damozel with night black hair and mossgreen eyes that brightened sometimes with the flashing fire of opals begone avaunt aroint thee he complained snuggling down weird tales more deeply in the soft fur robes but the shaking

is guarded but by a handful only she told him as they crept down the winding stair some lie in swinish drunkenness most range the hills with otto a few keep ward it is for us to force our way through them he loosed his long sword in its sheath as they stepped warily into the base court and tiptoed toward the stable basta had donned a page boys livery and tucked her long hair in a velvet cap high boots encased her slim straight legs and a sword hung by her side across her shoulder drafed a pair of saddle bags and in her hand she held a flint and tinder box swiftly they clapped saddles on two horses his own and a wallachian cog shortlegged and heavyset but an easy steed for womans riding await me here a moment she directed as he led the horses from the stable there was a click of steel on flint and looking through the stable door he saw the fireglow on her features as she blew the tinder into life then she stooped quickly and in a mo ment came the curl of smoke and a soft crackling as of eggshells trodden under foot that told him she had set the heaped up stable straw afire they tarried till the ruddy orange red of leaping flames began to paint the gray stone with bright hues then vaulted to the saddle and with a mighty shout of fire charged clattering across the courtyard the provosts men on guard about the gate rushed forward to dispute their pas sage but the billowing clouds of smoke that burst and tumbled from the stable door made them loom dim and indistinct as phantoms in a fog and the roar and crack of quickly mounting flames made the confusion greater a warder aimed a pike thrust at de grandin he swept the partizan aside and thrust out savagely the fellow fell back with a scream as steel crashed through his lips and teeth and tongue an arbalest bolt came whining past them and struck the vault above their heads and as another pikeman hurried up he trod upon the quarrel and went stumbling as it turned beneath his foot basta leant across her saddlebow and thrust her sword into the sprawling var lets spine and de grandin clove another to the eyes as their horses reached the outer gate no time to fold the great gates leaves back they thrust the posterns bar aside and bending low upon their horses necks rode through the narrow opening then while he held the watchmen back fortunes fools with darting point and flailing edge his partner in escape hacked at the hawsers which upheld the coulisse the spike toothed grating crashed behind them with a mighty bang as they fled down the causeway leading from the castle and de grandin turned and shook his fist back at the gloomy pile trapped by veri god he shouted the wolves are in the deadfall a shower of crossbow quarrels answered him but all fell short and he rocked with laughter as they rode away with the portcullis down its haws ers cut the men within the castle were securely prisoned they must run howl ing through their burning pen until the flames consumed them as surely doomed to death by fire as if found guilty in the bishops court and sentenced to be burnt for heresy and witchcraft they clattered down the mountainside through groves of evergreen and oak and out across the pleasant valley where the rising sun began already to shoot rosy darts and drive the clustering shadows back far off in a sequestered franklins cot a cock crew with an elfin silvery note de grandin sent a mocking coque rico echoing back and burst into a song isot ma drue isot ma mie en vous ma mort en vous ma vie her rich contralto matched his lyric baritone belle amie ainsi va de nous ni vous sans moi ni moi sans vous the horses drew together as the trail way narrowed and he leant toward her and kissed her on the mouth en vous ma mort en vous ma vie he quoted in a whisper ni vous sans moi ni moi sans vous she answered and her lips clung against his like iron to the lodestone the wolf pack hunts again night was falling quickly the skys bright blue was stained to steelgray tawny finally a dull slate and presently the hard cold moonlight crept between the branches of the trees as if to search the riders out to say to something that pursued them here they be no caw of rook or ravens croak came through the thick pine boughs only the moaning of a wind that seemed to grow more cold each instant and occasionally the crackle of a dry dead leaf but was it just the crackling of dead leaves about them right and left be hind before marching with them fol lowing waiting for them was a stealthy padpadpad of tufted feet it grew and multiplied till from every quarter it seemed closing in on them something streaked across the road before them like a flash of dancing light reflected from a mirror a rabbit flying with wings of terror on its heels the rustling increased till it sounded like the slashing drive of hailstones on the dryleaf carpet of the forest and a deer shot by running with the speed of desperation bastas teeth were chattering this likes me not she whispered drawing nearer to de grandin he smoothed his restless horses neck and wondered which particular saint to approach with a proposition the blessed ones had never failed him yet but this situation was unprecedented intermedi ate help was not to be despised but in the circumstances it might be best to make direct petition he bent his head and signed himself dom dio look on us he whispered reverently we are very weak and full of sin and oftentimes have transgressed thy commandments nathless senhor lord we are very sorry for our misdeeds and if it be thy will to save us from the weird tales perils that encompass us we promise to amend our ways as far as in our sinful nature lies grant therefore that we may come safely through this dangeror if it be that we must perish let us take such toll of those who came against us that their children and their childrens chil dren shall turn pale and tremble when our names are spoken amen now let what is to come come quick ly he looked up smilingly from his de votions sweet mistress no man dies more times than one and who would wish to live alway they had ridden out into a little clear ing and the stars were twinkling infinitely remote and chill above them far off but belling nearer even as it sounded came the howling of a wolf and its quavering wail was answered by another and an otherand another on every side com pletely circling them rose the hunting cry and suddenly a gray form glided from the shadows followed by two more three a score and they found themselves the center of a ring of greenly gleaming eyes white teeth and hairy breasts the howling had ceased now but the silence that enfolded them was infinitely more frightening standing head and shoulders above others in the pack a gigantic wolf wove through the hairy circle seeming to give orders and plan strategy de grandin slipped down from his sad dle for his horse was mad with terror and unmanageable he held his hand to basta helping her alight and as she dropped beside him clipped her to his breast one kiss before we meet them steel to tusk querida he whispered as they took their stand against a lightning blasted pine if so be we must die and the lord wills i must rot in hell for ever the memory of thy kisses will console me in the midst of fire and brimstone ever lasting again she pleaded again she wound her arms about him and strained herself so tight against his armor that it seemed their two forms would be merged in one oh beloved why must we stop to breathe but need to stop was urgent for even as they embraced the pack charged a leap ing chaos of red mouths and flashing teeth surged on them and into it he plunged his sword with lightning strokes stabbing slashing hacking till his arm grew numb with killing he saw basta fighting like a thing pos sessed then suddenly he heard her give a cry and fall down writhing as two wolves leaped on her but it did not seem as if they bore her down rather it appeared she went down voluntarily and while she stabbed and slashed at her assailants with her dagger her right hand dropped the sword and reached out for an oddshaped fungus growing like a mushroom between two branches of the dead trees rotting roots her fingers closed upon it and she thrust it in her mouth perhaps that way is best he mur mured as he wrenched his swordblade from a cloven skull and thrust it through the brisket of a leaping wolf death cannot be far off and if the poison fungus kills her quickly she will not feel the agony of being torn to pieces ha wouldst thou by the sandals of saint bridethis to a wolf which clamped its teeth upon his sword arm and sought to drag him down taste this and see how well it likes thy belly he drove his dagger in the creatures throat and turned the blade so that the red blood spurted out like wine from a burst cask basta had rolled upon her back and four shaggy beasts were on her tearing at her gorget and breast armor de grandin started toward her hew ing out a lane for passage with his sword but the mighty leader of the pack leaped w t fortunes fools on him and he fell beneath the impact of the monsters driven weight now the other wolves drew back and the frenzied yelping ceased the leader was about to make his kill a thousand times de grandin had looked straighteyed in the skullfaced countenance of death and always he had grinned at it but now he did not grin the snarling face above him was a wolfs the fur was wolfish and the fangs were bestial but through the beastly linea ments he recognized the face of otto wolfberg his stomach retched with loathing as the grinning mouth drew near his throat in a moment he would feel the sharp teeth tearing through his flesh and he was powerless for the manwolf crouched upon him holding down his legs with his back legs pinioning his arms against the earth with his forepaws mater salvatoris he besought comes now a sinful soul pray thou for it his panted prayer was interrupted by a wild fierce cry the like of which hed never heard not quite a roar nor yet a scream but blending the most fearsome part of each it echoed and reechoed through the werewolfhaunted wood the wolves heard it and were afraid for the first time in their savage man beast lives they knew the paralyzing gripe of sheer stark terror and even as they turned in fright they knew the realization of their fear for apparently from no where a dreadful thing was in their midst it was a creature like a catamoun tain but four times larger with rippling sootblack fur and flashing eyes of green and teeth like simitars and claws like sa bers it rushed among them spreading death so swift it might have been a light ning bolt at a single blow from its great paw a wolf lay bellydown with twitching legs and whimpering breath its back snapped like a rotten twig a sweep of its swordstudded talons and skin and flesh and pelage ripped away from staring bones the creature seized a great wolf in its jaws and shook it as a cat might shake a mouse then tossed the carcass by contemptuously and struck two more beasts from its path as it made for the wolfthing that worried at de grandins throat then with a roar it sprang the wolfman turned to flee the great catmonster held its stroke and watched him till he almost reached the tangle of the undergrowth then leaped in a long arc and seized his flanks be tween its claws dragging him to earth as though it were a tabby he a luckless rat then began a dreadful parody of cat andmouse play the werewolf trailed a broken leg behind him for the panthers mighty jaws had crushed his bones at its first onset and at each fresh capture the black leopard gave him further hurt now raking him from hucklebone to rump now clawing him across the shoulders now wallowing him upon the frozen ground and slapping at him softclawed till the breath was almost beaten from his body then it would crouch its tail atwitch and watch him with inscrutable green eyes as he limped off to seek the shelter of a thicket only to leap and drag him back each time he almost reached asylum it seemed a metamorphosis was work ing in the werewolf when first the pan thers torturing play began he was as much in form a wrolf as any natural beast but as cruel claws and ruthless fangs ripped quivering flesh from his tormented bones he seemed to take on semihuman shape his paws appeared to lengthen into hands his shoulders widened and his body straightened so that while he was still cased in unkempt matted fur he was more like a man dight in a hairy garment than a wolf and from the tortured mask of fur the terrorstricken features of von wolfberg looked in hopeless fright w t weird tales now the wolfman found the sem blance of a human voice mercy he croaked hoarsely have pity on my mis ery castle followers chattels heritage are all gone grant me but the boon of life let me drag my broken body to some sanctuary where i may repent my sins repentance he had full measure of it now as the great panther sported with him otto of the wolves hill twelfth werewolf of his line robber and tor menter of the helpless now knew the pangs of torture he who never yet had granted mercy to a man or child or wo man prayed in vain for mercy craven at the last he offered no resistance to the claws that ripped his shuddering flesh or the strong teeth that crushed his bones but screamed and squealed and pled for pity more abjectly than the weakest victim of his wolflust ever begged at last the catamountain wearied of its play it struck von wolfbergs head with a great paw then as he reeled in dizziness beneath the blow seized his neck between its teeth and shook him till he hung limp as an empty glove de grandin watched the pantomime of vengeance to its end around him on the turf there lay a ring of werewolves some gasping out their lives with wheez ing breath some beginning to assume their human shapes now that the spell of evil magic had been ended with their evil lives all were smeared with blood and scarred with gaping wounds crouched on the lifeless form of otto wolfberg the great panther stared at him with green unwinking eyes mo dio domna cat he complimented had thought myself a valiant dealerout of

all fours into the bracken there was a thrashing in the conifers then the branches parted a great black panther looked at him with mossgreen eyes for a long moment it stood there regarding him unwinkingly then it turned and padded silently away into the whispering wood he stooped and took a palmful from the pile of gems that glittered at his feet and let them trickle slowly through his outspread fingers emeralds ru bies pearls emeralds for the green of eyes that looked into his heart rubies for her vivid lips pearls for the white skin of her rubies pearls and emeralds the ran som of

there for a long lifetime and not expend the tithe of that which glittered in his palm yea he could live wrapped in the arms of luxury but his own arms would be empty one look he cast into the thicket

seek his horse untouched the little pyramid of gems glowed like a fallen star against the brown leafmold dust in the house by david h keller a weird mystery story about an old house that had been closed for a century and the two skeletons that sat across the table from each other in that house tt is a good thing for you that you happened to see our advertise ment commented the lawyer it means that the hubler estate worth at least several million will go to you in stead of being distributed among various charitable institutions of the city of new york the man seated on the other side of the table smiled it was rather singular that i just happened to see your advertise ment in a paris paper i do not know how i happened to read it in a part of the paper i seldom look at of course i knew i belonged to the family but i never bothered to look them up are you sure there are no other heirs none that we can be sure of of course the usual number of claimants that was bound to occur but all of them are fraudulent there was one other gen uine heir the daughter of a greatuncle of yours we know she was born we do not know that she died we simply can not find her we have satisfied all legal requirements in our search for her if she does not appear in a week the fortune is yours of course there are conditions but that only makes it more interesting the whole affair is interesting think of it a valuable estate tied up for one hun dred years meantime increasing in value simply because of the real estate con nected with it our legal firm has cared for it all these hundred years as a trust and meantime the house has been unoc cupied unopened and unentered for all those years it has often been painted on the outside and the roof repaired as needed but no one has been inside since the windows were boarded shut and the front door locked by your greatgrand father it seems that he locked the door and stayed near the house till the windows were boarded shut then he came to our law office had this most peculiar will made and then killed himself his heirs were to enter the house at the end of the hundred years spend one night in the diningroom and then divide the estate among them then the house was to be torn down all the furniture burned and the land sold the man smiled rather sourly one night alone in the house he asked yes replied the lawyer a repre sentative of our firm is to go there with you and see that you are escorted to the room the next morning that man will call for you then legal application will be made for the dissolving of the trust and the closing of the estate and i am the only heir yes except for this lost woman as i told you we know she was born her mother died and her father disappeared taking the baby with him and we have proof that he died but where his daugh ter is we do not know we have tried to find her but failed how old would she be if she were living dust in the house he was going to lake the dagger and kill himself and he could not keep from doing it about thirty years if the birth certifi cate is correct and her baptismal name lilith lamereaux the man drew himself forward in the chair as he said slowly lilith lame reaux i knew a woman by that name in fact i knew her rather well she tried to kill me several times what happened to her asked the lawyer rather sharply i do not know perhaps i do not care she passed out of my life i would like to know what actually did happen to her of course she did not kill me only tried to the fact that i am here today talking to you is confirmation of the fact that she did not kill me but i will give her credit for trying her at tempts were intelligent and genuine i am alive today because i outguessed her evi dently she was one woman who became discouraged by repeated failures at least she stopped trying and disappeared a singular coincidence mused the lawyer of course there may have been two women by the same name but the name is an odd one we have been un able to find anyone of that name in america and our advertisements in eng weird tales land and the continent have been un answered of course we have no descrip tion of her so it would be useless to have you tell us what your lilith looked like she was very beautiful sighed the man and evidently very dangerous com mented the lawyer but fortunately our firm has never interested itself in the criminal side of the law and i can simply say that i have a human but not a pro fessional interest in your story of triple escape from a potential murderess will you meet me at the front door of the house at fivethirty tonight better bring an overcoat rubbers and something to eat and drink during the night rubbers asked the man i thought you said the roof had been kept in re pair it has but the dust man can you imagine a house unopened for a hundred years unopened unaired unentered uncleaned we cannot tell what state it is in that is true i will wear them and bring along something to eat and a bottle of wine and perhaps some candles of course there is neither gas nor electricity in the house of course not the house has not been opened for a hundred years and gas and electricity were unknown when it was occupied i have often wondered just why it was to be occupied for one night and then torn down evidently some peculiar fancy on the part of your ancestor and here is something interest ing he had two sons one simply dis appeared and the other lived on to keep the family alive there is something that has always interested me one son disap pears the father shuts the house makes his will and kills himself and now one hundred years later the only one of the family alive enters the house with a lawyer and whatever mystery there is will be solved and i suppose you will represent your firm tonight absolutely i grew up with this mys tery as one of the most precious parts of our legal firm in fact i think i would have died years ago but i was deter mined to be there when the house was opened and that kept me alive i simply had to stay there in the office as the oldest member of the firm year by year waiting till i could enter the house so i will be seeing you at fivethirty and dont forget the rubbers i will be there answered the man and the more i think of it the more determined i am to bring whisky instead of wine i may need something like whisky before the night is overto wash the dust down my throat promptly the two men met at the front door of the old house the old lawyer who evidently thought of every thing pulled a large key out of one pocket of his overcoat and a can of oil out of the other pocket the lock may be rusty he explained as he oiled the key and squirted some oil gravely into the keyhole a lock unused for a hundred years may be very rusty but it was a good lock and a stout key and with a little oil and patience we can open the door ah i can feel it turn now you will excuse me if i pause and take a tablet of nitroglycerin an anginal attack at this time would certainly spoil my pleasure he waited and then swung the front door open we will wait a little while and then we will go in i have two electric search lights you take one turn it on just as i expected this front room is the parlor with elegant draperies furnishings and carpet look at the dust several inches dust in the house thick over everything look at the lit tle waves in the dust where the winter winds blew through the cracks like the sand waves of the sahara i spent some weeks there as a young man this parlor is a little sahara suppose we go upstairs first and save the diningroom till the last it should be back of the parlor excuse me but i am going to tie a handkerchief over my nose i would advise you to do the same no telling what germs are in that dust of course it may be almost sterile as most of the family you repre sent has been walk carefully up these steps no matter how hard we try the dust will rise the two men wandered through the second floor of the old house through longdeserted bedrooms once gayly deco rated life and love have gone away leav ing doors and windows wide careless tenants they quoted the old man how appropriate i never married but i have always been a sentimentalist what tales of love this house could tell these fur nishings relate could they but talk i wish said the young man sharp ly that i could ask you to stop quoting poetical nonsense to me this is simply an old dirty house but to me it is mystery romance countered the old man well at least there is nothing on the second floor and above is the attic which i can leave un examined and now for the dining room yes and twelve hours without your rambling poetry sorry apologized the heir but i am really nervous jittery and all that sort of thing are you sure you cannot spend the night with me i could and i would like to but if i did the will would be broken and you would not receive a cent but who would know we would and honor to our law firm is the most priceless of our posses sions they went down the broad stairway and through the parlor there was only one door at the back of the room and that was closed the lawyer opened the door and announced this must be the diningroom they turned their flashlights on the open doorway and then the young man almost gasped no dust correct agreed the lawyer no dust spotlessly clean i would suggest that we take off our rubbers it would be a shame to spoil the spotless waxed floor and now the mystery hangs over us as the dust hangs over the rest of the house do you see what i see a ma hogany table in the center of the room two empty candlesticks on the table two plates and two glasses and three chairs in one chair there is something that may have once been a woman at least the remnants of a womans clothes cover the dried skin and bones of one long dead she must have been tied to the chair before or after she died dont move let us think about this first across the table are two chairs one is empty the other chair holds something long dead and from the general appear ance that was once a man there is a cane on the floor a goldheaded cane see how the gold shines as though it had been recently polished look at the oil paintings on the wall and the side board with its shining glass the candle sticks are of silver and they glisten as i throw my light on them excuse me this calls for another tablet of nitro glycerin i would not have missed this for anything i am glad i lived to see it and now suppose we walk through the room and open the door on the other sidethe mystery deepens there is weird tales the kitchen and it is as dusty as the rest of the house well whatever the expla nation is you will have to tell me in the morning the will states that the heirs must spend the night here twelve hours from six to six of course the old man probably thought there would be more than one heir the heir took a package of sandwiches out of his pocket wrapped them and placed them slowly on one of the plates on one side of the table he placed his quart of whisky then he placed two candles in the candlesticks and carefully sat down in the empty chair and turned to the old lawyer you said the house had been un opened for a hundred years that is what i said you said no one had been here i was sure of it yet you see this room i do i have seen everything in it this dead man and this dead woman seem to have sat here for a hundred years since i opened the door i have asked myself a hundred questions and none of them has an answer now i will ask one more see that dead man over his longdried and dusty heart there is still the handle of a dagger he was killed with the dagger and it was never withdrawn now i will take that dagger and withdraw it the blade should be almost gone but look at it long the steel polished the point like a needle answer that did this piece of steel kill this man or has the steel been replaced by a new blade or was this dagger the one that killed i wall place it on the table the ivory handle is yellow with age but it is clean you see it is a very unusual handle an artistically carved body of a nude woman well if i keep on thinking about this i shall have to take another tablet of nitroglycerin i will leave you with the two candles burn ing and at six in the morning i will unlock the front door and bid you good morning and now goodnight i can not say pleasant dreams for i think that you will not sleep the young man opened the bottle of whisky and took four fingers full you will find me here you ancient mariner and inside me you will find the quart of whisky i should have had two quarts if there was much less than a million at stake i would go with you and let the sick and the motherless of the city have the old mans money and be damned to him but a man will do a lot for money goodbye i will answer some of your questions in the morning the old lawyer left and shut the door then the front door creaked shut on its rusty hinges the heir took another drink and wiped his wet lips with the back of his hand i will drink some he whispered to himself and then i will try to solve this mystery of course someone has been here these dead bags of skin and bones did not wax the floor and dust the table and polish these candlesticks and that dagger it seems to me that i have seen that somewhere before perhaps another drink will clear my brain minutes passed and hours at eleven he looked at his watch and started to eat the sandwiches meantime the bottle was rapidly being emptied and then came midnight he started to laugh if any thing was going to happen it would have happened by now he whispered to himself so as nothing has happened nothing will happen i will empty the bottle in one last long drink and go to sleep for the rest of the night i thought for a while but that was simply sillyto think of that i never saw that dagger before i know that i never have seen it before i dust in the house simply saw something that looked like it but this one no i am going to keep on telling myself that i never saw it be fore and at last i will believe it he emptied the bottle and then he must have slept waking with a start he looked at his watch he held it to his ear and cried it stopped i must have forgotten to wind it it stopped at midnight and i never knew it and now i do not know what time it is i may have to wait only a few minutes or hours or an eternity till the lawyer comes for me if only i knew what time it was i would be happier how long was i asleep how long must i stay awake and then he heard a tap tap tap tap little heels walking on a wooden floor drawing nearer more distinct little heels tapping in mincing steps on a clean wooden floor they sank noiseless in the thick dust of the house and all the house was covered with thick carpeting of centuryold dust except this room his head whirled he shut his eyes and shook his head to clear it and then he opened his eyelids and there was a woman walk ing toward the table she was dressed in flounces and furbelows hairribbons pantofles and jewelry of the past century in one hand she carried a candlestick with lighted taper in the other hand a bottle of wine she placed them both on the table and then she took a handkerchief and started to dust the table and the pictures and the glasses she went around the room like a little wren making the place spotless and all was quiet save for the taptaptap of her little heels on the waxed and spotless wooden floor finally she replaced the halfburned candles with new ones she poured two glasses of wine and silently placed one in front of the man well she said finally how very very odd to find you here who would have thought that you would be here and why did you come for the two million i suppose i might have known it you were always so anxious to do anything for money and now that you are here and i am here shall we drink to each other as we did in the past you will recall the wine and the vintage or have you had too much whisky to recall anything that was the trouble with you you would have been a fine man and a faithful lover only you had to drink too much at the wrong time drain the glass you need it but i will not drink mine for you may need all in the bottle to keep your brain going till morning he picked the glass up and slowly drained it and then started to laugh think of you being here he sneered i might have known it whenever there was any deviltry you were somehow at the bottom of it but i am going to be rich now and i will give you half of it if you go away and leave me here till the morn ing you give me your name and address and i promise you that i will give you half of it come on be a good girl and get out she simply laughed at him you have not changed at all she said and you still think that all a woman thinks of is money drink another glass of the wine it is perfect do you remember when we drank this same wine in the little patio in northern italy i remember very well that was the third time and i told you there would be one more time and then i left you and now you meet me here how appropriate i sent you the newspaper with the adver tisement in it i knew that would bring you back to america and of course i knew about the will i could have had half the estate had i been willing to dis close my identity i did not care for the weird tales money it was something more than wealth i wanted drink the wine past lover of mine drink the wine he did as she ordered it seemed that he had lost all power of selfcon trol he had to do as she told him there were anger and hatred in his eyes but there was also terror he tried to rise from the chair he wanted to scream for help he thought of falling to his knees and crying for mercy instead he simply sat still and looked at lilith lamereaux she picked up the thing on the chair near him and walked away she was in back of him and she simply vanished tap taptapping on the waxed polished dust less floor he wanted to turn around and see where she had gone but instead he simply kept looking at the burning candles then he heard the taptaptap ping of her little heels and there she was back again arranging the plates on the table one in front of him and one in front of the dead woman on the other side of the table she arranged the glasses and the bottles and wiped a speck of crumb and a drop of the wine off the polished table i always like to have things neat she commented with her little birdlike laugh you know i always was neat my soul was so clean till i met you some years ago and now i am going to take this dagger and carefully wipe all the finger prints off the handle and put it cautiously on the table in front of you i will not try to use it on you again i tried three times and failed so why should i try again buttake another glass of the wineempty the bottlethat is good it is like old times to see you drinking you always thought such curious thoughts when you were drunk and you are drunk now in fact you are very drunk and you are wondering if this is not a hundred years ago can you do that there are two of you at the table drink ing and in desperation the little lady kills you and then perhaps she poisons herself the father comes in and finds you both dead perhaps he blames himself at least he leaves you there and locks the house now the poor little lady is dead so she cannot kill you again but you could kill yourself how easy it would be for you to kill yourself and if they examined the dagger for finger prints they would find there your finger prints it would be suicide they cer tainly could not blame this poor driedup lady tied so carefully to the chair and seated across the table from you and you have wanted to kill yourself so often keep that thoughtyou wanted to kill yourself so often and now with the whisky and the wine and the perfect stagesetting and your memories of how you treated me it should be so easy for you to do so all you have to do is to take the dagger and plunge it into your heart i will tie you to the chair so you will not drop overafter you are dead and all the money will go to poor people who need it to little children who have no parents it will be the only act of kindness you ever thought of doing in your life it will even atone for the way you treated me go ahead and do it in fact after i leave you you cannot help yourself she walked in back of him and he could hear the taptaptapping of her lit tle heels on the waxed and polished and dustless floor he looked at the candles burning with steady flame in the silent room it was too silent he thought he could hear his heart beating or was it the taptaptap of her little heels pounding his life away no it was her heels she was in back of him she was passing a sheet around his body tying him in the chair so that he would not fall to the dust in the house floor when he died she stroked his hair and she dropped a kiss on his hair and she whispered that she was sorry that he was going to do what he was going to do because they might have been happy if things had been different and now he should listen to her little heels taptap tapping out of the room and out of his life because he was going to take the dagger and kill himself and he could not keep from doing it if he kept looking at the candles and thinking of lilith lame reaux and the past years when he might have been happy if he had been differ ent and then taptaptap and she was gone and he was alone across the table the woman dead a hundred years looked at him and it seemed that she smiled and urged him to be a man at last and not be afraid because it was not such a hard thing to be dead if there was love even a dead love in your life and the more he looked at her and at the two candles the more he knew that he had to kill himself and the more sure he was that he would kill himself the woman across the table seemed to change to lilith and there was the tappitytaptappitytap of his heart and the taptaptap of her heels on the flooror was she tapping on the table with her polished finger nails he could hear the blood pounding in his ears and everything was beating rhythmically to the tune of the taptaptap and words came and kept time with the music in his ears and he heard her say again and again you have to kill yourselfyou have to kill yourselftaptaptappitytap tapyou have to kill yourself little white drops of sweat came out on his face and slowly very slowly he reached for the dagger and with clenched hand did the thing he had to do two weeks later the old lawyer sat alone in his office now and then he reached in his pocket took out his little bottle and placed a tablet of nitro glycerin carefully under his tongue he was trying to think and his thoughts did not make any sense his stenographer brought in a card he glanced at it took another tablet and simply said have her come in in came a little lady beautifully dressed in black her little heels tap tapped on the bare floor please do not say a word till i am through urged the lawyer where have you been and why did you fail to answer our advertisements dont you know it cost you nearly two million if you know me now you knew me then and knew about the will and where were you that night let me tell you something i took your cousin to that house and left him there there wrere two bodies there tied to chairs around the center table and i left him there in the third chair the room was spotless there was no dust i was afraid so the next morning i brought a witness with me the very best detective i could find and when we entered that diningroom there was only one dried body there that of the woman the other body was gone and your cousin was dead he had been killed with the dagger that i found in the room and the detective took finger prints of the dead man and the dagger and he says that the man killed himself and it does not make sense and where is the other body and where were you that night i will tell you in confidence that the dead man was afraid of you he said that you had tried three times to kill him and now everything points to the fact that he got drunk and killed him self but why was the room so clean of course there is nothing i can do weird tales now and perhaps it is just as well that he died when he did because he was not worth much anyway but how about me here i have waited all these years to find out about the house and its mystery and instead of finding out anything there is simply more mystery wont you please tell me what happened or dont you know and did you really try to kill him three times and did he really kill him self you poor dear man cooed the little lady you know i heard that you were worrying yourself sick so i just simply had to see you before i left for europe now i tell you what to do you are to have the house torn down when they tear down the diningroom you be there sort of puttering around aimlessly and you will see them tear into the wall by the fireplace and there you will find a passageway to the house next door and in that passageway you will find the man who was dead for a hundred years or what is left of him and his clothes then you will find that the house next door is empty but it was rented by a lady named susan smith but she has moved because she is going to europe tomorrow and of course i read the will and i knew that the diningroom was going to be used and i simply detest dust and dirt so of course the room had to be cleaned but i had lots of time and it was a beautiful room when everything was dustless and polished i even patched up the clothing of those two poor dear dead things and when you and the man walked in i was really proud of how nice everything looked i did not want the money and i am not sure that i wanted my cousin to die i am sure that i did not want to kill him in fact i tried to forget but i guess i went too far and suggested something to him and so that is the way it goes in life when men are not kind to women who love them and he must have killed him self i was not at all sure he would but when i read about it in the papers i knew he had and now i have one question to ask you i am going to hold your hand when you answer it because i want you to be very careful to give me the right answer perhaps you had better take one of those silly little pills first your stenographer said to me good god are you lilith lamereaux the old boss will sure have to take a pill when he hears you are here so take your silly little pill and hold my hand and look me in the eye and tell me do i look like a woman who would mur der a man or do i look like a little wren who just loves to taptaptappity tap through life with her high heels light ly pounding beautiful waxed dustless floors the old lawyer took a deep breath i dont know lilith i really dont know but i do know that if i were thirty years younger i would go to europe with you tomorrow even though i was sure that on the third day out you would toss my dead body to the fishes you are a dear she laughed and gayly tapped her way out of the office and out of his life he lay shackled by death powerless to use the knowledge at his command the defense rests by julius long the weird story of a heartless criminal lawyer who nevertheless wanted to aquit his own murderer jason sanders sat impassively while the twelve jurors filed impor tantly into the box out of the cor ner of his wizened little eyes he regarded with derisive contempt the perspiring in dividual who cowered beside him the individual perspired because upon the verdict of the jury hinged his life he cowered because he was guilty jason sanders enjoyed a mental laugh it was a foregone conclusion that his client would not fry in the electric chair no jury had ever sentenced a man to death in a scant halfhour so a pleasant sense weird tales of triumph was delightfully intermingled with jason sanders enjoyment of his clients anxiety crowded in the doorway nearest the telephones were a group of newspaper men ready to turn and run at a moments notice they watched jason sanders he doesnt give a damn whispered one he knows damn well what its going to be said another he doesnt carehes been paid was the significant statement of a third under whose dissipated eyes bulged pock ets of cynicism the jurymen subsided heavily into their chairs and the room became sound less save for a few whispers of the news paper men a bailiff eyed them omi nously and they quieted all eyes were now turned on the foreman of the jury the judge eyed the foreman wearily gentlemen have you reached a ver dict the foreman rose yes your honor we have you may hand it to the clerk the foreman produced a folded sheet of paper and proffered it to the clerk who carried it to the bench the judge accepted the sheet glanced over it frowned and returned it to the clerk the defendant will rise while the clerk reads the verdict of the jury his cheeks streaming with perspiration the defendant rose the clerk cleared his throat and began to read in an unpleasant tenor we the jury being duly impaneled and sworn do find the defendant louis padullo not guilty as charged in the in dictment the clerk folded the sheet and gave it to an assistant the judge threw up his hands and discharged the jury the freed man sank limply into his chair sanders stood up straightened his tie and gazed across the room at rob erts the district attorney who sat immo bile his reddened face in his hands be side him sat a pallid sickly youth who glared at sanders with burning eyes sanders shrugged and moved away better luck next time he called to roberts roberts sprang to his feet reached sanders in three long strides and shook his finger under his nose sanders he exploded i want to tell you that in all my years at the bar ive never seen such palpably manufac tured evidence so many paid perjurers in one case it is so nice cooed sanders to know that your experience has been broadened sanders roberts fairly shouted you are a disgrace to the bar im not a poor loser returned sand ers icily roberts seemed about to hurl another denunciation then he stopped short and said in a deliberate even tone let me tell you something sanders there will be one murderer you wont get off and that will be your own mark my words sanders dropped his mask of indiffer ence and eyed the district attorney inter estedly is that a threat no im simply telling you some day somewhere someone is going to give you your just deserts and whoever it is you wont be there to defend him sanders stared quizzically into roberts eyes then laughed in his face and saun tered away hes probably right he muttered under his breath and thats one case i cant win the defense rests the newspaper men ganged him he was photographedalone his cli ent was forgotten he rather enjoyed having his picture in the papers he made a good picture looked precisely what a great criminal lawyer is supposed to look like he was fifty and he showed it but not a few of the youthful report ers about him would have given up their youth for that distinguished countenance such a man as sanders would have to be very shrewd to live up to his face a statement to the press mr sand ers the newspaper men fawned sanders brow wrinkled slightly as he drew upon the reservoir of his memory for another of his well rehearsed bits of impromptu wit my distinguished opponent district attorney roberts he said lightly has hinted rather bluntly that in the conduct of this case i have not had justice on my side you may say to the imbeciles who read your newspapers that any man may go ahead when he is sure he is right but it takes a good lawyer to go ahead when hes sure hes wrong with that off his chest jason sanders walked away the several persons who made obse quious way for him as he entered the ele vator strained their ears to make out his mumbling they failed they would doubtless have succeeded had they been close by when district attorney roberts announced so heatedly there will be one murderer you wont get off and that will be your own for it was this that jason sanders repeated as he rode down stairs outside his chauffeur awaited him smiling broadly the chauffeur shared vicariously the celebrity of his employer and felt a personal triumph in this latest victory great goin boss sanders tried deperately not to show his pleasure at this very sincere flattery it irked him to know that he was really fond of this big fellow all his life he had tried to care as little about as few people as possible whenever he began to love his fellow men he knew he was drunk and went home to bed neverthe less he beamed he would have to give the chauffeur an extra day off he had placed one foot on the run ningboard of his limousine when he felt a hand upon his sleeve he turned quick ly with annoyance his features relaxed with recognition the thin tapering fingers that clutched his arm were those of the sallow sickly youth who had sat all through the trial with the district attorney hello costello said sanders pa tiently what can i do for you costello did not answer he withdrew his hand and thrust it into an outside coat pocket when it was withdrawn it contained a small singleshot pistol of foreign make the little barrel was pointed directly at sanders heart with his arm sanders carelessly re strained his chauffeur who had made a vigorous movement forward here here costello he said indulg ently this is no way for you to be have ive only done my duty for my client you say he killed your sister the jury has just said he didnt thats that so put away that toy pistol and shake hands costellos lips quivered slightly as he watched sanders extend his hand then he shot sanders through the heart lying alone in that strange room sand ers was in a panic how long he had been there he did not know he had awakened a few minutes ago and tried to sit up but he had been unable to do so at first he had not been seriously per weird tales turbed no doubt he was still numb with sleep within a few moments all his muscles would be thoroughly awake and he would be able to rise but seconds accumulated into minutes and sanders rapidly lost his confidence obviously something very strange was the matter with him he had never been like this before his head was perfectly clear yet his body remained numb and his muscles would not respond to his commands he had stared at one particular spot of ceiling many minutes before he became aware that he could stare at that spot and no other he could not try as he might change the focus of his eyes he could not even flicker his eyelashes he must lie there immobile staring fixedly at that one spot of strange ceiling realization of this drove him into a rage no prisoner bound fast by his most hated enemy could have been more an gered by his predicament then after a few seconds of this futile rage sanders controlled himself called his reason to his rescue he began to think to trace his movements backward a blinding flash a sallow sickly face so put away that toy ive only done my duty here here cos tello so he had been shot that little fool costello had really fired that tiny pistol sanders would have laughed only his frozen muscles would not evoke laugh ter he felt not the least anger toward costello being quite without a sense of justice he had no excuse to bear malice he forgot costello at once thought only of his present disconcerting state obviously the bullet from costellos lit tle gun had struck a vital spot in his nervous system and left him paralyzed despair staggered him would he be like this always a paralytic charge per haps not maybe he was only temporarily stunned but he must know the truth at once certainly there was a doctor or a nurse close by for this strange room must be the room of a hospital so sanders de cided at once to call out but his lips did not move his tongue lay immobile in his mouth again he be came enraged how was he to let anyone know that he had returned to conscious ness why was no one about to look after him a fine hospital this didnt the staff know any better than to leave alone a man so critically injured again and again he tried to utter a cry for help if only he could move his lips ever so little but they were numb in capable of motion he could only lie there and wait he did not have to wait long foot steps sounded in the corridor and voices murmured probably a doctor and a nurse sanders decided for a moment he endured agony fearful lest they would go by the door of his room heaven be thanked they were coming in but the two who had entered did not approach him they crossed the room and halted sanders tried to face them but his neck remained rigid his eyes re fused to remove their focus from that spot of ceiling he heard a familiar rasp ing one of the newcomers was dialing a number at the telephone close by hello said a coldly professional voice this is doctor asman were all through now and you can come for the body any time its in the general receiving room third from the left a pause very good either gowans or i will be hereprobably both the receiver clattered in the hook sanders was puzzled he knew doctor asman well asman was superintendent of the city morgue w t the defense rests shouldnt we close his eyes asked a second voice sanders knew that voice too it was the voice of young gowans asmans assistant it makes no difference asman re plied the undertaker will take care of that when he comes but insisted gowans rigor mortis might set in by that time i dont think so hes been here only two hours the undertaker will ar rive within an hour theres plenty of time maybe but sanders had worked hard all day when a man talks a jury out of burning a rat like padullo he uses up a lot of energy and such enervation would bring on rigor mortis plenty fast well lets have a look at him the two men approached sanders lay dazed he wasnt in a hospital he was in the morgue and these men thought he was dead he sanders dead impossible he must show them that he was alive any thing would dothe flutter of an eye lash the twitching of his fingersany thing in a panic he exerted all his will to make some small movement he tried to form words with his lips to double his fingers but this was quite impossible it was as if he had forgotten how to move he had a picture of himself lying there naked of course so many times he had come here to look indifferently at the white bodies of the victims of the murderers he had been employed to de fend this thought at the same time horrifying was in one respect encourag ing any movement that he might make would be noticed he tried again this time he would move his toescertainly it would not be asking too much just to wiggle his toes yet they did not move sanders struggled now not to convince asman and gowans that he was alive but to convince himself the two physicians were feeling of his body now he could not feel their hands but he could catch part of their move ments as they came within the range of his eyes now asman was chucking him under the chin see how readily his mouth closes look at this and sanders gaze swept the ceiling and came to rest on a shrouded figure close by as his head was turned he could catch a glimpse of another white object beyond third from the left that was he sanders he pictured himself as he must be lying there one member of a row of corpses one of the corpses sanders was now taking this for granted ill admit hes in pretty good shape right now but you wait a few minutes ive seen it happen too often when a mans as mentally and physically ex hausted as sanders was when he was killed rigor mortis is bound to come fast and violently but not that fast the undertaker will be here in plenty of time he should congratulate himself on this job very neat no mess did you ever see a cleaner hole right through the heart sanders was dead before he hit the ground yes he still looks surprized even so his face is still intelligent a wonderful brain there strong wilful yes conceded gowans but it doesnt mean a thing now hell never have another murderer acquitted hes fooled his last jury asman sighed the costello boy killed the only lawyer in town who could get him off i understand hes hired billy williams to defend him well billys a bright young fellow but hes no jason sanders im afraid not you know id kind of like to see the costello kid get off if w t weird tales the newspaper stories are true he didnt kill sanders for having padullo acquitted but because of the mud he threw at his sister during the trial well thats all in the game the only way sanders could get padullo a chinamans chance was to make the jury lose sympathy for the girl when they found out she was ten times as bad as the man that murdered her they didnt feel a grudge against him but was she probably not the costello kid says all the evidence against her character was trumped up he worshipped the girl thought she was an angel so he plugged sanders and now hell burn for it i suppose still if billy williams can prove that sanders witnesses perjured themselves to ruin the girls name no jury in the world would convict the boy but hows he going to do it sanders was no fool he wasnt the kind to leave loose ends for the grievance committee of the bar association to pick up hed played this game a hundred times before he once told me that a murderer had one foot out of his cell when it could be shown that he was no worse than his victim said that was always the first thing he tried to do theres something in what you say conceded asman take this case now dyou know what sanders would do if he was defending costello hed dig up a lot of witnesses that would convince a jury that hesanders i meandeserved killing hed show how hed coached all his witnesses in the padullo case to lie on the stand there must be somebody somewhere who could tell the truthbut only sanders knows where well said gowans with a chuckle you cant expect sanders to get his own murderer off no asman agreed thats a little too much even for sanders well lets get out of here weve got work to do asman started away before gowans left he moved surreptitiously toward sanders suddenly sanders saw no more gowans had closed his eyes then both asman and gowans were gone sanders made no effort to call after them he understood the futility of that now he was dead a realist he could no longer hope he could only lie there and think the whole content of his thinking was strangely reoriented all his life his thought had been focused exclusively on himself absolute unqualified selfish nessthat was his ethics if he inadvert ently committed an unselfish act that was cause for remorse for an aching con science that was weakness inexcusable weakness on this ethical basis he had lived all the mature years of his life but jason sanders was gone now dead no longer could he scheme cunningly for his personal advancement his little ambitions struck him as trifling utterly unimportant he found it impossible to think of jason sanders save in the third person objectively and impersonally he was merely one of many faces that crowded his memory of these faces only one stood out clearly in bold relief that was the sal low face of the boy costello and he was inclined to think kindly of costello pityingly the youth had been a fool he had committed his crime openly in the sight of many men he had killed to avenge a wrong and for that he was to die the two physicians had reasoned well despite the legal talents of billy wil liams he could not hope to untangle the maze of perjury that had successfully blasted the reputation of maria costello it was true that there existed a key wit the defense rests ness who could conclusively prove this perjury but only he sanders knew his name or where to find him place him on the stand and the world would know to what inexcusable lengths sanders had gone to save his client the last shred of sympathy for him would be gone but only sanders could locate this witness and he was dead as from the dim and remote past he recalled the gloating words of the district attorney roberts there will be one murderer you wont get off and that will be your own and jason sanders would gladly have sacrificed all his famous court room triumphs if only he could gain the acquittal of costello his murderer this he reflected bitterly would be a very simple thing to doif he were alive but he lay shackled by death powerless to use the knowledge at his command mechanically he planned the conduct of the case for the defense he marshaled his facts formulated his questions sum moned witnesses available only to him self at length the horrible irony of the situation weighed unendurably upon him and caused him to end this futile plan ning if only he could somehow communi cate with billy williams give him a few names and addresses given this informa tion williams whole case would unfold of itself and lie snugly in his lap the telephone close by if only then it happened quickly and without warning sanders was quite unprepared it seemed that the chains which had held him were smashed into bits he bounded from the table staggered on his feet his eyes burst open stared at the telephone on the wall without an instants hesi tancy he lunged forward and clasped the mouthpiece of the phone impelled by one fixed idea he jerked the receiver from the hook began frantically to dial doctor asman stared at billy wil liams with perplexity im sure you must be mistaken gowans and i have been right beside this phone for the last threequarters of an hour i assure you that we havent once touched it and no one has been inside this office except ourselves williams shrugged but i tell you i had the call traced whoever called left the receiver off the hook and tracing was easy they told me at the exchange that the call was made at the city morgue both asman and gowans gave wil liams a deprecating look after all was the call so important i dont know yet whoever called gave me a whole list of names and ad dresses i took them down just in case id just been hired to defend costello you know and i had a hunch this had something to do with it you didnt recognize the voice no never heard a voice even re motely like it the three men sat silently puzzled gowans suddenly looked up at his su perior say what about that phone in the re ceivingroom asman cut him off short nonsense ive had my eye on that room ever since we left it ive been on the lookout for the undertaker williams looked interested is that the only other phone in the place both asman and gowans nodded the next instant they froze in their chairs as a horrible weird wailing sounded through out the morgue williams bounded to his feet my god whats that asman and gowans rose shakily the wailing which continued as loud and as terrifying as ever came from the receiv ingroom weird tales come on snapped asman and he walked stolidly from the office shakily gowans and williams followed at his heels the three men halted in the doorway of the receivingroom slowly their glazed eyes lost their fear and their tense fea tures relaxed into a grin the weird wailing which still continued came from the receiver of the telephone the ex change had put on the howler to give warning that the receiver was off the hook gowans stepped quickly forward then stopped short uttering an exclamation he turned to asman and pointed at the thing at his feet see i told you so rigor mortis i told you it would be prematureand vio lent seesanders jumped clear off the table and almost to the phone i wonder what he stared at the receiver which hung suspended from its cord billy williams too was staring at the receiver and at the doubled figure of ja son sanders on the floor suddenly he turned on his heel and walked briskly outside to his car he had to find out about those names and addresses at once it couldnt be but the messenger by h p lovecraft the thing he said would come that night at three from the old churchyard on the hill below but crouching by an oak fires wholesome glow i tried to tell myself it could not be surely i mused it was a pleasantry devised by one who did not truly know the elder sign bequeathed from long ago that sets the fumbling forms of darkness free he had not meant itnobut still i lit another lamp as starry leo climbed out of the seekonk and a steeple chimed threeand the firelight faded bit by bit then at the door that cautious rattling came and the mad truth devoured me like a flame there are things against which ordinary protection would not suffice the black drama by gans t field a strange weird story about the eery personality known as verduk who claimed descent from lord byron and the hideous doom that stalked his wake the story so far gilbert connatt the narra tor once a motion picture idol but now penniless is persuaded by jake switz kindly utility man of the theatrical world to accept a rôle in the play ruthven opposite sigrid holgar connatts exsweetheart who since her break with connatt has become a glamor ous film favorite the play is being pro duced by varduk mysterious new genius of the theater other players will include this story began in weird tales for june weird tales elmo davidson varduks man friday and martha vining character actress ruthven is announced as the lost vam piredemon drama of lord byron and its authenticity is vouched for by judge keith pursuivant antiquary and occult ist who is convinced that the writing is genuinely byrons therefore more than a century old however he tells connatt that the paper on which the play is writ ten was watermarked less than ten years previously the play is to open in july at the lake jozgid summer theater among upstate new york forests connatt arrives ac companied by judge pursuivant who is vacationing near by jake meeting con natt tells a disquieting story of how he and sigrid were attacked and almost overcome at night by strange halfdefined shapes the story continues the theater in the forest jakes narrative did not give me cheer ful expectations of the lake jozgid theater it was just as well for my first glimpse of the place convinced me that it was the exact setting for a play of morbid unreality the road beyond pursuivants cabin was narrow but not too bad jake driv ing nimbly over its sanded surface told me that we might thank the public works program for its good condition in one or two places as i think i have said already the way was cut deeply between knolls or bluffs and here it was gloomy and almost sunless too the woods thickened to right and left with taller and taller ranks of trees at the roadside springtimes leafage made the trees seem vigorous but not exactly cheerful i fan cied that they were endowed with intel ligence and the power of motion and that they awaited only our passing before they moved out to block the open way be hind us from this sandsurfaced road there branched eventually a second and even narrower and darker that dipped down a thickly timbered slope we took a rather difficult curve at the bottom and came out almost upon the shore of the lake with the old lodge and its outbuildings in plain view these structures were in the best of repair but appeared intensely dark and weathered as though the afternoon sky shed a brownish light upon them the lodge that was now the theater stood clear in the center of the sizable cleared space although lushlooking clumps and belts of evergreen scrub grew almost against the sheds and the boathouse i was enough of an observer to be aware that the deep roofs were of stout axcut shingles and that the heavy timbers of the walls were undoubtedly seasoned for an age the windows were large but deepset in their sturdy frames those who call windows the eyes of a house would have thought that these eyes were large enough but well able to conceal the secrets and feelings within as we emerged from the car i felt rather than saw an onlooker varduk stood in the wide front door of the lodge building neither jake nor i could agree later whether he had opened the door himself and appeared whether he had stepped into view with the door already open or whether he had been standing there all the time his slender elegant figure was dressed in dark jacket and trousers with a black silk scarf draped ascot fashion at his throat just as he had worn at his hotel in new york when he saw that we were aware of him he lifted a white hand in greeting and descended two steps to meet us coming the black drama toward him i offered him my hand and he gave it a quick sharp pressure as though he were investigating the texture of my flesh and bone i am glad to see you here so soon mr connatt he said cordially now we need wait only for miss vining who should arrive before dark miss holgar came yesterday and davidson this morn ing there will be only the six of us then i asked he nodded his chestnut curls a care taker will come here each day to prepare lunch and dinner and to clean he lives several miles up the road and will spend his nights at home but we of the play itself will be in residence and we alone a condition fully in character i feel with the attitude of mystery and reserve we have assumed toward our interesting production for breakfasts davidson will be able to look after us huh grunted jake that davidson can act manage stagehand cookhe does everything almost everything said varduk dryly and his eyes turned long and ex pressionlessly upon my friend who im mediately subsided in the daylight i saw that varduks eyes were hazel on the night i had met him at his hotel they had seemed thunderdark you too are considered useful at many things around the theater switz varduk continued i took that into con sideration when miss holgar though she left her maid behind insisted on includ ing you in the company i daresay we can depend on you to help davidson with the staging and so on oh yes sure jake made reply cer tainly miss holgar she wants me to do that very good varduk turned on the heel of his wellpolished boot sup pose he added over his shoulder that you take mr connatt up to the loft of the boathouse mr connatt do you mind putting up with switz not in the least i assured him read ily and took up two of my bags jake had already lifted the third and heaviest we nodded to varduk and skirted the side of the lodge walked down to the water then entered the boathouse it was a simple affair of wellchinked logs two leakylooking canoes still occupied the lower part of it but we picked our way past them and ascended a sturdy staircase to a loft under the peaked roof this had been finished with wallboard and boasted a window at each end two cots a rug a washstand a table and several chairs made it an acceptable sleeping apartment this theater is halfway to the never never land i commented as i began to unpack i should live soi never saw the like of it jake said earnestly how are people going to find their way here yes terday i began to talk about signs by the side of the road right off at once var duk said no i begged like a poor rela tion left out of his uncles will finally he said yesbut the signs must be small and dignified and put up only a day be fore the show begins i wanted to ask a question about his adventure of the previous night but jake shook his head in refusal to discuss it not here he said gib who knows who may be listening he dropped his voice or even what might be listening i lapsed into silence and got out old canvas sneakers flannel slacks and a nor folk jacket and changed into them dressed in this easy manner i left the boathouse and stood beside the lake at once a voice hailed me sigrid was walk weird tales ing along the waters edge smiling in apparent delight we came face to face i bent to kiss her hand as once before it flut tered under my lips but when i straight ened again i saw nothing of distaste or unsteadiness in her expression gib how nice that youre here she cried do you like the place i havent seen very much of it yet i told her i want to see the inside of the theater she took her hand away from me and thrust it into the pocket of the old white sweater she wore i think that i love it here she said with an air of gay confes sion not all of the hermit stories about me are lies i could grow truly fatgod save the markon quiet and serenity varduk pleases you too i sug gested he has more understanding than any other theatrical executive in my experi ence she responded emphatically he fills me with the wish to work im like a starryeyed beginner again what would you say if i told you that i was sweeping my own room and making my own bed i would say that you were the most charming housemaid in the world her laughter was full of delight you sound as if you mean it gib it is nice to know you as a friend again it seemed to me that she emphasized the word friend a trifle as though to warn me that our relationship would nevermore become closer than that changing the subject i asked her if she had swum in the lake she had and found it cold how about seeing the theater together we walked toward the lodge and entered at a side door the auditorium was as jake had de scribed it to me and i saw that varduk liked a dark tone he had stained the paneling the benches and the beams a dark brown brown too was the heavy curtain that hid the stage well be there tonight said sigrid nodding stageward varduk has called the first rehearsal for immediately after dinner we eat together of course in a big room upstairs may i sit next to you when we eat i asked and she laughed yet again she was being as cheerful as i had ever known her to be you sound like the studenthero in a light opera gib i dont know about the seatingarrangement last night i was at the head of the table and varduk at the foot jake and mr davidson were at either side of me i shall certainly arrive before one or the other of them i vowed solemnly varduk had drifted in as we talked and he chuckled at my announcement a gallant note mr connatt and one that i hope you can capture as pleasantly for the romantic passages of our ruthven by the bye our first rehearsal will take place this evening so miss holgar has told me i nod ded i have studied the play rather prayerfully since davidson gave me a copy i hope im not a disappointment in it i am sure that you will not be he said kindly i did not choose disappoint ing people for my cast davidson entered from the front to say that martha vining had arrived var duk moved away stiff in his walk as i had observed before sigrid and i went through the side door and back into the open that evening i kept my promise to find a place by sigrid at the table davidson entering just behind me looked a trifle chagrined but sat at my other side with martha vining opposite the dinner was good with roast mutton salad and apple the black drama tart i thought of judge pursuivants healthy appetite as i ate after the coffee varduk nodded to the old man who served as caretaker cook and waiter as in dismissal then the producers hazel eyes turned to sigrid who took her cue and rose we did like wise shall we go down to the stage var duk said to us its time for our first effort with ruthven rehearsal we went down a back stairway that brought us to the empty stage a light was already burning and i remem ber well that my first impression was of the stages narrowness and considerable depth its back was of plaster over the outer timbers but at either side partitions of paneling had been erected to enclose the celllike dressingrooms one of the doors bore a star of white paint evidently for sigrid against the back wall leaned several open frames of wood with rolls of canvas lying ready to be tacked on and painted into scenery varduk had led the way down the stairs and at the foot he paused to call upward to davidson who remained at the rear of the procession fetch some chairs he ordered and the tall subordi nate paused to gather them he carried down six at once his long strong arms threaded through their open backs var duk showed him with silent gestures where to arrange them and himself led sigrid to the midmost of them upstage center sit down all he said to the rest of us curtain davidson he waited while the heavy pall rolled ponderously upward against the top of the arch have you got your scripts ladies and gentlemen we all had but his hands were empty i started to offer him my copy but he waved it away with thanks i know the thing by heart he informed me though with no air of boasting remaining still upon his feet he looked around our seated array capturing every eye and at tention the first part of ruthven is as we know already in iambic pentameterthe heroic verse that was customary and even expected in dramas of byrons day however he employs here his usual trick of breaking the earlier lines up into short situationbuilding speeches no long and involved declamations as in so many creaky tragedies of his fellows he wrote the same sort of opening scenes for his plays the world has already seen per formedwerner the two foscari ma rino faliero and the deformed trans formed martha vining cleared her throat doesnt manfred begin with a long measured soliloquy by the central char acter it does nodded varduk i am gratified miss vining to observe that you have been studying something of byrons work he paused and she bri dled in satisfaction however he con tinued somewhat maliciously you would be well advised to study farther and learn that byron stated definitely that manfred was not written for the theater but re turning to ruthven with which work we are primarily concerned the short lively exchanges at the beginning are aubreys and malvinas he quoted from memory scene malvinas garden time late afternoonaubrey sitting at malvinas feet tells his adventures very good mr connatt take your place at miss holgars feet i did so and she smiled in comradely fashion while waiting for the others to drag their chairs away glancing at our scripts we began weird tales im no othello darling yet i am your desdemona tell me of your travels of anthropophagi and men whose heads do grow beneath i saw no such not in all wildest greece and mace don saw you no spirits none malvinanone not even the vampire he who quaffs the blood of life that he may live in death not i how do you know that tale ive read in old romances capital capital interrupted varduk pleasantly i know that the play is writ ten in a specific meter yet you need not speak as though it were if anything make the lines less rhythmic and more matteroffact remember you are young lovers half bantering as you woo let your audience relax with you let it feel the verse form without actually hearing we continued to the line where aubrey tells of his travelacquaintance ruthven here the speech became defi nite verse he is a friend who charms but does not cheer one who commands but comforts not the world i do not doubt but women find him handsome yet hearts must be uneasy at his glance malvina asks his glance is it so piercing when it strikes and aubrey it does not pierceindeed it rather weighs like lead upon the face where it is fixed followed the story which i have out lined elsewhere of the encounter with bandits and ruthvens apparent sacrifice of himself to cover aubreys retreat then martha vining as the maid brid get spoke to announce ruthvens coming and upon the heels of her speech varduk moved stiffly toward us aubrey he cried in a rich ringing tone such as fills theaters and not at all like his ordinary gentle voice i made my due response have you lived ruthven but the horde of outlaw warriors compassed you and struck in the rôle of ruthven varduks in terruption was as natural and decisive as when in ordinary conversation he neatly cut anothers speech in two with a remark of his own i have already quoted this reply of ruthvens i faced them and who seeks my face seeks death he was speaking the line of course without script and his eyes held mine despite myself i almost staggered under the weight of his glance it was like that which aubrey actually credits to ruthven leadheavy instead of piercing difficult to support the rehearsal went on with ruthvens seduction of bridget and his court to the nervous but fascinated malvina in the end as i have synopsized earlier came his secret and miraculous revival from seeming death varduk delivered the final rather terrifying speech magnifi cently and then abruptly doffed his ruth ven manner to smile congratulations all around its more than a month to our open ing date in july he said and yet i would be willing to present this play as a the black drama finished play no later than this day week miss holgar may i voice my special ap preciation mr connatt your confessed fear of your own inadequacy is proven groundless bravo miss viningand you davidson his final tag of praise to his subordinate seemed almost grudg ing now for the second act of the thing no verse this time my friends finish the rehearsal as well as you have begun wait i said how about proper ties i simulated the clubstroke in the first act but this time i need a sword for the sake of feeling the action bet ter yes of course granted varduk theres one in the corner dressing room he pointed go fetch it david son davidson complied the sword was a crosshilt affair old but keen and bright this isnt a prop at all i half ob jected its the real thing wont it be dangerous oh i think we can risk it varduk replied carelessly lets get on with the rehearsal a hundred years later in the same garden swithin and mary descend ants of aubrey and malvina on stage we continued the opening again with sigrid and myself awooing was lively and even brilliant martha vining in her rôle of the centenarian bridget skilfully cracked her voice and infused a witchlike quality into her tell ing of the aubreyruthven tale again the entrance of ruthven his suavity and apparent friendliness his manner chang ing as he is revealed as the resurrected fiend of another age finally the clash with me as swithin i spoke my linemy ancestor killed you once ruthven i can do the same today then i poked at him with the sword varduk smiled and interjected rather a languid thrust that mr connatt do you think it will seem serious from the viewpoint of our audience im sorry i said i was afraid i might hurt you fear nothing mr connatt take the speech and the swordplay again i did so but he laughed almost in scorn you still put no life into the thrust he spread his hands as if to offer himself as a target once more dont be an old woman losing a bit of my temper i made a genuine lunge my right foot glided for ward and my weight shifted to follow my point but in midmotion i knew myself for a dangerdealing fool tried to re cover failed and slipped i almost fell at full lengthwould have fallen had varduk not been stand ing in my way my swordpoint com pletely out of control drove at the center of his breasti felt it tear through cloth through flesh a moment later his slender hands had caught my floundering body and pushed it back upon its feet my sword wedged in something snatched its hilt from my hand sick and horrified i saw it pro truding from the midst of varduks body behind me i heard the choked squeal of martha vining and an oath from jake switz i swayed my vision seemed to swim in smoky liquid and i suppose i was well on the way to an unmasculine swoon but a light chuckle in varduks familiar manner saved me from collaps ing that is exactly the way to do it mr connatt he said in a tone of wellbred applause he drew the steel freei think that he had to wrench rather hardand then stepped forward to extend the hilt theres blood on it i mumbled sickly weird tales oh that he glanced down at the blade just a deceit for the sake of real ism you arranged the falseblood device splendidly davidson he pushed the hilt into my slack grasp look the imi tation gore is already evaporating so it was like dew on a hot stone already the blade shone bright and clean very good said varduk climax now miss holgar i think it is your line she too had been horrified by the seeming catastrophe but she came gamely up to the bit where mary pleads for swi thins life offering herself as the price half a dozen exchanges between ruthven and mary thus you give yourself up then i do you renounce your former manners hopes and wishes i do you will swear so upon the book yonder here ruthven points to a bible open on the gardenseat i do mary touches the bible you submit to the powers i repre sent i know only the power to which i pray our father which wert in heaven sigrid as i say had done well up to now but here she broke off it isnt correct there she pointed out the prayer should read art in heaven per haps the script was copied wrongly no said martha vining its wert in heaven on mine and on mine i added varduk had frowned a moment as if perplexed but he spoke decisively as a matter of fact its in the original by ron undoubtedly meant it to be so to show marys agitation sigrid had been reading ahead far ther down in the same prayer it says almost the same thingthy will be done on earth as it was in heaven it should be is in heaven i had found the same deviation in my own copy byron hardly meant marys agitation to extend so far i argued since when mr connatt inquired varduk silkily did you become an au thority on what byron meant here or elsewhere in his writings youre being not only a critic but a clairvoyant i felt my cheeks glowing and i met his heavy mocking gaze as levelly as i could i dont like sacrilegious mistakes i said and i dont like being snubbed sir davidson stepped to varduks side you cant talk to him like that con natt he warned me davidson was a good four inches taller than i and more muscular but at the moment i welcomed the idea of fightirfg him i moved a step forward mr davidson i said to him i dont welcome dictation from you not on anything i choose to do or say sigrid cried out in protest and varduk lifted up a hand he smiled too in a dazzling manner i think he said in sudden good hu mor that we are all tired and shaken perhaps its due to the unintentional realism of that incident with the sword i saw several faces grow pale suppose we say that the rehearsals wont include so dangerouslooking an attack hereafter well save the trick for the public per formance itself and well stop work now in any case its supposed to be unlucky to speak the last line of a play in rehearsal shall we all go and get some rest he turned to sigrid and offered his arm she took it and they walked side by side out of the stage door and away martha vining followed at their heels while davidson lingered to turn out the lights jake and i left together for our the black drama own boathouse loft the moon was up and i jumped when leaves shimmered in its lighti remembered jakes story about the amorphous lurkers in the thick ets but nothing challenged us and we went silently to bed though i at least lay wakeful for hours pursuivant again when finally i slept it was to dream in strange unrelated flashes the clearest impression of all was that sigrid and judge pursuivant came to lead me deep into the dark woods beyond the lodge they seemed to know their way through pathless thickets and finally beckoned me to follow into a deep shad owed cleft between banks of earth we descended for miles i judged in my dream until we came to a bare hard floor at the bottom here was a wide round hatchway of metal like a very large sewer lid bidding me watch sig rid and the judge bent and tugged the lid up and away gazing down the exposed shaft it was as if i saw the heavens be neath my feetthe fathomlessness of the night sky like velvet all sprinkled with crumbs of starfire i did not know whether to be joyful or to fear then i had awakened and it was bright morn ing the air was warmer than it had been the day before and i donned bathing trunks and went downstairs treading softly to let jake snore blissfully on almost at the door of the boathouse i came face to face with davidson who smiled disarmingly and held out his hand he urged me to forget the brief hostility that had come over us at rehearsal he was quite unforced and cheerful about it yet i surmised that varduk had bade him make peace with me however i agreed that we had both been tired and upset and we shook hands cordially then i turned toward the water and saw sigrid lazily crawling out into the deep stretches with long smooth strokes i called her name ran in waistdeep and swam as swiftly as i could soon catching up she smiled in welcome and turned on her side to say goodmorning in her brief bathingsuit she did not look so gaunt and fragile her body was no more than healthily slim and quite firm and stronglooking as we swam easily i was impelled to speak of my dream and she smiled again i think that was rather beautiful i mean about the heavens below your feet she said symbolism might have some thing to say about it in a way the vision was propheticjudge pursuivant has sent word that he will call on us perhaps the rest was prophetic too i ventured boldly you and i together sigridand heaven at our feet ive been in long enough she an nounced suddenly and breakfast must be ready come on gib race me back to shore she was off like a trout and i churned after her we finished neck and neck separated and went away to dress at breakfast which davidson prepared sim ply but well of porridge toast and eggs i did not get to sit next to sigrid david son and jake had found places at her left and right hands i paid what attentions i could devise to martha vining but if sigrid was piqued by my courtliness in another direction she gave no sign the meal over i returned to my room secured my copy of ruthven and carried it outdoors to study i chose a sundrenched spot near the lodge set my back to a tree and leafed through the play underlining difficult passages here and there i remembered varduks announcement that we would never speak the plays last line in rehearsal lest bad weird tales luck fall he was superstitious for all his apparent wisdom and culture yet according to the books judge pursuivant had lent me so was lord byron from whom varduk claimed descent what was the illomened last line by the way i turned to the last page of the script the final line as typewritten by dav idson contained only a few words my eyes found it ruthven placing his hand on marys head and no more than that there was place for a speech after the stage direc tion apparently the monsters involun tary cry for blessing upon the brave girl but davidson had not set down such a speech amazed and in some unaccountable way uneasy i walked around the corner of the lodge to where martha vining seated on the doorstep also studied her lines before i had finished my first ques tion she nodded violently its the same way on my script she informed me you mean the last speech missing i noticed last night and men tioned it before breakfast to miss holgar she has no last line either a soft chuckle drifted down upon us varduk had come to the open door davidson must have made a careless omission he said of course there is only one typescript of the play with car bon copies well if the last line is miss ing isnt it a definite sign that we should not speak it in rehearsal he rested his heavy gaze upon me then upon martha vining smiled to con clude the discussion and drew back into the hallway and beyond our sight perhaps i may be excused for not feel ing completely at rest on the subject judge pursuivant arrived for lunch dressed comfortably in flannels and a tweed jacket and his performance at table was in healthy contrast to varduk who as usual ate hardly anything in the early afternoon i induced the judge to come for a stroll up the slope and along the main road as soon as we were well away from the lodge i told him of jakes adventure the outcome of the sword accident at rehearsal and the air of mys tery that deepened around the omitted final speech of the play perhaps im being nervous and illu sionridden i began to apologize in con clusion but he shook his great head youre being nothing of the sort connatt apparently my semipsychic in tuition was good as gold i did perfectly right in following this drama and its com pany out here into the wilderness you came deliberately i asked and he nodded my friends cabin in the neighbor hood was a stroke of good luck and i more than half courted the invitation to occupy it ill be frank connatt and say that from the outset i have felt a definite and occult challenge from varduk and his activities he chopped at a weed with his big malacca stick pondered a moment then continued your mr varduk is a mysterious fel low i need not enlarge on that though i might remind you of the excellent rea son for his strange character and be havior byrons blood exactly and byrons curse i stopped in midstride and turned to face the judge he smiled somewhat apologetically i know connatt he said that mod ern men and women think such things impossible they think it equally impos sible that anyone of good education and normal mind should take occultism seri ously but i disprove the latter impos sibility at leasti hold degrees from three worldfamous universities and my the black drama behavior at least shows that i am neither morbid nor shallow certainly not i assented thinking of his hearty appetite his record of achievement in many fields his manifest kindness and sincerity then consent to hear my evidence out he resumed his walk and i fell into step with him its only circum stantial evidence i fear and as such must not be entirely conclusive yet here it is byron was the ideal target for a curse not only personally but racially his fore bears occupied themselves with revolu tion dueling sacrilege and lesser sins they were the sort who attract and merit disaster as for his immediate parents it would be difficult to choose a more depraved father than captain mad jack byron or a more unnatural mother than catherine gordon of gight brimstone was bred into the childs very soul by those two follow his career and what is there pride violence orgy disgrace over his married life hangs a shocking cloud an unmentionable accusation rightly or not we cannot say as for his associates they withered at his touch his children lawful and natural died un timely and unhappy his friends found ruin or death even doctor polidori plagiarist of the ruthven story commit ted suicide byron himself when barely past his first youth perished alone and far from home and friends today his bright fame is blurred and tarnished by a wealth of legend that can be called nothing less than diabolic yet he wasnt all unlucky i sought to remind my companion his beauty and brilliance his success as a poet all part of the curse when could he be thankful for a face that drew the love of lady caroline lamb and precipi tated one of londons most fearful scan dals as for his poetry did it not mark him for envy spite and eventually a concerted attack i daresay byron would have been happier as a plainfaced me chanic or grocer i felt inclined to agree and said as much if a curse exists i added would it affect varduk as a descendant of byron i think that it would and that his recent actions prove at once the existence of a curse and the truth of his claim to descent a shadow lies on that man connatt the rest of the similarity holds i responded the charm and the genius i have wondered why miss holgar agrees to this play it is archaic in some degree melodramatic and her part is by no means dominant yet she seems de lighted with the role and the production in general i have considered the same apparent lapse of her judgment said pursuivant and came to the conclusion that you are about to suggestthat varduk has gained some sort of influence over miss holgar perhaps then you feel that such an influence would be dangerous to her and to others exactly what to do then do nothing gentlemen said some one directly behind us we both whirled in sudden surprize it was elmo davidson davidson gives a warning i scowled at davidson in surprized pro test at his intrusion judge pursuivant did not scowl but i saw him lift his walkingstick with his left hand place his right upon the curved handle and gave it a little twist and jerk as though preparing to draw a cork from a bottle davidson grinned placatingly please gentlemen i didnt mean to eavesdrop or to do anything else sneak weird tales ing it was only that i went for a walk too saw the pair of you ahead and hur ried to catch up i couldnt help but hear the final words you were saying and i couldnt help but warn you we relaxed but judge pursuivant re peated warn in a tone deeply frigid may i amplify first of all varduk certainly does not intend to harm either of you second he isnt the sort of man to be crossed in anything i suppose not i rejoined trying to be casual you must be pretty sure dav ilson of his capabilities and character he nodded weve been together since college pursuivant leaned on his stick and pro duced his wellseasoned briar pipe its comforting to hear you say that i mean that mr varduk was once a college boy i was beginning to wonder if he wasnt thousands of years old davidson shook his head slowly see here why dont we sit down on the bank and talk maybe ill tell you a story very good agreed pursuivant and sat down i did likewise and we both gazed expectantly at davidson he re mained standing with hands in pockets until pursuivant had kindled his pipe and i my cigarette then im not trying to frighten you and i wont give away any real secrets about my employer its just that you may un derstand better after you learn how i met him it was more than ten years ago var duk came to revere college as a fresh man when i was a junior he was much the same then as he is nowslender quiet selfcontained enigmatic i got to know him better than anyone in school and i cant say truly that i know him not even now revere in case you never heard of the place is a small school with a big reputation for grounding its students hockdeep in the classics pursuivant nodded and emitted a cloud of smoke i knew your professor dahl berg of revere he interjected hes one of the great minds of the age on greek literature and history davidson continued the buildings at revere are old and you might say swaddled in the ivy planted by a hundred graduating classes the traditions are consistently mellow and none of the fac ulty members come in for much respect until they are past seventy yet the stu dents are very much like any others when class is over in my day at least we gave more of a hoot for one touch down than for seven thousand odes of horace he smiled a little as though in mild relish of memories he had evoked within himself the football team wasnt very good but it wasnt very bad either it meant something to be on the first team and i turned out to be a fairish tackle at the start of my junior year the year im talk ing about a man by the name of schaefer was captaina good fullback though not brilliant and the recognized leader of the campus varduk didnt go in for athletics or for anything else except a good stiff course of study mostly in the humanities he took a room at the end of the hall on the third floor of the mens dormitory and kept to himself you know how a college dorm loves that you men six days after the term started the yellow dogs had him on their list who were the yellow dogs i asked oh theres a bunch like it in every school spiritual descendants of the mo hocks that flourished in queen annes reign rough and rowdy undergraduates out for halloween pranks every night w t the black drama and any student particularly any frosh that stood on his dignity he paused and let our imagination finish the potentialities of such a situation so one noon after lunch at the train ingtable schaefer winked at me and a couple of other choice spirits we went to our rooms and got out our favorite paddles carved from barrelstaves and lettered over with fraternity emblems and wisecracks then we tramped up to the third floor and knocked loudly at var duks door he didnt answer we tried the knob the lock was on so schaefer dug his big shoulder into the panel and smashed his way in davidson stopped and drew a long breath as if with it he could win a better ability to describe the things he was telling varduk lifted those big deep eyes of his as we appeared among the ruins of his door no fear not even surprize just a long look traveling from one of us to another when he brought his gaze to me i felt as if somebody was pointing two guns at me two guns loaded to their muzzles i listening felt like saying i knew how he had felt but i did not interrupt he was sitting comfortably in an arm chair went on davidson rocking on his feet as though nervous with the memory and in his slender hands he held a big dark book his forefinger marked a place between the leaves get up frosh schaefer said and salute your superiors varduk did not move or speak he looked and schaefer bellowed louder against a sudden and considerable uneasi ness what are you reading there he de manded of varduk in his toughest voice a very interesting work varduk replied gently it teaches how to rule people uhhuh schaefer sneered at him lets have a look at it i doubt if you would like it var duk said but schaefer made a grab the book came open in his hands he bent as if to study it then he took a blind lumbering step backward he smacked into the rest of us all bunched behind him and without us i think he might have fallen down i couldnt see his face but the back of his big bullneck had turned as white as plas ter he made two efforts to speak before he managed it then all he could splut ter out was whwhat davidson achieved rather well the man ner of a strong simple man gone sud denly shaky with fright i told you that you probably wouldnt like it varduk said like an adult reminding a child then he got up out of his armchair and took the book from schaefers hands he began to talk again schaefer i want to see you here in this room after you finish your football practise this afternoon schaefer didnt make any answer all of us edged backward and got out of there davidson paused so long that pursui vant asked is that all no it isnt in a way its just the beginning schaefer made an awful fool of himself five or six times on the field that day he dropped every one of his passes from center when we ran signals and five or six times he muffed the ball at dropkick practise the coach told him in front of everybody that he acted like a high school yokel when we finished and took our showers he hung back until i came out so as to walk to the dormitory with me he tagged along like a fright ened kid brother and when we got to the front door he started upstairs like an w t weird tales old man he wanted to turn toward his own room on the second floor but var duks voice spoke his name and we both looked up startled on the stairs to the third flight stood varduk holding that black book open against his chest he spoke to schaefer i told you that i wanted to see you schaefer tried to swear at him after all here was a frail pale little frosh who didnt seem to have an ounce of muscle on his bones giving orders to a big football husky who weighed more than two hundred pounds but the swear words sort of strangled in his throat varduk laughed neither of you have ever heard a sound so soft or merciless perhaps youd like me to come to your room after you varduk suggested schaefer turned and came slowly to the stairs and up them when he got level with varduk i didnt feel much like watching the rest as i moved away toward my room i saw varduk slip his slender arm through schaefers big thick one and fall into step with him just as if they were going to have the nicest schoolboy chat you can imagine davidson shuddered violently and so despite the warm june air did i pursui vant seemed a shade less pink here ive talked too much david son said with an air of embarrassment probably its because ive wanted to tell this storyover a space of years no point in holding back the end but id greatly appreciate your promiseboth your promisesthat youll not pass the tale on we both gave our words and urged him to continue he did so i had barely got to my own digs when there was a frightful row outside shouts and scamperings and screamings yes screamings of young men scared out of their wits i jumped up and hurried downstairs and out there lay schaefer on the pavement in front of the dormi tory he was dead with the brightest red blood all over him about twenty witnesses more or less had seen him as he jumped out of varduks window the faculty and the police came and varduk spent hours with them being questioned but he told them something satisfactory for he was let go and never charged with any responsibility late that night as i sat alone at my desk trying to drive from my minds eye the bright bright red of schaefers blood a gentle knock sounded at my door i got up and opened there stood varduk and he held in his hands that black vol ume i saw the dark red edging on its pages the color of blood three hours old i wondered he said in his soft voice if youd like to see the thing in my book that made your friend schaefer so anxious to leave my room i assured him that i did not he smiled and came in all uninvited then he spoke briefly but very clear ly about certain things he hoped to do and about how he needed a helper he said that i might be that helper i made no reply but he knew that i would not refuse he ordered me to kneel and i did then he showed me how to put my hands together and set them between his palms the oath i took was the medieval oath of vassalage and i have kept my oath from that day to this davidson abruptly strode back along the way to the lodge he stopped at half a dozen paces distance maybe id better get along he sug gested you two may want to think and talk about what i have said and my ad vice not to get in varduks way with that he resumed his departure and went out of sight without once look ing back again the black drama that evening judge pursuivant and i remained sitting on the roadside bank until davidson had completely vanished around a treeclustered bend of the way then my companion lifted a heavy walk ingboot and tapped the dottle from his pipe against the thick sole how did that cheerful little story im press you he inquired i shook my head dubiously my mus tache prickled on my upper lip like the mane of a nervous dog if it was true i said slowly how did davidson dare tell it probably because he was ordered to i must have stared foolishly you think that pursuivant nodded my knowledge of underworld argot is rather limited but i believe that the correct phrase is lay off were being told to do that and in a highly interesting manner as to whether or not the story is true im greatly inclined to believe that it is i drew another cigarette from my pack age and my hand trembled despite itself then the man is dangerousvarduk i mean what is he trying to do to sigrid that is what perplexes me once ac cording to your little friend jake switz he defended her from some mysterious but dangerous beings his behavior argues that he isnt the only power to consider the judge held a match for my cig arette his hand was steady and its stead iness comforted me now then i said to prevent whatever is being done thats what wed better talk about pursuivant took his stick and rose to his feet lets get on with our walk and make sure this time that nobody over hears us we began to saunter while he con tinued slowly and soberly you feel that it is miss holgar who is threatened thats no more than guess work on your part supplemented by the natural anxiety of a devoted admirerif youll pardon my mentioning thatbut you are probably right varduk seems to have exerted all his ingenuity and charm to induce her to take a part in this play and at this place the rest of you he had gathered more carelessly it is reasonably safe to say that whatever happens will happen to miss holgar but what will happen i urged feeling very depressed that we do not know as yet i began to speak again but he lifted a hand please let me finish perhaps you think that we should do what we can to call off the play get miss holgar out of here but i reply having given the mattter deep thought that such a thing is not desirable not desirable i echoed my voice rising in startled surprize you mean she must stay here in heavens name why because evil is bound to occur to spirit her away will be only a retreat the situation must be allowed to develop then we can achieve victory why connatt he went on warmly can you not see that the whole atmosphere is charged with active and supernormal perils dont you know that such a chance for meeting and defeating the power of wickedness seldom arises what can you think of when you want to run away im not thinking of myself sir i told him its sigrid miss holgar handsomely put all right then when you go back to the lodge tell her what weve said and suggest that she leave i shook my head more hopelessly than weird tales before you know that she wouldnt take me seriously just so nobody will take seriously the things we are beginning to under stand you and i we have to fight alone but well win he began to speak more brightly when is the play sup posed to have its first performance sometime after the middle of july ive heard varduk say as much several times though he did not give the exact date pursuivant grew actually cheerful that means that we have three weeks or so something will happen around that timepresumably on opening night if time was not an element he would not have defended her on her first night here i felt somewhat reassured and we re turned from our stroll in fairly good spirits varduk again spoke cordially to pur suivant and invited him to stay to dinner i must ask that you leave shortly after ward he concluded the invitation our rehearsals have something of secrecy about them you wont be offended if of course not pursuivant assured him readily but later the judge found a moment to speak with me keep your eyes open he said earnestly he feels that i in some degree familiar with oc cult matters might suspect or even dis cover something wrong about the play well talk later about the things you see the evening meal was the more pleas ant for judge pursuivants high humored presence he was gallant to the ladies deferential to varduk and witty to all of us even the pale haunted face of our producer relaxed in a smile once or twice and when the meal was over and pursuivant was ready to go varduk accompanied him to the door speaking graciously the while you will pardon me if i see you safely to the road it is no more than evening yet i have a feeling and i have the same feeling said pursuivant not at all heavily i appre ciate your offer of protection varduk evidently suspected a note of mockery he paused there are things judge pursuivant he said against which ordinary protection would not suf fice you have borne arms i believe yet you know that they will not always avail they had come to the head of the front stairs leading down to the lobby of the theater the others at table were chattering over a second cup of coffee but i was straining my ears to hear what the judge and varduk were saying arms yes ive borne them pursuivant admitted oddly enough im armed now should you care to see he lifted his malacca walkingstick in both hands grasping its shank and the handle a twist and a jerk and it came apart revealing a few inches of metal pursuivant drew forth as from a sheath a thin gleaming blade sword cane exclaimed varduk ad miringly he bent for a closer look and a singularly interesting one elaborated pursuivant quite old as you can see for yourself ah so it is agreed varduk i fancy you had it put into the cane i did look at the inscription varduk peered yes i can make it out though it seems worn he pursed his lips then read aloud very slowly sic pereant omnes inimici tui domine it sounds like scripture thats what it is mr varduk pursuivant was saying blandly the king james version has it so let all thine enemies perish o lord its from the black drama deborahs song fifth chapter of judges varduk was plainly intrigued a war like text i must say what knight of the church chose it for his battle cry many have chosen it responded the judge shall we go on they walked down the stairs side by side and so out of my sight and hearing when varduk returned he called us at once to rehearsal he was as alert as he had been the night before but much harder to please indeed he criticized speeches and bits of stage busi ness that had won his high praise at the earlier rehearsal and several times he called for repetitions and new interpre tations he also announced that at the third rehearsal due the next day he would take away our scripts you are all accomplished actors he amplified you need nothing to refresh good memories id like to keep my book begged martha vining but varduk smiled and shook his head youll be better without he said definitely when we approached the climactic scene with swithins attempt to kill ruthven and marys attempted sacrifice varduk did not insist on stage business in fact he asked us flatly to speak our lines without so much as movmg from our places if this was to calm us after the frightening events of the night be fore it did not succeed everyone there remembered the accidental swordthrust and varduks seeming invulnerability it was as though their thoughts were dole ful spoken words rehearsal overagain without the final line by ruthvenvarduk bade us a courteous goodnight and as before walked out first with sigrid and martha vining i followed with jake but at the threshold i touched his arm come with me i muttered and turned toward the front of the lodge varduk and the two women had gone out of sight around the rear of the build ing nobody challenged us as we walked silently in the direction of the road but i had a sensation as of horrors all around me inadequately bound back with strands that might snap at any moment whats it about gib asked jake once but at that moment i saw what i had somehow expected and feared to see a silent figure lay at the foot of the upwardsloping driveway to the road we both ran forward coming up on either side of that figure the moon showed through broken clouds by its light we recognized judge pursuivant limp and apparently lifeless beside him lay the empty shank of his walkingstick his right fist still clenched around the handle and the slender blade set therein was driven deeply into the loam i did not know what to do but jake did he knelt scooped the judges head up and set it against his knee then slapped the flaccid checks with his open palm pursuivants eyelids and mustache fluttered jake snorted approvingly and lifted his own crossed eyes to mine i guess hes all right gib just passed out is all maybe better you go to varduk and ask for some brand he broke off suddenly he was star ing at something behind me i turned my heart quivering inside my chest shapesmonstrous pallid unclean shapeswere closing in upon us in the thrilling chapters that will bring this strange novel to its end in next months weird tales the veil is swept aside and the weird monstrosity known as varduk stands revealed in all his hideousness we sug gest that you reserve your copy at your magazine dealers now he that hath wings by edmond hamilton the story of a modern icarusdavid rand was a freak of nature a glorious winged freak who had experienced the freedom of the sky and could no longer be tied to the ground doctor harriman paused in the corridor of the maternity ward and asked what about that woman in there was pity in the eyes of the plump crisply dressed head nurse as she answered she died an hour after the birth of her baby doctor her heart was bad you know the physician nodded his spare clean shaven face thoughtful yes i remem ber nowshe and her husband were in jured in an electrical explosion in a sub way a year ago and the husband died re cently what about the baby the nurse hesitated a fine healthy little boy except except what except that he is humpbacked doc tor doctor harriman swore in pity what horrible luck for the poor little devil born an orphan and deformed too he said with sudden decision ill look at the infant perhaps we could do some thing for him but when he and the nurse bent to gether over the crib in which redfaced little david rand lay squalling lustily the doctor shook his head no we cant do anything for that back what a shame david rands little red body was as straight and deanlined as that of any baby ever bornexcept for his back from the back of the infants shoulder blades jutted two humped projections one on each side that curved down toward the lower ribs those twin humps were so long and streamlined in their jutting curve that they hardly looked like deformities the skilful hands of doctor harriman gently probed them then an expression of per plexity came over his face this doesnt seem any ordinary de formity he said puzzledly i think well look at them through the xray tell doctor morris to get the apparatus going doctor morris was a stocky red headed young man who looked in pity also at the crying redfaced baby lying in front of the xray machine later he muttered tough on the poor kid that back ready doctor harriman nodded go ahead the xrays broke into sputtering crackling life doctor harriman applied his eyes to the fluoroscope his body stif fened it was a long silent minute be fore he straightened from his inspection his spare face had gone dead white and the waiting nurse wondered what had so excited him harriman said a little thickly mor ris take a look through this im either seeing things or else something utterly unprecedented has happened morris with a puzzled frown at his superior gazed through the instrument his head jerked up he that hath wings my god he exclaimed you see it too exclaimed doctor harriman then i guess im not crazy after all but this thingwhy its with out precedent in all human history he babbled incoherently and the bones toohollowthe whole skeleton al structure different his weight he set the infant hastily on a scale the beam jiggled see that exclaimed harriman he weighs only a third of what a baby his size should weigh redheaded young doctor morris was staring in fascination at the curving humps on the infants back he said hoarsely but this just isnt possi ble but its real harriman flung out his eyes were brilliant with excitement he cried a change in genepattems only that could have caused this some prenatal influence his fist smacked into his hand ive got it the electrical explosion that in jured this childs mother a year before his birth thats what did itan explo sion of hard radiations that damaged changed her genes you remember mul lers experiments the head nurses wonder overcame her respect she asked but what is it doc tor whats the mater with the childs back is it so bad as all that so bad repeated doctor harriman he drew a long breath he told the nurse this child this david rand is a unique case in medical history there has never been anyone like himas far as we know the thing thats going to happen to him has never happened to any other human being and all due to that elec trical explosion whats going to happen to him demanded the nurse dismayed this child is going to have wings shouted harriman those projections growing out on his backtheyre not just ordinary abnormalitiestheyre nascent wings that will very soon break out and grow just as a fledgling birds wings break out and grow the head nurse stared at them youre joking she said finally in flat unbelief good god do you think id joke about such a matter cried harriman i tell you im as stunned as you arc even though i can see the scientific reason for the thing this childs body is dif ferent from the body of any other human being that ever lived his bones are hollow like a birds bones his blood seems different and he weighs only a third what a normal hu man infant weighs and his shoulder blades jut out into bone projections to which are attached the great wing muscles the xrays clearly show the rudimentary feathers and bones of the wings themselves wings repeated young morris daz edly he said after a moment harri man this child will be able to hell be able to fly yes declared harriman im certain of it the wings are going to be very large ones and his body is so much lighter than normal that theyll easily bear him aloft good lord ejaculated morris inco herently he looked a little wildly down at the infant it had stopped crying and now waved pudgy red arms and legs weakly it just isnt possible said the nurse taking refuge in incredulity how could a baby a man have wings doctor harriman said swiftly its weird tales due to a deep change in the parents genes the genes you know are the tiny cells which control bodily development in every living thing that is born alter the genepattern and you alter the bodily development of the offspring which ex plains the differences in color size and so forth in children but those minor differences are due to comparatively mi nor genechanges but the genepattern of this childs parents was radically changed a year ago the electrical explosion in which they were injured must have deeply altered their genepatterns by a wave of sudden electrical force muller of the university of texas has demonstrated that gene patterns can be greatly altered by radia tion and that the offspring of parents so treated will differ greatly from their par ents in bodily form that accident pro duced an entirely new genepattern in the parents of this child one which devel oped their child into a winged human hes what biologists technically call a mutant young morris suddenly said good lord what the newspapers are going to do when they get hold of this story they mustnt get hold of it doctor harriman declared the birth of this child is one of the greatest things in the history of biological science and it mustnt be made a cheap popular sensa tion we must keep it utterly quiet they kept it quiet for three months in all during that time little david rand occupied a private room in the hos pital and was cared for only by the head nurse and visited only by the two phy sicians during those three months the cor rectness of doctor harrimans prediction was fulfilled for in that time the humped projections on the childs back grew with incredible rapidity until at last they broke through the tender skin in a pair of stubby scrawnylooking things that were unmistakably wings little david squalled violently during the days that his wings broke forth feel ing only a pain as of teething many times intensified but the two doctors stared and stared at those little wings with their rudimentary feathers even now hardly able to believe the witness of their eyes they saw that the child had as com plete control of the wings as of his arms and legs by means of the great muscles around their bases which no other hu man possessed and they saw too that while davids weight was increasing he remained still just a third of the weight of a normal child of his age and that his heart had a tremendously high pulsebeat and that his blood was far warmer than that of any normal person then it happened the head nurse unable any longer to contain the tremen dous secret with which she was bursting told a relative in strict confidence that relative told another relative also in strict confidence and two days later the story appeared in the new york news papers the hospital put guards at its doors and refused admittance to the grinning reporters who came to ask for details all of them were frankly skeptical and the newspaper stories were written with a tongue in the cheek the public laughed a child with wings what kind of phony new story would they think up next but a few days later the stories changed in tone others of the hospital personnel made curious by the newspaper yarns pried into the room where david rand lay crowing and thrashing his arms and legs and wings they babbled broad cast assertions that the story was true he that hath wings one of them who was a candid camera enthusiast even managed to slip out a photograph of the infant smeary as it was that photograph did unmistakably show a child with wings of some sort growing from its back the hospital became a fort a place be sieged reporters and photographers milled outside its doors and clamored against the special police guard that had been detailed to keep them out the great press associations offered doctor harriman large sums for exclusive stories and photographs of the winged child the public began to wonder if there was anything in the yarn doctor harriman had to give in finally he admitted a committee of a dozen reporters photographers and emi nent physicians to see the child david rand lay and looked up at them with wise blue gaze clutching his toe while the eminent physicians and news papermen stared down at him with bulg ing eyes the physicians said its incredible but its true this is no fakethe child really has wings the reporters asked doctor harriman wildly when he gets bigger will he be able to fly harriman said shortly we cant tell just what his development will be like now but if he continues to develop as he has undoubtedly hell be able to fly good lord let me at a phone groaned one newshound and then they were all scrambling pellmell for the tele phones doctor harriman permitted a few pic tures and then unceremoniously shoved the visitors out but there was no hold ing the newspapers after that david rands name became overnight the best known in the world the pictures con vinced even the most skeptical of the public great biologists made long statements on the theories of genetics which could explain the child anthropologists specu lated as to whether similar freak winged men had not been born a few times in the remote past giving rise to the world wide legends of harpies and vampires and flying people crazy sects saw in the childs birth an omen of the approaching end of the world theatrical agents offered immense sums for the privilege of exhibiting david in a hygienic glass case newspapers and press services outbid each other for ex dusive rights to the story doctor harri man could tell a thousand firms begged to purchase the right to use little davids name on toys infant foods and what not and the cause of all this excitement lay and rolled and crowed and sometimes cried in his little bed now and then vig orously flapping the sprouting wings that had upset the whole world doctor har riman looked thoughtfully down at him he said ill have to get him out of here the hospital superintendent is com plaining that the crowds and commotion are wrecking the place but where can you take him mor ris wanted to know he hasnt any par ents or relatives and you cant put a kid like this in an orphan asylum doctor harriman made decision im going to retire from practise and devote myself entirely to observing and record ing davids growth ill have myself made his legal guardian and ill bring him up in some spot away from all this turmoil an island or some place like that if i can find one harriman found such a place an island off the maine coast a speck of barren sand and scrubby trees he leased it built a bungalow there and took david weird tales rand and an elderly nursehousekeeper there he took also a strong norwegian watchman who was very efficient at repel ling the boats of reporters who tried to land there after a while the newspapers gave it up they had to be content to reprint the photographs and articles which doctor harriman gave to scientific pub lications concerning davids growth david grew rapidly in five years he was a sturdy little youngster with yellow hair and his wings were larger and covered with short bronze feathers he ran and laughed and played like any youngster flapping his wings vigorously he was ten before he flew by then he was a little slimmer and his glittering bronze wings came to his heels when he walked or sat or slept he kept the wings closely folded on his back like a bronze sheath but when he opened them they extended much farther than his arms could on either side doctor harriman had meant to let da vid gradually try flying to photograph and observe every step of the process but it did not happen that way david flew first as naturally as a bird first flies he himself had never thought much about his wings he knew that doctor john as he called the physician had no such wings and that neither did flora the gaunt old nurse nor holf the grin ning watchman have them but he had seen no other people and so he imagined the rest of the world was divided into people who had wings and people who didnt have them he did not know just what the wings were for though he knew that he liked to flap them and exercise them when he was running and would wear no shirt over them then one april morning david found out what his wings were for he had climbed into a tall old scrub oak to peer at a birds nest the child was always inordinately interested in the birds of the little island jumping and clapping his hands as he saw them darting and circling overhead watching their flocks stream south each fall and north each spring prying into their ways of living because of some dim sense of kinship with these other winged things he had climbed nearly to the top of the old oak on this morning toward the nest he had spied his wings were tight ly folded to keep them out of the way of branches then as he reached up to pull himself the last step upward his foot pressed on the merest rotten shell of a dead branch abnormally light as he was his weight was enough to snap the branch and he fell cleanly toward the ground instincts exploded in davids brain in the moment that he plummeted toward the ground quite without will his wings unfolded with a bursting whir he felt a terrific tug on them that wrenched his shoulders hard and then suddenly mar velously he was no longer falling but was gliding downward on a long slant with his wings unfolded and rigidly set there burst from his innermost being a high ringing shout of exultation downdowngliding like a swooping bird with the clean air buffeting at his face and streaming past his wings and body a wild sweet thrill that he had never felt before a sudden crazy joy in living he shouted again and with instant im pulse flapped his great wings beating the air with them instinctively bending his head sharply back and keeping his arms flattened against his sides his legs straight and close together he wras soaring upward now the ground swiftly receding beneath him the sun blazing in his eyes the wind scream ing around him he opened his mouth he that hath wings to shout again and the cold clean air hammered into his throat in sheer mad physical ecstasy he rocketed up through the blue with whirring wings it was thus that doctor harriman saw him when he chanced to come out of the bungalow a little later the doctor heard a shrill exultant cry from high above and looked up to see that slim winged shape swooping down toward him from the sunlit heavens the doctor caught his breath at the sheer beauty of the spectacle as david dived and soared and whirled above him gone crazy with delight in his newfound wings the boy had instinctively learned how to turn and twist and dive even though his movements had yet a clumsi ness that made him sometimes sideslip when david rand finally swooped down and alighted in front of the doctor with quickclosing wings the boys eyes streamed electric joy i can fly doctor harriman nodded you can fly david i know i cant keep you from doing it now but you must not leave the island and you must be careful by the time david reached the age of seventeen there was no longer any need to caution him to be careful he was as much at home in the air as any bird living he was a tall slim yellowhaired youth now his arrowstraight figure still clad only in the shorts that were all the cloth ing his warmblooded body required a wild restless energy crackling and snap ping in his keen face and dancing blue eyes his wings had become superb glitter ing bronzefeathered pinions that ex tended more than ten feet from tip to tip when he spread them and that touched his heels with their lowest feathers when he closed them on his back constant flying over the island and the surrounding waters had developed the great wingmuscles behind davids shoulders to tremendous strength and endurance he could spend a whole day gliding and soaring over the island now climbing high with mad burst of whir ring wings then circling planing on mo tionless wings slowly descending he could chase and overtake almost any bird in the air he would start up a flock of pheasants and his laughter would ring high and wild across the sky as he turned and twisted and darted after the panicky birds he could pull out the tailfeathers of outraged hawks before they could escape and he could swoop quicker than hawk on rabbits and squir rels on the ground sometimes when fog banked the island doctor harriman would hear the ringing shout from the gray mists overhead and would know that david was somewhere up there or again he would be out over the sunlit waters plummeting headlong down to them and then at the last mo ment swiftly spreading his wings so that he just skimmed the wavecrests with the screaming gulls before he rocketed up ward again never yet had david been away from the island but the doctor knew from his own infrequent visits to the mainland that the worldwide interest in the flying youth was still strong the photographs which the doctor gave to scientific jour nals no longer sufficed for the public curi osity and launches and airplanes with movingpicture cameramen frequently cir cled the island to snap pictures of david rand flying to one of those airplanes occurred a thing that gave its occupants much to talk about for days to come they were weird tales a pilot and cameraman who came over the island at midday in spite of doctor harrimans prohibition of such flights and who circled brazenly about looking for the flying youth had they looked up they could have seen david as a circling speck high above them he watched the airplane with keen interest mixed with contempt he had seen these flying ships before and he felt only pity and scorn for their stiff clumsy wings and noisy motors with which wing less men made shift to fly this one though so directly beneath him stimu lated his curiosity so that he swooped down toward it from above and behind his great wings urging him against the slipstream of its propeller the pilot in the open rearcockpit of that airplane nearly had heart failure when someone tapped him on the shoul der from behind he whirled startled and when he saw david rand crouching precariously on the fuselage just behind him grinning at him he lost his head for a moment so that the ship sideslipped and started to fall with a shouting laugh david rand leaped off the fuselage and spread his wings to soar up past it the pilot re covered enough presence of mind to right his ship and presently david saw it move unsteadily off toward the mainland its occupants had enough of the business for one day but the increasing number of such curi ous visitors stimulated in david rand a reciprocal curiosity concerning the outside world he wondered more and more what lay beyond the low dim line of the mainland over there across the blue wa ters he could not understand why doc tor john forbade him to fly over there when well he knew that his wings would bear him up for a hundred times that dis tance doctor harriman told him ill take you there soon david but you must wait until you understand things betteryou wouldnt fit in with the rest of the world yet why not demanded david puz zledly the doctor explained you have wings and no one else in the world has that might make things very difficult for you but why harriman stroked his spare chin and said thoughtfully youd be a sensation a sort of freak david theyd be curious about you because youre different but theyd look down on you for the same reason thats why i brought you up out here to avoid that you must wait a lit tle longer before you see the world david rand flung a hand up to point half angrily at a streaming flock of piping wild birds heading south black against the autumn sunset they dont wait every fall i see them everything that flies going away every spring i see them returning passing overhead again and i have to stay on this little island a wild pulse of freedom surged in his blue eyes i want to go as they do to see the land over there and the lands beyond that soon you shall go over there prom ised doctor harriman i will go with youwill look out for you there but through the dusk that evening david sat with chin in hand wings folded staring broodingly after the strag gling southing birds and in the days that followed he took less and less pleas ure in mere aimless flight above the is land and more and more watched wist fully the endless merry passage of the honking wild geese and swarming ducks and whistling songbirds he that hath wings doctor harriman saw and under stood that yearning in davids eyes and the old physician sighed he has grown up he thought and wants to go like any young bird that would leave its nest i shall not be able much longer to keep him from leaving but it was harriman himself who left first in a different way for some time the doctors heart had troubled him and there came a morning when he did not awaken and when a dazed uncompre hending david stared down at his guard ians still white face through all that day while the old housekeeper wept softly about the place and the norwegian was gone in the boat to the mainland to arrange the funeral david rand sat with folded wings and chin in hand staring out across the blue waters that night when all was dark and si lent around the bungalow he stole into the room where the doctor lay silent and peaceful in the darkness david touched the thin cold hand hot tears swam in his eyes and he felt a hard lump in his throat as he made that futile gesture of farewell then he went softly back out of the house into the night the moon was a red shield above the eastern waters and the autumn wind blew cold and crisp down through the keen air came the joy ous piping and carolling and whistling of a long swarm of wild birds like shrill buglecalls of gay challenge davids knees bent and he sprang up ward with whirring wingsup and up the icy air streaming past his body thun dering in his ears his nostrils drinking it and the dull sorrow in his heart re ceded in the bursting joy of flight and freedom he was up among those shrill ing whistling birds now the screaming wind tearing laughter from his lips as they scattered in alarm from him then as they saw that this strange winged creature who had joined them made no move to harm them the wild birds reformed their scattered flock far off across the dim heaving plain of the waters glowed the dull red moon and the scattered lights of the mainland the little lights of earthbound folk the birds shrilled loud and david laughed and sang in joyous chorus as his great wings whirred in time with their own trailing high across the night sky toward adven ture and freedom flying south all through that night and with brief rests through the next day also david flew southward for a time over endless waters and then over the green fertile land his hunger he satisfied by dipping toward trees loaded with ripening fruit when the next night came he slept in a crotch high in a tall forest oak crouched comfortably with his wings folded about him it was not long before the world learned that the freak youth with wings was abroad people in farms and vil lages and cities looked up incredulously at that slim figure winging high over head ignorant negroes who had never heard of david rand flung themselves prostrate in panic as he passed across the sky through all that winter there were re ports of david from the southland re ports that made it evident he had be come almost completely a creature of the wild what greater pleasure than to soar through the long sundrenched days over the blue tropic seas to swoop on the sil ver fish that broke from the waters to gather strange fruits and sleep at night in a high tree close against the stars and wake with dawn to another day of unfet tered freedom weird tales now and again he would circle un suspected over some city at night soar ing slowly in the darkness and peering down curiously at the vast pattern of straggling lights and the blazing streets choked with swarms of people and ve hicles he would not enter those cities and he could not see how the people in them could bear to live so crawling over the surface of the earth amid the rubbing and jostling of hordes like them never knowing even for a moment the wild clean joy of soaring through blue infini ties of sky what could make life worth while for such earthbound antlike folk when the spring sun grew hotter and higher and the birds began to flock to gether in noisy swarms david too felt something tugging him northward so he flew north over the springgreen land great bronzed wings tirelessly beating the air a slim tanned figure arrowing un erringly north he came at last to his goal the island where he had lived most of his life it lay lonely and deserted now in the empty waters dust gathering over the things in the abandoned bungalow the garden weedgrown david settled down there for a time sleeping upon the porch mak ing long flights for amusement west over the villages and dingy cities north over the rugged wavedashed coast east over the blue sea until at last the flowers began to die and the air grew frosty and the deep urge tugged at david until again he joined the great flocks of winged things going south north and southsouth and north for three years that wild freedom of un checked migration was his in those three years he came to know mountain and valley sea and river storm and calm and hunger and thirst as only they of the wild know them and in those years the world became accustomed to david al most forgot him he was the winged man just a freak there would never be another like him then in the third spring there came the end to david rands winged freedom he was on his spring flight north and at dusk felt hunger he made out in the twilight a suburban mansion amid extensive orchards and gardens and swooped down toward it with ideas of early berries he was very near the trees in the twilight when a gun roared from the ground david felt a blinding stab of pain through his head and knew nothing more when he awoke it was in a bed in a sunlit room there were a kindfaced elderly man and a girl in the room and another man who looked like a doctor david discovered that there was a band age around his head these people he saw were all looking at him with intense interest the elderly kindlooking man said youre david rand the fellow with wings well youre mighty lucky to be living he explained you see my gardener has been watching for a hawk that steals our chickens when you swooped down in the dusk last night he fired at you before he could recognize you some of the shot from his gun just grazed your head the girl asked gently are you feeling better now the doctor says youll soon be as good as ever she added this is my father wilson hall im ruth hall david stared up at her he thought he had never seen anyone so beautiful as this shy soft dark girl with her curling black hair and tender worried brown eyes he suddenly knew the reason for the puzzling persistence with which the birds sought each other out and clung together he that hath wings in pairs each mating season he felt the same thing in his own breast now the urge toward this girl he did not think of it as love but suddenly he loved her he told ruth hall slowly im all right now but she said you must stay here un til youre completely well its the least we can do when it was our servant who almost killed you david stayed as the wound healed he did not like the house whose rooms seemed so dark and stiflingly close to him but he found that he could stay outside during the day and could sleep on a porch at night neither did he like the newspaper men and cameramen who came to wilson halls house to get stories about the winged mans accident but these soon ceased coming for david rand was not now the sensation he had been years ago and while visitors to the hall home stared rather disconcertingly at him and at his wings he got used to that he put up with everything so that he might be near ruth hall his love for her was a clean fire burning inside him and nothing in the world now seemed so desirable as that she should love him too yet because he was still mostly of the wild and had had little experience in talking he found it hard to tell her what he felt he did tell her finally sitting beside her in the sunlit garden when he had finished ruths gentle brown eyes were troubled you want me to marry you david why yes he said a little puzzled thats what they call it when people mate isnt it and i want you for my mate she said distressed but david your wings he laughed why theres nothing the matter with my wings the accident didnt hurt them see and he leaped to his feet whipping open the great bronze wings that glit tred in the sunlight looking like a figure of fable poised for a leap into the blue his slim tanned body clad only in the shorts which were all the clothing he would wear the trouble did not leave ruths eyes she explained its not that davidits that your wings make you so different from everybody else of course its wonderful that you can fly but they make you so different from everyone else that people look on you as a kind of freak david stared you dont look on me as that ruth of course not ruth said but it does seem somehow a little abnormal monstrous your having wings monstrous he repeated why its nothing like that its justbeautiful being able to fly see and he sprang upward with great wings whirringup and up climbing into the blue sky dipping and darting and turning up there like a swallow then cometing down in a breathless swoop to land lightly on his toes beside the girl is there anything monstrous about that he demanded joyously why ruth i want you to fly with me held in my arms so that youll know the beauty of it as i know it the girl shuddered a little i couldnt david i know its silly but when i see you in the air like that you dont seem so much a man as a bird a flying animal something unhuman david rand stared at her suddenly miserable then you wont marry me because of my wings he grasped her in his strong tanned arms his lips seeking her soft mouth weird tales ruth i cant live without you now that ive met you i cant it was on a night a little later that ruth somewhat hesitantly made her suggestion the moon flooded the gar den with calm silver gleamed on david rands folded wings as he sat with keen young face bent eagerly toward the girl she said david there is a way in which we could marry and be happy if you love me enough to do it ill do anything he cried you know that she hesitated your wingstheyre what keep us apart i cant have a husband who be longs more to the wild creatures than to the human race a husband whom every one would consider a freak a deformed oddity but if you were to have your wings taken off he stared at her my wings taken off she explained in an eager little rush of words its quite practicable david doctor white who treated you for that wound and who examined you then has told me that it would be quite easy to amputate your wings above their bases there would be no danger at all in it and it would leave only the slight projection of the stumps on your back then youd be a normal man and not a freak she added her soft face earnest and appeal ing father would give you a position in his business and instead of an abnor mal roaming halfhuman creature you would be likelike everyone else we could be so happy then david rand was stunned amputate my wings he repeated almost uncom prehendingly you wont marry me un less i do that i cant said ruth painfully i love you david i dobut i want my husband to be like other womens husbands never to fly again said david slow ly his face white in the moonlight to become earthbound like everyone else no he cried springing to his feet in a wild revulsion i wont do iti wont give up my wings i wont become like he stopped abruptly ruth was sob bing into her hands all his anger gone he stooped beside her pulled down her hands yearningly tilted up her soft tear stained face dont cry ruth he begged it isnt that i dont love youi do more than anything else on earth but i had never thought of giving up my wings the idea stunned me he told her you go on into the house i must think it over a little she kissed him her mouth quivering and then was gone through the moonlight to the house and david rand remained his brain in turmoil pacing nervously in the silver light give up his wrings never again to dip and soar and swoop with the winged things of the sky never again to know the mad exaltation and tameless freedom of rushing flight yetto give up ruthto deny this blind irresistible yearning for her that beat in every atom of himto know bit ter loneliness and longing for her the rest of his lifehow could he do that he couldnt do it he wouldnt so david went rapidly toward the house and met the girl waiting for him on the moonlit terrace david yes ruth ill do it ill do anything for you she sobbed happily on his breast i knew you really loved me david i knew it w t he that hath wings two days later david rand came out of the mists of anesthesia in a hospital room feeling very strange his back an aching soreness doctor white and ruth were bending over his bed well it was a complete success young man said the doctor youll be out of here in a few days ruths eyes were shining the day you leave david well be married when they were gone david slowly felt his back only the bandaged pro jecting stumps of his wings remained he could move the great wingmuscles but no whirring pinions answered he felt dazed and strange as though some most vital part of him was gone but he clung to the thought of ruthof ruth waiting for him and she was waiting for him and they were married on the day he left the hos pital and in the sweetness of her love david lost all of that strange dazed feel ing and almost forgot that once he had possessed wings and had roamed the sky a wild winged thing wilson hall gave his daughter and soninlaw a pretty white cottage on a wooded hill near town and made a place for david in his business and was patient with his ignorance of commercial matters and every day david drove his car into town and worked all day in his office and drove back homeward in the dusk to sit with ruth before their fire her head on his shoulder david are you sorry that you did it ruth would ask anxiously at first and he would laugh and say of course not ruth having you is worth anything and he told himself that that was true that he did not regret the loss of his wings all that past time when he had flown the sky with whirring wings seemed only a strange dream and only now had he awakened to real happiness he assured himself wilson hall told his daughter da vids doing well down at the office i was afraid he would always be a little wild but hes settled down fine ruth nodded happily and said i knew that he would and everyone likes him so much now for people who once had looked askance at ruths marriage now remarked that it had turned out very well after all hes really quite nice and except for the slight humps on his shoulders youd never think that he had been differ ent from anyone else they said so the months slipped by in the little cottage on the wooded hill was complete happiness until there came the fall frost ing the lawn with silver each morning stamping crazy colors on the maples one fall night david woke suddenly wondering what had so abruptly awak ened him ruth was still sleeping softly with gentle breathing beside him he could hear no sound then he heard it a faraway ghostly whistling trailing down from the frosty sky a remote challenging shrilling that throbbed with a dim wild note of puls ing freedom he knew what it was instantly he swung open the window and peered up into the night with beating heart and up there he saw them long streaming files of hurtling wild birds winging southward beneath the stars in an in stant the wild impulse to spring from the window to rocket up after them into the clean cold night clamored blindly in davids heart instinctively the great wingmuscles at his back tensed but only the stumps of his wings moved beneath his pajama jacket w t weird tales and suddenly he was limp trembling aghast at that blind surge of feeling why for a moment he had wanted to go to leave ruth the thought appalled him was like a treachery against himself he crept back into bed and lay deter minedly shutting his ears to that distant joyous whistling that fled southward through the night the next day he plunged determined ly into his work at the office but all through that day he found his eyes straying to the windows blue patch of sky and week by week thereafter all through the long months of winter and spring the old wild yearning grew more and more an unreasonable ache inside his heart stronger than ever when the flying creatures came winging north in spring he told himself savagely youre a fool you love ruth more than anything else on earth and you have her you dont want anything else and again in the sleepless night he would assure himself im a man and im happy to live a normal mans life with ruth but in his brain old memories whis pered slyly do you remember that first time you flew that mad thrill of soaring upward for the first time the first giddy whirl and swoop and glide and the night wind outside the win dow called remember how you raced with me beneath the stars and above the sleeping world and how you laughed and sang as your wings fought me and david rand buried his face in his pillow and muttered im not sorry i did it im not ruth awoke and asked sleepily is anything the matter david no dear he told her but when she slept again he felt the hot tears stinging his eyelids and whispered blindly im lying to myself i want to fly again but from ruth happily occupied with his comfort and their home and their friends he concealed all that blind buried longing he fought to conquer it destroy it but could not when no one else was by he would watch with aching heart the swallows darting and diving in the sunset or the hawk soaring high and remote in the blue or the kingfishers thrilling swoop and then bitterly he would accuse himself of being a traitor to his own love for ruth then that spring ruth shyly told him something david next falla child of ours he was startled ruth dear then he asked youre not afraid that it might be she shook her head confidently no doctor white says there is no chance that it will be born abnormal as you were he says that the different genecharacters that caused you to be born with wings are bound to be a recessive character not a dominant and that there is no chance of that abnormality being inherited arent you glad of course he said holding her ten derly its going to be wonderful wilson hall beamed at the news a grandchildthats fine he exclaimed david do you know what im going to do after its birth im going to retire and leave you as head of the firm oh dad cried ruth and kissed her father joyfully david stammered his thanks and he told himself that this ended for good all his vague unreasonable longings he was going to have more than ruth to think about now was going to have the re sponsibilities of a family man he plunged into work with new zest he that hath wings for a few weeks he did entirely forget that old blind yearning in his planning for things to come he was all over that now he told himself then suddenly his whole being was overturned by an amazing thing for some time the wingstumps on davids shoulders had felt sore and painful also it seemed they were much larger than they had been he took occasion to ex amine them in a mirror and was astound ed to discover that they had grown out in two very large humplike projections that curved downward on each side along his back david rand stared and stared into the mirror a strange surmise in his eyes could it be possible that he called on doctor white the next day on another pretext but before he left he asked casually doctor i was wondering is there any chance that my wings would eyer start to grow out again doctor white said thoughtfully why i suppose there is a chance of it at that a newt can regenerate a lost limb you know and numerous animals have simi lar powers of regeneration of course an ordinary man cannot regenerate a lost arm or leg like that but your body is not an ordinary one and your wings might possess some power of partial regenera tion for one time at least he added you dont need to worry about it though david if they start to grow out again just come in and ill remove them again without any trouble david rand thanked him and left but day after day thereafter he closely watched and soon saw beyond doubt that the freak of genes that had given him wings in the first place had also given him at least a partial power of regener ating them for the wings were growing out again day by day the humps on his shoulders had become very much larger though covered by his specially tailored coats the change in them was not noticed they broke through late that summer in wings real wings though small as yet folded under his clothing they were not ap parent david knew that he should go in and let the doctor amputate them before they got larger he told himself that he did not any longer want wingsruth and the coming child and their future together were all that meant anything to him now yet still he did not say anything to anyone kept the growing wings con cealed and closed beneath his clothing they were poor weak wings compared to his first ones as though stunted by the previous amputation it was unlikely that he would ever be able to fly with them he thought even if he wanted to which he didnt he told himself though that it would be easier to have them removed after they had attained their full size besides he didnt want to disturb ruth at this time by telling her that the wings had grown again so he reassured himself and so the weeks passed until by early october his second wings had grown to their full size though they were stunted and pitiful compared to his first splendid pinions on the first week in october a little son was born to ruth and david a fine stronglimbed little boy without a trace of anything unusual about him he was normal of weight and his back was straight and smooth and he would never have wings and a few nights later they were all in the little cottage admiring him isnt he beautiful asked ruth look ing up with eyes shining with pride weird tales david nodded dumbly his heart throb bing with emotion as he looked down at the red sleeping mite his son hes wonderful he said humbly ruth deari want to work the rest of my life for you and for him wilson hall beamed on them and chuckled youre going to have a chance to do that david what i said last spring goes this afternoon i formally resigned as head of the firm and saw that you were named as my successor david tried to thank him his heart was full with complete happiness with love for ruth and for their child he felt that no one before had ever been so happy then after wilson hall had left and ruth was sleeping and he was alone david suddenly realized that there was something he must do he told himself sternly all these months youve been lying to yourself making excuses for yourself letting your wings grow again in your heart all that time you were hoping that you would be able to fly again he laughed well thats all over now i only told myself before that i didnt want to fly it wasnt true then but it is now ill never again long for wings for flying now that i have both ruth and the boy no never againthat was ended he would drive into town this very night and have doctor white remove these newgrown second wings he would never even let ruth know about them flushed with that resolve he hurried out of the cottage into the windy dark ness of the fall night the red moon was lifting above the treetops eastward and by its dull light he started back toward the garage all around him the trees were bending and creaking under the brawling jovial hammering of the hard north wind david stopped suddenly down through the frosty night had come a faint far sound that jerked his head erect a distant phantom whistling borne on the rushing wind rising falling growing stronger and strongerthe wild birds southing through the noisy night shrill ing their exultant challenge as the wind bore their wings onward that wild throb of freedom that he had thought dead clutched hard of a sudden at davids heart he stared up into the darkness with brilliant eyes hair blowing in the wind to be up tliere with them just once again to fly with them just one more time why not why not fly this one last time and so satisfy that aching longing before he lost these last wings he would not go far would make but a short flight and then return to have the wings re moved to devote his life to ruth and their son no one would ever know swiftly he stripped off his clothing in the darkness stood erect spreading the wings that had been so long concealed and confined quaking doubt assailed him could he fly at all now would these poor stunted second wings even bear him aloft for a few minutes no they wouldnthe knew they wouldnt the wild wind roared louder through the groaning trees the silvery shrilling high overhead came louder david stood poised knees bent wings spread for the leap upward agony on his white face he couldnt try ithe knew that he couldnt leave the ground but the wind was shouting in his ears you can do it you can fly again see i am behind you waiting to lift you ready to race you up there under the stars he that hath wings and the exultant whistling voices high above were shrilling upwardup with us you belong among us not down there upwardfly he sprang the stunted wings smote the air wild and he was soaring the dark trees the lighted window of the cottage the whole hilltop dropped be hind and below him as his wings bore him upward on the bellowing wind up upclean hard battering of the cold air on his face once more the crazy roaring of the wind around him the great thrash of his wings bearing him higher and higher david rands high ringing laughter pealed out on the screaming wind as he flew on between the stars and the nighted earth higher and higher right up among the shrilling southing birds that companioned him on either side on and on he flew with them he knew suddenly that this alone was living this alone was waking all that other life that had been his down there that had been the dream and he had awakened from it now it was not he who worked in an office and had loved a woman and a child down there it was a dream david rand who had done that and the dream was over now southward southward he rushed through the night and the wind screamed and the moon rose higher un til at last the land passed from beneath and he flew with the flying birds over moonlit plains of ocean he knew that it was madness to fly on with these poor wings that already were tiring and weak ening but he had no thought in his ex ultant brain of turning back to fly on to fly this one last time that was enough so that when his tired wings began at last to fail and he began to sink lower and lower toward the silvered waters there was no fear and no regret in his breast it was what he had always ex pected and wanted at the end and he was drowsily gladglad to be falling as all they with wings must finally fall after a brief lifetime of wild sweet flight dropping contentedly to rest microcosms by edgar daniel kramer in this strange thing we call today are all the ages that have gone since beauty with her mystic sway bid qiaos flee before the dawn in this strange thing we hold so dear this flesh that crumbles into dust are souls of idiot and seer the dead years godliness and lust mother of toads by clark ashton smith weird and powerful was the effect on the young apprentice of the potion given him by mère antoinette known by the villagers as the mother of toads why must you always hurry away my little one the voice of mère antoi nette the witch was an amorous croak ing she ogled pierre the apothecarys young apprentice with eyes fullorbed and unblinking as those of a toad the folds beneath her chin swelled like the throat of some great batrachian her short flat fingers outspread on her soiled apron revealed an appearance as of nar row webs between their first flanges pierre baudin as usual gave no answer but turned his eyes from mère antoi nette with an air of impatience her voice raucously coaxing persisted stay awhile tonight my pretty or phan no one will miss you in the vil lage and your master will not mind pierre tossed his head with the disdain of a young adonis the witch was more than twice his age and her charms were too uncouth and unsavory to tempt him for an instant she was repellently fat and lumpish and her skin possessed an unwholesome pallor also her repute was such as to have nullified the attrac tions of a younger and fairer sorceress her witchcraft had made her feared among the peasantry of that remote prov ince where belief in spells and philtres was still common the people of averoigne called her la mère des cra pauds mother of toads a name given for more than one reason toads swarmed innumerably about her hut they were said to be her familiars and dark tales were told concerning their relationship to the sorceress and the duties they per formed at her bidding such tales were all the more readily believed because of those batrachian features that had always been remarked in her aspect the youth disliked her even as he dis liked the sluggish abnormally large toads on which he had sometimes trodden in the dusk upon the path between her hut and the village of les hiboux he could hear some of these creatures croaking now and it seemed weirdly that they uttered halfarticulate echoes of the witchs words it would be dark soon he reflected the path along the marshes was not pleasant by night and he felt doubly anxious to depart still without replying to mère antoinettes invitation he reached for the black triangular vial she had set before him on her greasy table the vial contained a philtre of curious potency which his master alain le din don had sent him to procure le din don the village apothecary was wont to deal surreptitiously in certain dubious medicaments supplied by the witch and pierre had often gone on such errands to her osierhidden hut the old apothecary whose humor was rough and ribald had sometimes rallied pierre concerning mère antoinettes pref mother of toads erence for him remembering certain admonitory gibes more witty than decent the boy flushed angrily as he turned to go stay insisted mère antoinette the fog is cold on the marshes and it thick ens apace i knew that you were coming and i have mulled for you a goodly meas ure of the red wine of ximes she removed the lid from an earthen pitcher and poured its steaming contents into a large cup the purplishred wine creamed delectably and an odor of hot delicious spices filled the hut overpower ing the less agreeable odors from the simmering cauldron the halfdried newts vipers batwings and evil nauseous herbs hanging on the walls and the reek of the black candles of pitch and corpsetallow that burned always by noon or night in that murky interior ill drink it said pierre a little grudgingly that is if it contains noth ing of your own concoction tis naught but sound wine four seasons old with spices of arabia the sorceress croaked ingratiatingly twill warm your stomach and she added something inaudible as pierre ac cepted the cup before drinking he inhaled the fumes of the beverage with some caution but was reassured by its pleasant smell sure ly it was innocent of any drug any philtre brewed by the witch for to his knowl edge her preparations were all evil smelling still as if warned by some premoni tion he hesitated then he remembered that the sunset air was indeed chill that mists had gathered furtively behind him as he came to mère antoinettes dwell ing the wine would fortify him for the dismal return walk to les hiboux he quaffed it quickly and set down the cup truly it is good wine he declared but i must go now even as he spoke he felt in his stomach and veins the spreading warmth of the alcohol of the spices of something more ardent than these it seemed that his voice was unreal and strange falling as if from a height above him the warmth grew mounting within him like a golden flame fed by magic oils his blood a seething torrent poured tumul tuously and more tumultuously through his members there was a deep soft thundering in his ears a rosy dazzlement in his eyes somehow the hut appeared to expand to change luminously about him he hardly recognized its squalid furnishings its lit ter of baleful oddments on which a tor rid splendor was shed by the black can dles tipped with ruddy fire that towered and swelled gigantically into the soft gloom his blood burned as with the throbbing flame of the candles it came to him for an instant that all this was a questionable enchantment a glamor wrought by the witchs wine fear was upon him and he wished to flee then close beside him he saw mère antoinette briefly he wondered why he had thought her old and gross and repulsive for it seemed that he looked upon lilith the first witch the lumpish limbs and body had grown voluptuous the pale thicklipped mouth enticed him with a promise of ampler kisses than other mouths could yield he knew why the magic warmth mounted ever higher and hotter within him do you like me now my little one she questioned pierre awoke in the ashy dawn when the tall black tapers had dwindled down and had melted limply in their sockets sick and confused he sought vainly to remember where he was or weird tales what he had done then turning a lit tle he saw beside him on the couch a thing that was like some impossible mon ster of ill dreams a toadlike form large as a fat woman its limbs were somehow like a womans arms and legs its pale warty body pressed and bulged against him and he felt the rounded softness of something that resembled a breast nausea rose within him as memory of that delirious night returned most foully he had been beguiled by the witch and had succumbed to her evil enchantments it seemed that an incubus smothered him weighing upon all his limbs and body he shut his eyes that he might no longer behold the loathsome thing that was mère antoinette in her true sem blance slowly with prodigious effort he drew himself away from the crushing nightmare shape it did not stir or ap pear to waken and he slid quickly from the couch again compelled by a noisome fas cination he peered at the thing on the couchand saw only the gross form of mère antoinette perhaps his impression of a great toad beside him had been but an illusion a halfdream that lingered after slumber he lost something of his nightmarish horror but his gorge still rose in a sick disgust remembering the lewdness to which he had yielded fearing that the witch might awaken at any moment and seek to detain him he stole noiselessly from the hut it was broad daylight but a cold hueless mist lay everywhere shrouding the reedy marshes and hanging like a ghostly cur tain on the path he must follow to les hiboux moving and seething always the mist seemed to reach toward him with intercepting fingers as he started home ward he shivered at its touch he bowed his head and drew his cloak closer around him thicker and thicker the mist swirled coiling writhing endlessly as if to bar pierres progress he could discern the twisting narrow path for only a few paces in advance it was hard to find the familiar landmarks hard to recognize the osiers and willows that loomed suddenly before him like gray phantoms and faded again into the white nothingness as he went onward never had he seen such fog it was like the blinding stifling fumes of a thousand witchstirred caul drons though he was not altogether sure of his surroundings pierre thought that he had covered half the distance to the vil lage then all at once he began to meet the toads they were hidden by the mist till he came close upon them misshapen unnaturally big and bloated they squat ted in his way on the little footpath or hopped sluggishly before him from the pallid gloom on either hand several struck against his feet with a horrible and heavy flopping he stepped unaware upon one of them and slipped in the squashy noisomeness it had made barely saving himself from a headlong fall on the bogs rim black miry water gloomed close beside him as he staggered there turning to regain his path he crushed others of the toads to an abhorrent pulp under his feet the marshy soil was alive with them they flopped against him from the mist striking his legs his bosom his very face with their clammy bodies they rose up by scores like a devildriven legion it seemed that there was a malignance an evil purpose in their movements in the buffeting of their vio lent impact he could make no progress on the swarming path but lurched to and fro slipping blindly and shielding his face with lifted hands he felt an eery consternation an eldritch horror it mother of toads was as if the nightmare of his awaken ing in the witchs hut had somehow re turned upon him the toads came always from the direc tion of les hiboux as if to drive him back toward mère antoinettes dwelling they bounded against him like a mon strous hail like missiles flung by unseen demons the ground was covered by them the air was filled with their hurt ling bodies once he nearly went down beneath them their number seemed to increase they pelted him in a noxious storm he gave way before them his courage broke and he started to run at random without knowing that he had left the safe path losing all thought of direction in his frantic desire to escape from those im possible myriads he plunged on amid the dim reeds and sedges over ground that quivered gelatinously beneath him always at his heels he heard the soft heavy flopping of the toads and some times they rose up like a sudden wall to bar his way and turn him aside more than once they drove him back from the verge of hidden quagmires into which he would otherwise have fallen it was as if they were herding him deliberately and concertedly to a destined goal now like the lifting of a dense cur tain the mist rolled away and pierre saw before him in a golden dazzle of morning sunshine the green thick growing osiers that surrounded mère antoinettes hut the toads had all dis appeared though he could have sworn that hundreds of them were hopping close about him an instant previously with a feeling of helpless fright and panic he knew that he was still within the witchs toils that the toads were in deed her familiars as so many people believed them to be they had prevented his escape and had brought him back to the foul creature whether woman batrachian or both who was known as the mother of toads pierres sensations were those of one who sinks momently deeper into some black and bottomless quicksand he saw the witch emerge from the hut and come toward him her thick fingers with pale folds of skin between them like the be ginnings of a web were stretched and flattened on the steaming cup that she carried a sudden gust of wind arose as if from nowhere and bore to pierres nostrils the hot familiar spices of the drugged wine why did you leave so hastily my little one there was an amorous wheedling in the very tone of the witchs question i should not have let you go without another cup of the good red wine mulled and spiced for the warming of your stomach see i have pre pared it for you knowing that you would return she came very close to him as she spoke leering and sidling and held the cup toward his lips pierre grew dizzy with the strange fumes and turned his head away it seemed that a paralyzing spell had seized his muscles for the sim ple movement required an immense ef fort his mind however was still clear and the sick revulsion of that nightmare dawn returned upon him he saw again the great toad that had lain at his side when he awakened i will not drink your wine he said firmly you are a foul witch and i loathe you let me go why do you loathe me croaked mère antoinette i can give you all that other women give and more you are not a woman said pierre you are a big toad i saw you in your weird tales true shape this morning id rather drown in the marshwaters than stay with you again an indescribable change came upon the sorceress before pierre had finished speaking the leer slid from her thick and pallid features leaving them blankly inhuman for an instant then her eyes bulged and goggled horribly and her whole body appeared to swell as if in flated with venom go then she spat with a guttural virulence but you will soon wish that you had stayed the queer paralysis had lifted from pierres muscles it was as if the injunc tion of the angry witch had served to revoke an insidious halfwoven spell with no parting glance or word pierre turned from her and fled with long hasty steps almost running on the path to les hiboux he had gone little more than a hun dred paces when the fog began to return it coiled shoreward in vast vol umes from the marshes it poured like smoke from the very ground at his feet almost instantly the sun dimmed to a wan silver disk and disappeared the blue heavens were lost in the pale and seething voidness overhead the path before pierre was blotted out till he seemed to walk on the sheer rim of a white abyss that moved with him as he went like the clammy arms of specters with deathchill fingers that clutched and ca ressed the weird mists drew closer still about pierre they thickened in his nos trils and throat they dripped in a heavy dew from his garments they choked him with the fetor of rank waters and putrescent ooze and a stench as of liquefying corpses that had risen some where to the surface amid the fen then from the blank whiteness the toads assailed pierre in a surging solid wave that towered above his head and swept him from the dim path with the force of falling seas as it descended he went down splashing and floundering into water that swarmed with the num berless batrachians foul slime was in his mouth and nose as he struggled to regain his footing the water however was only kneedeep and the bottom though slippery and oozy supported him with little yielding when he stood erect he discerned indistinctly through the mist the nearby margin from which he had fallen but his steps were weirdly and horribly hampered by the toadseeth ing waters when he strove to reach it inch by inch with a hopeless panic deep ening upon him he fought toward the solid shore the toads leaped and tum bled about him with a dizzying eddylike motion they swirled like a viscid under tow around his feet and shins they swept and swirled in great loathsome un dulations against his retarded knees however he made slow and painful progress till his outstretched fingers could almost grasp the wiry sedges that trailed from the low bank then from that mistbound shore there fell and broke upon him a second deluge of these demoniac toads and pierre was borne helplessly backward into the filthy waters held down by the piling and crawling masses and drowning in nauseous dark ness at the thickoozed bottom he clawed feebly at his assailants for a moment ere oblivion came his fingers found among them the outlines of a monstrous form that was somehow toadlike but large and heavy as a fat woman escape by paul ernst a brief weird tale about the escape of a madman he had the craziest form of crazi ness ive ever seen of course i hasten to add i hadnt seen much id been through an asylum once before as now to get a story for my paper on treatment and conditions of state inmates and that was all on that former trip id witnessed nothing like this nor had i till now on this trip the man didnt look crazy so often they dont he was a mediumsized chap with gray in his hair and a look of sad ness on his thin mild face a look of sadnessand determination neatly dressed precise of movement he was very busy in his cell he paid no atten tion for a while as the guard and i stood at the barred door and watched him he was building something he would pick up a tool adjust it carefully work with all the delicacy of a watchmaker for a moment then he would lay the tool down and pick up a gage and check his work all very accurate and careful the only thing was that you couldnt see what he was building and you couldnt see any tools nor gages nor workbench there was nothing in the cell but the man and a bolteddown cot and chair nevertheless the fellow was extraor dinarily industrious he would seize a nonexistent tool examine it with a frown and then use it on thin air after which would come the inevitable measur ing movements it certainly looks i said in a low tone to the attendant as though there should be something there the attendant grinned and nodded and i continued to watch fascinated you could follow the man through his whole box of tools from his rational movements now he was boring a hole obviously a very small hole with a tiny metaldrill equipped with an eggbeater handle now he was just touching a surface with a file now he was sawing something else after which he took the sawed part from an imaginary work bench and tried it in its placewhatever and wherever that was i got still another glimpse of unity of effort as i watched him each little period of accurate workmanship ended with a trip four steps to his left to a corner of his cell which was bright with sunlight there his motions said was the thing he was working on there was the object slowly growing bit by accurate bit which he was making and assembling it was uncanny there simply ought to have been something therea cabinet chair whatnotand there wasnt the man slowly screwed an imaginary part to an imaginary whole then laid down his imaginary screwdriver and walked to the door for the first time acknowledging our presence there hello nick he said to the attend ant his voice was as mild and as sad and as oddly determined as the rest of him hello said the attendant aifably his goodnatured broad face turned from the man in the cell toward me meet mr freer mr gannet mr freers with a newspaper weird tales oh said gannet politely he put out his hand so that i could shake it if i reached through the bars of his door a little i hesitated then grasped it he didnt look dangerous howre you doing with your whatis it gannet the attendant said nodding solemnly toward the bright corner where lay the object of the mans attentions pretty well said gannet this damned floor isnt quite level its three thirtyseconds of an inch to the foot off i have to allow for that in every line and angle and it makes it needlessly diffi cult what is it youre building asked nick wheedlingly you wont tell any of us but wont you tell mr freer for his newspaper story there it is shrugged gannet point ing to the corner see for yourself i stared involuntarily at the corner then feeling like a fool back at his mild sad face was there a ghost of a twinkle in his gray eyes or was it my imagina tion i couldnt tell i was beginning to feel a little crazy myself we walked away the big library and loungingroom where the al mostcured could sit and read was left for me to see but i looked around without much interest as we passed through i kept thinking of gannet has he been going through that set of motions very long i asked the at tendant he started right after he got here said nick that was a year ago he came here raving trying to fight free and get back to the house where hed lived with his son and daughterinlaw there was something in his room he had to get he said then he calmed down and next day began going through the routine you saw some days he works only a few hours sometimes all day long and up until lightsout at night the way he puttered around that cor ner made me think i was off myself for not seeing something there i said it was amazingly realistic as though you could surely feel what he was working on even if you couldnt see it has any body ever felt around that comer where he spends his time hey boy said nick easy now pretty soon well be sending a wagon for you but has anybody i persisted smiling no thats the one thing that brings out gannets kink if anyone gets too close to that corner he gets quite violent so we dont even clean there were try ing to cure these folks not upset em needlessly we went out the massive door of the main building where a stalwart attendant eyed us sharply there were nicely kept grounds and then a high fence with inwardslanting barbs on its top you dont want anybody to escape from here do you i said nodding to ward the heavy door and the high fence nick grinned nope and nobody ever has or ever will i reckon see you in church but he saw me sooner than that i kept thinking of the spare mild mannered man with the sad determined eyes all evening after id handed my story in to the paper i kept thinking about him next morning and next after noon saw me at the asylum again stand ing in front of gannets barred door he was as busy as he had been yester day but his activity seemed more mental than physical today he would stand in the center of his cell hand rubbing jaw while he stared at the sunny corner then he would walk to the corner and touch a spot in midair with an inquisitive fore escape finger then he would step back and survey the atmosphere again eyes run ning slowly up and down as though over the lines of a quite tangible thing finally he took something out of his pocket and walked with a more decisive air to the corner i saw his hands move close together for all the world as though he were adjusting a micrometer or other delicate measuringdevice he applied his hands to the questionable point in nothingness as he had done yesterday he paid no attention to observers at his door at first but finally he spoke without looking up from his task hello freer hello i said gannet had an unim paired memory at any rate come for another story in a way i evaded he shook his head meanwhile step ping a foot to the right and staring criti cally at nothing i dont see how you stand it stand what your work the madness and despair of humanitythats your stock in trade you deal in war and famine and flood in social injustice and political and civil brutalities theyre the intimate facts of your life i dont see how you can live among such things i cant even read about them i stared at him id never met a man who seemed less crazy whether you face the facts intimately or detachedly i said they are still facts and theyre still there you cant avoid them but you can at least i can and im going to im getting out of all this he squatted on his haunches and be gan running his hands slowly over space up and down then horizontally he straightened and repeated the process ill swear i could make out what he had in his mind it was a sort of chair with a very high back and unusually high arms just as i had decided thishe sat in it youve seen stage tricksters sit in chairs with arms folded when there are no chairs there to sit in well this was the same i gaped at gannet sitting in thin air not an impossible stunt but always an arresting one he got up and came to the door i cant take life as its lived today gannet a weakness no doubt but there you are so youre getting out of it i nodded so im getting out of it its not for nothing that i am a mathematician and an inventor what a shame i almost said it aloud but didnt id conceived a positive fancy for the sadfaced mr gannet he stared at me quizzically you neednt hunt up nick he said im not hinting at suicide its a more literal escape i mean escape with these barred doors the high wall outside oh walls bars he waved his hand dismissing them he walked back to his sunny corner and resumed his critical ocular and man ual examinations ofnothing you may have another story tomor row freer he said mildly and then he turned his back thereby dismissing me as he had the walls and bolts of his confine ment i hunted up nick on the way out i felt like a traitor but i knew it was for my new friends own good gannets talking of an escape i said nicks customary grin appeared on his broad face forget it hes handed out that line before nobody could get out of here he walked to the high gate in the weird tales fence with me and waved as i got into my car i wasnt coming back any more i didnt want to see gannet again he was such a nice little guy but next noon saw me knocking for admittance a third time summoned by a call from nick got an exclusive for you if you want it he said an escape i dont know that its very important to you but weve never had one before that might make it worth a couple of inches escape i said yeah your man gannet so he did it but how nick grunted suppose you tell me in the night i asked he shook his head a little while ago in broad daylight he was seen in his cell at ten an hour later the room was empty he was gone but he couldnt have simply walked out of the place in broad daylight no said nick he couldnt was his door unlocked it was not it was locked from the outside when we came to investigate the report that he was gone his window bars are all right too youve searched the grounds of course he isnt in them he isnt in any of the buildings nobody saw him after eleven oclock hes just gone with his cell still locked so even a monkey couldnt slip out you must have some idea how he got away no idea because it cant be done only it was how am i going to get a story out of that i asked how in thunder would i know thats your worry i put a cigarette between my lips unlit because smoking wasnt permitted here what in the world do you suppose he thought he was building i mused nick snorted i dont suppose any thing about it if i did id be as crazy as he was well theres your exclusive if you know what to do with it i didnt know what to do with it so i finally handed it in as it stands now this very story in fact and the little man with the big vizor at the editors desk promptly handed it back not that i blame him nobody ever saw gannet again no body ever thought of him again i guess except me i had a rush of curiosity to the head a few days later and went to his cell armed with a level and a steel rule the floor of the barred cubicle gannet once occupied is three thirtyseconds of an inch off level now how do you suppose he could have determined that without tools of any kind to aid the naked eye return to the sabbath by robert bloch a shuddery weird tale of hollywood and the film industrya story of the gruesome thing that emerged from the burial crypt its not the kind of story that the columnists like to print its not the yarn pressagents love to tell when i was still in the public relations depart ment at the studio they wouldnt let me break it i knew better than to try for no paper would print such a tale we publicity men must present holly wood as a gay place a world of glamor and stardust we capture only the light but underneath the light there must al ways be shadows ive always known that its been my job to gloss over those shadows for yearsbut the events of which i speak form a disturbing pattern too strange to be withheld the shadow of these incidents is not human its been the cursed weight of the whole affair that has proved my own mental undoing thats why i resigned from the studio post i guess i wanted to forget if i could and now i know that the only way to relieve my mind is to tell the story i must break the yarn come what may then perhaps i can for get karl jorlas eyes the affair dates back to one september evening almost three years ago les kin caid and i were slumming down on main street in los angeles that night les is an assistant producer up at the studio and there was some purpose in his visit he was looking for authentic types to fill minor roles in a gangster film he was doing les was peculiar that way he preferred the real article rather than the casting bureaus readymade imitations wed been wandering around for some time as i recall past the great stone chows that guard the narrow alleys of chinatown over through the touristtrap that is olvera street and back along the flophouses of lower main we walked by the cheap burlesque houses eyeing the insolent filipinos that sauntered past and jostling our way through the usual satur day night slumming parties we were both rather weary of it all thats why i suppose the dingy little theatre appealed to us lets go in and sit down for a while les suggested im tired even a main street burlesque show has seats in it and i felt ready for a nap the callipygy of the stageattraction did not appeal to me but i acceded to the suggestion and purchased our tickets we entered sat down suffered through two striptease dances an incredibly an cient blackout sketch and a grand fi nale then as is the custom in such places the stage darkened and the screen flickered into life we got ready for our doze then the pictures shown in these houses are usually ancient specimens of the quickie va riety fillers provided to clear the house as the first blaring notes of the sound track heralded the title of the opus i closed my eyes slouched lower in my seat and mentally beckoned to morpheus i was jerked back to reality by a sharp dig in the ribs les was nudging me and whispering look at this he murmured prod weird tales ding my reluctant body into wakefulness ever see anything like it i glanced up at the screen what i expected to find i do not know but i sawhorror there was a country graveyard shad owed by ancient trees through which flick ered rays of mildewed moonlight it was an old graveyard with rotting headstones set in grotesque angles as they leered up at the midnight sky the camera cut down on one grave a fresh one the music on the sound track grew louder in cursed climax but i forgot camera and film as i watched that grave was realityhideous reality the grave was moving the earth beside the headstone was heaving and churning as though it were being dug out not from above but from below it quaked upward ever so slowly terribly little clods fell the sod pulsed out in a steady stream and little rills of earth kept falling in the moonlight as though there were some thing clawing the dirt away some thing clawing from beneath that somethingit would soon ap pear and i began to be afraid ii didnt want to see what it was the clawing from below was not natural it held a purpose not altogether human yet i had to look i had to see him itemerge the sod cascaded in a mound and then i was staring at the edge of the grave looking down at the black hole that gaped like a corpsemouth in the moonlight something was com ing out something slithered through that fis sure fumbled at the side of the opening it clutched the ground above the grave and in the baleful beams of that demons moon i knew it to be a human hand a thin white human hand that held but half its flesh the hand of a lich a skeleton claw a second talon gripped the other side of the excavation top and now slowly insidiously arms emerged naked flesh less arms they crawled across the earthsides like leprous white serpents the arms of a cadaver a rising cadaver it was pulling itself up and as it emerged a cloud fell across the moonpath the light faded to shadows as the bulky head and shoul ders came into view one could see noth ing and one was thankful but the cloud was falling away from the moon now in a second the face would be revealed the face of the thing from the grave the resurrected visage of that which should be rotted in death what would it be the shadows fell back a figure rose out of the grave and the face turned to ward me i looked and saw well youve been to horror pictures you know what one usually sees the apeman or the maniac or the deathshead the papiermaché gro tesquerie of the makeup artist the skull of the dead i saw none of that instead diere was horror it was the face of a child i thought at first no not a child but a man with a childs soul the face of a poet perhaps unwrinkled and calm long hair framed a high forehead cres cent eyebrows tilted over closed lids the nose and mouth were thin and finely chis eled over the entire countenance was written an unearthly peace it was as though the man were in a sleep of som nambulism or catalepsy and then the face grew larger the moonlight brighter and i sawmore the sharper light disclosed tiny touches of evil the thin lips were fretted mag gotkissed the nose had crumbled at the nostrils the forehead was flaked with putrefaction and the dark hair was dead encrusted with slime there were shad w t return to the sabbath ows in the bony ridges beneath the closed eyes even now the skeletal arms were up and bony fingers brushed at those dead pits as the rotted lids fluttered apart the eyes opened they were wide staring flaming and in them was the grave they were eyes that had closed in death and opened in the coffin under earth they were eyes that had seen the body rot and the soul depart to mingle in wormravened dark ness below they were eyes that held an alien life a life so dreadful as to animate the cadavers body and force it to claw its way back to outer earth they were hungry eyestriumphant now as they gazed in graveyard moonlight on a world they had never known before they hun gered for the world as only death can hunger for life and they blazed out of the corpsepallid face in icy joy then the cadaver began to walk it lurched between the graves lumbered be fore ancient tombs it shambled through die forest night until it reached a road then it turned up that road slowly slowly and the hunger in those eyes flamed again as the lights of a city flared below death was preparing to mingle with men i sat through all this entranced only a few minutes had elapsed but i felt as though uncounted ages had passed un heeded the film went on les and i didnt exchange a word but we watched the plot was rather routine after that the dead man was a scientist whose wife had been stolen from him by a young doc tor the doctor had tended him in his last illness and unwittingly administered a powerful narcotic with cataleptic effects the dialog was foreign and i could not place it all of the actors were un familiar to me and the setting and pho tography was quite unusual unorthodox treatment as in the cabinet of dr cali gari and other psychological films there was one scene where the living dead man became enthroned as archpriest at a black mass ceremonial and there was a little child his eyes as he plunged the knife he keptdecaying throughout the film the black mass worshippers knew him as an emissary of satan and they kidnapped the wife as sacrifice for his own resurrection the scene with the hysterical woman when she saw and recognized her husband for the first time and the deep evil whispering voice in which he revealed his secret to her the final pursuit of the devilworshippers to the great altarstone in the mountains the death of the resurrected one almost a skeleton in fact now riddled by bullets and shot from the weapons of the doctor and his neighbors the dead one crumbled and fell from his seat on the altarstone and as those eyes glazed in second death the deep voice boomed out in a prayer to sathanas the lich crawled across the ground to the ritual fire drew painfully erect and tottered into the flames and as it stood weaving for a moment in the blaze the lips moved again in infernal prayer and the eyes implored not the skies but the earth the ground opened in a final flash of fire and the charred corpse fell through the master claimed his own it was grotesque almost a fairytale in its triteness when the film had flick ered off and the orchestra blared the opening for the next fleshshow we rose in our seats conscious once more of our surroundings the rest of the mon grel audience seemed to be in a stupor almost equal to our own wideeyed japanese sat staring in the darkness fili pinos muttered covertly to one another even the drunken laborers seemed incap w t weird tales able of greeting the grand opening with their usual ribald hoots trite and grotesque the plot of the film may have been but the actor who played the lead had instilled it with ghastly reality he had been dead his eyes knew and the voice was the voice of lazarus awakened les and i had no need to exchange words we both felt it i followed him silently as he went up the stairs to the managers office edward relch was glowering over the desk he showed no pleasure at seeing us barge in when les asked him where he had procured the film for this eve ning and what its name was he opened his mouth and emitted a cascade of curses we learned that return io the sabbath had been sent over by a cheap agency from out inglewood way that a western had been expected and the damned foreign junk substituted by mistake a hell of a picture this was for a girlshow gave the audience the lousy creeps and it wasnt even in english stinking im ported films it was some time before we managed to extract the name of the agency from the managers profane lips but five min utes after that les kincaid was on the phone speaking to the head of the agency an hour later we were out at the office the next morning kincaid went in to see the big boss and the following day i was told to announce for publication that karl jorla the austrian horrorstar had been signed by cable to our studio and he was leaving at once for the united states it was a stroke of genius on kincaids part we all felt that way about the matter horror pictures were on the way in karloff and lugosi were turning out their early numbers over at universal and grossing big lionel atwill was do ing his usual villainy on several lots and profitably so peter lorre the peer of them all had just been signed for ameri can films after his sensational perform ances as the psychopathic murderer in m and his gruesome spyportrayal in the man who knew too much and we knew that karl jorla topped them all if the fans were really sincere in their liking for the macabre they were going to get the genuine article not since lon chaney had i seen such con summate artistry certainly this man was chaneys superior in that he had a sin cerity which outdistanced the horror of mere makeup tricks i printed these items gave all the buildup i could but after the initial announcements i was stopped dead ev erything had happened too swiftly we knew nothing about this man jorla re ally subsequent cables to austrian and german studios failed to disclose any in formation about the fellows private life he had evidently never played in any film prior to return to the sabbath he was utterly unknown the film had never been shown greatly abroad and it was only by mistake that the inglewood agen cy has obtained a copy and run it here in the united states audience reaction could not be learned and the film was not scheduled for general release unless english titles could be dubbed in i was up a stump here we had the find of the year and i couldnt get enough material out to make it known we expected karl jorla to arrive in two weeks however i was told to get to work on him as soon as he got in then flood the news agencies with stories three of our best writers were working on a special production for him already the big boss meant to handle it himself it would be similar to the foreign film return to the sabbath for that return from the dead sequence must be included jorla arrived on october seventh he put up at a hotel the studio sent down its usual welcoming committee took him out to the lot for formal testing then turned him over to me i met the man for the first time in the little dressingroom they had assigned him ill never forget that afternoon of our first meeting or my first sight of him as i entered the door what i expected to see i dont know but what i did see amazed me for karl jorla was the deadalive man of the screen in life the features were not fretted of course but he was tall and almost as cadaverously thin as in his role his face was pallid and his eyes bluecircled and the eyes were the dead eyes of the movie the deep knowing eyes the booming voice greeted me in hesi tant english jorla smiled with his lips at my obvious discomfiture but the ex pression of the eyes never varied in their alien strangeness somewhat hesitantly i explained my office and my errand no publeecity jorla intoned i do not weesh to make known what is affairs of mine own do eeng i gave him the usual arguments how much he understood i cannot say but he was adamant i learned only a little that he had been born in prague lived in wealth until the upheavals of the euro pean depression and entered film work only to please a director friend of his this director had made the picture in which jorla played for private showings only by mischance a print had been re leased and copied for general circulation it had all been a mistake however the american film offer had come oppor tunely since jorla wanted to leave austria at once after the feelm appear i am in bad lights weeth myfriends he explained slowly they do not weesh it to be shown that ceremonee the black mass i asked your friends yes the worship of lucifer it was real you know was he joking noi couldnt doubt the mans sincerity there was no room for mirth in those alien eyes and then i knew what he meant what he so casu ally revealed he had been a devilwor shipper himselfhe and that director they had made the film and meant it for private display in their own occult cir cles no wonder he sought escape abroad it was incredible save that i knew europe and the dark northern mind the worship of evil continues today in budapest prague berlin and he karl jorla the horroractor admitted to being one of them what a story i thought and then i realized that it could of course never be printed a horrorstar admitting be lief in the parts he played absurd all the features about boris karloff played up the fact that he was a gentle man who found true peace in raising a garden lugosi was pictured as a sensi tive neurotic tortured by the rôles he played in the films atwill was a social ite and a stage star and peter lorre was always written up as being gentle as a lamb a quiet student whose ambition was to play comedy parts no it would never do to break the story of jorlas devilworship and he was so damnably reticent about his pri vate affairs i sought out kincaid after the termi nation of our unsatisfactory interview i weird tales told him what i had encountered and asked for advice he gave it the old lon chaney line he coun seled mystery man we say nothing about him until the picture is released after that i have a hunch things will work out for themselves the fellow is a marvel so dont bother about stories until the film is canned consequently i abandoned publicity efforts in karl jorlas direction now i am very glad i did so for there is no one to remember his name or suspect the horror that was soon to follow the script was finished the front office approved stage four was un der construction the casting director got busy jorla was at the studio every day kincaid himself was teaching him eng lish the part was one in which very few words were needed and jorla proved a brilliant pupil according to les but les was not as pleased as he should have been about it all he came to me one day about a week before production and unburdened himself he strove to speak lightly about the affair but i could tell that he felt worried the gist of his story was very simple jorla was behaving strangely he had had trouble with the front office he re fused to give the studio his living ad dress and it was known that he had checked out from his hotel several days after first arriving in hollywood nor was that all he wouldnt talk about his part or volunteer any informa tion about interpretation he seemed to be quite uninterestedadmitting frankly to kincaid that his only reason for sign ing a contract was to leave europe he told kincaid what he had told me about the devilworshippers and he hinted at more he spoke of being fol lowed muttered about avengers and hunters who waited he seemed to feel that the witchcult was angry at him for the violation of secrets and held him re sponsible for the release of return to the sabbath that he explained was why he would not give his address nor speak of his past life for publication that is why he must use very heavy makeup in his film debut here he felt at times as though he were being watched or fol lowed there were many foreigners here too many what the devil can i do with a man like that kincaid exploded after he had explained this to me hes insane or a fool and i confess that hes too much like his screen character to please me the damned casual way in which he professes to have dabbled in devilwor ship and sorcery he believes all this andwell ill tell you the truth i came here today because of the last thing he spoke of to me this morning he came down to the office and at first when he walked in i didnt know him the dark glasses and muffler helped of course but he himself had changed he was trembling and walked with a stoop and when he spoke his voice was like a groan he showed me this kincaid handed me the clipping it was from the london times through european press dispatches a short para graph giving an account of the death of fritz ohmmen the austrian film direc tor he had been found strangled in a paris garret and his body had been frightfully mutilated it mentioned an in verted cross branded on his stomach above the ripped entrails police were seeking the murderer i handed the clipping back in silence so what i asked but i had already guessed his answer fritz ohmmen kincaid said slow return to the sabbath ly was the director of the picture in which karl jorla played the director who with jorla knew the devilworship pers jorla says that he fled to paris and that they sought him out i was silent mess grunted kincaid ive of fered jorla police protection and hes re fused i cant coerce him under the terms of our contract as long as he plays the part hes secure with us but he has the jitters and im getting them he stormed out i couldnt help him i sat thinking of karl jorla who believed in devilgods worshipped and betrayed them and i could have smiled at the absurdity of it all if i hadnt seen the man on the screen and watched his evil eyes he knew it was then that i began to feel thankful we had not given jorla any publicity i had a hunch during the next few days i saw jorla but seldom the rumors however began to trickle in there had been an influx of foreign sightseers at the studio gates someone had attempted to crash through the barriers in a racingcar an extra in a mob scene over on lot six had been found carrying an automatic beneath his vest when apprehended he had been lurking under the executive office win dows they had taken him down to headquarters and so far the man had re fused to talk he was a german jorla came to the studios every day in a shuttered car he was bundled up to the eyes he trembled constantly his english lessons went badly he spoke to no one he had hired two men to ride with him in his car they were armed a few days later news came that the german extra had talked he was evident ly a pathological case he babbled wildly of a black cult of lucifer known to some of the foreigners around town it was a secret society purporting to wor ship the devil with vague connections in the mother countries he had been chosen to avenge a wrong more than that he dared not say but he did give an address where the police might find cult headquarters the place a dingy house in glendale was quite deserted of course it was a queer old house with a secret cellar beneath the basement but everything seemed to have been aban doned the man was being held for ex amination by an alienist i heard this report with deep misgiv ings i knew something of los an geles and hollywoods heterogeneous for eign population god knows southern california has attracted mystics and oc cultists from all over the world ive even heard rumors about stars being mixed up in unsavory secret societies things one would never dare to admit in print and jorla was afraid that afternoon i tried to trail his black car as it left the studio for his mysterious home but i lost the track in the winding reaches of topanga canyon it had dis appeared into the secret twilight of the purple hills and i knew then that there was nothing i could do jorla had his own defenses and if they failed we at the studio could not help that was the evening he disappeared at least he did not show up the next morning at the studio and production was to start in two days we heard about it the boss and kincaid were frantic the police were called in and i did my best to hush things up when jorla did not appear the following morning i went to kincaid and told him about my follow ing the car to topanga canyon the police went to work next morning was production we spent a sleepless night of fruitless vigil there was no word morning came and there was unspoken dread in kincaids eyes as he faced me across the weird tales office table eight oclock we got up and walked silently across the lot to the studio cafeteria black coffee was badly needed we hadnt had a police report for hours we passed stage four where the jorla crew was at work the noise of hammers was mockery jorla we felt would never face a camera today if ever bleskind the director of the untitled horror opus came out of the stage office as we passed his paunchy body quivered as he grasped kincaids lapels and piped any news kincaid shook his head slowly bles kind thrust a cigar into his tense mouth were shooting ahead he snapped well shoot around jorla if he doesnt show up when we finish the scenes in which he wont appear well get another actor but we cant wait the squat director bustled back to the stage moved by a sudden impulse kincaid grasped my arm and propelled me after bleskinds waddling form lets see the opening shots he sug gested i want to see what kind of a story theyve given him we entered stage four a gothic castle the ancestral home of baron ulmo a dark gloomy stone crypt of spidery horror cobwebbed dustshrouded deserted by men and given over to the rats by day and the unearthly horrors that crept by night an altar stood by the crypt an altar of evil the great black stone on which the ancient baron ulmo and his devilcult had held their sacrifices now in the pit beneath the altar the baron lay buried such was the legend according to the first shot scheduled sylvia charming the heroine was explor ing the castle she had inherited the place and taken it over with her young hus band in this scene she was to see the altar for the first time read the inscrip tion on its base this inscription was to prove an unwitting invocation opening up the crypt beneath the altar and awak ening jorla as baron ulmo from the dead he was to rise from the crypt then and walk it was at this point that the scene would terminate due to jorlas strange absence the setting was magnificently handled kincaid and i took our places beside di rector bleskind as the shot opened sylvia channing walked out on the set the sig nals were given lights flashed and the action began it was pantomimic sylvia walked across the cobwebbed floor noticed the altar examined it she stooped to read the inscription then whispered it aloud there was a drone as the opening of the altarcrypt was mechanically begun the altar swung aside and the black gaping pit was revealed the upper cameras swnang to sylvias face she was to stare at the crypt in horror and she did it most magnificently in the picture she would be watching jorla emerge bleskind prepared to give the signal to cut action then something emerged from the crypt it was dead that thingthat horror with a mask of faceless flesh its lean body was clothed in rotting rags and on its chest was a bloody crucifix inverted carved out of dead flesh the eyes blazed loathsomely it was baron ulmo rising from the dead and it was karl jorla the makeup was perfect his eyes were dead just as in the other film the lips seemed shredded again the mouth even more ghastly in its slitted blackness and the touch of the bloody crucifix was immense bleskind nearly swallowed his cigar when jorla appeared quickly he con trolled himself silently signaled the men to proceed with the shooting we strained forward watching every move return to the sabbath but les kincaids eyes held a wonder akin to my own jorla was acting as never before he moved slowly as a corpse must move as he raised himself from the crypt each tiny effort seemed to cause him ut ter agony the scene was soundless syl via had fainted but jorlas lips moved and we heard a faint whispering murmur which heightened the horror now the grisly cadaver was almost half out of the crypt it strained upward still murmur ing the bloody crucifix of flesh gleamed redly on the chest i thought of the one found on the body of the murdered foreign director fritz ohmmen and real ized where jorla had gotten the idea the corpse strained up it was to rise now up and then with a sudden rictus the body stiffened and slid back into the crypt who screamed first i do not know but the screaming continued after the propboys had rushed to the crypt and looked down at what lay within when i reached the brink of the pit i screamed too for it was utterly empty i wish there were nothing more to tell the papers never knew the police hushed things up the studio is silent and the production was dropped immedi ately but matters did not stop there there was a sequel to that hideous horror on stage four kincaid and i cornered bleskind there was no need of any explanation how could what we had just seen be ex plained in any sane way jorla had disappeared no one had let him into the studio no makeup man had given him his attention nobody had seen him enter the crypt he had ap peared in the scene then disappeared the crypt was empty these were the facts kincaid told bleskind what to do the film was de veloped immediately though two of the technicians fainted we three sat in the projection booth and watched the morn ings rushes flicker across the screen the soundtrack was specially dubbed in that scenesylvia walking and read ing the incantationthe pit opening and god when nothing emerged nothing but that great red scar sus pended in midairthat great inverted crucifix cut in bleeding flesh no jorla visible at all that bleeding cross in the air and then the mumbling jorlathe thingwhatever it was had mumbled a few syllables on emerg ing from the crypt the soundtrack had picked them up and we couldnt see anything but that scar yet we heard jorlas voice now coming from nothing ness we heard what he kept repeating as he fell back into the crypt it was an address in topanga canyon the lights flickered on and it was good to see them kincaid phoned the police and directed them to the address given on the soundtrack we waited the three of us in kin caids office waited for the police call we drank but did not speak each of us was thinking of karl jorla the devil worshipper who had betrayed his faith of his fear of vengeance we thought of the directors death and the bloody crucifix on his chest remembered jorlas disappearance and then that ghastly ghostthing on the screen the bloody thing that hung in midair as jorlas voice groaned the address the phone rang i picked it up it was the police de partment they gave their report i fainted weird tales it was several minutes before i came to it was several more minutes before i opened my mouth and spoke theyve found karl jorlas body at the address given on the screen i whis pered he was lying dead in an old shack up in the hills he had been murdered there was a bloody cross in verted on his chest they think it was the work of some fanatics because the place was filled with books on sorcery and black magic they say i paused kincaids eyes commanded go on they say i murmured that jorla had been dead for at least three days

cheerfully have commit ted murder for that rug but as it is morgan revell smiled at the memory of his exceeding cleverness and regarded the thronerug of saladin with that fanatic affection comprehensible only to a collector the savage jest of it is that he did commit murder only he doesnt know it nor for that matter do i absolutely know but piecing it all together and taking into account the emotions that take possession of a rug collector i can draw but one inevitable conclusion and that is but to approach the matter at all some explaining is necessary first of all you who regard a rug as something to hide the nakedness of a floor must revise your conception of things it is all very true that the machinemade atrocities of this country as well as the precious weaves of the orient are indeed used as floor coverings something on which to walk something to give the vacuum cleaner its excuse for existing but that is only a part of it oriental rugs are works of art the peer of any of the numerous products of mans instinct to create unbelievable and imperishable beauty and just as there are those who collect the works of ancient silversmiths armorers cabinetmakers and bookbinders so likewise are there those whose consuming passion and sole aim in life is the accumulating of antique specimens of oriental weaving rugs from boukhara and silken samarcand from shiraz and herat of the hundred gardens prayer rugs palace carpets or the priceless fabric that graced the floor of a nomads tent in turkestan rugs are many and their enumeration lengthy and the study of their personality and traits is the pursuit of a lifetime some are prized for their beauty and matchless craftsmanship others for their exceeding rarity and some for the sake of all those qualities once one has succumbed to the sorcery of a bijar that covered the dirt floor of a kurdish hovel or a silken kashan that hung suspended by silver rings on the walls of a kings palace one is beyond redemption or the desire of redemption it is even as though one had become ad dicted to the smoke of the poppy or to from weird tales for october weird tales the grain of hasheesh dissolved in wine ones house becomes a place designed for the sheltering and storing of rare rugs though of course the collector him self has no moral scruples about utilizing a bit of that same shelter for himself one may wear last years overcoat and have last years shoes halfsoled but one can always raise the price however ex orbitant of a threadbare ladik a battle scarred ghiordes or a motheaten fera ghan thus though morgan revell was ex aggerating when he smiled in a way reminiscent of a cat who has just had a pleasant têteàtête with a canary and re marked id cheerfully have committed murder for that rug he was well within the limits of poetic license not that he would actually consider going as far as rope pistol or poison in fact i think he would stop short of breaking and entering but the fact remains that trifles can not stand in ones way when a really rare rug is in sight and very often a jest is the essence of truth well and that is that either you still maintain that a rug is but something to put on the floor or else you have grasped some conception of the fanaticism that consumes the confirmed collector of antique rugs if the former well and good de gustibus non disputandum est but if the latter if you have grasped the idea then perhaps you will understand why i crave a bit of fresh air and a change of scene whenever i catch a whiff of attar of roses or a glimpse of a fine hardspun silken cord i was making one of my customary reconnaissances prowling tours in search of the perfect rug the wondrous prize though what id have done with it is a bit beyond me unless id have tacked it to the ceiling all other space is occu pied furthermore i am at times hereti cal enough to fancy that it is better to know that the rent due on the morrow will be in cash available for payment to the landlord instead of being draped over a lounge or parked on the last bit of vacant wall or floor space a chubby oily little fellow from some where in asia minor with features that combined mephisto with kewpie ap proached and offered his services assur ing me that some rare bargains would be auctioned off that afternoon i assured him that i was merely prowling about a fine kirman worth seven hundred dollars he began just from force of habit perhaps you will bid on it get it for twothree hundred i didnt bother to tell him that id not use it for a bath mat that it was a sicklylooking mess with its flabby tex ture its aniline dyes bleached to un natural softness and its fearful glassy luster gained from glycerin and hot rollers and that it would hardly be a fit companion for a kirman roserug of the old school so he left me to my own de vices to tear down several piles shoul derhigh of rugs of varying quality mainly atrocities recently woven to satisfy the everincreasing demand for oriental rugs wretched rags which the auctioneer would later exhibit glassily agleam under a powerful floodlight and describe as royal bijar royal sarouk or royal kashan or royal whatever travesty it was on some ancient honor able weave weariness and more weariness i worked my way through the second pile and with like result an old feraghan tempted me but i decided that though honest and ancient it would cost too much to have the worn spots rewoven nor did the third pile bring forth any thing of interest then poking about in a dark corner i found behind a baled roomsized carpet a scrap of something saladins thronerug which even in that dim light had the look of antiquity the stamp of personality possessed only by one of the old guard and it had the feel of ancient weaving i dragged it out through all its coat ing of dust and dirt the unbelievable richness of the dyes the baldheaded ness of the back and subdued luster of the face were apparent thenhorrible sighti saw that i had but a portion of a rug between half and twothirds of one the remnant of something which if complete would be priceless judging from the fragment the complete piece would be about five feet wide and twelve feet long or thereabout some barbarian had sliced it in two crosswise with a clean sweeping cut that left in this frag ment about half of the medallion which had been the central design of the com plete piece what fool would commit such a wanton infamy such an uncalledfor blas phemy and then i recalled that classic incident of early moslem history where in one of the prophets fanatic generals in apportioning the loot of a persian pal ace had dismembered a goldthreaded carpet giving each of his captains a por tion saying that it would have been un fair to let any one individual retain the entire rug and offering the equally good reason that such a pagan vanity deserved mutilation under stronger light i saw that my instinct for a rarity had indeed been true the weave was incredibly fine at least six or seven hundred knots to the square inch the pile worn to the warp was of silk and the ground inside the main border and surrounding the central medallion was of silver bullion thread woven tapestrywise about the warp threads instead of being tied and clipped so as to make a nap as is the practise when weaving with silk or wool here certes was the adornment of a palace the gift of one prince to another fortunately for my chances of buying the fragment the silver bullion ground was so tarnished and caked with dirt that its true nature would scarcely be noticed for if some collector with a bottomless wallet would see recognize and bid against my poverty id surely lose out but the chances were that even a keen observer unless he had examined the relic closely would pass it up as a mere scrap unworthy of consideration but then i had to take the auctioneer into account if in handling that frag ment displaying it to the assembled bidders he ever noticed that its ground was of silver thread id be strictly out of luck however there was little chance hed notice the pile was of silk for it was worn to the warp and since all ancient rugs either of silk or wool have a greasy slick surface his sense of touch might not enlighten him i had to buy that ancient fragment and i had to get it without the auction eers realizing what was going on just what device would minimize his chances of noticing the true nature of what was passing through his hands and then came the solution boy come here a minute one of the uniformed porters ap proached i gave him his instructions also a couple of dollar bills and the promise of as much more if the ruse worked also the promise that id hunt him up and down the earth with a sawedoff shotgun if he failed me it was now and the auction was to begin at prospective bidders were already taking seats before the auction eers rostrum the average bargain hunter has such sublime confidence in his or her ability to pick a rug or other precious article at first glance that few bother to examine the treasures before bidding weird tales and thus no one intruded on my final study of the fragment i had unearthed i contrived to decipher die inscription in the remaining half of the central medallion id stumbled across and al though im no scholar i can in a pinch hammer out a few words of arabic and get enough to supply at least the context of an inscription at the feet of my lord i fall i have bowed me down seven times with breast and back and all that the king said to me well well do i hear abimilki a servant of the king am i and the dust of thy two feet this much i could gather the upper half of the inscription in the missing upper half of the medallion doubtless con tained the preliminary honorifics and per haps even the name of the prince to whom the rug had been presented pre sented where at trebizond damascus isphahan baghdad what king shah abbas nadir shall who had received the servile protestations of this prince ling abimilki the opening of the daily auction broke into my reflections i caught the eye of the porter i had bribed and then found a seat royal bijars and royal sarouks were extolled and lauded with all the dramatic art and per jury at the command of auctioneers hail ing from the near east and under the floodlights those pseudoroyal rugs did have a magnificent appearance how much am i offered for this royal sarouk this magnificent lustrous carpet it is worth a thousand dollars am i offered seven hundred seven hun dred they are getting scarcer every day a genuine royal sarouk do i hear five hundred is there no one here who really knows rugs this is not a floor covering this isfour hundred thank you i am offered four hundred dollars that shouldnt even buy the fringe will someone give me five hundred did i hear four fifty seventyfive eighty thank you who offers five hundred and thus through the heap of rugs then came some boukhara saddlebags one at a time then more royal bijars and kashans and kirmans valiantly the plump mephisto pleading groaning holding out for just one more dollar per jured his way through the stacks beside the rostrum and all the while the porter paraded up and down the aisle giving the bidders a glimpse of the articles in question finally after an hours exhorting after the perspiration was trickling down his cheeks and glistening on his brow after fatigue had left its marks on the chubby auctioneer the porter handed him the fragment i had discovered under that powerful light its suave magnificence glowed forth through the coating of dust and dirt devil take that light but thanks to the naps being worn so close the now weary auctioneer some what dulled by fatigue did not sense that he held the remains of a silken rug in his hands nor did the silver bullion ground below the medallion betray itself the porter had handed him the end nearest the original center where the medallion reached from border to border and where consequently there was no silver ground to meet his fingertips then scarcely had the orator opened his harangue the porter snatched the precious fabric and was dashing down the aisle holding it as well knotted up as he could contrive without seeming to do so noble african nevertheless it was a ticklish moment how much am i offered for this antique rug he had begun flashing it beneath the flaring floodlight before yielding it to the eager porter yes sir saladins thronerug i know it is half of a rug but it is old and very rare it is an antique tabriz which proved that hed never seen it before id exhumed it from that dark dusty comer that hed not noticcd the silver ground tabriz pure and simple improvisation on his part sixty dollars thank you i am of fered sixty it is worth several hundred a rare old tabriz seventy thank you madam damn that schoolteacher what made her think it was worth seventy though she might be a decoy to raise the bids so i came up five will anyone offer a hundred ninety give me ninety for this rare oldi am offered ninety will someone make it a hundred i rather fancied that my ninetyfive would land it ninetyfive once ninetyfive twice the porter was already thrusting an other piece into the auctioneers weary fingers but before the hammer could drop el hamdu lilláh gasped someone at my right one hundred a lean foreigner with a nose like the beak of a bird of prey took the seat next to me a turk perhaps or a kurd whom civilization had not robbed of his alert predatory air and desert gauntness and ten i snapped back onefifty enunciated the newcomer hells hinges who was that fool and who ever heard of an oriental un less he were a dealer caring a happy hoot about the threadbare worn fragment of an antique ring and seventyfive that ought to stop him but it didnt not for a moment two hundred he pronounced and when i raised him twentyfive he did as much for me and without batting an eyelash i prayed that some angel would slip me the handle of a meatax and then offered fifty more the auctioneer beamed and gloated and rubbed his hands and praised heaven for connoisseurs who appreciated antiques the porter from force of habit once more began to deploy the precious piece to egg on the bidders but catching my eye he desisted though it could have done no harm for that relentless heathen at my right was out for that rug that elhamdu lilláh was the incredulous gasp of one who has stumbled around a corner and met fate face to face it would be my roll against his threefifty he announced scarcely giving the overjoyed auctioneer a chance to acknowledge my last bid five hundred was my last despair ing effort and fivefifty came like the crack of doom the stranger rose from his seat peeled a wad of bills from a roll that would have choked a rhinoceros and claimed his prize have it delivered absolutely not and when i saw the look in his eye and the gesture with which he draped that scrap over his arm i knew that all the wealth of the indies could not separate him from one thread of that ancient relic i climbed to my feet and strode down the aisle talking to myself in non apostolic tongues but as i reached the paving my meditations were interrupted allow me to thank you effendi it was the foreigner still caressing the nap of the precious fragment he had draped over his arm i owe you a great deal for having dis covered this piece though i was almost too late i couldnt resist that courtly manner weird tales that cordial goodfellowship the bird of prey had laid aside his predatory man ner and seemed really overjoyed about something happiness exaltation were mingled with his triumph dont thank me thank my slim bank roll i laughed and swallowed the rem nants of my disappointment i have been hunting that piece for years continued the stranger in stam boul sultanabad tabriz new york london wherever rugs are sold and now i or rather you have found it i regret your disappointment but i had to have that rug he concluded speaking his last phrase in the tone of a bigoted moslem announcing his belief in the unity of allah so i noted was my reply though it wasnt as illnatured as it may sound if you can spare the time i shall tell you the story and show you the other half of the rug you knew of course that there was another half this was becoming interesting i suspected as much though who and where i am ilderim shirkuh bin ayyub announced the stranger and bowed in response to my acknowledgment of the introduction ilderim shirkuh bin ayyub very im pressive but what of itthough there was something familiar about that reso nant handle he led the way to a car parked at the curbing during our drive north bin ayyub maintained a reflective silence that gave me a bit of time for my own thoughts and as the long aristocratic car purred its way toward the gold coast i began to sense that i had indeed fallen into something true i had lost the prize i had sought to capture but had i made the grade id probably have remained in ignorance of its entire significance a few blocks past the edgewater beach hotel we drew up before an ancient bulky mansion set back of an acre of lawn a great house its dignity still overshadowing its approaching de crepitude an outlaw a rebel that still withstood the encroachment of apart ments and apartment hotels a negro arrayed in a striped buftan and wearing a massive spirally twisted turban ushered us into a dimly lit salon which though almost bare of furniture was magnificently carpeted and tapestried with ancient lustrous persian rugs clusters of arms and armor placed at in tervals along the walls gleamed icily in the dull light of several great brazen floorlamps it seemed almost sacrilege to tread on that magnificent palace car pet whose exquisite loveliness framed by a border of hardwood floor reminded me of a diamond set off by its background of onyx bin ayyub finally broke the silence he had maintained for as we entered he had with a gesture invited me to be seated he himself remaining on his feet preoccupied regarding the precious frag ment he had captured looking at it as though all the splendor about him was cheap and tawdry in comparison to that threadbare eroded scrap he held in his hands unintentionallyand involuntarily alsoyou have done me a great service he at last began as he seated himself as i told you i am ilderim shirkuh bin ayyub again he paused as if to let that im pressive title sink home and as i saw him against that background of lustrous rugs and damascened simitars and armor i wondered whether i had been wrong in having omitted a salaam bin ayyub turned to the negro and saladins thronerug i can in no other way describe his man nerpublished an order then to me you have heard of salah ad din yusuf bin ayyub in your language saladin certainly who has not i am descended in direct line from saladin that fragment is part of the thronerug of my ancestor the nephew of shirkuh of tekrit and sultan of syria and egypt now do you begin to see why i value that scrap do you mean to say that that rug covered the throne of saladin exactly and i shall prove it even as bin ayyub spoke the african returned carrying a small chest of dark wood elaborately carved and bound in bands of discolored metal bluish black like ageold silver look how the pieces match exulted bin ayyub as he took from the chest that which i saw at a glance was the other part of the relic i had discovered the pieces did indeed match perfectly though the lastacquired fragment was somewhat the more worn and eroded by the rough use of those who had possessed it ig norant of its worth read effendi surely you can read else you would never have bid this after noon but i insisted that bin ayyub read and translate into english i felt rather fool ish about strutting my halting arabic be fore this polished oriental whose very english was better than my own in the name of allah the merciful the compas sionate to my lord salah ad din yusuf bin ayyub the sun of heaven thus hath spoken abimilki the groom of thy horse i am the dust under the sandals of my lord the king seven and seven times at the feet of my lord i fall i have bowed me down seven times with breast and back and all that the king said to me well well do i hear abim ilki a servant of the king am i and the dust of thy two feet and here it was threadbare and eroded by the passing of eight centuries the thronerug of saladin that great prince who elevated himself from the castle of tekrit in kurdistan to the throne of syria and egypt and reigned as defender of the faith and sword of islam had the auctioneers hammer fallen just an instant earlier alláhu akbar ejaculated bin ayyub sensing my thoughts to think of how close a race it was a second later and i might now be bargaining with you for your prize offering you all my posses sions for that one fragment of carpet and you would have refused i would go barefooted through the tali flames of gehennem for what i took from you an hour ago then to the negro saoud prepare some coffee i wonder he resumed if you have any truly rare rugs in your collection like that isphahan for example bin ayyub plucked from the wall what even in that dim light i recognized as an ancient isphahan that deep winered and solemn green that classically perfect ren dition of the shah abbas border and field were unmistakable it was indeed an old isphahan that final supreme prize of the collector that rarest and most costly of all rugs i admitted that i had not attained and probably never should attain to such a fabulously scarce piece of weaving you are wrong quite wrong for since i need that wall space for saladins thronerug i shall give you that isphahan with my thanks and apologies apologies yes for what i am giving you is a worthless rag compared with what i took from you this afternoon such generosity is dizzying that small perfect isphahan would be worth several thousand dollars even had it been ragged weird tales as a last years birds nest i was stumped stopped dead saoud entering with coffee inter rupted my thanks after having served the steaming nightblack deathly bitter beverage the negro took his post at the farther end of the salon in front of a pair of heavy curtains that i fancied must conceal an alcove in elkáhireh it is the custom to per fume ones coffee with a tiny bit of am bergris remarked bin ayyub but i have devised a more subtle combination in response to the masters nod saoud parted the silverembroidered curtains and caught them on the hilts of the simi tars that hung at each side of the alcove a great jar fully as tall as the negro and gracefully curved as a grecian amphora glowed in the level sunset rays like a monstrous rosyamber bead he lifted the cover of the jar and from it rolled a wave of overwhelming sweetness an unearthly fragrance so curi ously blended that i could not pick the dominant odor jasmine or the rose of naishápúr or all the mingled spices of cebu and saigon with undertones of sandalwood and patchouli a dizzy ing madness a surge of intoxicating warmth and richness poured resistlessly from the glowing pulsating almost transparent depths of that great urn i wondered how saoud could endure it at such close range and then drink ing fully of the potent wave that swept past me i lost all physical sensation save that of floating in a sea of torrid con fusing sweetness and then the african replaced the cover of the jar i fancied that he reeled ever so slightly as he with drew from that throbbing luminous fountain of unbelievable fragrance and wondered that he did not collapse bin ayyub had apparently forgotten my presence he sipped his coffee and with halfclosed eyes stared into the depths of the urn the unfathomable perfect peace which moslems wish each other with their essalaam aleika had descended upon him keyf the placid en joyment of wakefulness that is half sleep the silence the utter repose was con tagious i found myself gazing eyes half out of focus at the thronerug and then i sensed that eyes were staring at me from some place of con cealment i turned and caught a glimpse of a dainty armful shapely and elegantly contoured a girl with smoldering sara cenic eyes pools of dusky enchantment just for an instant i held her level un abashed gaze which lingered long enough to let me fully sense her imperious calm and composure it was just a glimpse barely enough to let me recognize the transparent olive complexion and faint ly aquiline features of a transcaucasian a gurjestani the most flawlessly lovely of all oriental women and then the por tières closed on the vision what a mad afternoon the throne rug of saladin and then the descend ant of that great prince and that girl with her smoldering kohldarkened eyes the familiar spirit of the urn whose byzantine curves imprisoned that glow ing rosyamber sea of sweetness wild thought but she was small and dainty enough to have emerged from that great jar and then vanished back into its shimmering pulsating depths the contents of that jar began bin ayyub emerging from the silence would make a rich perfume of all the seas of the world it would be folly to try to imagine the countless myriads of blos soms and herbs spices and gums that are imprisoned in that essence a drop a thousandfold diluted and a drop of that dilution equally diluted would be more potent than the strongest scents known to your feringhi perfumers w t weird tales it seems you took a fearful risk in shipping such a fragile and predous article into this country i suggested it was risky still i would rather have had it shattered en route than fall into the hands of the spoilers who looted my house in stamboul but as luck would have it there was a babbler among my enemies so that i had warning i packed my treasures and smuggled them out one at a time and the night before the bowstring was to grace my throat my family and i left in disguise bin ayyub paused to reflect a moment wondering perhaps whether to carry on or change the subject and then the dark ness of his deepset eyes flared fiercely do you see that cord he indicated a fine strand of hardbraided silk which hung from the peg that supported the simitar at the right of the alcove con taining the byzantine urn my enemy was so careless as to walk by moonlight the evening before a doom was to settle on my house and as a souvenir of the promenade i brought with me that fine stout cord which for all he cared i might have left there to chafe his throat con cluded bin ayyub as he stroked his black mustache and then he showed me how the bow string is employed that flickering swift gesture of his long lean hands was grue somely convincing bin ayyub was in deed a versatile man swift and probably painless i vol unteered yes but if i had my choice of deaths mused bin ayyub i would elect to be drowned in a pool of that

portières parted and the lady from gurjestan reappeared in that strange atmosphere it never occurred to me to commit the faux pas of rising as she entered this was doubtless bin ayyubs family and though the united states were on the street they had not quite penetrated to this dim salon so that i felt it would be tactful not to seem to take any notice of the girl upon more intimate acquaintance with bin ayyub i might be presented to her but not at present bin ayyub replied to her purring rippling syllables speaking some lan guage unknown to me and then the tapestried portières closed and hid her from sight you will surely pardon me effendi though djénane hanoum speaks eng lish she prefers her native language he remarked then clapped his hands to sum mon saoud fresh coffee was served and then as my cigarette smoldered to its finish bin ayyub rose rolled up the precious is phahan and again offered it to me and in ten days or two weeks the thronerug of saladin will be spliced by skilled weavers i would be very glad to have you return and see it after it is restored the clicking of the latch behind me reminded me that i was again in the city of chicago and the isphahan did not let me forget that i had actually been awake the past few hours whenever there has been a killing the vultures assemble i had mar veled that morgan revell had not stum bled across the thronerug of saladin be fore i did thus it was that i was not surprized to have him call at my apart ment that very evening well most extraordinary that where did you get it he demanded as he paused in the doorway stripping off his gloves in preparation for the in spection of the isphahan that bin ayyub had so generously given me shades of shah abbas strike me blind but it seems genuine and perfect he then parked his bulk in my favorite chair and poured himself a drink and proceeded to extract the story and naturally i was not at all averse to en lightening him for this would about even up for his eternal boasting of the mosque carpet of eski shehr a remarkable tale but one which eventually wears on ones nerves on the level now did anyone actually make you a present of this isphahan he inquired as i concluded my account of the days doings idiot said i do you think i could have bought it well no but still his features parted in a reminiscent grin perhaps you remember the mosque carpet of eski shehr lay off that mosque carpet no i got this honestly and without any of your clever devices score one for you but really now old egg dont you know this is a most unusual tale youre telling quite pre posterous quite first of all this bin ayyub person is a rara avis and all that if at all who ever heard of one of those beggars who had any appreciation of an antique rug what about rot whoever you were going to cite is probably a dealer its simply preposter ous this bin ayyub who collects ancient rugs and that descendant of saladin why really old fruit that doesnt hold water at all i insisted that there were orientals who did appreciate the beauty of the won drous rugs which they wove quite so quite so but just consider weird tales countered revell that this isphahan which you treasure as an antique was painfully new in the days when good old shah abbas was so partial to fine weav ing and inventing new designs that jolly prince had nothing but antiques on his hands and he craved new ones also new patterns so much so that he sent artists to italy to study design but damn it i tell you ah yes surely nevertheless i insist that the appreciation of antiques is an occidental taste and one which is jolly well artificial remember that little armenian in ashjians showrooms and how much he felt that we were upset above the ears for preferring a thread bare kabistan to a new sarouk i remembered well now go to ashjians and let that same lad catch you admiring a kir man roserug hear him sigh with much ecstasy see him caper about get the gal lons of praise he pours on the heads of those fine old eggs who really knew how to weave a rug he knows his litany now but he wasnt born that way revell scored but bin ayyub is a cultured gentle man ill take you out to his house and then youll be convinced about it all in cluding his being a descendant of saladin very well have it your own way you know it really may be quite pos sible only its just a bit unusual if you know what i mean revell finally con ceded as i completed my repetition of the story and added bits of color i had omitted the first time not that i doubted your word but in all honesty old onion can you blame me for being a shade skeptical when even the shalls palace in teheran is cluttered with gilt bricàbrac and modern sultanieh rugs and all that sort of atrocious thing beastly taste these

may be the exception though i contend that whatever the art the orient provides is the result of in stinct and not intent i granted most of his contentions and then we discussed the great jar of attar and the surpassing loveliness of bin ayyubs family most fascinating really this sounds like what people think the orient ought to be but never actually is houris and incense and all that sort of thing then just as he left by the way did you ever read the quaint little tale of aladdins lamp sure what of it nothing really nothing at all merely curious you know now what had that buzzard meant by that remark a subtle way of calling me an outandout romancer or did he mean that in getting my isphahan i had stumbled into something aladdinlike and then i carefully examined the isphahan no revell had not palmed it and left a replica in its place strangely enough he had not even tried to trade or bargain for it it was fully two weeks before i could find time to call on bin ayyub to in spect the restoration of the thronerug but finally i did contrive to find some spare time and just to convince revell that i had not been releasing an arabian fantasy i decided to take him along cheers old bean greeted revell i was just thinking but how do you like it it the thronerug of saladin stared me in the face rich lustrous magnifi cent now that it had been cleaned and the pieces spliced together where in revell laughed at my amazement most amazing what but dont rub your eyes it is exactly what it looks like the rug of the justly popular saladin i was just thinking of asking you to trans late the inscription couldnt remember the exact wording you gave me several nights ago devil take inscriptions how did you get it unless he suddenly needed the money you could have done the same thing revell began as he poured him self a drink then painstakingly selected a cigar especially after i told you in so many words how to go about it how come told me how to go about it this was too much for me hed been up to dirty work of some kind it was unbelievable that he had purchased that rug and i doubted that he was clever enough to have outwitted bin ayyub then what breaking and entering well not very likely the last thing i said the other night was something about aladdins lamp i fancy you recollect but i was jolly well certain youd not follow my train of thought well the magician from el moghreb paraded up and down in front of aladdins palace offering to exchange old lamps for new ones and the prin cessmrs aladdinwas tickled pink to take an unfair advantage of an old mans foolishness so she joyously swapped the greasy tarnished old magic lamp for a nice new one never occurred to aladdin to tell the young person his wife that the rather crude old lamp was of some value simple really do you mean to say oh yes quite exactly in fact mrs bin ayyub greatly fancied a lovely ana tolian silk rug about the same size as the revered saladins thronerug which by the way she thought was a bit passé liked my silk rug bright colors and not at all worn and all that sort of thing so we swapped and i fancy i noted a gleam weird tales of triumph or something like that in her most fascinating eyes charming creature yes and then i exploded you ought to be shot hell beat the tar out of her hell flay her alive regrets and all that surely but caveat emptor still holds good she had no business messing around with the mas ters trinkets after all a bit of de ceit and that girl will surely smell hell much regret certainly but really would you have me pass up such an op portunity id cheerfully have committed murder for that rug as it is revell smiled at the memory of his exceeding cleverness and gazed at the thronerug of saladin with that fanatic affection comprehensible only to a col lector and that smile drove me mad thanks to my babbling revell had turned a very clever trick and thanks also to me that dainty girls shoulders no bin ayyub wouldnt beat her himself hed have black saoud lay aside his duties of foot man pipebearer and coffeegrinder and peel every inch of skin off her shoulders the noble turk is a man of few words and short temper when dealing with his family all of which went to my head seeing that it was mainly my fault for having set revell on the trail listen you damned coyote i gripped revell by the shoulder by way of emphasis he blinked in

mastered his amazement at my outburst i return that rug absurd really preposterous why as i said id have committed and then revell stared as i leaped to the arm of a davenport reached up and yanked saladins thronerug from its place on the wall wait a minute this is getting a bit thick i say by this time i was seeing red and also other colors one more word out of you and ill knock your head off im taking this rug back to its owner get me revell is far from yellow but some how i convinced him the last glimpse i had of him he was the color of an old saddle and choking for breath really now but this is a bit thick he contrived as i slammed the door i missed the rest but i am sure that for the next fifteen minutes it was a bit thick in the revell apartment thronerug trailing over my shoulder i hopped a taxi and proceeded to bin ayyubs house bin ayyub himself admitted me i recognized him simply because no mask could disguise those lean aquiline features but this which faced me was but a simulacrum of the vital personality i had met two weeks ago his face was unshaven his eyes wrere cavernous and dull lifeless gone was all save the shell of saladins descendant the change was so startling so dismaying that for the moment i forgot the thronerug i carried rolled up under my arm in view of the denunciation and wrath i expected accusations of having played a part in the trickery of revell this list lessness of bin ayyub left me dazed and wondering i am glad to see you effendi he murmured as he conducted me into the salon he had not offered to take my hat and coat had not noticed the bundle i carried the thronerug i began offering him the precious roll i regret spare your regrets it was my fault i should have told djénane hanoum of its value he took the rug with a listlessness that amazed me and moving as one suddenly aroused from sound sleep spread it across a couch i feared that i suspected you interrupted bin ayyub no i knew you were not guilty you know who is guilty but since he must be one who has eaten your bread and salt i can not ask you to betray him bin ayyub seemed to forget that i was not bound by the moslems belief in the sanctity of bread and salt but now that i had returned the rug why bother about the trickster revell nor have i time to hunt him con tinued bin ayyub i have been waiting for you to return saladins thronerug and now that that is done i have little time for hunting him but now theres no need of hunting him i suggested you have your rug which i fancied was a sensible answer but the look that flitted across bin ayyubs face and took form in his eyes told me that my remark had been the thrust of incandescent iron bin ayyub rose i wondered if this was to terminate the interview it seemed that he might at least have thanked me despite my having been the cause of his annoyance i have dismissed saoud for the day weird tales but i myself will prepare coffee one moment please the aura of unbounded misery and corroding despair remained lingering after the portières had hidden bin ayyub from sight not even the clanging of the brazen pestle wherewith he pulverized the freshly roasted coffee could infuse a trace of life into the somber magnificence of that rich salon the order of nature had been upset this was the house of one whose spirit had died a thousand deaths without having deprived the body of life not even the return of the thronerug had aroused a sparkle of the vital preda tory spirit of that fierce kurd whose eyes had but two weeks ago flamed exultantly as he told of the enemy who had unwisely walked by moonlight bin ayyubs entry with a tray inter rupted my reflections one of the tiny eggshell cups was white the other deep blue no effendi blue is the color of mourning take the white one a light began to dawn on me the color of mourning he had taken this tactful way of letting me know that my presence was an intrusion on his sorrow but if there had been a death in the family why that flash of abysmal despair when a few moments ago i had suggested that since he once more had the throne rug he need not bother to hunt whoever it was that had tricked djénane hanoum bismillahi murmured bin ayyub then tasted his coffee after a moments silence he continued i bear you no ill will for what has happened naturally you would speak to your friends of the isphahan i gave you and of the throne rug it was my fault i should have told her worse and worse that rug again hadnt i returned it wasnt he sitting on it even as he spoke well then the wise men of ancient egypt told herodotus

rapidly getting on edge and i hoped bin ayyub would end the inter view i am leaving very soon effendi he finally resumed saoud will pack up my goods i have been waiting for you to return the thronerug and i was right in waiting for the sake of my illustrious ancestor i treasure it but much has hap pened in the last few days i do not care to have it in my house any longer my brothers son in tekrit will take it i could think of no appropriate com ment here is the piece which was ex changed for the thronerug take it with you when you leave and return it to its owner which was also fair enough though revell deserved no such fortune after his shabby trick the loss might be a lesson to him may i ask you to be so kind as to lift the cover of the jar of attar requested bin ayyub as he set aside his empty cup i could see that he was momentarily becoming paler there was not a drop of blood beneath his bronzed skin the corners of his mouth and the muscles of his cheeks twitched perceptibly so that his request did not seem at all out of order though if i myself felt as he looked the last thing in the world id want would be a whiff of that overpower ing perfume certainly i replied poor devil he seemed to be having a chill shivering noticeably no wonder he wanted me to take saouds place in the ritual of the perfume jar as i advanced across the wondrously carpeted floor i heard him mutter to himself one is at times hasty i parted the curtains that veiled the great urn of byzantine glass and lifted the heavy cover then dizzied by the overwhelming surge of sweetness re coiled a pace and then i dropped the cover christ in heaven but why deny my own eyes in the throbbing glowing rosy amber jar was the shapely form of djénane hanoum faintly distorted by the refraction of the curved surfaces of the urn and the attar but nevertheless and beyond any mistake that was the gurjestani girl i stared fascinated then looked behind the jar hoping ridicu lous hope to find that she was stand ing on the other side and that i had seen her through and not in the urn it is strange how in such a moment one notices trifles la illah ilia allah wa muhammad rasul allahi came the murmuring ac cents of bin ayyub very low but distinct even in the grip of that horribly lovely sight i had distinctly caught the mos lems there is no god but allah and then scarcely perceptible djén ane my movements must have been those of a mechanical toy as i caught the curtains on the hilts of the simitars hanging at each side of the alcove i noted that the fine hardwoven cord of silk was missing and then i found myself wondering what poison the blue cup of mourning had contained not until fully a minute later did it dawn on me why bin ayyubs eyes had flamed with immeasurable despair when i had reminded him that since i had re turned the thronerug of saladin he had weird tales no cause to concern himself about the thief that awful sweetness was rolling from the uncovered jar strangling me with its richness i wondered how a girl in the heart of an ocean of perfume could en dure its fragrance and whether the silken cord was chafing her throat bin ayyubs drawn features were now overlaid with a shadow of a smile if it were given me to elect the man ner of my death i would choose to be drowned in that perfume he had once said so instead of covering the jar i left ilderim shirkuh bin ayyub en throned on the rug of saladin and facing the loveliness which he had imprisoned in attar revell was still frothing when i re turned and tossed his anatolian silk rug on the floor id have committed

weird tales like but i donr expect the authors to please everyone the loss of howard and love craft is irreparable to my mind how ard was tops and i hope you will honor mr robert j hoyers request for reprints or a book of mr howards stories especially the conan series i also propose that one of your other authors study mr howards style and characters and continue the conan series i dont think any howard fan would be too harsh with criticism after all conan was a strong character and many weaker ones have outlived their creators so lets make conan a monument to his creator lets hear what some of the others think of this proposal as to quinn let me say i heartily disagree with marian shortess i think roads was a truly wonderful story i read it to my children and i am sure it was more acceptable than the ageworn lies told to children down through the centuries i would like to suggest that our friend marian look up the real history of our socalled christian holidays then she will find that mr quinn really knew whereof he spoke as to mentioning christ and the virgin mary in a magazine filled with witchcraft ghosts werewolves and vampires etc i would suggest that she borrow someones holy bible and read it but i am afraid that if she did she might like the horrible and gruesome as well as the witchcraft stories contained therein so well she would forget to buy the next issue sorry to deny your request for some other author to carry on the conan stories of the late robert e how ard his work was touched with genius and he had a distinctive style of writing that put the stamp of his personality on every story he wrote it would hardly be fair to his memory if we allowed conan to be re created by another hand no matter how skil fullythe editor a lone cry donald v allgeier writes from licking missouri congratulations on the fine may issue i give first place to dreadful sleep williamson has done it again i agree with those who compare his style to mer ritts they are similar but williamson is a splendid author in his own right this seems to me to be as great a story as the now al most legendary golden blood pigeons from hell gets my vote for second place it cer tainly makes one long for howard to be back again theres a story that really caused the goosepimples horrible and frightening are the wordsa real weird tale perhaps its my preference for serials but even without that thunder in the dawn would rank high i rate it third it has all the elements of a true weird talemystery black magic fan tastic settingplus action that makes it comparable to the conan saga congratula tions to kuttner a writer who has certainly developed recently im sorry this story is only in two parts quinns latest yarn is so close behind that its practically a tie goet terdaemmerung struck me as an experimental type of storyto test readers reactions personally i prefer a story that i can under stand but as usual quinn delivers a fine job of writing the secret of the vault was quite good i wonder if the style reminded others of poe it seemed to me quite like some of e as masterpieces hamiltons latest is little but a clever idea but is worth reading the reprint was fair but the writ ing seemed strained why wait so long to reprint early stories by howard the eyrie is demanding them in recent issues i particularly liked the house of ecstasy with farleys abductor minimi digit and vallisneria madness it completes a trilogy of delightfully unique short tales i voice a lone cry for less lurid covers reprint from old issues edith mulder writes from lindenhurst long island i like the new serial dread ful sleep immensely im eagerly awaiting the finish i wish you would reprint stories in wt that other readers keep talking about like shambleau once in a thousand years and oh so many others that readers write about they make me long so for all the wts that were ever printed so i could read them all couldnt you reprint serials that were acclaimed also i agree with others that say they would rather have a serial reprint than a lot of new stories where once poe walked t gelbert writes from niagara falls new york features of the april issue are the temple dancer the garden of adompha and the very charming hawthorne tale feathertop mediocre and very much so are dreadful sleep and forest of evil i am glad to see seabury quinns tales featur ing others besides jules de grandin and the weird tales stupid trowbridge in the may issue thunder in the dawn pigeons from hell and the secret of the vault in the order named pleased yours truly best honorable mention goes to the poem where once poe walked in closing i will say that anyone who derides poe and his work is not and cannot possibly be a lover of weird tales as exemplified by lovecraft c a smith kuttner and others in our own unique magazine the easter island images john h green writes from washington d c no use to tell you how much i enjoy wt because if i didnt i wouldnt read it and keep on reading it roads by seabury quinn was about the only story i ever read three times and probably will read it again current novel by jack wil liamson is great the eyrie is as interesting as the stories might add to e hoffmann prices statement concerning the stanzas of dzyan that there and there only is the ex planation of the easter island images pride of place francis g howes writes from rugby england i am writing to congratulate you on wt there is nothing like them in england and they are the only stories that i get a real kick from i am a research worker and a folklore expert who possesses a re markable library dealing with the occult and the weird but in the fiction line your maga zines take pride of place i put some of your stories especially those not overburdened with a superfluity of adjectives on a par with those of bram stoker m r james and algernon blackwood i have trav eled through middle europe collecting folk lore and legends and i was astounded at the amount of superstition and credence in the supernatural which abounds among quite civilized people there are grounds for these beliefs as i have discovered especially in the carpathians and the black forest but to all but my most intimate friends i have re mained silent for fear of ridicule i can as sure your readers that some of your mag nificent yarns touch alarmingly near to the truth i was grieved at

ohio pigeons from hell was just too scary and me alone in a big house when i read it and it raining too i walked every stair with griswell and all night i heard steps in the hall and on the stairsme that is not afraid of anything or i always said i wasnt but i should have read it on a bright sunshiny day virgils drawing for it those three awful things hanging and that awful old crone sitting there breathing evil as old as the world i wonder what a person would do if confronted with some thing like that ill tell the world i wouldnt ever go back in that house but men are supposed to have more courage than we weaker females ha while i think of it i must not forget roads ah quinn you have indeed given us a masterpiece that was the loveliest thing i ever read thats all i can say imagine some people saying it shouldnt have been in weird tales one is so fortunate to be able to read that story anywhere any place it in a way reminds me of child of the windsit had that same tender love and genius a man only writes one such story in his life and quinn bless your heart you gave us roads but then he always has been my favorite may he live for everwell anyway as long as i do a gifted writer hazel portelli writes from detroit this present issue of weird tales is up to its usual standard which is the peak of per fection so long as seabury quinn is a regu lar contributor i will keep on reading and his story the temple dancer is grand the devil deals by carl jacobi is unique and almost possible however the story that re mained in my mind is roads by seabury quinn in the january issue my sincerest congratulations and thanks to that gifted writer really swell clifton hall writes from los angeles congratulations on the best number since december the april wt was really swell in an issue like this one its always difficult to pick the best stories but after some re flection ill select the second installment of that magnificent serial by jack williamson dreadful sleep its totally different from anything i recall having read before in our magazine it takes a master to make the dreary icewastes of the south pole seem weird next comes forest of evil by john murray reynolds who should be heard from more often although not so weird as some others this was an enthralling adven ture yarn blochs the eyes of the mummy is third best bloch combines something of lovecrafts studied horror with a touch of color that h p did not possess these three lead the pack but the garden of adompha the temple dancer the house of ecstasy and feathertop arent far behind the last mentioned by hawthorne was so fine that i am prompted to suggest that we have more reprints from sources other than old copies of weird tales there are many short classics that could be printed a reader in france juanita lawrence writes from paris i have been a reader of weird tales for the last three years and often i have wanted to write a letter but somehow i never did but now after a three months stay in egypt where i couldnt get wt i just feel like telling you how much i like your magazine which is really unique as they say over here in france and now for some personal opinions i like seabury quinn and henry kuttner best of all your authors and im mediately next robert bloch but please dont give too many serials they always make me feel a bit irritated just when i am dying to know whats going to happen i have to wait another month also i would like to see some more werewolf and vampire stories almost all my american friends here read wt since i found it and do they love it please reprint some more poems by the late master h p lovecraft about reprints norman w siringer writes from lake wood ohio the may issue of wt is certainly the best issue so far this year with the first installment of henry kuttners thunder in the dawn topping the issue this may be sacrilege but the first half of the elak of atlantis novelette tops all of the conan stories and i was a rabid conan fan thunder in the dawn can be favorably weird tales compared with merritts works by all means h k write more about elak and his friends in an ordinary issue jack wil liamsons great novel would easily have taken first place but dreadful sleep wil liamsons best since golden blood must be content with second goetterdaemmerung seabury quinns novelette took third place the rest of the stories were all good i dont like short shortstories and i serious ly condemn you for reprinting the classics short shortstories are nearly always based on the ghost or spirit entity plot and they are usually very poorly developed my main objection to stories by hawthorne or poe being used is that nearly everyone has read them before i might add that there are scores of good stories from old issues of wt that are now eligible for reprinting bimini the skeleton under the lamp the copper bowl the cult of the skull the tinkle of the camels bell the silver key etc weird tales is showing constant improve ment keep it up jamup h sivia writes from palestine texas thanks for a swell may issue everything in it is jamup only one complaint the lack of shortshorts we must have variety you know my vote for first place is split between quinns goetterdaemmerung and hamiltons the isle of the sleeper especial ly do i like the idea back of the latter al ways glad to see one of howards yams in print the background for his piny woods stories is always authentic finlays illustrations henry kuttner writes from beverly hills california virgil finlays greasepencil work in the current wt is as excellent as his penandink sketches and seems to re produce somewhat better on pulp paper i was particularly struck in the april issue with starretts cordelias song which suc ceeded admirably in capturing the outré in sane horror of the king in yellow why not reprint that classic yarn and chambers even more ghastly the yellow sign clark ashton smiths tale the garden of adom pha was swell and virgils

standard of beauty among the natives of brittany is high indeed but in the girl who stood before me the very pinnacle of flawless perfection seemed to have been reached her featuresbut how can i describe that which transcends all description mere words seem futile and meaningless when applied to that radiant creature who con fronted us out of the mystery of the night her loveliness seemed more than human and most assuredly none of it was due to the art which conceals art in the esti mation of the feminine mind her dark hair waved in a profuse disorder of natural curls over her brow and neck her smooth skin was deeply tanned by exposure to the wind and sun her cheap cotton frock would have seemed but a mere rag but for the superb lines of the figure beneath her shapely legs were bare to the knees her feet innocent of even the wooden sabots which the poorest of peasants usually wear she seemed more like some dryad of the woods than a mundane peasantgirl for some reasonpossibly it
