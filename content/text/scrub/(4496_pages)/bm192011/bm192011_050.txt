the georgetown mystery yes plain too plain jim to bear out what youre hinting at thats my idea why i know her as i know ev ery one else in the county perhaps a little better than some and i know she has been very dutiful her nature to be so its rather ridiculous dorgan to jump at conclusions like that pre posterous a church worker the as sociated charities of the village the personification of kindness no jim it could not be but you do not intend to take it for granted do you bill youre surely going to investigate her thoroughly if i may offer a suggestion id keep the coroners verdict open for a while and and put her through a severe exami nation thornton thrummed his desk with a letter opener his face flushed look here jim he said shaking the instrument at dorgan with the man ner he might use in addressing a jury ive a little sense of human nature as well as you you have worked among people where that sort of thing exists it does not exist in this county it does not i tell you well thats the chivalrous way of looking at it ive got some sense of human na ture as i said thornton continued his eyes narrowing and i insist that i know an honest and decent woman when i see one i did not indicate it today but i have known helen lewis for a great many years we once went to school together down in the country before i met you that girl was whole some a romping opensouled sort of person that woman is wholesome and decent today but bill it is the wholesome wo man that often turns out to be the most unwholesome shes forced to it the lack of attention drives her to seek at tention havent i seen it proven scores of times i wasnt born yesterday there was a recalcitrant note in his voice yes thats the fine professional way of looking at it but its the brutal cold way too why dorgan id as soon cut off that little finger as to con sider such a thing seriously what do we know to indicate such an amour as you insinuate getting down to brass tacks what evidence have we got that such an affair ever existed none absolutely none they were never seen together and harley very very seldom was at the lewis home jacobsen told me privately he knew that neither had been farther away from georgetown than rockland within the year why man theres not a scintilla of fact to back you up dorgan laughed softly very well my dear sir thornton flung at him but perhaps you can ex plain the disappearance of the money on your hypothesis possibly the five thousand had an affinity oh i wont quarrel about it bill of course i cannot explain at this stage how the money disappeared but somebody who had a key to the bank and knew the safe combination must have got it thats almost a foregone conclusion yes but where did it go three persons had keys to the bankharley jacobsen and lewis i think you will agree with me that jacobsen may al most be eliminated from suspicion however i intend to have accountants go over the books and affairs of the bank generally just before you came in tonight i had the bank at winton on the phyie to see if i could find any clew to lewis taking the money there but there was none it was some real estate business that took him to win ton i learned and there was no money passed that brings us down to har ley if he stole the money what did he do with it it was not at the house
