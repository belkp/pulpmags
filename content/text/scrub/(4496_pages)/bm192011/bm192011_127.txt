 the mystery of the marseilles express that point so of the three confession aires it seemed most likely that mon sieur bertal was the guilty party the chemist nodded dully as a matter of fact bailey con tinued he had no more to do with sheppards death than the other two he declared that he had committed the crime while the marseilles express halted in the freight yard beyond lyons as a matter of fact the train did not stop there was a clear track and the express maintained a speed of thirty miles an hour through the yards hence it was impossible for bertal to have done as he claimed besides monsieur bertal did not leave his hotel in lyons until after the express had passed i learned from his housekeep er the hotel he usually stayed at in that city and found that he was aroused at five oclock in the morning had break fast and left at six that i think eliminates him then who in the name of heaven burst out the puzzled goulet killed john sheppard that will come out presently said bailey just now i have a surprise for you he flung open the door and beau nash his eyes wide and staring not a fleck of color in his face came in theres no use stalling he panted she didnt kill him i iwhy i killed johnny sheppard myself bill bailey laughed that confession is the finest thing you ever did beauthe only clean honest thing in your whole black rec ord but it wont wash you didnt kill johnny sheppard any more than i did myself vi the beaus thin lips twitched like a snarling dogs damn you he shout ed i tell you i did youre not go ing to railroad her to the guillotine of course not soothed bailey im not in the habit of railroading people i know you fairly well nash and i thought that telegram would do the trickyou see folks i sent a wire signed by one of the beaus apache friends telling him that his sweetheart mazie lee had been arrested for this murder and that she would be rail roaded as a matter of fact miss lee is already on her way to england nash grated his teeth you devil it wont do any good to indulge in personalities i know who the mur derer is and ill produce him very shortly before i do i want to clear up all the threads i suppose everyone knows that the beau is a member of a most respected family in sussex eng land he organized the london bank gang and later operated extensively in the united states sheppard his cousin was also a member of that gang now i want you denise to tell me why you helped him and why you confessed to sheppards murder the girl looked at nash paled and then said bravely i was afraid that my father had killed him as he had often threatened to do and i wanted to protect him your father said bailey question ingly denise made a gesture toward mon sieur robert the blind man nash and sheppard had my father in their power i aided them whenever they demanded it to save him they treated me brutally at times but i nev er dared resent it when sheppard was killed i believed that father did it the thought was natural for he was on his way to marseilles with nashs cousin and it could have been done while sheppard slept but father be lieved that i had slipped in and killed the fellow so he confessed to save me
