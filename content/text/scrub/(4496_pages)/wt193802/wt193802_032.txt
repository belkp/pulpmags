the diary of alonzo typer avoid hallucinations of changing expres sion but that to which i turned was even worse the long dour face small close ly set eyes and swinelike features iden tified it at once even though the artist had striven to make the snout look as human as possible this was what v had whispered about as i stared in horror i thought the eyes took on a reddish glow and for a moment the background seemed replaced by an alien and seemingly irrelevant scenea lone bleak moor beneath a dirty yellow sky whereon grew a wretchedlooking blackthorn bush fearing for my sanity i rushed from that accursed gallery to the dustcleared corner upstairs where i have my camp later decided to explore some of the laby rinthine wings of the house by day light i cannot get lost for my foot prints are distinct in the ankledeep dust and i can trace other identifying marks when necessary it is curious how easily i learn the intricate windings of the cor ridors followed a long outflung north erly ell to its extremity and came to a locked door which i forced beyond was a very small room quite crowded with furniture and with the paneling badly wormeaten on the outer wall i spied a black space behind the rotting woodwork and discovered a narrow secret passage leading downward to un known inky depths it was a steeply in clined chute or tunnel without steps or handholds and i wondered what its use could have been above the fireplace was a moldy paint ing which i found on close inspection to be that of a young woman in the dress of the late eighteenth century the face is of classic beauty yet with the most fiendishly evil expression which i have ever known the human countenance to bear not merely callousness greed and cruelty but some quality hideous beyond human comprehension seems to sit upon those finely carved features and as i looked it seemed to me that the artist or the slow processes of mold and decay had imparted to that pallid complexion a sickly greenish cast and the least sug gestion of an almost imperceptibly scaly texture later i ascended to the attic where i found several chests of strange booksmany of utterly alien aspects in letters and in physical form alike one contained variants of the aklo formulas which i had never known to exist i have not yet examined the books on the dusty shelves downstairs april there are certainly unseen presences here even though the dust bears no footprints but my own cut a path through the briars yesterday to the park gate where my supplies are left but this morning i found it closed very odd since the bushes are barely stirring with spring sap again i have that feeling of something at hand so colossal that the chambers can scarcely contain it this time i feel that more than one of the presences is of such a size and i know now that the third aklo ritualwhich i found in that book in the attic yesterday would make such beings solid and vis ible whether i shall dare to try this materialization remains to be seen the perils are great last night i began to glimpse evanes cent shadowfaces and forms in the dim corners of the halls and chambersfaces and forms so hideous and loathsome that i dare not describe them they seem al lied in substance to that titanic paw which tried to push me down the stairs night
