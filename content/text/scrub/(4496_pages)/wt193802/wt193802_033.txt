 weird tales before last and must of course be phan toms of my disturbed imagination what i am seeking would not be quite like these things i have seen the paw again sometimes alone and sometimes with its mate but i have resolved to ignore all such phenomena early this afternoon i explored the cel lar for the first time descending by a ladder found in a storeroom since the wooden steps had rotted away the whole place is a mass of nitrous encrustations with amorphous mounds marking the spots where various objects have disinte grated at the farther end is a narrow passage which seems to extend under the northerly ell where i found the little locked room and at the end of this is a heavy brick wall with a locked iron door apparently belonging to a vault of some sort this wall and door bear evidences of eighteenth century workmanship and must be contemporary with the oldest additions to the houseclearly prerevo lutionary on the lock which is obvious ly older than the rest of the ironwork are engraved certain symbols which i cannot decipher v had not told me about this vault it fills me with a greater disquiet than anything else i have seen for every time i approach it i have an almost ir resistible impulse to listen for something hitherto no untoward sounds have marked my stay in this malign place as i left the cellar i wished devoutly that the steps were still there for my progress up the ladder seemed maddeningly slow i do not want to go down there again and yet some evil genius urges me to try it at night if i would learn what is to be learned april i have sounded the depths of horror only to be made aware of still lower depths last night the temptation was too strong and in the black small hours i descended once more into that nitrous hellish cellar with my flashlight tiptoeing among the amorphous heaps to that ter rible brick wall and locked door i made no sound and refrained from whispering any of the incantations i knew but i lis tened with mad intentness at last i heard the sounds from be yond those barred plates of sheet iron the menacing padding and muttering as of gigantic nightthings within then too there was a damnable slithering as of a vast serpent or seabeast dragging its monstrous folds over a paved floor nearly paralyzed with fright i glanced at the huge rusty lock and at the alien cryptic hieroglyphs graven upon it they were signs i could not recognize and something in their vaguely mongoloid technique hinted at a blasphemous and indescribable antiquity at times i fan cied i could see them glowing with a greenish light i turned to flee but found that vision of the titan paws before me the great talons seeming to swell and become more tangible as i gazed out of the cellars evil blackness they stretched with shad owy hints of scaly wrists beyond them and with a waxing malignant will guid ing their horrible gropings then i heard from behind mewithin that abominable vaulta fresh burst of muffled rever berations which seemed to echo from far horizons like distant thunder impelled by this greater fear i advanced toward the shadowy paws with my flashlight and saw them vanish before the full force of the electric beam then up the ladder i raced torch between my teeth nor did i rest till i had regained my upstairs camp what is to be my ultimate end i dare not imagine i came as a seeker but now i know that something is seeking me i
