the piper from bhutan old piper to the home of a radio imper sonator who had known the late richford mason professor du bois planned every thing he spoke to the radio artist with the latter imitating richford masons voice while the bhutanese played away on his pipe and lieutenant crane and i worked with a phonographic machine making records the piper took it all deadly seriously though he kept jabbering in his tibetan or chinese dialect asking im sure where the dead body was his music wellyou cant hear it now for which im terribly sorrybut what music it wailed seemed to be talking plead ing in a weird melancholy voice that somehow seemed to beat right through you no melody as we know the term just a haunting lilting strain like noth ing ive ever heard beforeor hope again to hear at professor du bois direction we made two excellent recordings and in a few hours everything was ready in a secluded house at the end of town the accused rumster was made the sub ject of the experiment we had the corpse of richford mason in one room in another the bhutanese piper in the room where the lieutenant the professor and i sat with rumster were the two records one was on a phonograph on the table the other was on a phonograph hidden behind the sofa this hidden machine had a catch protruding just a sixteenth of an inch from the corner of the rug a tug with your shoetip would set off the record well first lieutenant crane gave rumster the third degree but no use he looked guilty his voice sounded guilty and his story had a few frayed edges but he denied the crime while admitting he had the best motive for it then professor du bois introduced to the accused as a friend of the late rich ford mason went to work it made me laugh sardonically to hear the professor build up a case for the subtle revivifying effects of music that is the vibrations we call music in his book backgrounds of psychol ogy professor du bois calls the ancients misguided and misguiding interpreters of natural phenomena with no just claim whatsoever to science but to rumster he said the wise men of the ancient world asclepiades and pythagoras taught and demonstrated the profound effect of mu sic upon the body the sages of egypt indeed went so far as to bring life to the dead so it is reliably reported he went on and on citing the reports of travelers in the orient and after that sank in he mentioned the bhutanese piper one wise old man who has astound ed observers by his ability to infuse life into the recently dead with the magical music of his pipe lias been brought to this country and he showed rumster dippings from the sensational press which of course had been inspired by the unscientific experiments of the mystic society well as the professor kept on rum ster scoffed but he was getting uneasy perspiring wondering then professor du bois said last night after hearing of the marvelous success of this piper from bhutan we brought him to the bier of richford masonto try him out and it worked lieutenant crane cut in it worked rumster yelled and lieu tenant crane growled yeah thats what i said and we got his word that you did it murdered him while rumster chafed and squirmed
