from beyond you see them you see them you see the things that float and flop about you and through you every moment of your life you see the creatures that form what men call the pure air and the blue sky have i not succeeded in break ing down the barrier have i not shown you worlds that no other living men have seen i heard his scream through the horrible chaos and looked at the wild face thrust so offensively close to mine his eyes were pits of flame and they glared at me with what i now saw was overwhelming hatred the machine droned detestably you think those floundering things wiped out the servants fool they are harmless but the servants are gone arent they you tried to stop me you discouraged me when i needed every drop of encouragement i could get you were afraid of the cosmic truth you damned coward but now ive got you what swept up the servants what made them scream so loud dont know eh youll know soon enough look at me listen to what i saydo you suppose there are really any such things as time and magnitude do you fancy there are such things as form or matter i tell you i have struck depths that your little brain cant picture i have seen beyond the bounds of infinity and drawn down de mons from the stars i have har nessed the shadows that stride from world to world to sow death and madness space belongs to me do you hear things are hunting me nowthe things that de vour and dissolvebut i know how to elude them it is you they will get as they got the servants stirring dear sir i told you it was dangerous to move i have saved you so far by telling you to keep stillsaved you to see more sights and to listen to me if you had moved they would have been at you long ago dont worry they wont hurt you they didnt hurt the servants it was the seeing that made the poor devils scream so my pets are not pretty for they come out of places where esthetic standards arevery different disintegra tion is quite painless i assure youbut i want you to see them i almost saw them but i knew how to stop you are not curious i always knew you were no scientist trembling eh trembling with anxiety to see the ulti mate things i have discovered why dont you move then tired well dont worry my friend for they are coming look look curse you look its just over your left shoulder what remains to be told is very brief and may be familiar to you from the newspaper accounts the police heard a shot in the old tillinghast house and found us theretillinghast dead and me unconscious they arrested me because the revolver was in my hand but released me in three hours after they found that it was apoplexy which had fin ished tillinghast and saw that my shot had been directed at the noxious machine which now lay hopelessly shattered on the laboratory floor i did not tell very much of what i had seen for i feared the coroner would be skeptical but from the evasive outline i did give the doctor told me that i had undoubtedly been hypno tized by the vindictive and homicidal madman i wish i could believe that doctor it would help my shaky nerves if i could dismiss what i now have to think of the air and the sky about and above me i never feel alone or comfortable and a hideous sense of pursuit sometimes comes chillingly on me when i am weary what prevents me from believing the doctor is this one simple factthat the police never found the bodies of those servants whom they say crawford tillinghast murdered
