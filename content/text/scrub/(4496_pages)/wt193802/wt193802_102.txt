from beyond by h p lovecraft if tillinghast was really a madman then what became of the bodies of the servants whom the police said he had murdered horrible beyond conception was the change which had taken place in my best friend crawford tillinghast i had not seen him since that day two months and a half before when he had told me toward what goal his physical and metaphysical researches were leading when he had answered my awed and almost frightened remon strances by driving me from his labora tory and his house in a burst of fanatical rage i had known that he now remained mostly shut in the attic laboratory with that accursed electrical machine eating little and excluding even the servants but i had not thought that a brief period of ten weeks could so alter and disfigure any human creature it is not pleasant to see a stout man suddenly grown thin and it is even worse when the baggy skin be comes yellowed or grayed the eyes sunk en circled and uncannily glowing the forehead veined and corrugated and the hands tremulous and twitching and if added to this there be a repellent un kemptness a wild disorder of dress a bushiness of dark hair white at the roots and an unchecked growth of white beard on a face once cleanshaven the cumula tive effect is quite shocking but such was the aspect of crawford tillinghast on the night his halfcoherent message brought me to his door after my weeks of exile such was the specter that trem bled as it admitted me candle in hand and glanced furtively over its shoulder as if fearful of unseen things in the ancient lonely house set back from benevolent street that crawford tillinghast should ever have studied science and philosophy was a mistake these things should be left to the frigid and impersonal investigator for they offer two equally tragic alterna tives to the man of feeling and action despair if he fail in his quest and ter rors unutterable and unimaginable if he succeed tillinghast had once been the prey of failure solitary and melancholy but now i knew with nauseating fears of my own that he was the prey of suc cess i had indeed warned him ten weeks before when he burst forth with his tale of what he felt himself about to discover he had been flushed and ex cited then talking in a high and un natural though always pedantic voice what do we know he had said of the world and the universe about us our means of receiving impressions are ab surdly few and our notions of surround ing objects infinitely narrow we see things only as we are constructed to see them and can gain no idea of their abso lute nature with five feeble senses we pretend to comprehend the boundlessly complex cosmos yet other beings wth a wider stronger or different range of senses might not only see very differently the things we see but might see and study whole worlds of matter energy and life which lie close at hand yet can never be detected with the senses we have i have always believed that such strange inaccessible worlds exist at our very elbows and now i believe i have found a way to break down the barriers i am not joking within twentyfour
