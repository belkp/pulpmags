 weird tales lee i had received iversens warning less than an hour before i had been sitting out here on the gallery until oclock or so i was in that very chair you are occupying iver sen had been having a heart attack i had been to see him that afternoon he looked just as he always did when he was recovering from an attack in fact he in tended to return to his office the follow ing morning neither of us i am sure had given a thought to the possibility of a sudden sinking spell we had not even referred to our agreement well it was about as ive said when all of a sudden i heard iversen com ing along through the yard below there toward the house along that gravel path he had apparently come through the gate from the kongensgadethe king street as they call it nowadaysand i could hear his heavy step on the gravel very plainly he had a slight limp heavycrunchlightcrunch heavy crunchlightcrunch plodplodplod plod old iversen to the life there was no mistaking his step there was no moon that night the half of a waning moon was due to show itself an hour and a half later but just then it was virtually pitch black down there in the garden i got up out of my chair and walked over to the top of the steps to tell you the truth mr lee i rather suspectedi have a kind of aptitude for that sort of thingthat it was not iversen himself how shall i express it i had the idea from somewhere inside me that it was iversen trying to keep our agreement my instinct assured me that he had just died i can not tell you how i knew it but such was the case mr lee so i waited over there just behind you at the top of the steps the footfalls came along steadily at the foot of the steps out of the shadow of the hibiscus bushes it was a trifle less black than far ther down the path there was a faint illumination too from a lamp inside the house i knew that if it were iversen himself i should be able to see him when the footsteps passed out of the deep shad ow of the bushes i did not speak the footfalls came along toward that point and passed it i strained my eyes through the gloom and i could see noth ing then i knew mr lee that iversen had died and that he was keeping his agreement i came back here and sat down in my chair and waited the footfalls began to come up the steps they came along the floor of the gallery straight toward me they stopped here mr lee just beside me i could feel iversen standing here mr lee mr da silva pointed to the floor with his slim rather elegant hand suddenly in the dead quiet i could feel my hair stand up all over my scalp straight and stiff the chills started to run down my back and up again mr lee i shook like a man with the ague sitting here in my chair i said iversen i understand iver sen im afraid my teeth were chatter ing like castanets mr lee i said iver sen please go you have kept the agree ment i am sorry i am afraid iversen the flesh is weak i am not afraid of you iversen old friend but you will understand man its not ordinary fear my intellect is all right iversen but im badly panicstricken so please go my friend there had been silence mr lee as i said before i began to speak to iversen for the footsteps had stopped here beside me but when i said that and asked my friend to go i could feel that he went at once and i knew that he had understood how i meant it it was suddenly mr lee as though there had never been any footsteps if you see what i mean it is
