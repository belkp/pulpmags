 weird tales of clothes around the house mrs updikes clothes were close to the front hall switch thats how i know she did it it got them all but so long as we dont move were fairly safe remember were deal ing with a hideous world in which we are practically helpless keep still the combined shock of the revelation and of the abrupt command gave me a kind of paralysis and in my terror my mind again opened to the impressions coming from what tillinghast called beyond was now in a vortex of sound and motion with confused pic tures before my eyes i saw the blurred outlines of the room but from some point in space there seemed to be pouring a seething column of unrecognizable shapes or clouds penetrating the solid roof at a point ahead and to the right of me then i glimpsed the templelike effect again but this time the pillars readied up into an aerial ocean of light which sent down one blinding beam along the path of the cloudy column i had seen before after that the scene was almost wholly kaleidoscopic and in the jumble of sights sounds and unidentified senseim pressions i felt that i was about to dis solve or in some way lose the solid form one definite flash i shall always remem ber i seemed for an instant to behold a patch of strange night sky filled with shining revolving spheres and as it re ceded i saw that the glowing suns formed a constellation or galaxy of settled shape this shape being the distorted face of crawford tillinghast at another time i felt huge animate things brushing past me and occasionally walking or drifting through my supposedly solid body and thought i saw tillinghast look at them as though his bettertrained senses could catch them visually i recalled what he had said of the pineal gland and won dered what he saw with this preternatural eye suddenly i myself became possessed of a kind of augmented sight over and above the luminous and shadowy chaos arose a picture which though vague held the elements of consistency and perma nence it was indeed somewhat familiar for the unusual part was superimposed upon the usual terrestrial scene much as a cinema view may be thrown upon the painted curtain of a theater i saw the attic laboratory the electrical machine and the unsightly form of tillinghast op posite me but of all the space unoccupied by familiar objects not one particle was vacant indescribable shapes both alive and otherwise were mixed in disgusting disarray and close to every known thing were whole worlds of alien unknown en tities it likewise seemed that all the known things entered into the composi tion of other unknown things and vice versa foremost among the living objects were inky jellyish monstrosities which flabbily quivered in harmony with the vibrations from the machine they were present in loathsome profusion and i saw to my horror that they overlapped that they were semifluid and capable of passing through one another and through what we know as solids these things were never still but seemed ever floating about with some malignant purpose sometimes they appeared to devour one another the attacker launching itself at its victim and instantaneously obliterating the latter from sight shudderingly i felt that i knew what had obliterated the un fortunate servants and could not exclude the things from my mind as i strove to observe other properties of the newly visible world that lies unseen around us but tillinghast had been watching me and was speaking
