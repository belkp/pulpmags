 illusions them within a week after i took him to her blue and silver room that looked out on the planetrees twelve yearsi could understand how terrible they must seem to marcia against the boys vivid youth how deadly they were to her now that she had become conscious of time there had been moments when i had envied her the two years that lay between my age and hers marcia playre to whom time had been no more than a fourth dimension to whom the years were friends whose passing left softly blessed memories and no regrets marcia facing at last the bitter lesson of ageat sixandthirty how she would hate them those months that had tricked her into thinking them her friends as little by little they carried youth from her yet she saw the truth clearly enough from cressons vivid recitals of the ar guments he marshaled against her i could reconstruct her thought he did not violate her confidence but he told me without knowing it just how she opposed him i knew her so well you see yes i was glad that she was old it had been hard enough to face the truth that she would never care for me except with the placid dilute friendliness that tortured while it fascinated me now to find her wakened by this boy respond ing to the pagan youth and fire of him as if she had been a woman of his own crude epochit was enough to make me fiercely glad that she saw that barrier for what it was and would not yield youth turns to youth she knew of course she knew the years that waited for her were the blood less ones the evil days of the psalmist she had learned at last of the bitterness which takes no pleasure in the morning and sees only the foreshadow of death in the dusk and the years that lay before cressonah the years that leap and pulse and laugh in a world of youth and love marcia knew the everwiden ing gulf between her tomorrows and those of the boy who loved her i think that she always knew what the end must be that cressons blazing eloquence never convinced her something she said to me before the shadow came told me the truth of that happiness isnt it only a reflection after all is there a positive happiness jim i think its only what one sees in the eyes of somebody one loves i knew then what she meant she married cresson not because she hoped to trick the years but because she saw that in making him a god in his own be lief she would know happiness by the divine indirection of her service she married him as a girl would have mar ried him flinging away her fears and her doubts plunging recklessly into his madness giving him fire for fire song for song laugh for laugh she made herspelf his mate in youth in the magni ficent folly of it the glow and blaze and glad abandon of it i watched her mar veling she turned her back on the sunset and on me and raced back toward the morning laughing sped back to where cresson waited for her i found some plausible excuse for being far away when they were married in my selfcentred blindness i thought that she would mark my absence and guess its reason i reproached myself for risking a shadow on her day later i laughed as an old wise man laughs at his boys importance marcia would not have seen me on that day if i had cut my throat before her in the very aisle she had found the way back to that cruel eden of youth the mystery that makes a solitude for two in the midst of many the paradise that is more a paradise because the whole world is relentlessly shut out if it i found out long afterward that she believed i had stood among the guests and seen her marry cresson i watched them both somehow now that the thing was done i lost my bitter ness i wanted marcia to win her game
