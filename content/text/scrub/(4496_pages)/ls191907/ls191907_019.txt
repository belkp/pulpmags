 the harbor put there by pain and sorrow notice ably also there was a certain look of desperation she was tall magnificently tall with a white throat and a shielding depth of breast her clear gray eyes were shaded by dusty golden lashes and her brows curved away like slender wings her cheeks gleamed with the cold air and her drooping discouraged mouth was surprisingly crimson low on her neck was a great twist of pale hair dead and lifelessthe color of wet haystacks the woman led the cow along the path way pausing at a gate which sagged be tween mossmarked gate posts chains gave forth a rusty jangle of welcome and the gate swung crookedly open be tween gnarled windbent trees a path way of ancient clamshells led away to a gaunt house the girl paused before the rickety steps straightened the wreath about the cows neck a shadow of joy slowly lifting some of the discourage ment from her face and called softly her voice breaking the silent morning air into a thousand echoic halloos a red door startling against the white ness of the house like a seal on an old letter opened and two figures appeared two tiny bent creatures with shawls over their heads like fairytale witches came creeping out clinging to the porch railings for support their sunken eyes fixed in amazement on the girl and the cow but karen the cowand milk for winter and milk for summer and but ter one of them croaked dropping her shawl and showing her ageworn work bent figure karenthe money in the box her voice was raised suspicious ly and her faded eyes gleamed with anger oh no no auntie i did not touch the funeral money you can have the tall plum cakes as you always planned and all the trimmings on your coffin too i earned the extra money for the cow last month when i was up at oysterville taking care of captain swensons wife dont you rememberi told you about the wife of the man who had the clam factory up there she had a baby too and the doctor got caught by the tide at hugthe coast point and did not get there and i did everything for her her husband was frightened it was their first baby and he paid me welland we have the cow karen talked as if it were hard to make the old women understand her sentences were stilted and her voice pitched high it always wearied her to try to explain things to them she paused and then added like an indulgent mother mrs davis did the cow up in the wreath she said that when people are as old as you are it is time to have fes tivities upon their birthdays she named the cow ârosebud karen laughed and jerked the wreath into place again once mrs davis wore those flowers at a grand partyonce when she was young and rich the girl added softly it seemed very wonderful to her that one could part with anything that had meant joy and happiness karen karen but you are good the girls mother croaked karen my one good child she pronounced the name gently making the letters form a single syllable but putting any amount of affection into the word the two old women crept along the broken steps coming nearer to pat the nose of the cow to caress the velvet flowers to pinch off evergreen needles and chew them between mumbling lips glancing up every few seconds to smile at the girl to blink kindly and content edly at her through the strong morning light which showed thousands of tiny crisscrosses on their leathery skinsand revealed the animallike sadness of their shifting rheumy eyes go back into the house now little women and cuddle down by the fire karen will take rosebud over and milk her and very soon you shall have milk
