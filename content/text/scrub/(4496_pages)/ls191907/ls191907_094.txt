robert shirley had i decided would keep profitably un til tomorrow when i could tackle them with a clear head macgregor lighted another lamp and handed it to me im sleeping here on these blankets in the kitchen said curtis yours is that room on the other side of the cor ridor across from uncles i presume mr macgregor aye thots mine answered the other an ill be seekin it whas more with a brief good night he picked up his knapsack and left us the dog followed him to the door stopped looked back then decided to remain with curtis and curled himself up on a corner of the blanket i yawned again and wished my friend good night inside mr curtis room i barely glanced about for i wished nothing so much as to get my clothes off and close my eyes i think i was not above five minutes in getting between the covers i did not close the door nor the window while the night was chill it was not uncomfortable and i like plenty of fresh air almost at once i began to dream i dreamed that ben biggoty was trying to row me away from the house and that macgregor had a rope tied around my waist and was trying to pull me out of the boat and into the water i struggled mightily and then with a strong heave he had me over the side of the boat instead of the cold plunge i expected however the water was unconscionably hard for i struck it with a bump that waked me instantly and i found that it was no dream i had been dragged off the bed and onto the floor and the rope was about my shoulders even as consciousness returned i found myself being dragged toward the window and with all the power of my lungs i shouted aloud my arms were lashed to my sides but with herculean effort i suc ceeded in freeing one of them and tore fiercely at the bond that gripped and dragged me it felt like slimy leather and i yelled with the fright that was upon me with the energy of despera tion i clutched and tore at the thing and finally ripped it from me to fly shouting toward the door daylight was just appearing in the passage i collided violently with curtis and macgregor coming from opposite directions i could do nothing but point to the room i had left and they rushed in i caught a puzzled look on the scotchmans face and staggered into the kitchen where i dropped upon a chair completely ex hausted the dog was shivering as with an ague and crouched in the furthest corner of the room for heavens sake what was the mat ter old man demanded curtis return ing to the room what on earth pos sessed you to yell like that were you dreaming i thought i wasat first i an swered until i found it was a reality hush heres macgregor the scot hurried in and i noticed that his face was pale beneath the tan i suffer from nightmares occasion ally i said casually though my teeth still chattered with fright and revulsion that was a particularly bad one sorry i waked you both nightmare eh said macgregor eyeing me doubtfully im no so sair tain o thot mon ye yelled like a steam whustle it was very real i told him i think ill not turn in again its getting light halfpast four said curtis glanc ing at the old clock on the kitchen shelf he stirred up the embers of the fire the warmth was grateful and i stretched toward it as i did so i turned and accidentally glanced out of the window what i saw prompted me to an exclamation but i succeeded in turning it into a cough macgregor went back to his room to put on some more clothing the instant he had gone i dragged curtis to the window
