seidlitzmobile pardon me mr hiram snodgrass did not look up from his desk it was saturday and nearly noon and the automobile was panting outside to take him out to the country club where he had a golf game on with his soninlaw pardon me the president of the ajax manufacturing com pany only dipped his pen again in the violet ink and scribbled the faster a half hundred letters still re mained to be signed and mr snodgrass figured that even with the simplest of luncheons he would be an hour late upon the green and this afternoon he purposed having his revenge for the saturday before the husband of his offspring had stung him to the tune of eight up pardon me mr snodgrass swung in his chair well what is it the inquiry came explosively and with a fierce sudden heat like the momentary opening of a furnace door it was mr snodgrass waya manner to which none in the office ever paid the slightest heed you are mr snodgrass yes i am snapped that individual what of it the stranger a man with mild blue eyes and vague rambling whiskers seated himself did you ever he began take first the blue and then the white of a common ordinary seidlitz powder mr snodgrass threw his head back aghast at the query no i have not he bellowed the stranger was unperturbed well then try it and drawing from his pocket one of the powders in question walked coolly over to the water filter and filling the glass drop ped in the blue powder which he stirred with a long index finger the result will surprise you ill do nothing of the dashed kind roared mr snodgrass and say he demanded as he caught the stenographer tittering behind her note book who the devil are you and how did you get in here for answer the strang er laid upon the presidents desk a card jason q fosdick inventor mr snodgrass features experienced a sudden transformation the belligerent expression faded away and a smile of genuine pleasure suffuses all of the countenance visible above and in front of the muttonchop whiskers my dear mr fosdick i am delighted to meet you i he ejaculated i suppose you dropped in to see how the nutcrackers the artist elihu vedder in telling some incidents of his younger life describes feeding a little negro boy with seidlitz powders separately administered with a cor responding alarming result in this excruciatingly funny story mr fosdickwe hesitate to call him a herogives himself the expanding dose and thus succeeds in his de sire to interest a capitalist friend in an automobile to be driven by the gas from seidlitz powder try to imagine for yourself what happened when a heavy charge of sodium carbonate and sulphuric acid were substituted for the comparatively mild seidlits powder but read the story through and you will agree that baron munchhau sen in the wildest flights of his imagination takes a sec ond place to this presentation of mr fosdicks invention see how humor can be evolved even from what so many people call the dryness of chemistry a capital story which you wont forget soon are getting along the device was an utter failure as a curling ironbut as a nutcracker it has been an unqualified success it is going to make you a rich man mr fosdick your royalties are now amounting to over a hundred dollars a week mr fosdick shook his head no i am not herei on that account i have a new invention that want to interest you in and the nature of it is what inquired mr snodgrass an automobile run by these and the inventor held up a seidlitz powder there is a wonderful lot of power in a seidlitz powder mr snodgrass just take first the blue and then the white he said offering the glass and at the same time unfolding the white paper containing the other half of the powder mr snodgrass drew back in some alarm no ill take your word for it please take it insisted mr fosdick its a beautiful experiment it gives a pressure of ten atmospheresone hundred and fifty pounds damn it man im not built for a hundred and fifty pounds i couldnt stand itid blow upi havent any safety valve the inventor shook his head solemnly in that mr snodgrass you are mistaken the human diaphragm will stand one hundred and sixty pounds you see there is a margin of safety of ten pounds the experiment is perfectly safe i tell you i wont cried mr snodgrass over come by a sudden fear that he might be persuaded into such a rash adventure i wont i tell you then i will said mr fosdick calmly lifting the glass just watch here stop that cried the horrified mr snod grass dont do that in here go down into the engine room where we have boiler insurance but the inventor was not to be thwarted with cool deliberation he quaf fed off first the one powder and then the other right here he said after a minutes wait there is power enough to run my seidlitzmobilc eleven and twotenths miles if my cal culations are not wrong and he placed his hand upon the pit of his stomach just feel the pres sure mr snodgrass extended his arm and gingerly prodded the compelling stranger under the ribs nots hard said the inventor warningly re member the margin of safety is only ten pounds mr snodgrass withdrew his hand with lightning like rapidity and the perspiration broke out upori his forehead couldnt you go outside and sit around for awhile he inquired with some trepida tion our building is not very strong and an acci dent would doubtlessly maim many of our clerks i usually dont stir replied mr fosdick solemn ly if i should walk about and stumbleor if i should even cough or sneeze why then
