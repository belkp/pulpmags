a trip to the center of the earth this reasoning calmed me a little and i began to hope the good and peaceful and imperturbable hans would certainly not have arisen from his sleep without some serious and grave motive was he bent on a voyage of discovery during the deep still silence of the night had he at last heard that sweet murmur about which we were all so anxious chapter xx water where is it a bitter disappointment during a long long weary hour there crossed my wildly delirious brain all sorts of reasons as to what could have aroused our quiet and faithful guide the most absurd and ridiculous ideas passed through ray head each more impossible than the other i believe i was either half or wholly mad suddenly there arose as it were from the depths of the earth a voice of comfort it was the sound of footsteps hans was returning presently the uncertain light began to shine upon the walls of the passage and then it came in view far down the sloping tunnel at length hans him self appeared he approached my uncle placed his hand upon his shoulder and gently awakened him my uncle as soon as he saw who it was instantly rose well exclaimed the professor vatten said the hunter i did not know a single word of the danish lang uage and yet by a sort of mysterious instinct i un derstood what the guide had said water water i cried in a wild and frantic tone clapping my hands and gesticulating like a madman water murmured my uncle in a voice of deep emotion and gratitude hvar nedat where below i understood every word i had caught the hunter by the hands and i shook them heartily while he looked on with perfect calm ness the preparations for our departure did not take long and we were soon making a rapid descent into the tunnel an hour later we had advanced a thou sand yards and descended two thousand feet at this moment i heard an accustomed and wellknown sound running along the floors of the granite rock a kind of dull and sullen roar like that of a distant waterfall during the first halfhour of our advance not finding the discovered spring my feelings of in tense suffering returned once more i began to lose all hope my uncle however observing how down hearted i was again becoming took up the conver sation hans was right he exclaimed enthusi astically that is the dull roaring of a torrent a torrent i cried delighted at even hearing the welcome words theres not the slightest doubt about it he replied a subterranean river is flowing beside us i made no reply but hastened on once more ani mated by hope i did not even feel the deep fatigue which hitherto had overpowered me the very sound of this glorious murmuring water already re freshed me we could hear it increasing in volume every moment the torrent which for a long time could be heard flowing over our heads now ran dis tinctly along the left wall roaring rushing splut tering and still falling several times i passed my hand across the rock hoping to find some trace of humidityof the slightest percolation alas in vain again a half hour passed in the same weary toil again we ad vanced it now became evident that the hunter during his absence had not been able to carry his researches any farther guided by an instinct peculiar to the dwellers in mountain regions and waterfinders he smelt the living spring through the rock still he had not seen the precious liquid he had neither quenched his own thirst nor brought us one drop in his gourd moreover we soon made the disastrous discov ery that if our progress continued we should sooii be moving away from the torrent the sound of which gradually diminished we turned back hans halted at the precise spot where the sound of the torrent appeared nearest i could bear the suspense and suffering no long er and seated myself against the wall behind which i could hear the water seething and effervescing not two feet away but a solid wall of granite still sep arated us from it hans looked keenly at me and strange enough for once i thought i saw a smile on his imperturb able face he rose from a stone on which he had been seated and took up the lamp i could not help rising and following he moved slowly along the firm and solid granite wall i watched him with mingled curiosity and eagerness presently he halted and placed his ear against the dry stone mov ing slowly along and listening with the most ex treme care and attention i understood at once that he was searching for the exact spot where the tor rents roar was most plainly heard this point he soon found in the lateral wall on the left side about three feet above the level of the tunnel floor i was in a state of intense excitement i scarcely dared believe what the eiderduck hunter was about to do it was however impossible in a moment more not to both understand and applaud and even to smother him in my embraces when i saw him raise the heavy crowbar and commence an attack upon the rock itself saved i cried yes cried my uncle even more excited and de lighted than myself hans is quite right oh the worthy excellent man we should never have thought of such an idea and nobody else i think would have thought of it such a process simple as it seemed would most certainly not have entered our heads nothing could be more dangerous than to begin to work with pickaxes in that particular part of the globe sup posing while he was at work a breakup were to take place and supposing the torrent once having gained an inch were to take an ell and come pour ing bodily through the brokein rock not one of these dangers was chimerical they were only too real but at that moment no fear of falling in of roof or even of inundation was cap able of stopping us our thirst was so intense that to quench it we would have dug below the bed of old ocean itself hans went quietly to worka work which neither
