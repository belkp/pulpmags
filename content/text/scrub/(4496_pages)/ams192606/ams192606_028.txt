a trip to the center of the earth alarm you are not surely thinking of anything so absurd or cowardly no my intention is to ad vance and continue our journey we have as yet been singularly fortunate and henceforth i hope we shall be more so but said i how are we to cross yonder liquid plain it is not my intention to leap into it head fore most or even to swim across it like leander over the hellespont but as oceans are after all only great lakes inasmuch as they are surrounded by land so does it stand to reason that this central sea is circumscribed by granite surroundings doubtless was my natural reply well then do you not think that when once we reach the other end we shall find some means of continuing our journey probably but what extent do you allow to this internal ocean i should fancy it to extend about forty or fifty leaguesmore or less but even supposing this approximation to be a correct onewhat then i asked my dear boy we have no time for further dis cussion we shall embark tomorrow i looked around with surprise and incredulity i could see nothing in the shape of boat or vessel what i cried we are about to launch out upon an unknown sea and where if i may ask is the vessel to carry us well my dear boy it will not be exactly what you would call a vessel for the present we must be content with a good and solid raft a raft i cried incredulously but down here a raft is as impossible of construction as a vessel and i am at a loss to imagine my good harryif you were to listen instead of talking so much you would hear said my uncle waxing a little impatient i should hear yescertain knocks with the hammer which hans is now employing to make the raft he has been at work for many hours but where has he found trees suitable for such a construction he found the trees all ready to his hand come and you shall see our excellent guide at work more and more amazed at what i heard and saw i followed my uncle like one in a dream after a walk of about a quarter of an hour i saw hans at work on the other side of the promonotory which formed our natural port a few minutes more and i was beside him to my great surprise on the sandy shore lay a halffinished raft it was made from beams of a very peculiar wood and a great number of limbs joints boughs and pieces lay about sufficient to have constructed a fleet of ships and boats i turned to my uncle silent with astonishment and awe where did all this wood come from icried what wood is it well there is pinewood fir and the palms of the northern regions mineralized by the action of the sea he replied sententiously can it be possible yes said the learned professor what you see is called fossil wood but then cried i after reflecting for a moment like the agates it must be as hard and as heavy as stone and therefore will certainly not float sometimes that is the case many of these woods have become true anthracites but others again like those you see before you have only undergone one phase of fossil transformation but there is no proof like demonstration added my uncle picking one or two of these precious waifs and casting them into the sea the piece of wood after having disappeared for a moment came to the surface and floated about with the oscillation produced by wind and tide are you convinced said my uncle with a self satisfied smile i am convinced i cried that what i see is incredible the fact was that my journey into the interior of the earth was rapidly changing all preconceived notions and day by day preparing me for the mar velous i should not have been surprised to have seen a float of native canoes afloat upon that silent sea the very next evening thanks to the industry and ability of hans the raft was finished it was about ten feet long and five feet wide the beams bound together with stout ropes were solid and firm and once launched by our united efforts the improvised vessel floated tranquilly upon the waters of what the professor had well named the central sea chapter xxix on the watersa raft voyage on the th of august we were up betimes there was no time to be lost we now had to inaugurate a new kind of locomotion which would have the advantage of being rapid and not fatiguing a mast made of two pieces of wood fastened together to give additional strength a yard made from another one the sail a linen sheet from our bed we were fortunately in no want of cordage and the whole on trial appeared solid and seaworthy at six oclock in the morning when the eager and enthusiastic professor gave the signal to em bark the victuals the luggage all our instruments our weapons and a goodly supply of sweet water which we had collected from springs in the rocks were placed on the raft hans had with consid erable ingenuity contrived a rudder which en abled him to guide the floating apparatus with ease he took the tiller as a matter of course the worthy man was as good a sailor as he was a guide and duckhunter i then let go the painter which held us to the shore the sail was brought to the wind and we made a rapid offing our sea voyage had at length commenced and once more we were making for distant and unknown regions just as we were about to leave the little port where the raft had been constructed my uncle who was very strong as to geographic nomenclature wanted to give it a name and among others sug gested mine well said i before you decide i have another to propose well out with it
