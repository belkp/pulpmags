an experiment in gyrohats the idea of a gyrohat did not come to me all at once as some great ideas come to inventors in fact i may say that but for a most unpleasant circumstance i might never have thought of gyro hats at all although i had for many years been considering the possibility of utilizing the waste space in the top of silk hats in some way or other as a practical hat dealer and lover of my kind it had always seemed to me a great economical waste to have a large vacant space inside the upper portion of top hats or high hats or stovepipe hats as they are variously called when a shoe is on it is full of foot and when a glove is on it is full of hand but a top hat is not and never can be full of head until such a day as heads assume a cylindrical shape perfectly flat on top and no sensible man ever expects that day to come i had therefore spent much of my leisure in devising methods by which the vacant space above the head in high hats might be turned to advantage and my patents ranged all the way from a small filing cabinet that just occupied the waste space to an extensible hat rack on the accordion plan that could be pushed compactly into the top of the hat when the hat was worn but could be ex tended into a hat and coat rack when the hat was not in use this device should have been very popular but i may say that the public received the idea coldly my attention had been for some time drawn away from this philanthropic work by certain symptoms of uneasiness i noticed in my daughter anne and my wife and i decided after careful consideration that anne must be in love and that her love must be unhappy otherwise we could not account for the strange excitability of our usually imperturbable daughter as a practical hat dealer my time has been almost exclusively devoted to hats and as a good wife my companions attention has been almost exclusively devoted t o her husband while anne was usually so calm and selfcontained that she did not take my attention from my hat business at all but when such a daughter suddenly devel ops signs of weeping and sighs and general nervous ness any father no mat ter how devoted to the hat trade must pay attention one of the primary necessities of a dealer in good hats is calm an ordinary hat dealer may not need calm he may buy his hats as another dealer buys flour in the bulk and then trust to advertise ments to sell them but i am not that kind of hat dealer hat dealing is an art with me and great art requires calm and peace in order that it may reach its highest development when i buy hats i do not think of dozens and dollars no indeed i think of noses and ears to be able to buy of a manufacturer a hat that will make the pug nose and big ears of a man i have never seen seem normal that mechanical marvel the gyroscope is being used successfully today to keep big ocean liners from roll ing it is being used for the same purpose in submarines and for many other stabilization purposes so ellis parker butler of pigs is pigs fame in this story seises upon this almost mechanical miracleand makes it the feature of his story charged with his characteristic humor the story goes along deliberately from point co point ludicrous in its ctbsurdity but having the aspect of a true tale nevertheless the contrast be tween the sober man who cannot help staggering and reeling as he progresses and the thoroughly drunken man who must walk rigorously straight is admirably shown and contributes not a little tcnvard making the story both humorous and interesting and beautiful when that man enters my store and buys a hat requires calm and no hatter can have calm in his soul while his daughter is lovesick and unhappy i demand happiness about and around me and i must have it so i told my wife and i told her so most emphatically and i informed her that anne must become happy at once perhaps you can imagine the shock i received when my wife after making the necessary inquiries of anne informed me that anne was indeed in love and in love with walsingham gribbs it was not because walsingham gribbs had never bought a hat of me that i was shocked bad hats are a common failing of mankind and a man will try a hundred hatters before he at last comes to me the trouble was deeper than this the thing that staggered me was that walsingham was a staggerer this is a joke but i hold that a hatter has as good a right to make a joke as the next man that my daughter had fallen in love with wals ingham gribbs without having met him was alto gether to her credit she first saw him when she was crossing the ocean for she travels where she pleases my hat business affording her such pleas ures and that he reeled and staggered about the boat did not impress her for it was a stormy trip and everyone aboard reeled and staggered even the captain of the boat but when she returned to new york and saw walsingham gribbs on the firm pave ment of fifth avenue she had a harsh cruel dis illusionment walsingham gribbs reeled and stag gered on terra firma i am glad to say that my daughter saw at once the impossibility of the daughter of a highclass hatter mating with a permanent staggerer as sho realized this she became sad and nervous thus creating an atmosphere in my home that was quite opposed to the best high class hatting irritating my faculties and threaten ing to reduce me to the state of a mere commer cial hatter further investigation only made the matter seem worse for quiet inquiries brought out the informa tion that walsingham gribbs had been stagger ing since the year his father died he had been constantly in a reeling staggering state since his twentieth birthday for such a man reform is indeed impossible and what made the case more sad was that all proof seemed to point to the fact that walsingham gribbs was not a bounder nor a rounder two classes of men who occasionally acquire a stagger and a reel in company with hearty boon companions in short no one had ever seen walsingham gribbs take a drink in public and i was forced to conclude that he was of that horrid type that drinks alone alone but with unabated zeal as that great poet sir walter scott has remarked in one of his charm ing poems
