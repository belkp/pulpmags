 amazing stories possible a machine cant possibly thinkor have judgment doctor hackensaw chuckled it would seem so pep said he but i assure you i am perfectly serious when i say the machine will do what i claim for it it seems impossible but as in the case of the translating machine this is only one of many impossible things made possible but how does it work ill tell you for the basic principle is extremely simple i have had a great deal of experience in the courts and i have noticed that theman who is in the wrong always secures the best lawyer the man who knows he is right will be satisfied with a poor lawyer trusting to the justice of his cause to per suade the jury his opponent however knows his only hope is to secure a better lawyer than his ad versary and will spare no pains or expense to secure it consequently if i were a judge i would let both lawyers talk five minutes each and then decide the case in favor of the poorer lawyer but in that case why do you need a machine the machine is useful as an aid to tell which lawyer is really the cleverer it registers their brain capacity their intelligence their energy etc but objected pep it seems to me that people would soon learn your system and then both sides would try to engage the poorest lawyers they could find precisely to avoid that i must keep my method secret my machine does the real judging but i should hire cheap men to listen quietly to the cases and at the end they would secretly draw a slip from the machine which would tell them what verdict to give and as i said i would guarantee the judgment to be equitable in cases out of a thousand whats that little instrument that looks like a match asked pep thats a gynaionometer its an instrument for measuring a womans age a gynaionometer yes thats greek and means the measure of a womans age great scott how does it work i got the idea from an author who wrote under the pen name of diogenes tubb who some forty years ago wrote the story of an inventor mr p q jones of an instrument for ascertaining a womans age at that time about the ladies all wore long skirts well this mr p q jones was a phil osopher iie had often stood on a street corner on a muddy day and he noticed that the ladies in crossing always raised their skirts a little in order to keep them out of the mud well theres nothing very extraordinary in that no but mr jones noticed the remarkable fact that the extent to which the skirt was raised varied with the age of the womanin fact he found that the amount of stocking displayed was directly pro portional to the womans agethe older the woman the higher she raised her skirts it was another instance of the law of compensationmaking up in quantity for what was lacking in quality mr p q jones used this fact as the basis for an instrument which he called a gynaionometer and which he used for measuring the ages of the ladies he met in this matchlike instrument on the table you see an improvement of mine on mr jones idea a very simple means for ascertaining the age of your motherinlaw or any other of your female friends as you see my device was simplicity itself it consisted merely of a dial on which was a fixed needle and a movable needle on a muddy day you could stand exactly ten feet away from the curb and place the instrument so the fixed needle is perfectly horizontal three feet from the ground then you wait for the lady to come along and when she raises her skirt you move the movable needle until it points directly at the highest visible portion of her stock ing and you could at once read her exact age on the dial in years months and days good heavens but the thing wouldnt work nowadays when we all wear short skirts no the fashions changed and i was obliged to modify my instrument as a persons arteries harden with age i tried to make one that would work according to the degree of hardness of the artery but i failed when the audion was invented however i succeeded by making agynaionometer that worked by electricity every human being is an electrical machinecontinually generating elec trical currents careful study showed me that these currents vary with age by the use of an audion i could amplify these currents and i constructed the rather complicated machine you see here which ena bles me to tell a ladys exact age in an instant i expected to make a fortune from my device but would you believe it the thing has brought me nothing but trouble and vexation like mr jones i have lost all my lady friends and have become es tranged from my female relatives because i claimed to know their ages better than they did themselves no pep there are some things it doesnt pay to monkey with one of them is the buzzsaw an other is a womans age the end
