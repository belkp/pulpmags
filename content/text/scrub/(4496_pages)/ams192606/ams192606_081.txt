 amazing stories passed out with the ever staggering walsingham the gyroscope was revolving at the rate of three thousand revolutions a minute and the slight hum ming was hardly noticeable i did not stagger and i did not reel when i reached gramercy park i was full of glee i had been walking on the edge of the curb but i now desired to climb atop of the iron fence that surrounds the park and walk on the points of the pickets my wife and walsingham tried to dissuade me but i climbed to the top of the fence i not only walked on the points of the pickets easily but i was able to place the end of one toe on the point of one picket and thus balanced wave the other leg in the air my wife and walsingham gribbs coaxed me to come down to the level of the walk but as i saw no reason to do so i flatly refused and at last wals ingham reached up and took me by the hand and pulled me ordinarily a man that had imbibed a quantity of brandy would have fallen to the street if pulled by one hand while standing on the top of a row of pickets but i did not when walsingham pulled my hand i inclined gently toward him until i was at right angles to the picket fence with my foot still on top of the picket and when he released my hand i slowly swung upright again without any effort whatever on my part i got down off that fence when i was ready and not before there could be no doubt whatever that i was far more intoxicated than walsingham gribbs and all the way home i gave vent to tremendous bursts of laughter over the idea that while walsingham thought he was seeing me safely home i walked as straight and true as a general and he staggered and reeled exceptwhen he clung closely to my arm many persons stopped and looked at us and i cannot wonder at it for walsingham is a young man of most dignified countenance and it must have seemed strange to see a young man of such sober mien reeling drunkenly while a dignified and steadily walking hatter laughed and shouted drunk enly it was as if the two of us had been able to afford but one spree and had divided it in that way he taking the stagger and i taking the boisterous ness my wife was much touched by the kind atten tions of walsingham and when we reached home she invited him in and while i found a little harm less amusement in walking up the stairbanisters and sliding down them standing on my feet which i was enabled to do because of the steadying effect of the gyrohat she took walsingham into the parlor and introduced him to anne formally my poor daughter was quite overcome with em barrassment and pleasure but when walsingham was sitting he showed no evidence of his stagger and reel whatever and they managed to become quite well acquainted while my wife was assisting me to bed unfortunately i had neglected to arrange any method for letting the vacuum out of the gyrohat and although my wife tugged and pulled at the hat the suction held it fast to my head and it refused to come off unless my scalp came with it my wife decided that i must sleep in the hat since i was in no condition of mind to do anything about it myself i was dying for sleep and my wife tumbled me into bed and pulled the sheet over mo and that same instant i fell into a heavy slumber but the moment my wife released her grasp on me i began arising to my feet irresistibly drawn to the perpendicular by the action of the gyrohat i continued to arise until i was standing upright i can only liken the manner in which i arose to the way a man might raise a stiff arm slowly until it pointed straight upward my wife immediately pushed me down onto the pillow again but it was unavailing again the gyrohat drew me to a standing position and my wife was forced to let me continue my nights rest in that position the next morning i did not feel very well but i never saw my wife in better spirits she told me she was sure walsingham had taken a great fancy to anne for he had asked permission to call again that evening and my wife said that in her opinion it would be well to take up the matter of the mar riage with walsingham at once before it went any further if he meant business he would be glad to wear the hat and be rid of his stagger and reel and if he meant nothing it would be a good thing to know it and the sooner we were rid of him the better i agreed with her fully but i spent the day perfecting the vacuum outlet on the hat i must admit that walsingham seemed somewhat surprised when i made the suggestion to him that evening for a few minutes he did not seem to know what to say perhaps it was a little overcom ing to have the parents of anne suggest the idea of a marriage in this offhand manner and at the same time propose the wearing of a gyrohat but wals ingham was a gentleman and when he glanced up after his first surprise and saw anne gazing at him appealingly with her hands clasped i could see that love had won but instead of acquiescing immediately walsingham gribbs took one of annes hands in his and after patting it spoke directly to me sir he said i cannot but appreciate the deli cate manner in which you have handled this matter but if i am only too glad to find that there is a hat that will correct my unfortunate staggering and reeling and if i am to accept your offer of that hat i feel it due to myself to assure you that liquor has nothing whatever to do with my staggering and reeling i am the victim of an unfortunate ex perience of my youthful days my father was a man of many ideas and always trying to make the world better he had a neighbor that had a mule it was a mousecolored mule and very stubborn and it used to wring my fathers heart to see the neighbor belabor that mule with a heavy whip trying to make the mule proceed in a direction in which it did not wish to go the mule was quite willing to go toward the barn where the feed was kept but it often refused to goin the opposite direction although it would go well enough if it once started my father therefore conceived the idea of what he called the gribbs mule reverser this was a circular platform large enough to hold a mule and his loaded wagon and beneath the platform was a motor capable of revolving the platform all that was necessary was to place the mule and the wagon on the platform and start the mule in the direction
