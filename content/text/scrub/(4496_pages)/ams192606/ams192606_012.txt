a trip to the center of the earth thanked my uncle by clasping his hands my heart was too full to speak yes said he one mouthful of water the very lastdo you hear my boythe very last i have guarded it at the bottom of my bottle as the apple of my eye twenty times a hundred times i have resisted the fearful desire to drink it butno no harry i saved it for you my dear uncle i exclaimed and the big tears rolled down my hot and feverish cheeks yes my poor boy i knew that when you reached this place this cross road in the earth you would fall down half dead and i saved my last drop of water in order to restore you thanks i cried thanks from my heart as little as my thirst was really quenched i had nevertheless partially recovered my strength the contracted muscles of my throat relaxedand the inflammation of my lips in some measure subsided at all events i was able to speak well i said there can be no doubt now as to what we have to do water has utterly failed us our journey is therefore at an end let us return while i spoke thus my uncle evidently avoided my face he held down his head his eyes were turned in every possible direction but the right one yes i continued getting excited by my own words we must go back to sneffels may heaven give us strength to enable us once more to revisit the light of day would that we now stood on the summit of the crater go back said my uncle speaking to himself and must it be so go backyes and without losing a single mo ment i vehemently cried for some moments there was silence under that dark and gloomy vault so my dear harry said the professor in a very singular tone of voice those few drops of water have not sufficed to restore your energy and courage courage i cried i see that you are quite as downcast as before and still give way to discouragement and despair what then was the man made of and what other projects were entering his fertile and audacious brain you are not discouraged sir what give up just as we are on the verge of success he cried never never shall it be said that professor hardwigg retreated then we must make up our minds to perish i cried with a helpless sigh no harry my boy certainly not go leave me i am very far from desiring your death take hans with you i will go on alone you ask us to leave you leave me i say i have undertaken this danger ous and perilous adventure i will carry it to the endori will never return to the surface of mother earth goharryonce more i say to you fgo my uncle as he spoke was terribly excited his voice which before had been tender almost woman ly became harsh and menacing he appeared to be struggling with desperate energy against the im possible i did not wish to abandon him at the bot tom of that abyss while on the other hand the in stinct of preservation told me to fly meanwhile our guide was looking on with pro found calmness and indifference he appeared to be an unconcerned party and yet he perfectly well knew what was going on between us our gestures sufficiently indicated the different roads each wished to followand which each tried to influence the other to undertake but hans appeared not to take the slightest interest in what was really a question of life and death for us all but waited quite ready to obey the signal which should say go aloft or to resume his desperate journey to the interior of the earth how i wished then with all my heart and soul that i could make him understand my words my repre sentations my sighs and groans the earnest accents in which i should have spoken would have convinced that cold hard nature those fearful dangers and perils of which the stolid guide had no idea i would have pointed them out to himi would as it were have made him see and feel between us we might have convinced the obstinate professor if the worst had come to the worst we could have compel led him to return to the summit of sneffels i ap proached hans i caught his hand in mine he never moved a muscle i indicated to him the road to the top of the crater he remained motionless my panting form my haggard countenance must have indicated the extent of my sufferings the icelander gently shook his head and pointed to my uncle master he said the master i cried beside myself with fury madman noi tell you he is not the master of our lives we must fly we must drag him with us do you hear me do you understand me i say i have already explained that i held hans by the arm i tried to make him rise from his seat i struggled with him and tried to force him away my uncle now interposed my good harry be calm he said you will obtain nothing from my devoted follower therefore listen to what i have to say i folded my arms as well as i could and looked my uncle in the face this wretched want of water he said is the sole obstacle to the success of my project in the entire gallery composed of lava schist and coal it is true we found not one liquid molecule it is quite possible that we may be more fortunate in the western tunnel my sole reply was to shake my head with an air of incredulity listen to me to the end said the professor in his well known lecturing voice while you lay yon der without life or nation i undertook a recon noitering journey into the conformation of this other gallery i have discovered that it goes direct ly downwards into the bowels of the earth and in a few hours will take us to the old granitic formation in this we shall undoubtedly find innumerable springs the nature of the rock makes this a mathe matical certainty and instinct agrees with logic to say that it is so now this is the serious proposi tion which i have to make to you when christo pher columbus asked of his men three days to dis cover the land of promise his men ill terrified and hopeless yet gave him three daysand the new world was discovered now i the christopher columbus of this subterranean region only ask of you one more day if when that time is expired i
