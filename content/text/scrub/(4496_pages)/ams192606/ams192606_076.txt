the runaway skyscraper had broken through its normal confines some time before but whose pressure had been sufficient to prevent the accident until the failure of its flow when the flow ceased the building sank rapidly for the fact that this sinking was in the fourth directionthe fourth dimensionarthur had no explanation he simply knew that in some mysteri ous way an outlet for the pressure had developed in that fashion and that the tower had followed the spring in its fall through time the sole apparent change in the building had occurred above the one hollow concrete pile which seemed to indicate that if access were to be had to the mysterious and so far only assumed spring it must be through that pile while the vault re tained its abnormal elevation arthur believed that there was still water at an immense and incalculable pressure in the pipe he dared not attempt to tap the pipe until the pressure had abated at the end of a week he found the vault slowly settling back into place when its return to the normal was complete he dared begin boring a hole to reach the hollow tube in the concrete pile as he suspected he found water in the pile water whose sulfurous and mineral nature con firmed his belief that a geyser reaching deep into the bosom of the earth as well as far back in the realms of time was at the bottom of the extra ordinary jaunt of the tower geysers were still far from satisfactory things to explain there are many of their vagaries which we cannot understand at all we do know a few things which affect them and one thing is that soaping them will stimulate their flow in an extraordinary manner arthur proposed to soap this mysterious geyser when the renewal of its flow should lift the run away skyscraper back to the epoch from which the failure of the flow had caused it to fall he made his preparations with great care he confidently expected his plan to work and to see the skyscraper once more towering over midtown new york as was its wont but he did not allow the fishermen and hunters to relax their efforts on that account they labored as before while deep down in the subbasement of the collossal building arthur and his volunteers toiled mightily they had to bore through the concrete pile until they reached the hollow within it then when the evidence gained from the water in the pipe had confirmed his surmises they had to prepare their charge of soapy liquids by which the geyser was to be stirred to renewed activity great quantities of the soap used by the scrub women in scrubbing down the floors was boiled with water until a sirupy mess was evolved means had then to be provided by which this could be quickly introduced into the hollow pile the hole then closed and then braced to withstand a pressure unparal leled in hydraulic science arthur believed that from the hollow pile the soapy liquid would find its way to the geyser proper where it would take effect in stimulating the lessened flow to its former propor tions when that took place he believed that the building would return to normal modern times as swiftly and as surely as it had left them the telephone rang in his office and estelle answered it arthur was on the wire a signal was being hung out for all the castaways to return to the building from their several occupations they were about to soap the geyser did estelle want to come down and watch she did she stood in the main hallway as the excited and hopeful people trooped in when the last was inside the doors were firmly closed the few friendly indians outside stared perplexedly at the mysterious white strangers the whites laughing excitedly began to wave to the indians their leavetaking was premature estelle took her way down into the cellar arthur was awaiting her arrival van deventer stood near with the grinning grimy members of arthurs volunteer work gang the massive concrete pile stood in the center of the cellar a big steamboiler was coupled to a tiny pipe that led into the heart of the mass of concrete arthur was going to force the soapy liquid into the hollow pile by steam at a signal steam began to hiss in the boiler live steam from the fi reroom forced the soapy sirup out of the boiler through the small iron pipe into the hollow that led to the geyser far under ground six thousand gallons in all were forced into the opening in a space of three minutes arthurs grimy gang began to work with desper ate haste quickly they withdrew the iron pipe and inserted a long steel plug painfully beaten from a bar of solid metal then girding the colossal con crete pile ring after ring of metal was slipped on to hold the plug in place the last of the safeguards was hardly fastened firmly when estelle listened intently i hear a rumbling she said quietly arthur reached forward and put his hand on the mass of concrete it is quivering he reported as quietly i think well be on our way in a very little while the group broke for the stairs to watch the panorama as the runaway skyscraper made its way back through the thousands of years to the times that had built it for a monument to modern commerce arthur and estelle went high up in the tower from the window of arthurs office they looked eagerly and felt the slight quiver as the tower got under way estelle looked up at the sun and saw it mend its pace toward the west night fell the evening sounds became high pitched and shrill then seemed to cease altogether in a very little while there was light again and the sun was speeding across the sky it sank hastily and returned almost immediately via the east its pace became a breakneck rush down behind the hills and up in the east down in the west and up in the east down and up the flickering began the race beck toward modern time had started arthur and estelle stood at the window and looked out as the sun rushed more and more rapid ly across the sky until it became but a streak of light shifting first to the right and then to the left as the seasons passed in their turn with arthurs arms about her shoulders estelle stared out across the unbelievable landscape while the nights and days the winters and summers and the storms and calms of a thousand years swept past them into the irrevocable aeons presently arthur drew her to him and kissed her while he kissed her so swiftly did the days and continued on page
