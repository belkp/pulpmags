the runaway skyscraper miss woodward arthur ordered suddenly look at the ground estelle glanced down the next time the sun flashed into view she gasped the ground was white with snow what has happened she demanded terrified oh what has happened arthur fumbled at his chin awkwardly watching the astonishing panorama outside there was hardly any distinguishing between the times the sun was up and the times it was below now as the darkness and light followed each other so swiftly the effect was the same as one of the old flickering motionpictures as arthur watched this effect became more pro nounced the tall fifth avenue building across the way began to disintegrate in a moment it seemed there was only a skeleton there then that vanished story by story a great cavity in the earth appeared and then another building be came visible a smaller brownstone unimpressive structure with bulging eyes arthur stared across the city except for the flickering he could see almost clearly now he no longer saw the sun rise and set there was merely a streak of unpleasantly brilliant light across the sky bit by bit building by building the city began to disintegrate and become replaced by smaller dingier buildings in a little while those began to disappear and leave gaps where they vanished arthur strained his eyes and looked far down town he saw a forest of masts and spars along the waterfront for a moment and when he turned his eyes again to the scenery near him it was almost barren of houses and what few showed were mean small residences apparently set in the midst of farms and plantations estelle was sobbing oh mr chamberlain she cried what is the matter what has happened arthur had lost his fear of what their fate would be in his absorbing interest in what he saw he was staring out of the window wideeyed lost in the sight before him at estelles cry however he reluctantly left the window and patted her shoulder awkwardly i dont know how to explain it he said un comfortably but its obvious that my first surmise was all wrong the speed of the earths rotation cant have been increased because if it had to the extent we see wed have been thrown off into space long ago buthave you read anything about the fourth dimension estelle shook her head hopelessly well then have you ever read anything by wells the time machine for instance again she shook her head i dont know how im going to say it so youll understand but time is just as much a dimension as length and breadth from what i can judge id say there has been an earthquake and the ground has settled a little with our building on it only instead of settling down toward the center of the earth or sidewise its settled in this fourth dimension but what does that mean asked estelle un comprehendingly if the earth had settled down wed have been lower if it had settled to one side wed have been moved one way or another but as its settled back in the fourth dimension were going back in time then were in a runaway skyscraper bound for some time back before the discovery of america the seasons are reversed in order it was very still in the office except for the flickering outside everything seemed very much as usual the electric light burned steadily but estelle was sobbing with fright and arthur was trying vainly to console her have i gone crazy she demanded between her sobs not unless ive gone mad too said arthur soothingly the excitement had quite a soothing effect upon him he had ceased to feel afraid but was simply waiting to see what had happened were way back before the founding of new york now and still going strong are you sure thats what has happened if youll look outside he suggested youll see the seasons following each other in reverse order one moment the snow covers all the ground then you catch a glimpse of autumn foliage then sum mer follows and next spring estelle glanced out of the window and covered her eyes not a house she said despairingly not a building nothing nothing nothing arthur slipped his arm about her and patted hers comfortingly its all right he reassured her well bring up presently and there well be theres nothing to be afraid of she rested her head on his shoulder and sobbed hopelessly for a little while longer but presently quieted then suddenly realizing that arthurs arm was about her and that she was crying on his shoulder she sprang away blushing crimson arthur walked to the window look there he exclaimed but it was too late ill swear to it i saw the halfmoon hudsons ship he declared excitedly were way back now and dont seem to be slackening up either estelle came to the window by his side the rap idly changing scene before her made her gasp it was no longer possible to distinguish night from day a wavering streak moving first to the right and then to the left showed where the sun flashed across the sky what makes the sun wabble so she asked moving north and south of the equator arthur explained casually when its farthest southto the lefttheres always snow on the ground when its farthest right its summer see how green it is a few moments observation corroborated his statement id say arthur remarked reflectively that it takes about fifteen seconds for the sun to make the round trip from farthest north to farthest south he felt his pulse do you know the normal rate of the heartbeat we can judge time that way a clock will go all to pieces of course
