a trip to the center of the earth the imperturbable professor once we reach the exact center of this sphere either we shall find a new road by which to ascend to the surface or we shall simply turn around and go back by the way we came i have every reason to believe that while we are traveling forward it will not close behind us then one of the first matters to see to will be to repair the raft was my rather melancholy re sponse of course we must attend to that above all things continued the professor then comes the allimportant question of pro visions i urged have we anything like enough left to enable us to accomplish such great such amazing designs as you contemplate carrying out i have seen into the matter and my answer is in the affirmative hans is a very clever fellow and has saved the greater part of the cargo but the best way to satisfy your scruples is to come and judge for yourself saying which he led the way out of the kind of open grotto in which we had taken shelter i had almost begun to hope that which i should rather have feared the impossi bility of such a shipwreck leaving even the slightest signs of what it had carried as freight as soon as i reached the shores of this inland sea i found hans standing gravely in the midst of a large number of things laid out in complete order my uncle wrung his hands with deep and silent gratitude his heart was too full for speech this man whose superhuman devotion to his employers i never saw surpassed nor even equaled had been hard at work all the time we slept and at the risk of his life had succeeded in saving the most precious articles of our cargo of course under the circumstances we necessar ily experienced several severe losses our weapons had wholly vanished but experience had taught us to do without them the provision of powder had however remained intact after nearly blowing us all to atoms in the storm well said the professor who was now ready to make the best of everything as we have no guns all we have to do is to give up all idea of hunting yes my dear sir we can do without them but yhat about all our instruments here is the manometer the most useful of all which i gladly accept in lieu of the rest with it alone i can calculate the depth as we proceed by its means alone i shall be able to decide when we have reached the center of the earth ha ha but for this little instrument we might make a mistake and run the risk of coming out at the antipodes all this was said amid bursts of unnatural laughter but the compass i cried without that what can we do here it is safe and sound he cried with real joy ah ah and here we have the chronometer and the thermometers hans the hunter was indeed an invaluable man it was impossible to deny this fact as far as the nautical and other instruments were concerned noth ing was wanting then on further examination i found ladders cords pickaxes crowbars and shovels all scattered about oh the shore but what are we to do for food i asked let us see to the commissariat department re plied my uncle gravely the boxes which contained our supply of food for the voyage were placed in a row along the strand and proved in a capital state of preservation the sea had in every case respected their contents taking into consideration biscuits salt meat schiedam and dried fish we could still cal culate on having about four months supply if used with prudence and caution four months cried the sanguine professor in high glee then we shall have plenty of time both to go and to come and with what remains i under take to give a grand dinner to my colleagues of the johanneum i sighed i should by this time have accustomed myself to the temperament of my uncle and yet this man astonished me more and more every day he was the greatest human enigma i had ever known now said he before we do anything else we must lay in a stock of fresh water the rain has fallen in abundance and filled the hollows of the granite there is a rich supply of water and we have no fear of suffering from thirst which in our circumstances is of the last importance as for the raft i shall recommend hans to repair it to the best of his abilities though i have every reason to believe we shall not require it again how is that i cried more amazed than ever at my uncles style of reasoning i have an idea my dear boy it is none other than this simple fact we shall not come out by the same opening as that by which we entered i began to look at my uncle with vague suspicion an idea had more than once taken possession of me and this was that he was going mad little did i know how true and prophetic his words were doomed to be and now he said having seen to all these matter of detail to breakfast i followed him to a sort of projecting cape after he had given his last instructions to our guide in this original posi tion with dried meat biscuit and a delicious cup of tea we made a satisfactory meali may say one of the most welcome and pleasant i ever remember exhaustion the keen atmosphere the state of calm after so much agitation all contributed to give me an excellent appetite indeed it contributed very much to producing a pleasant and cheerful state of mind while breakfast was in hand and between the sips of warm tea i asked my uncle if he had any idea of how we now stood in relation to the world above for my part i added i think it will be rather difficult to determine well if we were compelled to fix the exact spot said my uncle it might be difficult since during the three days of that awful tempest i could keep no account either of the quickness of our pace or of the direction in which the raft was going still we will endeavor to approximate to the truth we shall not i believe be so very far out well if i recollect rightly i replied our last observation was made at the geyser island harrys island my boy harrys island do not decline the honor of having named it having given your name to an island discovered by us the first human beings vho trod it since the creation of the world
