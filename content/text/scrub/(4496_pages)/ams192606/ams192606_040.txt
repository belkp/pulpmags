a trip to the center of the earth sor was not even listening and did not hear a word of all my eloquence to the raft he cried in a hoarse voice when i paused for a reply such was the result of my strenuous effort to resist his iron will i tried again i begged and im plored him i got into a passion but i had to deal with a will more determined than my own i seemed to feel like the waves which fought and battled against the huge mass of granite at our feet which had smiled grimly for so many ages at their puny efforts hans meanwhile without taking part in our dis cussion had been repairing the raft one would have supposed that he instinctively guessed at the further projects of my uncle by msars of some fragments of cordage he had again made the raft seaworthy while i had been speaking he had hoisted a new mast and sail the latter already flut tering and waving in the breeze the worthy professor spoke a few words to our imperturbable guide who immediately began to put our baggage on board and to prepare for our departure the atmosphere was now tolerably clear and pure and the northeast wind blew steadily and serenely it appeared likely to last for some time what then could i do could i undertake to resist the iron will of two men it was simply im possible if even i could have hoped for the support of hans this however was out of the question it appeared to me that the icelander had set aside all personal will and identity he was a picture of abnegation i could hope for nothing from one so infatuated with and devoted to his master all i could do therefore was to swim with the stream in a mood of stolid and sullen resignation i was about to take my accustomed place on the raft when my uncle placed his hand upon my shoulder there is no hurry my boy he said we shall not start un til tomorrow i looked the picture of resignation to the dire will of fate under the circumstances he said i ought to neglect no precautions as fate has cast me upon these shores i shall not leave without hav ing completely examined them in order to understand this remark i must ex plain that though we had been driven back to the northern shore we had landed at a very different spot from that which had been our starting point port gretchen must we calculated be very much to the westward nothing therefore was more natural and reasonable than that we should recon noitre this new shore upon which we had so unex pectedly landed let us go on a journey of discov ery i cried and leaving hans to his important operation we started on our expedition as we trudged along our feet crushed innumerable shells of every shape and sizeonce the dwelling place of animals of every period of creation i particularly noticed some enormous shellscarapaces turtle and tortoise spe cies the diameter of which exceeded fifteen feet they had in past ages belonged to those gigantic glyptodons of the pliocene period of which the mod ern turtle is but a minute specimen in addition the whole soil was covered by a vast quantity of stony relics having the appearance of flints worn by the action of the waves and lying in successive layers one above the other it appeared clear that we were walking upon a kind of sediment formed like all the soils of that period so frequent on the surface of the globe by the subsidence of the waters the professor who was now in his element carefully examined every rocky fissure let him only find an opening and it directly became import ant to him to examine its depth for a whole mile we followed the windings of the central sea when suddenly an important change took place in the aspect of the soil it seemed to have been rudely cast up convuisionized as it were by a violent upheaving of the lower strata in many places hollows here and hillocks there attested great dislocations at some other period of the ter restrial mass we advanced with great difficulty over the broken masses of granite mixed with flint quartz and alluvial deposits when a large field more even than a field a plain of bones appeared sud denly before our eyes it looked like an immense cemetery where generation after generation had mingled their mortal dust lofty barrows of early remains rose at intervals they undulated away to the limits of the distant horizon and were lost in a thick and brown fog on that spot some three square miles in extent was accumulated the whole history of animal life scarcely one creature still a habitant of the com paratively modern soil of the upper and inhabited world had there existed we were drawn forward by an allabsorbing and impatient curiosity our feet crushed with a dry and crackling sound the remains of those prehis toric fossils for which the museums of great cities quarrel even when they obtain only rare and curious morsels i was utterly confounded my uncle stood for some minutes with his arms raised on high to wards the thick granite vault which served us for a sky his mouth was wide open his eyes sparkled wildly behind his spectacles which he had fortu nately saved his head bobbed up and down and from side to side while his whole attitude and mien expressed unbounded astonishment he stood in the presence of an endless wondrous and inexhaustibly rich collection of antediluvian monsters piled up for his own private and peculiar satisfaction fancy an enthusiastic lover of books carried suddenly into the very midst of the famous library of alexandria burned by the sacrilegious omar and which some miracle had restored to its pristine splendor such was the state of mind in which uncle hardwigg was now placed for some time he stood thus literally aghast at the magnitude of his discovery but it was even a greater excitement when dart ing wildly over this mass of organic dust he caught up a naked skull and addressed me in a quivering voiceharry my boyharrythis is a human head chapter xxxv discovery upon discovery it will be easy to understand the professors mingled astonishment and joy when on advanc ing about twenty yards further he found him self in the presence of i may say face to face with
