 amazing stories i should like to call it gretchen port gretchen will sound very well on our future map well then port gretchen let it be said the professor and thus it was that the memory of my dear girl was attached to our adventurous and memorable expedition when we left the shore the wind was blowing from the northward and eastward we went di rectly before the wind at a much greater speed than might have been expected from a raft the dense layers of atmosphere at that depth had great propelling power and acted upon the sail with con siderable force at the end of an hour my uncle who had been making careful observations was enabled to estimate the rapidity with which we moved it was far beyond anything seen in the upper world if he said we continue to advance at our present rate we shall have traveled at least thirty leagues in twentyfour hours with a mere raft this is an almost incredible velocity i certainly was surprised and without making any reply went forward upon the raft already the northern shore was fading away on the edge of the horizon the two shores appeared to separate more and more leaving a wide and open space for our departure before me i could see nothing but the vast and apparently limitless seaupon which we floatedthe only living objects in sight huge and dark clouds cast their gray shadows belowshadows which seemed to crush that color less and sullen water by theirweight anything more suggestive of gloom and of regions of nether darkness i never beheld silvery rays of electric light reflected here and there upon some small spots of water brought up luminous sparkles in the long wake of our cumbrous bark presently we were wholly out of sight of land not a vestige could be seen nor any indication of where we were going so still and motionless did we seem without any distant point to fix our eyes on tlat but for the phosphoric light at the wake of the raft i should have fancied that we were still and motionitfss but i knew that we were advancing at a very rapid rate about twelve oclock in the day vast collections of seaweed were discovered surrounding us on all sides i was aware of the extraordinary vegetative power of these plants which have been known to creep along the bottom of the great ocean and stop the advance of large ships but never were sea weeds ever seen so gigantic and wonderful as those of the central sea i could well imagine how seen at a distance tossing and heaving on the summit of the billows the long lines of algse have been taken for living things and thus have been the fertile sources of the belief in sea serpents our raft swept past great specimens of fucse or seawrack from three to four thousand feet in length immense incredibly long looking like snakes that stretched out far beyond our horizon it af forded me great amusement to gaze on their varie gated ribbonlike endless lengths hour after hour passed without our coming to the termination of these floating weeds if my astonishment increased my patience was wellnight exhausted what natural force could possibly have produced such abnormal and extraordinary plants what must have been the aspect of the globe during the first centuries of its formation when under the combined action of heat and humidity the vegetable kingdom occupied its vast surface to the exclusion of everything else these were considerations of neverending interest for the geologist and the philosopher all this while we were advancing on our journey and at length night came but as i had remarked the evening before the luminous state of the at mosphere was in nothing diminished whatever was the cause it was a phenomenon upon the du ration of which we could calculate with certainty as soon as our supper had been disposed of and some little speculative conversation indulged in i stretched myself at the foot of the mast and pres ently went to sleep hans remained motionless at the tiller allowing the raft to rise and fall on the waves the wind being aft and the sail square all he had to do was to keep his rudder amidships ever since we had taken our departure from the newly named port gretchen my worthy uncle had directed me to keep a regular log of our days navigation with instructions to put down even the most minute particulars every interesting and curious phenomenon the direction of the wind our rate of sailing the distance we went in a word every incident of our extraordinary voyage from our log therefore i tell the story of our voyage on the central sea friday august th a steady breeze from the northwest raft progressing with extreme ra pidity and going perfectly straight coast still dimly visible about thirty miles to leeward noth ing to be seen beyond the horizon in front the extraordinary intensity of the light neither in creases nor diminishes it is singularly stationary the weather remarkably fine that is to say the clouds have ascended very high and are light and fleecy and surrounded by an atmosphere resemb ling silver in fusion thermometer degrees centigrade about twelve oclock in the day our guide hans having prepared and baited a hook cast his line into the subterranean waters the bait he used was a small piece of meat by means of which he concealed his hook anxious as i was i was for a long time doomed to disappointment were these waters supplied with fish or not that was the im portant question nowas my decided answer then there came a sudden and rather hard tug hans coolly drew it in and with it a fish which struggled violently to escape a fish cried my uncle putting on his spectacles to examine it it is a sturgeon i cried certainly a small sturgeon the professor examined the fish carefully not ing every characteristic and he did not coincide in my opinion the fish had a flat head round body and the lower extremities covered with bony scales its mouth was wholly without teeth the pec toral fins whieh were highly developed sprouted direct from the body which properly speaking had no tail the animal certainly belonged to the order in which naturalists class the sturgeon but it dif fered from that fish in many essential particulars my uncle after all was not mistaken after a long
