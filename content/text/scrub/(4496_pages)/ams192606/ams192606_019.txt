 amazing stories of associating ideas and words how many persons condemned to the horrors of solitary confinement have gone madsimply because the thinking fac ulties have lain dormant during the two weeks that followed our last inter esting conversation there occurred nothing worthy of being especially recorded i have while writing these memoirs taxed my memory in vain for one incident of travel during this particular period but the next event to be related is terrible in deed its very memory even now makes my soul shudder and my blood run cold it was on the seventh of august our constant and successive descents had taken us quite thirty leagues into the interior of the earth that is to say that there were above us thirty leagues nearly a hundred miles of rocks and oceans and continents and towns to say nothing of living inhabitants we were in a southeasterly direction about two hundred leagues from iceland on that memorable day the tunnel had begun to assume an almost horizontal course i was on this occasion walking on in front my uncle had charge of one of the ruhmkorf coils i had possession of the other by means of its light i was busy exam ining the different layers of granite i was com pletely absorbed in my work suddenly halting and turning round i found that i was alone well thought i to myself i have certainly been walking too fastor else hans and my uncle have stopped to rest the best thing i can do is to go back and find them luckily there is very little ascent to tire me i accordingly retraced my steps and while doing so walked for at least a quarter of an hour rather uneasy i paused and looked eagerly around not a living soul i called aloud no reply my voice was lost amid the myriad cavernous echoes it aroused i began for the first time to feel seriously un easy a cold shiver shook my whole body and per spiration chill and terrible burst upon my skin i must be calm i said speaking aloud as boys whistle to drive away fear there can be no doubt that i shall find my companions there cannot be two roads it is certain that i was considerably ahead all i have to do is to go back having come to this determination i ascended the tunnel for at least half an hour unable to decide if i had ever seen certain landmarks before every now and then i paused to discover if any loud appeal was made to me well knowing that in that dense and intensified atmosphere i should hear it a long way off but no the most extraordinary silence reigned in this immense gallery only the echoes of my own footsteps could be heard at last i stopped i could scarcely realize the fact of my isolation i was quite willing to think that i had made a mistake but not that i was lost if i had made a mistake i might find my way if losti shuddered to think of it come come said i to myself since there is only one road and they must come by it we shall at last meet all i have to do is still to go upwards perhaps however not seeing me and forgetting i was ahead they may have gone back in search of me still even in this case if i make haste i shall get up to them there can be no doubt about the matter but as i spoke these last words gloud it would have been quite clear to any listenerhad there been onethat i was by no means convinced of the fact moreover to associate together these simple ideas andto reunite them under the form of reason ing required some time i could not all at once bring my brain to think then another dread doubt fell upon my soul after all was i ahead of course was hans was no doubt following behind preceded by my uncle i perfectly recollect his having stopped for a mo ment to strap his baggage on his shoulder i now remembered this trifling detail it was i believed just at that very moment that i had determined to continue my route again thought i reasoning as calmly as was possible there is another sure means of not los ing my way a thread to guide me through the laby rinthine subterraneous retreatone which i had forgottenmy faithful river this course of reasoning roused my drooping spirits and i resolved to resume my journey with out further delay no time was to be lost it was at this moment that i had reason to bless the thoughtfulness of my uncle when he refused to allow the eider hunter to close the orifices of the hot springthat small fissure in the great mass of granite this beneficient spring after having saved us from thirst during so many days would now en able me to regain the right road having come to this mental decision i made up my mind before i started upwards that ablution would certainly do me a great deal of good i stopped to plunge my hands and forehead in the pleasant water of the hansbach stream blessing its presence as a certain consolation conceive my horror and stupefactioni was treading a hard dusty shingly road of granite the stream on which i reckoned had wholly dis appeared chapter xxiv lost no words in any human language can depict my utter despair i was literally buried alive with no other expectation before me than to die in all the slow horrible torture of hun ger and thirst mechanically i crawled about feel ing the dry and arid rock never to my fancy had i ever felt anything so dry but i frantically asked myself how had i lost the course of the flowing stream there could be no doubt it had ceased to flow in the gallery in which i now was i began to understand the cause of the strange silence which prevailed when last i tried if any appeal from my companions might perchance reach my ear it so happened that when i first took ail impru dent step in the wrong direction i did not perceive the absence of the allimportant stream it was now quite evident that when we halted another tunnel must have received the waters of the little torrent and that i had unconsciously entered a different gallery to what unknown depths had my compan ions gone where was i how to get back clue or landmark there was absolutely none my feet left no signs on the granite and shingle my brain throbbed with agony as i tried to discover the solution of this terrible
