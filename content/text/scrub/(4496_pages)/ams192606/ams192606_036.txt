a trip to the center of the earth pass it roared it yelled it shrieked with glee as of demons let loose the darkness increased and became indeed darkness visible the raft rose and fell with the storm and bound ed over the waves my uncle was cast headlong up on the deck with great difficulty i dragged my self towards him he was holding on with might and main to the end of a cable and appeared to gaze with pleasure and delight at the spectacle of the unchained elements hans never moved a muscle his long hair driv en hither and thither by the tempest and scattered wildly over his motionless face gave him a most extraordinary appearancefor every single hair was illuminated by little sparkling sprigs his countenance presented the extraordinary appear ance of an antediluvian man a true contemporary of the megatherium still the mast holds good against the storm the sail spreads out and fills like a soap bubble about to burst the raft rushes on at a pace impossible to estimate the sail the sail i cried making a trumpet of my hands and then endeavoring to lower it let it alone said my uncle more exasperated than ever nej said hans gently shaking his head the rain formed a roaring cataract before this horizon of which we were in search and to which we were rushing like madmen but before this wilderness of waters reached us the mighty veil of cloud was torn in twain the sea began to foam wildly to the fearful claps of thunder were added dazzling flashes of lightning such as i had never seen the flashes crossed one another hurled from every side while the thunder came pealing like an echo the mass of vapor becomes incandescent the hailstones which strike the metal of our boots and our weapons are actually luminous the waves they rise appear to be fireeating monsters be neath which seethes an intense fire their cnfcts surmounted by combs of flame my eyes are dazzled blinded by the intensity of light my ears are deaf ened by the awful roar of the elements i am com pelled to hold on to the mast which bends like a reed beneath the violence of the storm to which none ever before seen by mariners bore any re semblance here my traveling notes become very incomplete loose and vague i have only been able to make out one or two fugitive observations dotted down in a mere mechanical way but even their brevity even their obscurity show the emotions which overcame me sunday august d where have we got to in what region are we wandering we are still car ried forward with inconceivable rapidity the night has been fearful something not to be de scribed the storm shows no signs of cessation we exist in the midst of an uproar which has no name the detonations as of artillery are incessant our ears literally bleed we are unable to exchange a word or hear each other speak the light never ceases to flash for a single instant i can see the zigzags after a rapid dart strike the arched roof of this mightiest of mighty vaults if it were to give way and fall upon us other lightnings plunge their forked streaks in every direction and take the form of globes of fire which explode like bomb shells over a beleaguered city the general crash and roar do not apparently increase it has already gone far beyond what human ear can appreciate if all the powdermagazines in the world were to explode together it would be impossible for us to hear worse noise there is a constant emission of light from the stormclouds the electric matter is incessantly re leased innumerable columns of water rush up like waterspouts and fall back upon the surface of the ocean in foam whither are we going my uncle still lies at full length upon the raft without speak ingwithout taking any note of time monday august this terrible storm will never end why should not this state of the at mosphere so dence and murky once modified be come permanent we are utterly broken and harassed by fatigue hans remains just as usual the raft runs to the southeast invariably we have already gone two hundred leagues from the newlydiscovered island about twelve oclock the storm becomes worse than ever we are obliged to fasten every bit of cargo tightly on the deck of the raft or everything would be swept away we tie ourselves to the mast each man lashing the other the waves drive over us so that several times we are actually under water we had been under the painful necessity of ab staining from speech for three days and three nights we opened our mouths we moved our lips but no sound came even when we placed our mouths to each others ears it was the same the wind carried the voice away my uncle once con trived to get his head close to mine after several alirrost vain endeavors he appeared to my nearly exhausted senses to articulate some word i had a jiotion more from intuition than anything else that he said to me we are lost i took out my note book from which under the most desperate circumstances i never parted and wyote a few words as legibly as i couldtake in sail with a deep sigh he nodded his head and acquiesced his head had scarcely time to fall back in the position from which he had momentarily raised it when a disc or ball of fire appeared on the very edge of the raftour devoted our doomed craft the mast and sail were carried away bodily and i saw them swept away to a prodigious height like a kite we were frozen actually shivering with terror the ball of fire haft white half azurecolored about the size of a teninch bombshell moved along turn ing with prodigious rapidity to leeward of the storm it ran about here there and everywhere it clambered up one of the bulwarks of the raft it leaped upon the sack of provisions and then finally descended lightly fell like a foot ball and landed on our powder barrel horrible situation an explosion now seemed inevitable the dazzling disc moved to one side it approached hans who looked at it with singular fixity then it approached my uncle who cast him self on his knees to avoid it it came towards me as
