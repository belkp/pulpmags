 amazing stories eyes and failed she bit desperately into her pigeon drumstick trying to think of something to say when we get back went on arthur meditative ly ill have nothing to dono work or anything ill be broke and out of a job estelle shook her head emphatically arthur paid no attention estelle he said smiling would you like to be out of a job with me estelle turned crimson im not very successful arthur went on sober ly im afraid i wouldnt make a very good hus band im rather worthless and lazy you arent broke in estelle youre youre arthur reached over and took her by the shoulders what he demanded she would not look at him but she did not draw away he held her from him for a moment what am i he demanded again somehow he found himself kissing the tips of her ears her face was buried against his shoulder what am i he repeated sternly her voice was muffled by his coat youreyoure dear she said there was an interlude of about a minute and a half then she pushed him away from her dont she said breathlessly please dont arent you going to marry me he demanded still crimson she nodded shyly he kissed her again please dont she protested she fondled the lapels of his coat quite content to have his arms about her why maynt i kiss you if youre going to marry me arthur demanded she looked up at him with an air of demure primness youyouve been eating pigeon she told him in mock gravity andand your mouth is greasy a geyser effects a happy return it was two weeks later estelle looked out over the now familiar wild landscape it was much the same when she looked far away but near by there were great changes a cleared trail led through the woods to the waterfront and a raft of logs extended out into the river for hundreds of feet both sides of the raft were lined with busy fishermenmen and women too a little to the north of the base of the building a huge mound of earth smoked sullenly the coal in the cellar had given out and charcoal had been found to be the best substitute they could improvise the mound was where the charcoal was made it was heartbreaking work to keep the fires go ing with charcoal because it burned so rapidly in the powerful draft of the furnaces but the original fireroom gang had been recruited to several times its original number from among the towerites and the work was divided until it did not seem hard as estelle looked down two tiny figures sauntered across the clearing from the woods with a heavy animal slung between them one was using a gun as a walkingstick estelle saw the flash of the sun on its polished metal barrel there were a number of indians in the clearing watching with wideopen eyes the activities of the whites dozens of birchbark canoes dotted the hudson each with its load of fishermen in dustriously working for the white people it had been hard to overcome the fear in the indians and they still paid superstitious reverence to the whites but fair dealings coupled with a constant readiness to defend themselves had enabled arthur to in stitute a system of trading for food that had so far proved satisfactory the whites had found spare electriclight bulbs valuable currency in dealing with the redmen pic turewire too was highly prized there was not a picture left hanging in any of the offices metal paperknives bought huge quantities of provisions from the eager indian traders and the story was current in the tower that arthur had received eight canoeloads of corn and vegetables in exchange for a brokendown typewriter no one could guess what the savages wanted with the typewriter but they had carted it away triumphantly estelle smiled tenderly to herself as she remem bered how arthur had been the leading spirit in all the numberless enterprises in which the castaways had been forced to engage he would come to her in a spare ten minutes and tell her how every thing was going he seemed curiously boylike in those moments sometimes he would come straight from the fire roomhe insisted on takingpart in all the more arduous dutieshaving hastily cleaned himself for her inspection snatch a hurried kiss and then go off laughing to help chop down trees for the long fishingraft he had told them how to make char coal had taken a leading part in establishing and maintaining friendly relations with the indians and was now down in the deepest subbasement work ing with a gang of volunteers to try to put the building back where it belonged estelle had said after the collapse of the flooring in the boardroom that she heard a sound like the rushing of waters arthur on examining the floor where the safedeposit vault stood found it had risen an inch on these facts he had built up his theory the building like all modern skyscrapers rested on concrete piles extending down to bedrock in the center of one of those piles there was a hollow tube originally intended to serve as an artesian well the flow had been insufficient and the well had been stopped up arthur of course as an engineer had studied the construction of the building with great care and happened to remember that this partly hollow pile was the one nearest the safedeposit vault the collapse of the boardroom floor had suggested that some change had happened in the building itself and that was found when he saw that the deposit vault had actually risen an inch he at once connected the rise in the flooring above the hollow pile with the pipe in the pile estelle had heard liquid sounds evidently water had been forced into the hollow artesian pipe under an unthinkable pressure when the catastrophe oc curred from the rumbling and the suddenness of the whole catastrophe a volcanic or seismic disturbance was evident the connection of volcanic or seismic action with a flow of water suggested a geyser or a hot spring of some sort probably a spring which
