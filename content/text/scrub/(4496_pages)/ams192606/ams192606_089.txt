 amazing stories foot of the stairs they were about to go up for an inspection of the laboratory and its gruesome contents dr dorp switched on one of the reading lamps and closed the door then he established himself in a comfortable chair with a pile of manuscripts and i followed his example we found essays and articles on almost every subject pertaining to the transmission or generation of life there were papers on anatomy bacteriology cellstructure microbiology and embryology there were trea tises on evolution spontaneous generation and the structures and habits of microorganisms a force ful and extremely impressive essay set forth the astounding theory that all life was merely a form of force generated from matter the reasoning wp of course purely analogical the professors contention stated briefly was that just aselec tricity a force that is invisible and indefinable is generated by the friction of particles of certain kinds of matter so life is generated and springs into being when certain other types of matter come together in the right proportions and combinations what is your opinion of this theory i asked dr dorp it is most cleverly put but false because based on the false premise of the materialists that there are but two things in the universe matter and force they do not recognize the power that con trols the force which moves the matter toward a fixed objective that power is mind thus to them all life and all mind are merely forms of force generated originally from inert matter if the professor succeeded in creating a living thing from inert matter i said it seems to me that he has demonstrated his propostion why because he was experimenting with dead matter and not with mind or living creatures there would be no mind or soul involved to inherit its being from a parent mind or soul a new life entity would be generated as it were from matter which formerly contained no life i think said the doctor quietly you would have stated the proposition more accurately had you said that a life entitya mind without a body had been induced to enter the body synthetically created our discourse was interrupted by chief mcgraw who informed us that we were wanted by the coroner the coroners jury dr dorp did the talking before the coroners jury all theway through his testimony was negative when asked if he had any idea what killed the professor and the policeman he replied that he had several ideas but none of them would be worth bringing before the jury with out more facts to substantiate them i could see that his purpose was to get the inquest over with as soon as possible so we mightcontinue the inves tigation after due deliberation a verdict of death from cause or causes unknown was brought in and the coroner departed with his men now that the inquest is over what do you sug gest mcgraw asked the doctor my suggestion is that we immediately destroy the liquid in the glasslined tank in the laboratory why because i am convinced that it is at least one of the causes of the deaths that have taken place in this house i suppose you have a good reason for your assumption an excellent one i believe while you and your men were searching the house mr evans and i conducted a little investigation of our own we put some of the liquid under the compound micros cope and as we both saw the same things i ain convinced that my eyes did not deceive me tell the chief what you saw evans i described the foam work the granules and the white objects which appeared to be aiive and strug gling to escape all greek to me said the chief what was it the foam work with its accompanying granules closely resembled protoplasm the basic life sub stance and the white things were white blood corpuscles from the veins of a human being they were the strongest of the human body cells to resist assimilation and conse quently the last to succumb the red corpuscles turned the liquid pink for a while but they had disappeared before we made our microscopic exam ination good lord why didnt you tell me this before demanded the chief lets go up and destroy the stuff now those two men up there might be killed any minute we found the two policemen unharmed and made our plans for the destruction of the substance in thetank several demijohns of acid stood under the table and the doctor selected one nearly full of sulphuric acid open the windows he ordered this is going to make a horrible stench then he removed the rubber stopper from the mouth of thedemijohn and i helped him hoist it to the edge of the tank the searing liquid struck the heavy fluid in the tank with a hissing sound and bored into it like hot water poured in a snow bank the jellylike mass quivered slightly and pungent nauseating fumes arose to torment our nostrils then suddenly as if in horrible pain and awak ened to the danger of its dissolution the plasmic substance began to heave and billow toward the top of the tank with a movement suggestive of the writhing of a huge coiled serpent in its death agony by directing the stream of acid at the various peaks that arose we endeavored to keep it all washed down to a common level then a dozen peaks rose simultaneously and i noticed that one was capped with a round ball in the center of which was a black spot the nucleus cried the doctor excitedly shifting the demijohn pour it on the nucleus we were too late the thing upreared itself with amazing speed and lopped over the edge of the tank opposite us we dropped the nearlyemptied demi john into the tank and rushed around to intercept it just in time to see the ball containing the black
