the coming of the ice have mattered little who did win for all the world had become in all except its few remaining pre judices a single race and nothing was changed when it was all rebuilt again under a single gov ernment i saw the first of the strange creatures who appeared among us in the year men who were later known to be from the planet venus but they were repulsed for they were savages com pared with the earthmen although they were about equal to the people of my own century those of them who did not perish of the cold after the intense warmth of their world and those who were not killed by our hands those few returned silently home again and i have always regretted that i had not the courage to go with them i watched a time when the world reached perfec tion in mechanics when men could accomplish any thing with a touch of the finger strange men these creatures of the hundredth century men with huge brains and tiny shriveled bodies atrophied limbs and slow ponderous movements on their little conveyances it was i with my ancient compunc tions who shuddered when at last they put to death all the perverts the criminals and the insane ridding the world of the scum for which they had no more need it was then that i was forced to produce my tattered old papers proving my identity and my story they knew it was true in some strange fashion of theirs and thereafter i was kept on exhibition as an archaic survival i saw the world made immortal through the new invention of a man called kathol who used some what the same method legend decreed had been used upon me i observed the end of speech of all perceptions except one when men learned to communicate directly by thought and to receive directly into the brain all the myriad vibrations of the universe all these things i saw and more until that time when there was no more discovery but a perfect world in which there was no need for anything but memory men ceased to count time at last several hundred years after the th dynasty from the last war or as we would have counted in my time about ad official records of time were no longer kept carefully they fell into dis use men began to forget years to forget time at all of what significance was time when one was immortal after long long uncounted centuries a time came when the days grew noticeably colder slowly the winters became longer and the summers dimin ished to but a month or two fierce storms raged endlessly in winter and in summer sometimes there was severe frost sometimes there was only frost in the high places and in the north and the sub equatorial south the snow came and would not go men died by the thousands in the higher lati tudes new york became after awhile the furthest habitable city north an arctic city where warmth seldom penetrated and great fields of ice began to make their way southward grinding before them the brittle remains of civilizations covering over relentlessly all of mans proud work snow appeared in florida and italy one summer in the end snow was there always men left new york chicago paris yokohama and everywhere they traveled by the millions southward perishing as they went pursued by the snow and the cold and that inevitable field of ice they were feeble creatures when the cold first came upon them but i speak in terms of thousands of years and they turned every weapon of science to the recovery of their physical power for they foresaw that the only chance for survival lay in a hard strong body as for me at last i had found a use for my few powers for my physique was the finest in that world it was but little comfort however for we were all united in our awful fear of that cold and that grinding field of ice all the great cities were deserted we would catch silent fearful glimpses of them as we sped on in our machines over the snowgreat hungry haggard skeletons of cities shrouded in banks of snow snow that the wind rustled through desolate streets where the cream of human life once had passed in calm security yet still the ice pursued for men had forgotten about that last ice age when they ceased to reckon time when they lost sight of the future and steeped themselves in memories they had not remembered that a time must come when ice would lie white and smooth over all the earth when the sun would shine bleakly between unending intervals of dim twilit snow and sleet slowly the ice pursued us down the earth until all the feeble remains of civilization were gathered in egypt and india and south america the deserts flowered again but the frost would come always to bite the tiny crops for still the ice came all the world now but for a narrow strip about the equator was one great silent desolate vista of stark ice plains ice that brooded above the hidden ruins of cities that had endured for hundreds of thousands of years it was terrible to imagine the awful solitude and the endless twilight that lay on these places and the grim snow sailing in silence over all and so we existed hoping still that the ice might go again until at last it closed in upon us from north and south it came from every side and the boundaries of east and west were the frozen oceans fathoms deep in ice it closed about us it surrounded us on all sides until life remained only in a few scattered clearings all about that equa tor of the globe with an eternal fire going to hold away the hungry ice perpetual winter reigned now and we were become terrorstricken beasts that preyed on each other for a life already doomed ah but i i the archaic survival i had my revenge then with my great physique and strong jaws god let me think of something else those men who lived upon each otherit was horrible and i was one so inevitably the ice closed in one day the men of our tiny clearing were but a score we hud dled about our dying fire of bones and stray logs we said nothing we just sat in deep wordless thoughtless silence we were the last outpost of mankind i think suddenly something very noble must have transformed these creatures to a semblance of what they had been of old i saw in their eyes the question they sent from one to another and in every eye i saw that the answer was yes with continued on page
