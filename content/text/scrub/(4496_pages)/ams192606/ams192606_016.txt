a trip to the center of the earth ing every now and then sharp turns in fact it had all the appearance of a labyrinth its direction however was in general towards the southwest my uncle made several pauses in order to consult his compass the gallery now began to trend down wards in a horizontal direction with about two inches of fall in every furlong the murmuring stream flowed quietly at our feet i could not but compare it to some familiar spirit guiding us through the earth and i dabbled my fingers in its tepid water which sang like a naiad as we pro gressed my good humor began to assume a myth ological character as for my uncle he began to complain of the horizontal character of the road his route he found began to be indefinitely prolonged instead of sliding down the celestial ray according to his expression but we had no choice and as long as our road led towards the centerhowever little progress we made there was no reason to complain moreover from time to time the slopes were much greater the naiad sang more loudly and we began to dip downwards in earnest i felt no further painful sen sation i had not yet recovered from the excitement of thediscovery of water that day and the next we did a considerable amount of horizontal and relatively very little ver tical traveling on friday evening the tenth of july according to our estimation we ought to have been thirty leagues to the southeast of reykjawik and about two leagues and a half deep we now re ceived a rather startling surprise under our feet there opened a horrible well my uncle was so delighted that he actually clapped his handsas he saw how steep and sharp was the de scent ah ah he cried in rapturous delight this will take us a long way look at the projec tions of the rock hah he exclaimed its a fear ful staircase hans however who in all our troubles had neves given up the ropes took care so to dispose of thm as to prevent any accidents our descent thene gan i dare not call it a perilous descent fpr i was already too familiar with that sort of work to lookx upon it as anything but a very ordinary affair this well was a kind of narrow opening in the massive granite of the kind known as a fissure the con traction of the terrestrial scaffolding when it sud denly cooled had been evidently the cause if it had ever served in former times as a kind of fun nel through which passed the eruptive masses vom ited by sneffels i was at a loss to explain how it showed no mark we were in fact descending a spiral something like those winding staircases in use in modern houses we were compelled every quarter of an hour or thereabouts to sit down in order to rest our legs our calves ached we then seated ourselves on some projecting rock with our legs hanging over and gossiped while we ate a mouthfuldrinking still from the pleasantly warm running stream which had not deserted us it is scarcely necessary to say that in this curi ously shaped fissure the hansbach had become a cascade to the detriment of its size but it was still sufficient and more than sufficient for our wants besides we knew that as soon as the declivity ceased to be so abrupt the stream must resume itrâť peaceful course at this moment it reminded me of my uncle his impatience and rage while when it flowed more peacefully i pictured to myself the placidity of the icelandic guide during the whole of two days the sixth and seventh of july we followed the extraordinary spiral staircase of the fissure penetrating two leagues farther into the crust of the earth which placed us five leagues below the level of the sea on the eighth however at twelve oclock in the day the fissure suddenly assumed a much more gentle slope still trending in a southeast direction the road now became comparatively easy and at the same time dreadfully monotonous it would have been difficult for matters to have turned out other wise our peculiar journey had no chance of being diversified by landscape and scenery at all events such was then my idea at length on wednesday the fifteenth we were actually seven leagues twentyone miles below the surface of the earth and fifty leagues distant from the mountain of sneffels though if the truth be told we were very tired our health had resisted all suffering and was most satisfactory our travelers box of medicaments had not even been opened my uncle was careful to note every hour the indica tions of the compass of the manometer and of the thermometer all of which he afterwards published in his elaborate philosophical and scientific account of our remarkable voyage he was therefore able to give an exact relation of the situation therefore when he informed me that we were fifty leagues in a horizontal direction distant from our starting point i couldnt suppress a loud exclamation what is the matter now cried my uncle nothing very important only an idea has en tered my head was my reply well out with it my boy it is my opinion that if your calculations are correct we are no longer under iceland do you think so we can very easily find out i replied pulling out the map and compasses you see i said after careful measurement that i am not mistaken we are far beyond cape portland and those fifty leagues to the southeast will take us into the open sea under the open sea cried my uncle rubbing his hands with a delighted air yes i cried no doubt the old ocean flows over our heads well my dear boy what can be more natural do you not know that in the neighborhood of new castle there are coal mines which have been worked far out under the sea now my worthy uncle the professor no doubt regarded this discovery as a simple fact but to me the idea was by no means a pleasant one and yet when one came to think the matter over seriously what mattered it whether the plains and mountains of iceland were suspended over our devoted heads or the mighty billows of the atlantic ocean the whole question rested on the solidity of the granite roof above us however i soon got used to the idea for the passage now level now running down and still always to the southeast kept going deeper
