 amazing stories chapter xxx terrific saurian combat saturday august the sea still retains its uniform monotony the same leaden hue the same eternal glare from above no indi cation of land being in sight the horizon appears to retreat before us more and more as we advance my head is still dull and heavy from the effects of my extraordinary dream which i cannot as yet banish from my mind the professor who has not dreamed is however in one of his morose and un accountable humors spends his time in scanning the horizon at every point of the compass his telescope is raised every moment to his eyes and when be finds nothing to give any clew to our where abouts he assumes a napoleonic attitude and walks anxiously i remarked that my uncle the professor had a strong tendency to resume his old impatient char acter and i could not but make a note of this dis agreeable circumstance i saw clearly that it had required all the influence of my danger and suffer ing to extract from him one scintillation of hu mane feeling now that i was quite recovered his original nature had conquered and obtained the upper hand you seem uneasy uncle said i when for about the hundredth time he put down his telescope and walked up and down muttering to himself no i am not uneasy he replied in a dry harsh tone by no means perhaps i should have said impatient i replied softening the force of my remark enough to make me so i think and yet we are advancing at a rate seldom at tained by a raft i remarked what matters that cried my uncle i am not vexed at the rate we go at but i am annoyed to find the sea so much vaster than i expected i then recollected that the professor before our departure had estimated the length of this sub terranean ocean as at most about fifty leagues now we had traveled at least over thrice that dis tance without discovering any trace of the distant shore i began to understand my uncles anger we are not going down suddenly exclaimed the professor we are not progressing with our great discoveries all this is utter loss of time after all i did not come from home to undertake a party of pleasure this voyage on a raft over a pond annoys and wearies me he called this adventurous journey a party of pleasure and this great inland sea a pond but argued i if we have followed the route indicated by the great saknussem we cannot be going far wrong that is the question as the great the immor tal shakespeare has it are we following the route indicated by that wondrous sage did saknussem ever fall in with this great sheet of water if he did did he cross it i began to fear that the rivulet we adopted for a guide has led us wrong in any case we can never regret having come thus far it is worth the whole journey to have enjoyed this magnificent spectacleit is something to have seen i care nothing about seeing nor about magni ficent spectacles i came down into the interior of the earth with an object and that object i mean to attain dont talk to me about admiring scenery or any other sentimental trash after this i thought it well to hold my tongue and allow the professor to bite his lips until the blood came without further remark at six oclock in the evening our matteroffact guide hans asked for his weeks salary and re ceiving his three rixdollars put them carefully in his pocket he was perfectly contented and satis fied sunday th august nothing new to record the same weather as before the wind has a slight tendency to freshen up with signs of an approach ing gale when i awoke my first observation was in regard to the intensity of the light i keep on fearing day after day that the extraordinary elec tric phenomenon should become first obscured and then go wholly out leaving us in total darkness nothing of this kind occurs however the shadow of the raft its mast and sails is clearly distinguish ed on the surface of the water this wondrous sea is after all immense in ex tent it must be quite as wide as the mediterra neanor perhaps even as the great atlantic ocean why after all should it not be so my uncle has on more than one occasion tried deep sea soundings he tied one of our heaviest crowbars to the end of a cord which he allowed to run out to the extent of two hundred fathoms we had the greatest difficulty in hoisting in our novel kind of lead when the crowbar was finally dragged on board hans called my attention to some singular marks uponfits surface the piece of iron looked as if it had been crushed between two very hard substances i looked at our worthy guide with an inquiring glance taender said he of course i was at a loss to understand i turned round towards my uncle absorbed in gloomy re flections i had little wish to disturb him from his reverie accordingly turned once more toward our worthy icelander hans very quietly and signifi cantly opened his mouth once or twice as if in the act of biting and in this way made me understand his meaning teeth cried i with stupefaction as i examined the bar of iron with more attention yes there can be no doubt about the matter the indentations on the bar of iron are the marks of teeth what jaws must the owner of such molars be possessed of have we then come upon a mons ter of unknown species which still exists within the vast waste of watersa monster more voracious than a shark more terrible and bulky than the whale i am unable to withdraw my eyes from the bar of iron actually halfcrushed is then my dream about to come truea dread and terrible reality all day my thoughts were bent upon these speculations and my imagination scarcely regained a degree of calmness and power of reflection until after a sleep of many hours this sunday as other sundays we observed as a day of rest and pious meditation monday august th i have been trying to realize from
