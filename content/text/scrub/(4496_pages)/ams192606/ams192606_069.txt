 amazing stories what does that crack in the floor mean it means were going to get back where we belong arthur cried jubilantly it means im on the track of the whole trouble it means every things going to be all right he prowled about the vault exultantly noting exactly how the cracks in the flooring ran and seeing in each a corroboration of his theory ill have to make some inspections in the cellar he went on happily but im nearly sure im on the right track and can figure out a corrective how soon can we hope to start back asked estelle eagerly arthur hesitated then a great deal of the excite ment ebbed from his face leaving it rather worried and stern it may be a month or two months or a year he answered gravely i dont know if the first thing i try will work it wont be long if we have to experiment i darent guess how long we may be buthis chin set firmlywere going to get back estelle looked at him speculatively her own expression grew a little worried too but in a month she said dubiously wethere is hardly any hope of our finding food for two thou sand people for a month is there weve got to arthur declared we cant hope to get that much food from the indians it will be days before theyll dare to come back to their vil lage if they ever come it will be weeks before we can hope to have them earnestly at work to feed us and thats leaving aside the question of how well communicate with them and how well manage to trade with them frankly i think everybody is going to have to draw his belt tight before we get throughif we do some of us will get along any way estelles eyes opened wide as the meaning of his last sentence penetrated her mind you meanthat all of us wont im going to take care of you arthur said gravely but there are liable to be lively doings around here when people begin to realize theyre really in a tight fix for food im going to get van deventer to help me organize a police band to en force martial law we mustnt have any disorder thats certain and i dont trust a citybred man in a pinch unless i know him he stooped and picked up a revolver from the floor left there by one of the bank watchmen when he fled in the belief that the building was falling wild pigeons dash against the building arthur stood at the window of his office and stared out toward the west the sun was setting but upon what a scene where from this same windoiy arthur had seen the sun setting behind the jersey hills all edged with the angular roofs of factories with their chim neys emitting columns of smoke he now saw the same sun sinking redly behind a mass of luxuriant foliage and where he was accustomed to look upon the tops of high buildingseach entitled to the name of skyscraperhe now saw miles and miles of waving green branches the wide hudson flowed on placidly all unruffled by the arrival of this strange monument upon its shoresthe same hudson arthur knew as a busy thoroughfare of puffing steamers and chugging launches two or three small streams wandered unconcernedly across the land that arthur had known as the most closely builtup territory on earth and far far below himarthur had to lean well out of his window to see itstood a collection of tiny wigwams those small bark structures rep resented the original metropolis of new york his telephone rang van deventer was on the wire the exchange in the building was still work ing van deventer wanted arthur to come down to his private office there were still a great many things to be settledthe arrangements for com mandeering offices for sleeping quarters for the women and numberless other details the men who seemed to have best kept their heads were gathering there to settle upon a course of action arthur glanced out of the window again before going to the elevator he saw a curiously compact dark cloud moving swiftly across the sky to the west miss woodward he said sharply what is that estelle came to the window and looked they are birds she told him birds flying in a group ive often seen them in the country though never as many as that how do you catch birds arthur asked her i know about shooting them and so on but we havent guns enough to count could we catch them in traps do you think i wouldnt be surprised said estelle thought fully but it would be hard to catch many come downstairs directed arthur you know as much as any of the men here and more than most apparently were going to make you show us how to catch things estelle smiled a trifle wanly arthur led the way to the elevator in the car he noticed that she looked distressed whats the matter he asked you arent really frightened are you no she answered shakily butim rather upset about this thing its soso terrible some how to be back here thousands of miles or years away from all ones friends and everybody pleasearthur smiled encouragingly at her please count me your friend wont you she nodded but blinked back some tears arthur would have tried to hearten her further but the elevator stopped at their floor they walked into the room where the meeting of cool heads was to take place no more than a dozen men were in there talking earnestly but dispiritedly when arthur and estelle entered van deventer came over to greet them weve got to do something he said in a low voice a wave of homesickness has swept over the whole place look at those men every one is thinking about his family and contrasting his cozy fire side with all that wilderness outside you dont seem to be worried arthur observed with a smile van deventers eyes twinkled im a bachelor he said cheerfully and i live in a hotel ive been longing for a chance to see some real excitement for thirty years business
