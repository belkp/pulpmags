 amazing stories it was some years later that i happened to notice it again it had not given birth to any young but i was amazed to note that it had apparently grown no older it seemed precisely in the same state of growth in which i had left it from that i built up i reexamined the guinea pig and observed it carefully i need not detail my studies but in the end i found that my mistake had in reality been a momentous discovery i found that i had only to close certain organs to rearrange certain ducts and to open certain dormant organs and mirabile dictu the whole process of reproduc tion was changed you have heard of course that our bodies are continually changing hour by hour minute by min ute so that every few years we have been literally reborn some such principle as this seems to operate in reproduction except that instead of the old body being replaced by the new and in its form approximately the new body is created apart from it it is the creation of children that causes us to die it would seem because if this activity is so to speak dammed up or turned aside into new channels the reproduction operates on the old body renewing it continually it is very obscure and very absurd is it not but the most absurd part of it is that it is true whatever the true explanation may be the fact remains that the operation can be done that it actually prolongs life indefinitely and that i alone know the secret sir john told me a very great deal more but after all i think it amounted to little more than this it would be impossible for me to express the great hold his discovery took upon mymind the moment he recounted it from the very first under the spell of his personality i believed and i knew he was speaking the truth and it opened up before me new vistas i began to see myself become sud denly eternal never again to know the fear of death i could see myself storing up century after century an amplitude of wisdom and experience that would make me truly a god sir john i cried long before he was finished you must perform that operation on me i but dennell you are too hasty you must not put yourself so rashly into my hands you have perfected the operation havent you that is true he said you must try it out on somebody must you not yes of course and yetsomehow dennell i am afraid i cannot help feeling that man is not yet preparedfor such a vast thing there are sac rifices one must give up love and all sensual pleasure this operation not only takes away the mere fact of reproduction but it deprives one of all the things that go with sex all love all sense of beauty all feeling for poetry and the arts it leaves only the few emotions selfish emotions that are necessary to selfpreservation do you not see one becomes an intellect nothing morea cold apotheosis of reason and i for one cannot face such a thing calmly but sir john like many fears it is largely hor rible in the foresight after you have changed your nature you cannot regret it what you are would be as horrible an idea to you afterwards as the thought of what you will be seems now true true i know it but it is hard to face nevertheless i am not afraid to face it i said a little boast fully you do not understand it dennell i am afraid and i wonder whether you or i or any of us on this earth are ready for such a step after all to make a race deathless one should be sure it is a perfect race sir john i said it is not you who have to face this nor any one else in the world till you are ready but i am firmly resolved and i demand it of you as my friend well we argued much further but in the end i won sir john promised to perform the operation three days later but do you perceive now what i had for gotten during all that discussion the one thing i had thought i could never forget so long as i lived not even for an instant it was my love for alice i had forgotten that i cannot write here all the infinity of emotions i experienced later when with alice in my arms it suddenly came upon me what i had done ages agoi have forgotten how to feel i could name now a thousand feelings i usedto have but i can no longer even understand them for only the heart can understand the heart and the intellect only the intellect with alice in my arms i told the whole story it was she who with her quick instinct grasped what i had never noticed but carl she cried dont you seeit will mean that we can never be married and for the first time i understood if only i could recapture some conception of that love i have always known since the last shred of comprehension slipped from me that i lost something very wonderful when i lost love but what does it matter i lost alice too and i suppose i could not have kncwn love again without her we were very sad and very tragic that night for hours and hours we argued the question over but i felt somewhat that i was inextricably caught in my fate that i could not retreat now from my resolve i was perhaps very schoolboyish but i felt that it would be cowardice to back out now but it was alice again who perceived a final aspect of the matter carl she said to me her lips very close to mine it need not come between our love after all ours would be a poor sort of love if it were not more of the mind than of the flesh we shall remain lovers but we shall forget mere carnal desire i shall sub mit to that operation too and i could not shake her from her resolve i would speak of danger that i could not let her face but after the fashion of women she disarmed me with the accusation that i did not love her that i did not want her love that i was trying to escape from love what answer had i for that but that i loved her and would do anything in the world not to lose her i have wondered sometimes since whether we might have known the love of the mind is love something entirely of the flesh something created by an ironic god merely to propagate his race or can there be love without emotion love without
