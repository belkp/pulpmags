the runaway skyscraper everybody here will be better for hearing it any way everybody will have to know it before night i took over the restaurant as you suggested and posted some of the men from the bank that i knew i could trust about the doors but there was hardly any use in doing it the restaurant stocks up in the afternoon as most of its business is in the morning and at noon it only carries a days stock of foodstuffs and the the cataclysm or whatever it was came at three oclock there is practically nothing in the place we couldnt make sandwiches for half the women that are caught with us let alone the men every body will go hungry tonight there will be no breakfast toiporrow nor anything to eat until we either make arrangements with the indians for some supplies or else get food for ourselves arthur leaned his jaw on his hand and considered a slow flush crept over his cheek he was getting his fighting blood up at school when he began to flush slowly his schoolmates had known the symptom and avoided his wrath now he was growing angry with mere circumstances but it would be none the less unfor tunate for those circumstances well he said at last deliberately weve got to whats that there was a great creaking and groaning sud denly a sort of vibration was felt under foot the floor began to take on a slight slant great heaven some one cried the buildings turning over and well be buried in the ruins the tilt of the floor became more pronounced an empty chair slid to one end of the room there was a crash arthur and estelle in conference arthur woke to find some one tugging at his shoulders trying to drag him from beneath the heavy table which had wedged itself across his feet and pinned him fast while a flying chair had struck him on the head oh come and help estelles voice was calling deliberately somebody come and help hes caught in here she was sobbing in a combination of panic and some unknown emotion help me please she gasped then her voice broke despondently but she never ceased to tug ineffectually at chamberlain trying to drag him out of the mass of wreckage arthur moved a little dazedly are you alive she called anxiously are you alive hurry oh hurry and wriggle out the buildings falling to pieces im all right arthur said weakly you get out before it all comes down i wont leave you she declared where are you caught are you badly hurt hurry please hurry arthur stirred but could not loosen his feet he halfrolled over and the table moved as if it had been precariously balanced and slid heavily to one side with estelle still tugging at him he ma naged to get to his feet on the slanting floor and started about him arthur continued to stare about no danger he said weakly just the floor of the one room gave way the aftermath of the rockflaw he made his way across the splintered flooring and piledup chairs were on top of the safedeposit vault he said thats why we didnt fall all the way to the floor below i wonder how were going to get down estelle followed him still frightened for fear of the building falling upon them some of the long floorboards stretched over the edge of the vault and rested on a tall bronze grating that protected the approach to the massive strongbox arthur tested them with his foot they seem to be pretty solid he said tenta tively his strength was coming back to him every mo ment he had been no more than stunned he walked out on the planking to the bronze grating and turned if you dont get dizzy you might come on he said we can swing down the grille here to the floor estelle followed gingerly and in a moment they were safely below the corridor was quite empty when the crash came estelle explained her voice shaking with the reaction from her fear of a moment ago every one thought the building was coming to pieces and ran out im afraid theyve all run away theyll be back in a little while arthur said quietly they went along the big marble corridor to the same western door out of which they had first gone to see the indian village as they emerged into the sunlight they met a few of the people who had already recovered from their panic and were re turning a crowd of respectable size gathered in a few moments all still pale and shaken but coming back to the building which was their refuge arthur leaned wearily against the cold stone it seemed to vibrate under his touch he turned quickly to estelle feel this he exclaimed she did so ive been wondering what that rumble was she said ive been hearing it ever since we landed here but didnt understand where it came from you hear a rumble arthur asked puzzled i cant hear anything it isnt as loud as it was but i hear it estelle insisted its very deep like the lowest possible bass note of an organ you couldnt hear the shrill whistle when we were coming here arthur exclaimed suddenly and you cant hear the squeak of a bat of course your ears are pitched lower than usual and you can hear sounds that are lower than i can hear listen carefully does it sound in the least like a liquid rushing through somewhere yyes said estelle hesitatingly somehow i dont quite understand how it gives me the im pression of a tidal flow or something of that sort arthur rushed indoors when estelle followed him she found him excitedly examining the marble floor about the base of the vault its cracked he said excitedly its cracked the vault rose all of an inch estelle looked and saw the cracks
