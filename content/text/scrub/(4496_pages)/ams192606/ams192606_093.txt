 amazing stories devised a machine that worked with a phonograph when the letter was spoken the vibiation of the diaphragm would turn on the proper current to strike the letter how about capital letters in dictating it is necessary to use the prefix cap when you wish the next letter to be a capital thus if you were dictating the name dickens you would have to say cap dickens and the machine would write the word properly with the capital d flushed with my success i decided to go further and write whole syllables instead of letters by using the phonograph there was no limit to the number of different keys i would use hence i could have separate keys for thousands of syllables al though the typewriter itself needed but twenty six letters how did you manage that each syllable key was so arranged that when depressed it switched on in turn all the letters which spelt the syllable thus when i spoke the syllable be the key tuned to work when this sound was uttered received the electric current and in de scending it switched a second electric current on to the letters b and e in turn so that these two letters were written on the paper a man could then dictate his letters to the machine just as he would to a stenographer how about syllables that sound alike but are spelled differently like pa in paper and pay ah that was the stumbling block to avoid it i made my first machine to write italian as in that language words are spelt as they are pronounced but i found that even in english there were not so many syllables that sound alike and are spelt dif ferently and i realized it would be a very easy matter for the dictator to learn to pronounce them slightly different thus the syllables dough doe and do could be pronounced somewhat as they are spelt a man could learn the proper pronunciation in an hour and the machine would then spell each properly then you succeeded perfectly my first machine had to be tuned to suit the voice of the dictator but experience soon taught me to leave enough play so that the machine would answer to any voice try it your self and see how it works dont shout just speak quietly into the mouthpiece just as you would at a telephone pep accordingly took up the mouthpiece and spoke a few sentences with some coaching from the doctor as to the proper pronunciation and was delighted to see that the machine typewrote from her dictation without a single error thats great cried pep isnt it i was so delighted with my success that i didnt stop there it was an easy matter to make a phonographic record that would repeat the dictation automatically as often as required and thus make a thousand typewritten copies from dictation if desired even this didnt satisfy me i resolved to go a step further and build a typewriter that would trans late my dictation automatically into several different languages i dictated in english and the machine at iny dictation typewrote copies in english french german and whatever other language i desired but objected pep that is impossible you cant make a machine think you cant translate without thinking and no steel springs electric currents can ever be made to think doctor hackensaw laughed that isnt the first impossible thing that ive made possible pep said he as a matter of fact the thing is simple in theorythough it is complex in practice if it were sufficient to translate word for word the prob lem would be easy say there are a hundred thou sand words in use in the english language it would only be necessary to have one hundred thou sand keys to spell the corresponding word in the foreign language it would be no more difficult than my dictation typewriter though it would require more keys but the problem is far more complex words spelt alike in english such as row a line and row the verb would have to be translated differ ently into german or french it is therefore neces sary to make these similar words different when dictating i accomplish this by saying row row row according to the meaning of the word i use the proper german equivalent is then released of course this means that the dictator must spend months in learning to dictate but he need know only english and his dictation will be automatically translated into any language de sired how about idioms special phrases proverbs and so on each idiom must of course have a key of its own this necessarily multiplies the number of keys all the keys you see in this room are parts of ray machine for translating into french my inversion keys will give you some idea of the many problems i had to meet and solve in french every noun is either masculine or feminine and its adjec tives must agree with the noun in gender for example horse is masculine and table is feminine so a good horse must be translated un bon cheval and a good table une bonne table in french too most adjectives follow the noun instead of preceding it as in english a french man does not say a black horse he says un cheval noir ie a horse black also french verbs must agree with their subject then as you re marked there are a large number of idiomatic phrases all these difficulties however i over come by an arrangement by which no typewriting is done before a complete sentence is dictated au tomatic inversion keys enable me to get the proper construction of words and their proper termina tions i dont understand you i will explain the adjective black in french may be either noir noire noirs or noires according to the gender and number of the noun that follows my key for the adjective tblack can write any one of these four words if the first nounkey that follows is masculine plural it is provided with a finger that turns around the key black so as to write the word noirs as the adjective black must always follow the noun the key black is also pro vided with an inversion device that prevents it from typewriting its word until the noun that follows it is typewritten so that if i dictate the words
