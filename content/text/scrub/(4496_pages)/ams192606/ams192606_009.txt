 amazing stories at six oclock in the evening after a very weari some journey but one not so tiring as before we had made six miles towards the southward but had not gone more than a mile downwards my uncle as usual gave the signal to halt we ate our meal in thoughtful silence and then retired to sleep our arrangements for the night were very primitive and simple a traveling rug in which each rolled himself was all our bedding we had no necessity to fear cold or any unpleasant visit travelers who bury themselves in the wilds and depths of the african desert who seek profit and pleasure in the forests of the new world are com pelled to take it in turn to watch during the hours of sleep but in this region of the earth absolute soli tude and complete security reigned supreme after a nights sweet repose we awoke fresh and ready for action there being nothing to detain us we started on our journey we continued to burrow through the lava tunnel as before it was impossi ble to make out through what soil we were making way the tunnel moreover instead of going down into the bowels of the earth became absolutely hori zontal i even thought after some examination that we were actually tending upwards about ten oclock in the day this state of things became so clear that finding the change very fatiguing i was obliged to slacken my pace and finally to come to a halt well said the professor quickly what is the matter the fact is i am dreadfully tired was my earnest reply what cried my uncle tired after a three hours walk and by so easy a road easy enough i dare say but very fatiguing but how can that be when all we have to do is to go downwards i beg your pardon sir for some time i have noticed that we are going upwards upwards cried my uncle shrugging his shoulders how can that be there can be no doubt about it for the last half hour the slopes have been upwardand if we go on in this way much longer we shall find ourselves back in iceland my uncle shook his head with the air of a man who does not want to be convinced i tried to con tinue the conversation he would not answer me but once more gave the signal of departure his silence i thought was only caused by concentrated illtemper however this might be i once more took up my load and resolutely followed hans who was now in advance of my uncle i did not like to be beaten or even distanced the very idea of being left behind lost in that terrible labyrinth made me shiver as with the ague besides if the ascending path was more arduous and painful to clamber i had one source of secret consolation and delight it was to all appearance taking us back to the surface of the earth that in itself was hopeful every step i took confirmed me in my belief and i began already to build castles in the air in relation to my marriage with my pretty little cousin about twelve oclock there was a great and sudden change in the aspect of the rocky sides of the gal lery i first noticed it from the diminution of the rays of light which cast back the reflection of the lamp from being coated with shining and re splendent lava it became living rock the sides were sloping walls which sometimes became almost vertical we were now in what the geological pro fessors call a state of transition in the period of silurian rocks i can see clearly now i cried the sediment from the waters which once covered the whole earth formed during the second period of its existence these schists and these calcareous rocks we are turning our backs on the granite rocks i might just as well have kept my observations to myself my geological enthusiasm got the better of my cooler judgment however and professor ilardwigg heard my observations what is the matter now he said in a tone of great gravity well cried i do you not see these different layers of calcareous rocks and the first indication of slate strata well what then we have arrived at that period of the worlds existence when the first plants and the first animals made their appearance you think so yes look examine and judge for yourself i induced the professor with some difficulty to cast the light of his lamp on the sides of the long wind ing gallery i expected some exclamation to burst from his lips i was very much mistaken the worthy professor never spoke a word it was impossible to say whether he understood me or not perhaps it was possible that in his pride my uncle and a learned professorhe did not like to own that he was wrong in having chosen the eastern tunnel or was he determined at any price to go to the end of it it was quite evident we had left the region of lava and that the road by which we were going could not take us back to the great crater of mount sneffels at all events if i am right i thought to myself i must certainly find some remains of primitive plants and it will be absolutely necessary to give way to such indubita ble evidence let us have a good search i accordingly lost opportunity of searching and had not gone more than about a hundred yards when the evidence i sought for cropped up in the most incontestable manner before my eyes it was quite natural that i should expect to find these signs for during the silurian period the seas contained no fewer than fifteen hundred different animal and veg etable species my feet so long accustomed to the hard and arid lava soil suddenly found themselves treading on a kind of soft dust the remains of plants and shells upon the walls themselves i could clearly make out the outline as plain as a sun picture of the fucus and the lycopods the worthy and excellent professor hardwigg could not of course make any mistake about the matter but i believe he deliberately closed his eyes as he con tinued on his way with a firm and unalterable step i began to think he was carrying his obstinacy a great deal too far i could no longer act with prudence or composure i stooped on a sudden and picked up an almost perfect shell which had un doubtedly belonged to some animalvery much re sembling some of the present day having secured the prize i followed in the wake of my uncle do you see this i said
