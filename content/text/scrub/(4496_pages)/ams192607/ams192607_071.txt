officer standing at attention shouted impres sively le president de la republique the president of france arrives instantly every man stood erect at attention hand at the cap a few seconds later and presi dent poincare walked in slowly at his side general petain it was then five minutes to president poincare was introduced to the red haired tousled young man whom he addressed as monsieur sparks monsieur sparks speaking a much dilapidated french managed however to explain to his excellence all of the important machinery thanks to a sleepless night with a french dictionary monsieur poincare was much impressed and visibly moved when a french officer had gone over sparks ground and reexplained the finer details the president now takes his stand on an elevated platform near a huge switch which has an ebonite handle about a foot long he then addresses the distinguished assembly with a short speech all the while watching a dapper young french officer stand ing near him chronometer in hand somewhere a clock begins striking the hour of ten the president still speaks but finishes a few seconds later the distinguished assemblage ap plauds and cheers vociferously only to be stopped by the dapper young officer who slowly raises his right hand his eyes glued to the chronometer im mediate silence prevails only interrupted by the soft purring of the huge generator the dapper young officer suddenly sings out monsieur le president atention allez the president of the glorious french republic then shouts dramatically messieurs le jour de gloire est arrive vivelafrance and throws in the huge switch with its long ebon ite handle instantly the ponderous rotary spark gap begins to revolve with a dizzying speed while blinding blue white sparks crash all along the inside circumfer ence with a noise like a hundred cannons set off all at once the large brewery hall intensifies the ear splitting racket so much that every one is compelled to close his ears with his hands quickly stepping outside the party arrives just in time to see fifteen german airplanes volplaning down and disappearing behind the german lines a french aerial officer who had observed the german airplanes drops his glass steps over to the presi dent salutes smartly and says impressively le cirque du baron dunterrichter ils sont hors de combat hors de combat is correct von unterrichter was not to fly again for many a week we look around to tell the glad news to general petain but the latter has disappeared into a low brick building where he now sits surrounded by his staff poring over military maps ornamented with many varicolored pencil marks as well as little brightlycolored pinflags telephone and telegraph instruments are all about the room the enemy in retreat again the president shakes hands with moil sieur sparks congratulating him on his achievement luncheon is then served in the former office of the brewery gayl y bedecked with the allied flags along the walls but even here far from the titanic ro tary spark gap its crashing sparks are audible looking through the window we see a wonderful sight although it is broad daylight the entire queer telegraph line is entirely enveloped in a huge violet spray of electric sparks it is as if heat lightning were playing continuously about the whole line no one may venture within fifty feet of the line it would mean instant death by this manmade lightning luncheon is soon over and more speeches are made suddenly the door flings open and general petain steps in one look at his remarkable fea tures and all talk stops as if by magic he crosses the room towards the president salutes and says in a calm voice though his eyes betray his deep emo tion monsieur le president toute larme allemande est en retraite and so it was the greatest and final retreat of the kaisers invincible hordes was in full swing towards the rhine more congratulations are to be offered to sparks a medal heavens where is that young man but sparks
