the moon metal sunny land filled with brillianthued vegetation and dotted with villages and cities which were bright with lightcolored buildings people appear ed moving through the scenes as in a cinemeto graph exhibition but with infinitely more semblance of reality in fact the pictures blending one into another seemed to be life itself yet it was not an earthlike scene the colors of the passing land scape were such as no man in the room had ever beheld and the people tall roundlimbed with florid complexion golden hair and brilliant eyes and lips were indescribably beautiful and graceful in all their movements dr syxs movies from the land the view passed out to sea and bright blue waves edged with creaming foam ran swiftly under the spectators eyes and occasionally driven before light winds ap peared fleets of daintily shaped vessels which re minded the beholder by their flashing wings of the feigned ship of pearl after the fairy ships and breezy sea views came a long curving line of coast brilliant with coral sands and indented by frequent bays along whose enchanting shores lay pleasant towns the landscapes behind them splendid with groves meadows and streams presently the shifting photographic tape or what ever the mechanism may have been appeared to have settled upon a chosen scene and there it rest ed a broad champaign reached away to distant sapphire mountains while the foreground was oc cupied by a magnificent house resembling a large country villa fronted with a garden shaded by bowers and festoons of huge brilliant flowers birds of radiant plumage flitted among the trees and blossoms and then appeared a company of gayly attired people including many young girls who joined hands and danced in a ring apparently with shouts of laughter while a group of musicians standing near thrummed and blew upon curiously shaped instruments end of the movie show suddenly the shadow of a dense cloud flitted across the scene whereupon the brilliant birds flew away with screams of terror which almost seemed to reach the ears of the onlookers through the wall an expression of horror came over the faces of the people the children broke from their

spectacles had been enacted as if on the other side of a window seemed to retreat swiftly into space until at last emerging from a fleecy cloud it reappeared in the form of the full moon hanging in the sky but larger than is its wont with its dry oceanbeds its keenspired peaks its ragged mountain ranges its gaping chasms its immense crater rings and tycho the chief of them all shooting raylike streaks across the scarred face of the abandoned lunar globe the show was ended and dr syx turning on only a partial illumination in the room rose slowly to his feet his tall form appearing strangely mag nified in the gloom and invited his bewildered guests to accompany him to his house outside the mill where he said dinner awaited them as they emerged into daylight they acted like persons just

not only was it gladly accepted in the form of money but its success was instantaneous in the arts dr syx and the inspectors representing the various nations found it difficult to limit the output to the agreed upon amount the demand was incessant goldsmiths and jewellers continually discovered new excellencies in the wonderful metal its prop erties of translucence and refraction enabled skilful artists to perform marvels by suitable manage ment a chain of artemisium could be made to re semble a string of varicolored gems each separate link having a tint of its own while as the wearer moved delicate complementary colors chased one another in rapid undulation from end to end a fresh charm was added by the new metal to the personal adornment of women and an enhanced splendor to the
