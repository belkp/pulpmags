 amazing stories to me to reason like one without will or decision like a being without energy while there is life there is hope then cried i exasperated to a degree which is scarcely to be explained you do not mean to tell methat youthat you have not lost all hope certainly not replied the professor with con summate coolness you mean to tell me uncle that we shall get out of this monstrous subterranean shaft while there is life there is hope i beg to as sert harry that as long as a mans heart beats as long as a mans flesh quivers i do not allow that a being gifted with thought and will can allow him self to despair what a resolution the man placed in a position like that we occupied must have been very brave to speak like this well i cried what do you mean to do eat what remains of the food we have in our hands let us swallow the last crumb it will be heaven willing our last repast well never mind instead of being exhausted skeletons we shall be men true muttered i in a despairing tone let us take our fill we must replied my uncle with a deep sigh call it what you will my uncle took a piece of the meat that remained and some crusts of biscuit which had escaped the wreck he divided the whole into three parts each had one pound of food to last him as long as he remained in the interior of the earth each now acted in accordance with his own pri vate character my uncle the professor ate greed ily but evidently without appetite eating simply from some mechanical motion i put the food in side my lips and hungry as i was chewed my morsel without pleasure and without satisfaction hans the guide just as if he had been eiderdown hunting swallowed every mouthful as though it were a usual affair he looked like a man equally prepared to enjoy superfluity or total want hans in all probability was no more used to starvation than ourselves but his hardy icelandic nature had prepared him for many sufferings as long as he received his three rixdollars every saturday night he was prepared for anything the fact was hans never troubled himself about much except his money he had undertaken to serve a certain man at so much per week and no matter what evils befell his employer or himself he never found fault or grumbled so long as his wages were duly paid suddenly my uncle roused himself he had seen a smile on the face of our guide i could not make it out what is the matter said my uncle schiedam said the guide producing a bottle of this precious fluid we drank my uncle and myself will own to our dying day that hence we derived strength to exist until the last bitter moment that precious bottle of hollands was in reality only halffull but under the circumstances it was nectar the worthy professor swallowed about half a pint and did not seem able to drink any more fortrafftig said hans swallowing nearly all that was left excellentvery good said my uncle with as much gusto as if he had just left the steps of the club at hamburg i began to feel as if there were still one gleam of hope now all thought of the future vanished we had consumed our last ounce of food and it was five oclock in the morning chapter xlii the volcanic shaft mans constitution is so peculiar that his health is purely a negative matter no sooner is the rage of hunger appeased than it becomes difficult to comprehend the mean ing of starvation it is only when you suffer that you really understand as to anyone who has not endured privation having any notion of the matter it is simply absurd with us after a long fast some mouthfuls of bread and meat a little mouldy bis cuit and salt beef triumphed over all our previous saturnine thoughts nevertheless after this repast each gave way to his own reflections i wondered what were those of hansthe man of the extreme north who was yet gifted with the fatalistic resignation of oriental character but the utmost stretch of the imagina tion would not allow me to realize the truth as for my individual self my thoughts had ceased to be anything but memories of the past and were all connected with that upper world which i never should have left i saw it all now the beautiful house in the konigstrasse my poor gretchen the good martha they all passed before my mind like visions of the past every time any of the lugubri ous groanings which were to be distinguished in the hollows around fell upon my ears i fancied i heard the distant murmur of the great cities above my head as for my uncle always thinking of his science he examined the nature of the shaft by means of a torch he closely examined the different strata one above the other in order to recognize his situation by geological theory this calculation or rather this estimation could by no means be anything but approximate but a learned man a philosopher is nothing if not a philosopher when he keeps his ideas calm and collected and certainly the pro fessor possessed this quality to perfection i heard him as i sat in silence murmuring words of geological science as i understood his object and his meaning i could not but interest myself de spite my preoccupation in that terrible hour erup tive granite he said to himself we are still in the primitive epoch but we are going upgoing up still going up but who knows who knows then he still hoped he felt along the vertical sides of the shaft with his hand and some few min utes later he would go on again in the following stylethis is gniess this mocashitessilicious mineral good again this is the epoch of transi tion at all events we are close to themand then and then what could the professor mean could he by any conceivable means measure the thickness of the crust of the earth suspended above our heads did he possess any possible means of making any ap proximation to this calculation no the man
