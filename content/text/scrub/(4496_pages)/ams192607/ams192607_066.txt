the magnetic storm why sparks had stopped reading the new york evening world he contemp lated his old meerschaum pipe medita tively while with his long and lanky in dex finger stained by many acids he carefully rubbed a long thin and quivering nose this was always a sign of deep concentrated thought of the noses owner it also as a rule in duced the birth of a great idea again and very slowly he reread the article which millions that same day had read casually without a quiver let alone a nose quiver the news paper item was simple enough new york aug an electro magnetic storm of great violence swept over the eastern section of the united states last night due to a brilliant aurora borealisthe north ern lightstelegraph and long distance tele phone as well as cable communications were interrupted for hours no telegraphic traffic was possible between new york and points west it was impossible to work any of the transatlantic cables between a m and a m every one of them having gone dead the aurora borealis disturbance af fected all telegraph and telephone lines extend ing between chicago and the eastern cities on telegraph wires of the postal telegraph co without regular battery being applied at terminal offices grounded lines showed a po tential of volts positive varying to volts negative the disturbance continuing be tween a m and a m at newark n j in the broad street office a western union operator was severely shocked trying to operate the key while long sparks played about his instruments sparks rose excitedly and began pacing the ce ment floor of the vast tesla laboratory totally ob livious to the fact that he was sucking a cold pipe the more he paced about the more excited he be came finally he flung himself into a chair and began feverishly to make sketches on big white sheets of drawing paper why sparks had been just an ordinary bug an experimenter when he entered teslas great re search laboratory at the beginning of the great war in tesla liked the keen redhaired tous led boy who always seem ed to divine your thoughts before you had uttered five words his clear blue eyes lying deep in their sockets sparkled with life and intelligence and what sparks did not know about electricity was mighty little indeed i believe there is no electrical book in existence that sparks had not devoured ravenously in his spare hours while hav ing lunch or else while in bed in the small hours of the morning his thirst for electrical knowledge was unbounded and he soaked up every bit of in formation like a sponge yes and he retained it this story was written during the world war long be fore the death ray was ever invented it is believed in some quarters that here we have the original germ of the death ray in fact the means chosen by the author to bring down enemy airplanes by means of electricity were exploited a number of years later by grindell matthews although he admits today that the death ray was pure fiction nevertheless at some future date it will be possible to do just what the author tells us in this story nikola tesla who read the original proofs of this story endorses the idea he himself was able to bum out electrical amateurs thirteen miles from his famous col orado pozver plant in when he was also able to light electric lamps at this distance without wires too in short the young prodigy was a living elec trical cyclopedia and highly valued by his associates no wonder tesla in three short years had made him superintendent of the laboratory sparks first name of course sparks first name was not really why but some one had dubbed him with this sobriquet because of his eternal but why is thiswhy why should we not do it this waywhy do you try to do that in short his first word always seemed to be whyit had to be in his unending quest of knowledge and his why was always very emphatic explosivelike imperative from which there was no escape ah yes his first name to tell the honest truth i dont know it last year in the spring when i went up to the laboratory i thought i would find out so when i finally located the young wonder behind a bus bar where he was drawing fat blue sparks by means of a screwdriver i told him that i intended to write something about him and his wonderful electrical knowledge would he be good enough to give me his real first name he was watching a big fuse critically and in an absentminded manner exploded why that finished my mission and for all i know his real name is why sparks but we left sparks with his drawings in the laboratory that was on a certain evening in to be exact it was about oclock at tesla accompanied by two high army officials strolled in to the laboratory where sparks was still feverishly engaged with sketches lying all about him tesla who was working out a certain apparatus for the government had dropt in late to show major general mcquire the result of six weeks labors the apparatus had been completed that day and the general a military electrical expert had come over specially from washington to see the thing work but before tesla had a chance to throw in the switch of the large rotary converter sparks had leaped up and was wav ing excitedly a large drawing in teslas face he gushed forth a tor rent of sentences and for fully five minutes tesla and the two army officials were listening spellbound to the young inventor for a minute or two the three men were speech less looking awestruck at sparks who having de livered himself of his latest outburst now became normal again and lit up his still cold pipe it was tesla who first found his voice wonder ful wonderful absolutely wonderful sparks in a month you will be the most talked of man on this planet and his idea is sound this to the gen eral absolutely without a flaw and so simple why oh why did i not think of it before come let me shake the hand of americas youngest and greatest genius which he did there then followed an excited thirtyminute con
