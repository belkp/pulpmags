 amazing stories at the wireless key he pressed the key impulsively and noted with grim satisfaction that the loud blue spark crashed merrily in the not very uptodate spark gap as he sent out the call mechanically he wondered vaguely what the matter could be with the govern ment because it did not even supply a modern up todate loschfunkenstreckequenched spark gap for field use things must be pretty bad when the government must economize even a few beggarly pounds of brass so necessary for a noiseless spark gap but he could not give that matter further atten tion for he had thrown the aerial switch from sending to receiving he had strained his ears for a reply from the op erator from the kommando but as the switch was thrown instead of a reply there was a loud constant roar in the receivers so loud that it was painful off came the headgear while von unterrichter once more sank into a chair he was a pitiful spectacle to look at the fate of a th century man flung back a hundred years his eyes roamed idly about till the distant railroad em bankment struck his eye no train was moving everything was at a standstillhow could a train move without a telegraph how could a train be dispatchedthere would be a thousand collisions he turned to the radio operator who as yet had not grasped the situation in its entirety nordlicht nicht wahr herr leutnant he be gan thinking no doubt that the phenomenon was an ordinary form of aurora borealisthe northern lightsin other words a magnetic storm that would be over soon dummes rindsvieh snapped the herr leutnant who knew better by this time indeed he was to know still more at once for while he was speaking there came to his ear a low dull roar a sound he had heard once before far back in when the germans had retreated very much in a hurry beyond the marne panic seized him yes the sound was unmistak able the german army once more was in full re treatno it was a routa panicstricken rabble that made its way back rumors spread through the german ranks like lightning the news had spread among the men at the front that uncanny things were afoot that all communications had been an nihilated with one stroke that no orders could be sent or received except by prehistoric cour iers that the grosses kommando was cut off from the army and that in short the german army as far as communication was concerned had suddenly found itself a century back for what had happened to von unterrichter that morning hafl happened on a large scale not only to every one along the front but all over germany as well every train every trolley car every electric motor or dynamo every telephone every telegraph had been put out of commission with one stroke germany had been flung back into the days of na poleon every modern industry every means of trafficexcept horsedrawn vehicleswere at a standstill for days the german retirement went on till on the fifteenth day the entire german army had retired behind the natural defenses of the rhine the victorious allies pressing the fleeing hordes back irresistibly and it must have been a bitter pill for the ger man highcommand to swallow when they saw that the allied fliers were constantly flying behind their own lines and that as the allies advanced their au tomobiles and their trains seemed to run as well as ever behind their own lines but no german suc ceeded in flying an aeroplane or in running an au tomobile that mysterious force obviously was trained only against them but was harmless behind the allied lines nor did the germans find out to this date what caused their undoing i cannot even now divulge the full details of the scheme of just how the germans were finally driven across the rhine that of course is a military secret but i am permitted to give an outline of just what happened on that memorable morning when the german army was flung back into the dark ages in teslas laboratory but first we must go back to teslas laboratory once more back to that evening when why sparks first overwhelmed tesla and his com panions with his idea this is in part what sparks said mr tesla in while you were making your now historic highfrequency experiments in col orado with your kilowatt generator you ob tained sparks feet in length the noise of these sparks was like a roaring niagara and these spark discharges were the largest and most wonderful produced by man down to this very day the prim ary coil of your oscillator measured feet in diam eter while you used amperes the voltage probably was over million now then in your book high frequency currents among other things you state that the current which you produced by means of this mammoth electric oscillator was so terrific that its effect was felt miles away al though there were no wires between your laboratory and the colorado electric light amp power co five miles distant your wireless energy burnt out several armatures of the large dynamo generators simply by long distance induction from your high frequency oscillator you subsequently raised such havoc with the lighting companys dynamos that you had to modify your experiments although you were over five miles away from the lighting com pany now if in twenty years ago you could do that why why cannot we go a step further in when we have at our command vastly more powerful generators and better machinery if you can burn out dynamo armatures miles distant with a paltry kilowatts why cannot we burn out every armature within a radius of miles or more sparks great project the primary coil of your oscillator in was feet in diameter why cannot we build a primary coil from the english channel down to switzerland paralleling the the above occurrences as well as the citcd experiments and effects of the tesla currents are actual facts checked by mr tesla himself who saw the original proofs of this storyeditor
