the eggs from lake tanganyika professor meyermaier drew a sharp needle out of the cushion carefully picked up with the pincers the fly lying in front of him and stuck it carefully upon a piece of white paper he looked over the rim of his glasses dipped his pen in the ink and wrote under the specimen glossina palpalis specimen from tsetsefly river in the aboriginal language termed nsinsi usually found on river courses and lakes in west africa bearer of the malady negana tsetse sickness sleep ing sickness he laid down the pen and took up a powerful magnifying glass for a closer examination a hor rible creature he murmered and shivered involun tarily on each side of the head of the flying horror there was a monstrous eye surrounded by many sharp lashes and divided up into a hundred thousand flashing facets an ugly proboscis thickly studded with curved barbs or hooks grew out of the lower side of the head the wings were small and pointed the legs armed with thorns spines and claws the thorax was muscular like that of a prize fighter the abdomen was thin and looked like india rubber it could take in a great quantity of blood and expand like a balloon on the whole the flying horror resembling a prehistoric flying dragon was not very pleasant lookingprof meyermaier took a pin and transfixed the body of the fly it seemed to him that a vicious sheen of light emanated from the eyes and that the probos cis rolled up quickly he picked up the magnifying glass but it was an optical illusionthe thing was dead with all its poison still within its body memories of the expedition to africa with a deep sigh he laid aside pincers and magnifying glass and sank into a deep re verie the clock struck counted professor meyermaier in udjidji a village on lake tanganyika the na tives had told him of gi gantic flies inhabiting the interior further north these monsters were three times as big as the giants composing the giant bodyguard of the prince of ssuggi who all had to be of at least stand ard height meyermaier laughed over this negro fable but the negroes were obstinate they refused to follow him to the northern part of lake tanganyika even msuuru his black ser vant who otherwise made an intelligent impression trembled with excitement and begged to be left out of the expeditionbecause there enormous flies and bees were to be foundthat let no man approach they drank the river dry and guarded the valley of the elephants the valley of the elephants was a fabled place where the old pachyderms withdrew to die it is inexplicable soliloquized meyer maier that no one ever found a dead elephant the clock struck we consider this extraordinary story a classic and cer tanly the best scientifiction story so far for how large can insects grow is there any limit to their size frankly no one knows we have almost micros copically small flies and in some of the tropical countries we have some almost as large as the fist is it possible to have still larger flies and could monstrous flies such as are depicted in this story be bred at some future date the author of this brilliant tale evidently thinks so anyway we trust he is mistaken as we should not like to meet such monsters the science of entomology pre sented in this story is excellent and will arouse your imagination the natives had come along on the expedition much against their will moyermaier had trouble to keep the caravan moving up to the day when he found four great strange looking eggs larger than ostrich eggs the negroes were seized with a panic half of them deserting in the night in spite of the great distance from the coast the other half could only be kept there by tremendous efforts he had to make up his mind finally to go back but he secretly put the eggs he had found into his camp ing chest to solve their riddle now they were here in his berlin home in his workroom he had not found time as yet to exam ine them for he had brought much material home to be worked over the clock struck meyermaier kept thinking of the ugly head of the tsetse fly that he had seen through the magnifying glass a strange thought occurred to him and made him smile suppose the stories of the negroes were true and the giant fliesbutterflies and beetles as big as elephants did exist and suppose that they propagated as flies doeach one laying eighty million eggs a year he laughed aloud and pictured to himself how such a creature would stalk through the streets a strange sound and the hatching of an egg he broke off suddenly in the midst of his laughter a sound reached his ear an earsplitting buzzing like that of a thousand flies a deafening hum as if a swarm of bees were entering the room it burst out like a blast of wind through the room and then stopped meyermaier jerked the door open nothing all was quiet i must relax for a while said he and opened the window he turned on the light and threw back the lid of the big chest which contained the giant eggs suddenly he grew pale as death and staggered back a creature was crawling out a creature as big as a police doga frightful creature with wings a muscular body and six hairy legs with claws it crept slowly raised its incandescent head to the light and polished its wings with its hind legs faint with fright meyer maier pressed against the wall with outspread arms a loud buzzing the creature swept across the room climbed up on the window sill and was gone meyermaier came slowly to himself my nerves are deceiving me did i dream he whis pered and dragged himself to the campchest but he became frozen with horror one egg was broken open it breaks out of its shell like a chicken it does not change into a chrysalis he thought me chanically at last his mind cleared and he awoke to the emergency he sprang to the desk snatched up his revolver ran downstairs and out into the street he saw no trace of the escaped giant insect meyer maier looked up at the lighted windows of his home suddenly the light became dim the other eggs like a blow came the thoughtthe other eggs too
