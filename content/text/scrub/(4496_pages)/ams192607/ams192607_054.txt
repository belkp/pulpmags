the moon metal i fear you flatter the man in the moon was my laughing reply no i dont returned hall and some day youll admit it well what about that something that shines down there you seem to see more in it than i can dr syx is suspicious about the climb to the summit but my companion had fallen into a reverie and didnt hear my question he was gazing abstractedly at the faint image of the wan dering moon now nearing the mountaintop in the distance presently his mind seemed to return to the old magnet and he whirled about and glanced down at the syx mill the column of smoke was diminishing in volume an indication that the en gine was about to enjoy one of its periodical rests the irregularity of these stoppages had always been a subject of remark among practical engineers the hours of labor were exceedingly erratic but the engine had never been known to work at night ex cept on one occasion and then only for a few min utes when it was suddenly stopped on account of a fire just as hall resumed his inspection two huge quarter spheres which had been resting wide apart on the roof moved towards one another until their arched sections met over the circular aperture which they covered like the dome of an observatory i expected it hall remarked but come it is midafternoon and we shall need all of our time to get safely down before the light fades dr syx speaks to them as i have already explained it would not have been possible for us to return the way we came we determined to descend the com paratively easy western slopes of the peak and pass the night on that side of the mountain letting our selves down with the rope into the hollow way that divides the summit of the teton into two pinnacles we had no difficulty in descending by the route fol lowed by all previous climbers the weather was fine and having found good shelter among the rocks we passed the night in comfort the next day we succeeded in swinging round upon the eastern flank of the teton below the more formidable cliffs and just at nightfall we arrived at the station as we passed the syx mine the doctor himself con fronted us there was a very displeasing look on his dark countenance and his sneer was strongly marked so you have been on top of the teton he said yes replied hall very blandly and if you have a taste for that sort of thing i should advise you to go up the view is immense as fine as the best in the alps pretty ingenious plan that balloon of yours continued the doctor still looking black thank you hall replied more suavely than ever ive been planning that a long time you probably dont know that mountaineering used to be my chief amusement the doctor turned away without pursuing the conversation i could kick myself hall muttered as soon as dr syx was out of earshot if my absurd wish to outdo others had not blinded me i should havo known that he would see us going up this side of the peak particularly with the balloon to give us away however whats done cant be undone he may not really suspect the truth and if he does he cant help himself even though he is the richest man in the world strange fate of a kite are you ready for another tramp was andrew halls greeting when we met early on the morning following our return from the peak certainly i am what is your programme for today i wish to test the flying qualities of a kite which i have constructed since our return last night you dont allow the calls of sleep to interfere very much with your activity i havent much time for sleep just now replied hall without smiling the kite test will carry us up the flanks of the teton but i am not going to try for the top this time if you will come along ill ask you to help me by carrying and operating a light transit i shall carry another myself i am desirous to get the elevation that the kite attains and certain other data that will be of use to me we will make a detour towards the south for i dont want old syxs suspicions to be prodded any more what interest can he have in your kiteflying the same interest that a burglar has in the rap of a policemans nightstick then your experiment today has some connec tion with the solution of the great mystery my dear fellow said hall laying his hand on my shoulder until i see the end of that mystery i shall think of nothing else in a few hours we were clambering over the broken rocks on the southeastern flank of the teton at an elevation of about three thousand feet above the level of jacksons hole finally hall paused and began to put his kite together it was a small box shaped affair very light in construction with paper sides in order to diminish the chances of dr syx noticing what we are about he said as he worked away i have covered the kite with skyblue paper this together with distance will probably insure us against his notice in a few minutes the kite was ready having ascertained the direction of the wind with much attention he stationed me with my transit on a commanding rock and sought another post for him self at a distance of two hundred yards which he carefully measured with a gold tape my instruc tions were to keep the telescope on the kite as soon as it had attained a considerable height and to note the angle of elevation and the horizontal angle with the base line joining our points of observation be particularly careful was halls injunction and if anything happens to the kite by all means note the angles at that instant as soon as we had fixed our stations hall began to pay out the string and the kite rose very swiftly as it sped away into the blue it was soon practi cally invisible to the naked eye although the tele scope of the transit enabled me to follow it with ease
