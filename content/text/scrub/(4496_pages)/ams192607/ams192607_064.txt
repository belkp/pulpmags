friends we will get at least one of them an armored automobile came tearing along at a frightful speed we appreciate your foresight major said meyermaier as they stepped into the steelarmored machine one of the giant flies is electrocuted although it was five oclock in the morn ing the square in front of the broadcasting station was black with people the police kept a space clear in the center where monstrously large and ugly lay the dead giant fly its wings were burnt its proboscis extended while the legs with their claws were drawn up against the body the abdomen was a great ball full of bright red liquid that is certainly the creature that killed the horse said schmidtschimitt and pointed at the thick abdomen he then walked around the crea ture glossina palpalis a monstrous tsetse fly will you please send the monster to the zoological laboratory the major nodded assent the fire men prepared for service pushed poles under the insect and tried to lift it up from the ground out of the air came a droning sound an airplane squadron dropped out of the clouds and again disap peared a bright body with vibrating wings flew across the sky the airplanes dropped on it the noise of the machineguns staged the bright body fell in a spiral course to the ground crying and screaming the people fled from the street and crowded into the houses they couldnt tell where the insect would fall and they were afraid of their heads the street was empty in an instant the body of the monster fell directly in front of the armored car and lay there stiff in its fall it car ried away a lot of aerial cable and now it lay on the pavement as if caught in a net the head torn by the machine gun bullets it looked like a strange gleam ing cactus take me to my home major groaned meyer maier i cant stand it any longer the excite ment is too much for me in the hospital the armored car started noisily into motion meyermaier fell from the seat senseless up on the floor of the tonneau when he came to himself he lay in a strange bed his gaze fell upon a bell which swung to and fro above his face in his head there was a humming like an airplane motor he made no attempt even to think his finger pressed the pushbutton and he never released it until halfadozen attendants came rushing into the room one figure stood out in dark colors in the group of whiteclad interns it was his colleague schmidtschmitt youre awake said he and stepped to his bed how are you feeling my head is buzzing as if there were a swarm of hornets living in it how many hours have i lain here hours schmidtschmitt dwelt upon the word today is the fifteenth day that you are lying in professor stieblings sanitorium it was a difficult case you always woke up at mealtime and without saying a word went to sleep again fifteen days cried meyermaier excitedly and the insects have they been killed ill tell you the whole story when you are well again said schmidtschmitt quieting him lie as you are quietlyany excitement may hurt you they must not come into the room he screamed out to an excited messenger who breathlessly pull ed the door open professor the man was in deadly fear the central police station has given out the news that a swarm of giant flies are descending up on the city barricade all windows at once you wasted precious time screamed meyer maier and jumped out of the bed let me go to my house i must solve the riddle as to how to get at the insects dont touch me he raved he snatched a coat from the rack ran out of the house and jumped into schmidtschmitts automobile which stood at the gate and went like the wind to his home the door of his house was ajar he rushed up four flights and in delirious haste rushed into his workroom the telephone bell rang the danger is over meyermaier snatched up the receiver he got the consoling message from the city police commissioner the danger is over professor our airsquadron has destroyed the swarm with a cloud of poisongas only two of the insects escaped death these we have caught in a net and are taking them to the zoological gardens and if they have left eggs behind them we are going to search the woods systematically and will inject lysol into any eggs we find i think that will help laughed the major shall i send some of them to you for examination no cried meyermaier in fright keep them off my neck he sat down at his worktabie there seemed a vicious smile on the face of the transfixed dead tse tse fly you frightful ghost murmured the pro fessor with pallid lips and threw a book on the in sect his head was in a daze he tried his best to think clearly an axiom of science came to him if the flies are as large as elephants they can only progagate as fast as elephants do they cant have a million young ones but only a few i cant be wrong he murmured ill look up the confirma tion he took up the telephone and called the city com missioner major how many insects were in the swarm continued on page
