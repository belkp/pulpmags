the man who could work miracles afraid of a premture discovery of his powers he addressed the blossoming stick hastily go back what he meant was change back but of course he was confused the stick receded at a consider able velocity and incontinently came a cry of anger and a bad word from the approaching person who are you throwing brambles at you fool cried a voice that got me on the shin mr fotheringay gets in trouble with the police and disposes of the officer as in the next chapter im sorry old chap said mr fotheringay and then realizing the awkward nature of the explanation caught nervously at his moustache he saw winch one of the three im mering constables advancing what do you mean by it asked the constable hallo its you is it the gent that broke the lamp at the long dragon i dont mean anything by it said mr fother ingay nothing at all what dyer do it for then oh bother said mr fotheringay bother indeed dyer know that stick hurt what dyer do it for eh for the moment mr fotheringay could not think what he had done it for his silence seemed to irritate mr winch youve been assaulting the police young man this time thats what you done look here mr winch said mr fotheringay annoyed and confused im sorry very the fact is well he could think of no wâły but the truth i was working a miracle he tried to speak in an off hand way but try as he would he couldnt chapter iv more trouble about the policeman working a ere dont you talk rot working a miracle indeed miracle well thats downright funny why yous the chap that dont believe in miracles fact is this is another of your silly conjuring tricks thats what this is now i tell you but mr fotheringay never heard what mr winch was going to tell him he realized he had given himself away flung his valuable secret to all the winds of heaven a violent gust of irritation swept over him to action he turned on the con stable swiftly and fiercely here he said ive had enough of this i have ill show you a silly conjuring trick i will go to hades go now he was alone mr fotheringay performed no more miracles that night nor did he trouble to see what had become of his flowering stick he returned to the town scared and very quiet and went to his bedroom lord he said its a powerful giftan extremely power ful gift i didnt hardly mean as much as that not really i wonder what hades is like he sat on the bed taking off his boots struck by a happy thought he transferred the constable to san francisco and without any more interference with normal caution went soberly to bed in the night he dreamt of the

and the river as far as rawiings mill was to be dragged for constable winch mr fotheringay was abstracted and thoughtful all that day and performed no miracles except certain provisions for winch and the miracle of completing his days work with punctual perfec tion in spite of all the beeswarm of thoughts that hummed through his mind and the extraordinary abstraction and meekness of his manner was
