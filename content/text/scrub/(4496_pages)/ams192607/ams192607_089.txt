 amazing stories worth while to have left the interior of a volcano and remain here to receive a huge piece of rock upon ones head let us carefully descend the mountain and discover the real state of the case to con fess the truth i am dying of hunger and thirst decidedly the professor had ceased to be a truly reflective character for myself forgetting all my necessities ignoring my fatigues and sufferings i should have remained still for several hours long erbut it was necessary to follow my companions where are they an interview with a child the slope of the volcano was very steep and slippery we slid over piles of ashes avoiding the streams of hot lava which glided about like fiery serpents still while we were advancing i spoke with extreme volubility for my imagination was too full not to explode in words we are in asia i exclaimed we are on the coast of india in the great malay islands in the center of oceana we have crossed the one half of the globe to come out right at the antipodes of europe but the compass exclaimed my uncle explain that to me yesthe compass i said with considerable hesitation i grant that is a difficulty according to it we have always been going northward then it lied hemto say it lied is rather a harsh word was my answer then we are at the north pole the polenowellwell i give it up was my reply the plain truth was that there was no explanation possible i could make nothing of it all the while we were approaching this beautiful verdure hunger and thirst tormented me fearfully happily after two long hours march a beautiful country spread out before us covered by olives pomegranates and vines which appeared to belong to anybody and everybody in the state of destitu tion into which we had fallen we were not particular to a grape what delight it was to press these delicious fruits to our lips and to bite at grapes and pomegranates fresh from the bough not far off near some fresh and mossy grass under the delicious shade of some trees i discovered a spring of fresh water into which we voluptuously plunged our faces hands and feet while we were all giving way to the delights of newfound pleasures a little child appeared be tween two tufted olive trees ah cried i an in habitant of this happy country the little fellow was poorly dressed weak and suffering and appeared terribly alarmed at our ap pearance halfnaked with tangled matted and ragged beards we did look supremely illfavored and unless the country was a bandit land we were not unlikely to alarm the inhabitants just as the boy was about to take to his heels hans ran after him and brought him back despite his cries and kicks my uncle tried to look as gentle as possible and then spoke in german what is the name of this mountain my friend the child made no reply good said my uncle with a very positive air of conviction we are not in germany he then made the same demand in english of which he was an excellent scholar the child shook its head and made no reply is he dumb cried the professor who was rather proud of his polyglot knowledge of languages and making the same demand in french the boy only stared in his face i must perforce try him in italian said my uncle with a shrug dove siamo yes tell me where we are i added impatiently and eagerly again the boy remained silent stromboli stromboli my fine fellow do you or do you not mean to speak cried my uncle who began to get angry he shook him and spoke an other dialect of the italian language come si chi ama questa isolawhat is the name of this island stromboli replied the rickety little shepherd dashing away from hans and disappearing in the olive groves stromboli what effect oh the imagination did these few words produce we were in the center of the mediterranean amid the eastern archipelago of mythological memory in the ancient strongylos where aeolus kept the wind and the tempest chained up and those blue mountains which rose towards the rising of the sun were the mountains of cala bria and that mighty volcano which rose on the southern horizon was etna the fierce and cele brated etna stromboli stromboli i repeated to myself my uncle played a regular accompaniment to my ges tures and words we were singing together like an ancient chorus ahwhat a journeywhat a marvelous and extraordinary journey here we had entered the earth by one volcano and we had come out by another and this other was situated more than twelve hundred leagues from sneffels from that drear country of iceland cast away on the con fines of the earth the wondrous chances of this expedition had transported us to the most harmon ious and beautiful of earthly lands after a delicious repast of fruits and fresh water we again continued our journey in order to reach the port of stromboli to say how we had reached the island would scarcely have been prudent the superstitious character of the italians would have been at work and we should have been called de mons vomited from the infernal regions it was therefore necessary to pass for humble and unfor tunate shipwrecked travelers it was certainly less striking and romantic but it was decidedly safer as we advanced i could hear my worthy uncle muttering to himselfbut the compass the com pass most certainly marked north this is a fact i cannot explain in any way well the fact is said i with an air of disdain we must not explain anything it will be much more easy i should like to see a professor of the johanneum institution who is unable to explain a cosmic phenomenonit would indeed be strange and speaking thus my uncle halfnaked his leathern purse round his loins and his spectacles upon his
