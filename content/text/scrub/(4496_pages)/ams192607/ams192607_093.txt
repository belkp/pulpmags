 amazing stories his services and needless to say the bootblacking and spittooncleaning ceased immediately the man was too valuable to be allowed to spend his time in such duties finally the doctor needing a confidential man to send to africa had entrusted keene with the mis sion poor pep perkins was brokenhearted at his departure because her admiration for this unique specimen of a man was unbounded she had at last found a man who made her heart go ticktack keene was now back from africa and it was after his business report that he exclaimed doctor hackensaw ive got something peculiar to show you what is it asked the doctor its a little memento i brought back from my african trip as you know i had with me some of the special cameras you invented for taking photo graphs at night without the need of flashlights yes said doctor hackensaw i gave you photographic plates of two kinds i gave you plates that were sensitive to electric emanations so that you could take photos of the aura that surrounds living beings precisely said silas what you call the zray plates well the curious thing i have to show you is one of the zray photographs i took near mon galla i think you will find it rather curious so saying phessenden keene took from his pocket a photograph which he handed to the doctor and pep left cleaning her typewriter in order to get a better view a young girl and her aura the photograph represented what appeared to be a beautiful young girl in a state of nature but surrounded by an aura of electric emana tions well what is there peculiar about this asked the doctor its just an ordinary photograph of a young lady taken on a special plate in order to show the aura no indeed replied keene i took that snap shot in bright sunlight and not a trace of a girl could i see it was a bird i was photographing and i hadnt the faintest idea there was a girl anywhere near me doctor hackensaw do you believe there are such things as invisible creatures well yes there are in the water there are cer tain animals like jellyfishes that are so transparent that they are practically invisible among the ani malcules too there are many whose small size rend ers them invisible and there are some that are so transparent that we cannot see them until they are stained even with a microscope that is what makes it so difficult to discover the specific microbe that causes a disease we must find some stain that will make the microbe visible and this isnt always easy the celebrated ehrhardt had to try no less than different stains before he found one that would color the microbes that cause syphilis once he found the proper stain however he was able to incorporate drugs with it and was thus en abled to have his drugs carried into the bodies of the microbes but while invisible beings are com mon in the microscopic world we know of no large invisible animals then the original of this photograph is the first one said keene and i wish to ask your permis sion to return to africa and try to capture her why didnt you try while you were over there i unfortunately didnt develop the negative until after my return to the united states well assented the doctor a search for an invisible girl is worse than a search for a needle in a haystack but the thing is so curious that we ought to make the attempt ill order my rapid aeroplane and pep and i will go with you chapter iii bunches of bananas for bait here we are doctor exclaimed phessen den keene this is the very spot where i took the snapshot as you can see by comparing it with the photograph even now said pep i dont see how we can ever hope to find the invisible girl pep spoke of its being as hard as looking for a needle in a hay stack but it seems to me much harder yes assented the doctor but to a scientist there would be no difficulty in finding a needle in a haystack he would merely spread out the hay and pass a strong electromagnet over it and in a few minutes the needle would be found clinging to the magnet perhaps so said pep but at least you can see the needle when you do find it here we cant see the girl and even if she were right in front of us and we took a snapshot of her with the zrays she would probably be gone by the time the negative was developed doctor hackensaw smiled you forget pep said he that we have other senses besides the sense of sight besides there are ways of making the invisible visible dont imagine for an instant that i have come unprepared i have in fact several strings to my bow you will remember that we stopped awhile in mongalla and i heard news there that will be of use to us hunting parties out after lions or elephants have noticed the mysterious dis appearance of their provisions bunches of bana nas disappear and also the strips of hippopotamus meat that they hang up to dry this knowledge will be very useful to us the girl evidently has no way of obtaining provisions except by stealing them hence a bunch of fine bananas would make a tempting bait oh exclaimed pep thats the reason you loaded up the aeroplane with such quantities of bunches of bananas precisely our first job is to locate the girl to do this we will hang up small bunches of bananas at likely spots near the white nile where she must go for water and when tomorrow we find one or two of the bunches missing we may strongly sus pect one invisible girl of being the culprit it was no easy task tramping through the wilds for caution was necessary as lions leopards and elephants abounded in the region and even the crocodiles were dangerous the postboat captain having informed our adventurers that he had had two of his men devoured by crocodiles the past year
