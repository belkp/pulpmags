 amazing stories me the one seemed fighting the other but the sec ond voice was gaining then there was suddenly something like darkness and a sharp command from the first voice i seemed to be struck a violent blow on the back of my head the next thing i knew was finding myself on board this ship that is absolutely all you know about it ques tioned captain evered that is all sir try and forget it for tonight said the doctor get to sleep as fast as you can and tomorrow get up and have a turn on deck they wished him goodnight and left the cabin for hours the two men talked in the privacy of cap tain evereds cabin but they ended as they began each knew that he was half carried away by the story macrae had told both from the internal evi dence of the report itself and his evident sincerity at the same time each saw its extraordinary nature too clearly to admit yielding an entire belief in it even to himself much less to any one else he seems perfectly sane to you questioned captain evered quite so as rational as you or i was the re sponse well i shall follow your advice respecting pro fessor rudge said captain evered there should be no difficulty in his seeing macrae we shall land him tomorrow and from hongkong he will be in valided home accompanied by my report and of course these writings of his i shall report him as not in my opinion suited to this kind of service you will be able to endorse that i can said anderson macrae is one of the subjective sort did you notice how full his diary is of himself exactly by the by what did you make of two voices and a blow on the head well i suppose two voices are not more mysteri ous than one said anderson if you can believe in one why not two according to him there would appear to be disagreement sometimes even among our friends the venerians theres a party i sup pose who want to have nothing to do with us probably smiled captain evered adding i intend in addition to suggesting that this account of his be submitted to professor rudge to drop a private line or two to the professor himself letting him know there is something in the wind a gov ernment department my dear anderson being in this case the admiralty i hope i am not speaking blasphemy will go about as far as it is kicked but i think rudge will not let them shelve it the operator returns to his sweetheart so it came about that macrae found himself on the homeward journey much before he had anticipated when leaving england it did not exhilarate him as he was oppressed with a feeling of failure without being able to see how he could have done differently he was afraid that what would be looked upon as a preposterous story would militate against him and the government might not find him even home employment this feeling of depression lasted until entering the bay of biscay when grey skies reminded him of his native hills the wind of the atlantic with a tooth in it blew on him aad his spirits rose a telegram advised may treherne of her lovers unexpected return and she was at portsmouth to meet him hers was one of the first faces he saw and her welcome completed the cure that northern skies had begun macraes keen eyes did not fail to see in hers the involuntary question that tact was keeping from her lips and he wondered how he was going to answer it seeing that he was bound to secrecy it was no secret that he had been at a wireless station and there could not be any breach of trust in saying the position was somewhat isolated there were plenty which that description would suit so he told her how during a short absence of his from the stationhouse his fellow workers had been murdered and he had returned to find their dead bodies and himself the only survivor how he had fallen unconscious how in consequence of the shock to his system he had been relieved and placed on sick leave and ultimately sent back for service at a home station he added that there were some other details which in view of the strictness of of ficial secrecy he could not divulge she was horrified at the tale and clung to him in her gratitude that he had escaped suppose dear alan you had been at the sta tion when those wretches murdered your compan ions you would have been murdered too oh i am glad you are back in england when i got your telegram i was awfully surprised he saw his explanation had relieved her mind of something it also seemed to have loosened her tongue for now he had very little to do but be a patient listener and hear a full account of her somewhat uneventful history during his absence and discuss plans for the future as modified by this new development the government investigations in london that evening may treherne returned to ply mouth and macrae proceeded to report him self in london the next morning he pre sented himself at the admiralty and was given an hour at which to attend the next day when the re port respecting him would have been read he then found himself put through a very searching examination for there had been considerable nervousness that some scheme of a possible enemy was at the bottom of the business it came as a surprise to the officials to find that after the most exhaustive questioning nothing could be gleaned to lend color to this suspicion it was obviously a relief to his examiners to find that everything went to indicate that the deaths took place as officially reported first by macrae himself and afterwards by the captain of the sagitta for the rest it had of course been a curi ous case of delusion while under the influence of nervous shock his diary was confiscated he was reprimanded for having written it and especially for including expressions that would serve as indi cations of things that were government secrets he would for the future be retained at home stations so long as no further indiscretion was committed and was further directed to present himself for duty at the end of a month granted as leave of ab sence the next day found macrae at plymouth and
