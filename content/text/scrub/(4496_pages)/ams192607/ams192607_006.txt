editorial and general offices park place new york n y extravagant fiction today cold fact tomorrow fiction versus facts by hugo gernsback a few letters have come to the editors desk from some readers who wish to know what prompts us to so frequently preface our stor ies in our introductory remarks with the state ment that this or that scientific plot is not impossible but quite probable these readers seem to have the idea that we try to impress our friends with the fact that whatever is printed in amaz ing stories is not necessarily pure fiction but could or can be fact that impression is quite correct we do wish to do so and have tried to do so ever since we started amazing stories as a matter of fact our editorial policy is built upon this structure and will be so continued indefinitely the reason is quite simple the human mind not only of today but of ten thousand years ago also is and was so con stituted that being merged into the present it can see neither the past nor the future clearly if only five hundred years ago or little more than ten generations which is not a long time as human progress goes anyone had come along with a story wherein radio telephone steamships airplanes electricity painless surgery the phonograph and a few other modern marvels were described he would probably have been promptly flung into a dungeon all these things sounded preposterous and the height of nonsense even as little as one hundred years ago and lo and behold within two generations we take these marvels and miracles as everyday occurrences and do not get in the least excited when we read of recent reports that it will be possible within a year or less to see as well as hear your sweetheart a thousand miles away without intervening wires or connections of any sort so when we do read one of these to us impossible tales in amazing stories we may be almost certain that the impossibility will have become a fact perhaps before an other generationif not much sooner it is most unwise in this age to declare anything impossible because you may never be sure but that even while you are talking it has already become a reality many things in the past which were declared impossible arc of everyday occurrence now there are few stories published in this magazine that can be called outright impossible as a matter of fact in selecting our stories we always consider their possibility we reject stories often on the ground that in our opinion the plot or action is not in keeping with science as we know it today for instance when we see a plot wherein the hero is turned into a tree later on into a stone and then again back to himself we do not consider this science but rather a fairy tale and such stories have no place in amazing stories of course once in a great while an author may take some liberties as happened for instance in the conclusion of a trip to the center of the earth printed in this issue jules verne brought back his heroes in a most improbable manner but this one defect does not detract from the story as a whole throughout which good science is maintained it is only when the entire plot becomes frankly impossible or far too improbable that we draw the line and it should never be forgotten that the educational value of the scicntifiction type of story is tremendous mr g peyton wertenbaker author of the man from the atom says this on the same subject amazing stories should appeal however to quite a dif ferent public referring to the sextype of literature scientifiction is a branch of literature which requires more intelligence and even more aesthetic sense than is possessed by the sextype reading public it is designed to reach those qualities of the mind which are aroused only by things vast things cataclysmic and things unfathomably strange it is designed to reach that portion of the imagination which grasps with its eager feeble talons after the unknown it should be an influence greater than the influence of any literature i know upon the restless ambition of man for further conquests further understandings literature of the past and the present has made the mystery of man and his world more clear to us and for that reason it has been less beautiful for beauty lies only in the things that are mysteri ous beauty is a groping of the emotions towards realiza tion of things which may be unknown only to the intellect scientifiction goes out into the remote vistas of the uni verse where there is still mystery and so still beauty for that reason scientifiction seems to me to be the true literature of the future the danger that may lie before amazing stories is that of becoming too scientific and not sufficiently literary it is yet too early to be sure but not too early for a warning to be issued amicably and frankly it is hard to make an actual measure of course for the determination of the correct amount of science but the aesthetic instinct can judge i can only point out as a model the works of mr h g wells who has instinctively recog nized in his stories the correct proportions of fiction fact and science this has been possible only because mr wells is a literary artist above everything rather than predomin antly a scientist if he were a scientist his taste and sense would permit him only to write books of scientific research since lie is an artist he has given us the first truly beautiful work in this new field of literature these opinions we believe state the case clearly if we may voice our own opinion we should say that the ideal pro portion of a scientifiction story should be seventyfive per cent literature interwoven with twentyfive per cent science
