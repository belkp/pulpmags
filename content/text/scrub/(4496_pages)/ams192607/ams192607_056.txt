the moon metal as if i had seen it but i thought you were entitled to be in with me at the death a visit to the hall laboratory experimenting with a gold cathode from the nearest railway station we took horses to the laboratory which occupied a secluded but most beautiful site at an eleva tion of about six thousand feet above sealevel with considerable surprise i noticed a building sur mounted with a dome recalling what we had seen from the grand teton on the roof of dr syxs mill hall observing my look smiled significantly but said nothing the laboratory proper occupied a smaller building adjoining the domed structure hall led the way into an apartment having but a single door and illuminated by a skylight this is my sanctum sanctorum he said and you are the first outsider to enter it seat yourself comfortably while i proceed to unveil a little cor ner of the artemisium mystery near one end of the room which was about thirty feet in length was a table on which lay a glass tube about two inches in diameter and thirty inches long in the farther end of the tube gleamed a lump of yellow metal which i took to be gold hall and i were seated near another table about twentyfive feet distant from the tube and on this table was an apparatus finished with a con cave mirror whose optical axis was directed towards the tube it occurred to me at once that this ap paratus would be suitable for experimenting with electric waves wires ran from it to the floor and in the cellar beneath was audible the beating of an engine my companion made an adjustment or two and then remarked now keep your eyes on the lump of gold in the farther end of the tube yonder the tube is exhausted of air and i am about to concentrate upon the gold an intense electric influence which will have the effect of making it a kind of cathode pole i only use this term for the sake of illus tration you will recall that as long ago as the days of crookes it was known that a cathode in an exhausted tube would project particles or atoms of its substance away in straight lines now watch i fixed my attention upon the gold and presently saw it enveloped in a most beautiful violet light this grew more intense until at times it was blinding while at the same moment the interior of the tube seemed to have become charged with a luminous vapor of a delicate pinkish hue watch watch said hall look at the nearer end of the tube why its becoming coated with gold i ex claimed continuation of the experiment he smiled but made no reply still the strange process continued the pink vapor became so dense that the lump of gold was no longer visible although the eye of violet light glared piercingly through the colored fog every second the deposit of metal shining like a mirror increased until suddenly there came a curious whistling sound hall who had been adjusting the mirror jerked away his hand and gave it a flip as if hot water had spattered it and then the light in the tube quickly died away the vapor escaped filling the room with a peculiar stim ulating odor and i perceived that the end of the glass tube had been melted through and the molten gold was slowly dripping from it i carried it a little too far said hall ruefully rubbing the back of his hand and when the glass gave way under the atomic bombardment a few atoms of gold visited my bones but there is no harm done you observed that the instant the air reached the cathode as i for convenience call the electrified mass of gold the action ceased but your anode to continue your simile i said is constantly exposed to the air true he replied but in the first place of course this is not really an anode just as the other is not really a cathode as science advances we are compelled for a time to use old terms in a new sense until a fresh nomenclature can be in vented but we are now dealing with a form of electric action more subtile in its effects than any at present described in the textbooks and the tran sactions of learned societies i have not yet even attempted to work out the theory of it i am only concerned with its facts but wonderful as the exhibition you have given is i do not see i said how it concerns dr syx and his artemisium listen replied hall settling back in his chair after disconnecting his apparatus you no doubt have been told how one night the syx engine was heard working for a few minutes the first and only night work it was ever known to have done and how hardly had it started up when a fire broke out in the mill and the engine was instantly stopped now there is a very remarkable story connected with that and it will show you how i got my first clew to the mystery although it was rather a mere sus picion than a clew for at first i could make nothing out of it the alleged fire occurred about a fort night after our discovery of the double tunnel my mind was then full of suspicions concerning syx because i thought that a man who would fool people with one hand was not likely to deal fairly with the other the suspicious actions of dr syx explained it was a glorious night with a full moon whose face was so clear in the limpid air that having found a snug place at the foot of a yel lowpinetree where the ground was carpeted with odiferous needles i lay on my back and renewed my early acquaintance with the romantically named mountains and seas of the lunar globe with my binocular i could trace those long white streaks which radiate from the crater ring called tycho and run hundreds of miles in all directions over the moon as i gazed at these singular objects i re called the various theories which astronomers puzzled by their enigmatical aspects have offered to a more or less confiding public concerning them in the midst of my meditation and moon gazing i was startled by hearing the engine in the syx works suddenly begin to run immediately a queer light shaped like the beam of a ships searchlight but reddish in color rose high in the moonlit heav ens above the mill it did not last more than a minute or two for almost instantly the engine was
