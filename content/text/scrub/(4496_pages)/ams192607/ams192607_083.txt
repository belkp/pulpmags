 amazing stories and his distended mouth looked large enough to have swallowed a boatful of men we were about ten feet distant when i discov ered that much as his body resembled that of a crocodile his mouth was wholly that of a shark his twofold nature now became apparent to snatch us up at mouthful it was necessary for him to turn on his back which motion necessarily caused his legs to kick up helplessly in the air i actually laughed even in the very jaws of death but next minute with a wild cry i darted away into the interior of the cavern leaving my unhappy comrades to their fate this cavern was deep and dreary after about a hundred yards i paused and looked around the whole floor composed of sand and malachite was strewn with bones freshly gnawed bones of reptiles and fish with a mixture of mamalia my very soul grew sick as my body shud dered with horror i had truly according to the old proverb fallen out of the fryingpan into the fire some beast larger and more ferocious even than the sharkcrocodile inhabited this den what could i do the mouth of the cave was guarded by one ferocious monster the interior was inhabited by something too hideaus to contemplate flight was impossible suddenly a groaning as of fifty bears in a fight fell upon my earshisses spitting moaning hideous to hear and then i saw a dreadful dream of the antidiluvian gorilla never were ages to pass over my head shall i forget the horrible apparition it was the ape gigans the antidiluvian gorilla four teen feet high covered with coarse hair of a black ish brown it advanced its arms were as long as its body while its legs were prodigious it had thick long and sharplypointed teethlike a mammoth saw it struck its breast as it came on smelling and sniffing reminding me of the stories we read in our early childhood of giants who ate the flesh of men and little boys suddenly it stopped my heart beat wildly for i was conscious that somehow or other the fearful monster had smelt me out and was peering about with his hideous eyes to try and discover my where abouts i gave myself up for lost no hope of safety or escape seemed to remain at this moment just as my eyes appeared to close in death there came a strange noise from the en trance of the cave and turning the gorilla evi dently recognized some enemy more worthy his pro digious size and strength it was the huge shark crocodile which perhaps having disposed of my friends was coming in search of further prey the gorilla placed himself on the defensive and clutching a bone some seven or eight feet in length a perfect club aimed a deadly blow at the hideous beast which reared upwards and fell with all its weight upon its adversary a terrible combat en sued the struggle was awful and ferocious i did not wait to witness the result regarding my self as the object of contention i determined to remove from the presence of the victor i slid down from my hidingplace reached the ground and glid ing against the wall strove to gain the open mouth of the cavern but i had not taken many steps when the fearful clamor ceased to be followed by a mumbling and groaning which appeared to be indi cative of victory i looked back and saw the huge ape gory with blood coming after me with glaring eyes with di lated nostrils that gave forth two columns of heat ed vapor i could feel his hot and fetid breath on my neck and with a horrid jumpawoke from my nightmare sleep yesit was all a dream i was still on the raft with my uncle and the guide the relief was not instantaneous for under the influence of the hideous nightmare my senses had become numbed after a while however my feel ings were tranquilized the first of my perceptions which returned in full force was that of hearing i listened with acute and attentive ears all was still as death all i comprehended was silence to the roaring of the waters which had filled the gallery with awful reverberations succeeded perfect peace after some little time my uncle spoke in a low and scarcely audible toneharry boy where are you i am here was my faint rejoinder well dont you see what has happened we are going upwards my dear uncle what can you mean was my half delirious reply yes i tell you we are ascending rapidly our downward journey is quite checked the ascent continues i held out my hand and after some little diffi culty succeeded in touching the wall my hand was in an instant covered with blood the skin was torn from the flesh we were ascend ing with extraordinary rapidity the torchthe torch cried the professor wildly it must be lighted hans the guide after many vain efforts at last succeeded in lighting it and the flame having now nothing to prevent its burning shed a tolerably clear light we were en abled to form an approximate idea of the truth it is just as i thought said my uncle after ai moment or two of silent attention we are in a narrow well about four fathoms square the waters of the great inland sea having reached the bottom of the gulf are now forcing themselves up the migh ty shaft as a natural consequence we are being cast up on the summit of the waters that i can see was my lugubrious reply but where will this shaft end and to what fall are we likely to be exposed of that i am as ignorant as yourself all i know is that we should be prepared for the worst we are going up at a fearfully rapid rate as far as i can judge we are ascending at the rate of two fathoms a second of a hundred and twenty fathoms a minute or rather more than three and a half leagues an hour at this rate our fate will soon be a matter of certainty no doubt of it was my reply the great con cern i have now however is to know whether this shaft has any issue it may end in a granite roof in which case we shall be suffocated by compressed
