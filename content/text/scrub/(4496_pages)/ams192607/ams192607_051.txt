 amazing stories eration in wholesale electroplating just at present ive the ghost of an idea what it means but let me test my theory a little before i formulate it in the meanwhile wont you take a stroll with me certainly nothing could please me better i replied which way shall we go to the top of the grand teton what are you seized with the mountainclimb ing fever not exactly but i have a particular reason for wishing to take a look from that pinnacle i suppose you know the real apex of the peak has never been trodden by man i do know it but it is just that apex that i am determined to have under my feet for ten minutes the failure of others is no argument for us just as you say i rejoined but i suppose there is no indiscretion in asking whether this little climb has any relation to the mystery if it didnt have an important relation to the clearing up of that dark thing i wouldnt risk my neck in such an undertaking was the reply wandering over the great teton peak accordingly the next morning we set out for the peak all previous climbers as we were aware had attacked it from the west that seemed the obvious thing to do because the westward slopes of the mountain while very steep are less abrupt than those which face the rising sun in fact the eastern side of the grand teton ap pears to be absolutely unclimable but both hall and i had had experience with rock climbing in the alps and the dolomites and we knew that what looked like the hardest places sometimes turn out to be next to the easiest accordingly we decided the more particularly because it would save time but also because we yielded to the common desire to outdo our predecessorsto try to scale the giant right up his face we carried a very light but exceedingly strong rope about five hundred feet long wore nailshod shoes and had each a metalpointed staff and a small hatchet in lieu of the regular mountaineers axe advancing at first along the broken ridge be tween two gorges we gradually approached the steeper part of the teton where the cliffs looked so sheer and smooth that it seemed no wonder that no body had ever tried to scale them the air was de liciously clear and the sky wonderfully blue above the mountains and the moon a few days past its last quarter was visible in the southwest its pale crescent face slightly blued by the atmosphere as it always appears when seen in daylight slow westering a phantom sail the lonely soul of yesterday behind us somewhat north of east lay the syx works with their black smoke rising almost vertic ally in the still air suddenly as we stumbled along on the rough surface something whizzed past my face and fell on the rock at my feet i looked at the strange missile that had come like a meteor out of open space with astonishment it was a bird a beautiful specimen of the scarlet tanagers which i remembered the early explorers had found inhabiting the teton canyons their brill iant plumage borrowing splendor from contrast with the gloomy surroundings it lay motionless its outstretched wings having a curious shrivelled aspect while the flaming color of the breast was half obliterated with smutty patches stooping to pick it up i noticed a slight bronzing which in stantly recalled to my mind the peculiar appearance of the victims of the attack on the mine look here i called to hall who was several yards in advance he turned and i held up the bird by a wing where did you get that he asked it fell at my feet a moment ago hall glanced in a startled manner at the sky and then down the slope of the mountain did you notice in what direction it was flying he asked no it dropped so close that it almost grazed my nose i saw nothing of it until it made me blink andrew hall does not tell everything i have been heedless muttered hall under his breath at the time i did not notice the singularity of his remark my attention being absorbed in contemplating the unfortunate tanager look how its feathers are scorched i said i know it hall replied without glancing at the bird and it is covered with a film of artemisium i added a little piqued by his abstraction i know that too see here hall i exclaimed are you trying to make game of me not at all my dear fellow he replied dropping his cogitation pray forgive me but this is no new phenomenon to me i have picked up birds in that condition on this mountain before there is a terrible mystery here but i am slowly letting light into it and if we succeed in reaching the top of the peak i have good hope that the illumination will increase here now he added a moment later sitting down upon a rock and thrusting the blade of his penknife into a crevice what do you think of this he held up a little nugget of pure artemisium and then went on you know that all this slope was swept as clean as a dutch housewifes kitchen floor by the thous ands of miners and prospectors who swarmed over it a year or two ago and do you suppose they would have missed such a tidbit if it had been here then dr syx must have been salting the mountain again i suggested well replied hall with a significant smile if the doctor hasnt salted it somebody else has thats plain enough but perhaps you would like to know precisely what i expect to find out when we get on the topknot of the teton i should certainly be delighted to learn the ob ject of our journey i said of course im only go ing along for company and for the fun of the thing but you know you can count on me for substantial aid whenever you need it it is because you are so willing to let me keep my own counsel he rejoined and to wait for things to ripen before compelling me to disclose them that i like to have you with me at critical times now as to the object of this breakneck
