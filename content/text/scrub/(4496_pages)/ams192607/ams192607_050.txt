the moon metal and the marksmen fell in bunches like shaken grapes ninetenths of the besiegers were destroyed within ten minutes after the first movement had been noticed on the roof those who survived owed their escape to the rocks which concealed them and they lost no time in crawling off into neighboring chasms and as soon as they were beyond eyeshot from the mill they fled with panic speed then the towering form of dr syx appeared at the door emerging without sign of fear or exciter ment he picked his way among his fallen enemies and approaching the military guardhouse undid the fastening and set the imprisoned soldiers free i think i am paying rather dear for my whistle he said with a characteristic sneer to captain carter the commander of the troop it seems that i must not only defend my own people and property when attacked by mob force but must also come to the rescue of the soldiers whose payrolls are met from my pocket the captain made no reply and dr syx strode back to the works when the released soldiers saw what had occurred their amazement had no bounds it was necessary at once to dispose of the dead and this was no easy undertaking for their small force however they accomplished it and at the begin ning of their work made a most surprising discov ery hows this jim said one of the men to his comrade as they stooped to lift the nearest victim of dr syxs withering fire whats this fellow got all over him artemisium pon my soul responded jim staring at the body hes all coated over with it end of the riot immediately from all sides came similar exclamations every man who had fallen was covered with a film of the precious metal as if he had been dipped into an electrolytic bath cloth ing seemed to have been charred and the metallic atoms had penetrated the flesh of the victims the rocks all around the battlefield were similarly ve neered it looks to me said captain carter as if old syx had turned one of his spouts of artemisium into a hosepipe and soaked em with it thats it chimed in a lieutenant thats ex actly what hes done well returned the captain if he can do that i dont see what use hes got for us here probably he dont want to waste the stuff said the lieutenant what do you suppose it cost him to plate this crowd i guess a months pay for the whole troop wouldnt cover the expense its costly but then gracious wouldnt i have given something for the doctors hose when i was a youngster campaigning in the philippines in the story of the marvellous way in which dr syx defended his mill became the sensation of the world for many days the hosepipe theory struck off on the spot by captain carter seized the popu lar fancy and was generally accepted without fur ther question there was an element of the ludicrous which robbed the tragedy of some of its horror moreover no one could deny that dr syx was well within his rights in defending himself by any means when so savagely attacked and his triumph ant success no less than the ingenuity which was supposed to underlie it placed him in an heroic light which he had not hitherto enjoyed as to the demagogues who were responsible for the outbreak and its terrible consequences they slunk out of the public eye and the result of the battle at the mine seemed to have been a clearing up of the atmosphere such as a thunderstorm effects at the close of a season of foul weather but now little as men guessed it the beginning of the end was close at hand chapter viii the detective of science the morning of my arrival at grand teton station on my return from the east an drew hall met me with a warm greeting i have been anxiously expecting you he said for i have made some progress towards solving the great mystery i have not yet reached a con clusion but i hope soon to let you into the entire secret in the meantime you can aid me with your companionship if in no other way for since the defeat of the mob this place has been mighty lone some the grand teton is a spot that people who have no particular business out here carefully avoid i am on speaking terms with dr syx and occasionally when there is a party to be shown around i visit his works and make the best pos sible use of my eyes captain carter of the military is a capital fellow and i like to hear his stories of the war in luzon forty years ago but i want some body to whom i can occasionally confide things and so you are as welcome as moonlight in harvest time tell me something about that wonderful fight with the mob did you see it i did i had got wind of what bings intended to do while i was down at pocotello and i hurried up here to warn the soldiers but unfortunately i came too late finding the military cooped up in the guardhouse and the mob masters of the situation i kept out of sight on the side of the teton and watched the siege with my binocular i think there was very little of the spectacle that i missed what of the mysterious force that the doctor employed to sweep off the assailants of course captain carters suggestion that syx turned molten artemisium from his furnace into a hosepipe and sprayed the enemy with it is ridicu lous but it is much easier to dismiss carters theory than to substitute a better one i saw the doctor on the roof with a gang of black workmen and i noticed the flash of polished metal turned rapidly this way and that but there was some in tervening obstacle which prevented me from getting a good view of the mechanism employed it cer tainly bore no resemblance to a hosepipe or any thing of that kind no emanation was visible from the maehine but it was stupefying to see the mob melt down how about the coating of the bodies with arte misium there you are back on the hosepipe again laughed hall but to tell you the truth id rather be excused from expressing an opinion on that op
