the magnetic storm the magneto apart and to withdraw the armature he gave it one look and with a sickly smile uttered ausgebrannt herr leutnant herr leutnant took the armature into his own hands and inspected it critically sure enough it was burnt out if ever there was a burnt out armature perhaps fused would be a better term the armature was beyond repair a child could see that he flung it away and went over to the next nearest flyer but the mechanic had already located the troublein the magneto burnt out too von unterrichter unutterably sick at heart aim lessly wandered about the other machines in each case the result was the same every magneto arma ture of the fifteen flyers was burnt out the wires fused together all insulation gone aber so was muttered von unterrichter look ing about him helplessly it took fully five minutes before it filtered through his thick skull that this disaster that overtook his circus could by no means be a coincidence verfluchte amerikaner he said probably a new teufelmaschine of edison but what would the kommando say to this in stantly he stiffened as he jumped into a waiting au tomobile attached to the airdrome zum kommando schnell he ordered the driver as he sank back into his seat he must report this queer business to headquarters at once the driver cranked the engine then cranked it some more pfut pfut pfut sputtered the engine asthmaticlike but it did not start he tried again same result the useless automobile donnerwetter nochmal stormed the baron vexed over the delay was ist denn jetzt los why in thunder dont you start you miserable dog but the engine would not start the perplexed chauffeur climbed into the seat of the old style car which still had its faithful spark coils so necessary to the igni tion system but the spark coil refused to work al though the storage battery was fully charged and all the connections were right cautiously he pulled out one of the spark coil units from its box one look told the story ausgebrannt herr leutnant he said weakly for he had seen the burnt out magneto armatures a few minutes before von unterrichter with eyes almost popping out of his head was struck absolutely speechless for half a minute heiliger strohsack he muttered awestruck remembering his young sisters favorite expression whenever something out of the ordinary happened to her he finally collected himself suf ficiently and jumped out of the car zum telefon he muttered to himself he must report this uncanny occurrence at once to the kom mando not a second was to be lost he at last un derstood that something momentous had happened he made the airdrome on the run and though it was only yards away he surprised himself at the speed he made puffing volubly he arrived at the telephone he gave the handle several quick turns grasped the receiver and simultaneously bellowed into the mouthpiece in front of him all german telephones are magneto operated to call central you most turn the handle of the ringing magneto hallo hallo but he went no further the receiver flew from his ear for there had been a loud clattering rattling earsplitting noise in the instru ment that almost burst his eardrum he made a foolish grimace as he held his ear with his hand cautiously he approached the receiver to within a few inches of his other ear and listened all was quiet not a sound mechanically he unscrewed the receiver cap and looked at the two bobbins they were charred and black the telephone was dead to the radio transmitting station the instrument slipped from his hand and dangling by its red and purple cord went crashing against the wall of the airdrome while von unterrichter limply sank into a chair once more he got up and walked out he must get in touch with his general at all costs this was becoming too serious ah he had it the field telegraph there was one at the other end of the building he went there as fast as his legs could carry him he opened the door of the little office but one look sufficed the young man in charge of the telegraph sat dejected in a corner a dumb ex pression in his eyes long purple sparks were play ing about the instruments on the table a child could have seen that it was impossible to either send or receive a telegram under such conditions ah an inspiration dummkopf he muttered to himself why didnt i think of it before die funkenstation surely the wireless must work ha ha there are no wires there at least to burn out the radio station was over a kilometer away he knew it well for he had flown over it a great many times to get there quick that was the question the kommando was at least eight kilometers to the rear and he knew he could not make that distance on foot very quickly ah yes there was a horse somewhere around the cavalry horse was located soon and as the young airman walked hurriedly about troubled as he was he could not help noticing the listless attitude of every man he passed men were whispering in a hushed manner alarm was plainly written on their facesthe fear or the un known von unterrichter jumped on to his horse and galloped in the direction of the field radio station it did not take him long to reach it and long be fore he dismounted he could see the bright blue spark of the transmitting station gott sei lob he uttered to himself as he jumped to the ground at least thats working now it so happened that von unterrichter had been an expert wireless man before the war and while he did not know a great deal about electricity he well knew how to send and receive messages he ran to the wagon which carried the mobile radio field apparatus and peremptorily ordered the operator in charge away aber herr leutnant expostulated the thus rudely interrupted man i tell you maul halten thundered von unterrichter with which he sat down clamping the operators receiv ers on his own head
