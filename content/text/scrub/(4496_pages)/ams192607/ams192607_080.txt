a trip to the center of the earth uncle and the icelander followed the voyage from the port to this point of the sea had by no means calmed me it had rather produced the opposite effect i even proposed to burn our vessel that is to destroy our raft in order to completely cut off our retreat but my uncle sternly opposed this wild project i began to think him particularly luke warm and unenthusiastic at any rate my dear uncle i said let us start without delay yes my boy i am quite as eager to do so as you can be but in the first place let us examine this mysterious gallery in order to find if we shall need to prepare and mend our ladders my uncle now began to see to the efficiency of our ruhmkorfs coil which would doubtless soon be needed the raft securely fastened to a rock was left alone the opening into the new gallery was not twenty paces distant from the spot our little troop with myself at the head advanced their journey blocked by a great rock the orifice which was almost circular pre sented a diameter of about five feet the som ber tunnel was cut in the living rock and coated on the inside by the different material which had once passed through it in a state of fusion the lower part was about level with the water so that we were able to penetrate to the interior without difficulty we followed an almost horizontal direc tion when at the end of about a dozen paces our further advance was checked by the interposition of an enormous block of granite rock accursed stone i cried furiously on perceiv ing that we were stopped by what seemed an insur mountable obstacle in vain we looked to the right in vain we looked to the left in vain examined it above and below there existed no passage no sign of any other tun nel i experienced the most bitter and painful dis appointment so enraged was i that i would not admit the reality of any obstacle i stooped to my knees i looked under the mass of stone no hole no interstice i then looked above the same bar rier of granite hans with the lamp examined the sides of the tunnel in every direction but all in vain it was necessary to renounce all hope of pass ing through i had seated myself upon the ground my uncle walked angrily and hopelessly up and down he was evidently desperate but i cried after some mo ments thought what about arne saknussem you are right replied my uncle he can never have been checked by a lump of rock noten thousand times no i cried with ex treme vivacity this huge lump of rock in conse quence of some concussion has in some unexpected way closed up the passage many and many years have passed away since the return of saknussem and the fall of this huge block of granite is it not quite evident that this gallery was formerly the out let for the pentup lava in the interior of the earth and that these eruptive matters then circulated freely look at these recent fissures in the granite roof it is evidently formed of pieces of enormous stone placed here as if by the hand of a giant who had worked to make a strong and substantial arch one day after an unusually heavy shock the vast rock which stands in our way fell through to a level with the soil and has barred our further pro gress we are right then in thinking that this is an unexpected obstacle with which saknussem did not meet and if we do not upset it in some way we are unworthy of following in the footsteps of the great discoverer and incapable of finding our way to the center of the earth in this wild way i addressed my uncle the zeal of the professor his earnest longing for success had become part and parcel of my being i wholly forgot the past i utterly despised the future noth ing existed for me upon the surface of this spheroid in the bosom of which i was engulfed no towns no country no hamburg no konigstrasse not even my poor gretchen who by this time would believe me utterly lost in the interior of the earth well cried by uncle roused to enthusiasm by my words let us go to work with pickaxes with crowbars with anything that comes to handbut down with these terrible walls it is far too tough and too big to be destroyed by a pickax or crowbar i replied what then as i said it is useless to think of overcoming such a difficulty by means of ordinary tools what then what else but gunpowder a subterranean mine let us blow up the obstacle that stands in our way gunpowder yes all we have to do is to get rid of this paltry obstacle to work hans to work cried the professor the icelander went back to the raft and soon re turned with a huge crowbar with which he began to dig a hole in the rock which was to serve as a mine it was by no means a slight task it was necessary for our purpose to make a cavity large enough to hold fifty pounds of fulminating gun cot ton the expansive power of which is four times as great as that of ordinary gunpowder i had now roused myself to an almost miraculous state of excitement while hans was at work i ac tively assisted my uncle to prepare a long wick made from damp gunpowder the mass of which we finally enclosed in a bag of linen we are bound to go through i cried enthusiastically we are bound to go through responded the professor tapping me on the back at midnight our work as miners was completely finished the charge of fulminating cotton was thrust into the hollow and the match which we had made of considerable length was ready a spark was now sufficient to ignite this formidable engine and to blow the rock to atoms we will now rest until tomorrow it was absolutely necessary to resign myself to my fate and to consent to wait for the explosion for six weary hours chapter xxxix the explosion and its results the next day which was the twentyseventh of august was a date celebrated in our won drous subterranean journey i never think of it even now but i shudder with horror my heart beats wildly at the very memory of that awful day from this time forward our
