a time have been able to accum ulate an immense quantity of the new metal it must be extremely abundant others will discover it and then where shall we be while mr boon uttered these words those who were watching dr syx as the president was not resembled persons whose startled eyes are fixed up on a wild beast preparing to spring as mr boon ceased speaking he turned towards the visitor and

had now returned with a concentrated expression of mingled selfconfidence and disdain will you have relief or not he asked in a dry hard voice what can you do i alone possess the secret which can restore industry and commerce if you reject my offer do you think a second one will come president boon found voice to reply stammer ingly i did not mean to suggest a rejection of the of fer i only wished to inquire if you thought it probable that there would be no repetition of what occurred after gold was found at the south pole the earth may be full of my metal returned dr syx almost fiercely

but inaccessible heart of the rocky mountains three mighty brothers the big tetons look perpendicularly into the blue eye of jennys lake lying at the bottom of the profound depression among the mountains called jacksons hole bracing against one another for support these remarkable peaks lift their granite spires from to nearly feet into the blue dome that arches the crest of the continent their sides and especially those of their chief the grand teton are streaked with glaciers which shine like silver trap pings when the morning sun comes up above the wilderness of mountains stretching away eastward from the hole when the first white men penetrated this wonder ful region and one of them bestowed his wifes name upon jennys lake they were intimidated by the grand teton it made their flesh creep ac customed though they were to rough scrambling among mountain gorges and on the brows of im mense precipices when they glanced up the face of the peak where the cliffs fall one below another in a series of breathless descents and imagined themselves clinging for dear life to those skyey battlements but when in messrs stevenson and lang ford finally reached the top of the grand teton the only successfu members of a party of nine practised climbers who had started together from the bottomthey found there a little rectangular enclosure made by piling up rocks six or seven feet across and three feet in height bearing evidences of great age and indicating that the red indians had for some unknown purpose resorted to the summit of this tremendous peak long before the white men invaded their mountains yet neither the indians nor the whites ever really conquered the teton for above the highest point that they at tained rises a granite buttress whose smooth verti cal sides seemed to them to defy everything but wings winding across the sagecovered floor of jacksons hole runs the shoshone or snake river which takes its rise from jacksons lake at the northern end of the basin and then as if shrinking from the threatening brows of the tetons whose fall would block its progress makes a detour of one hundred miles around the buttressed heights of the range before it finds a clear way across idaho and so on to the columbia river and the pacific ocean
