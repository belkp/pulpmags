the moon metal the secret of producing artemisium becomes public property soon after came a report that dr syx had been seen again this time at ekaterinburg in the urals next he was said to have paid a visit to batang in the mountainous district of southwestern china and finally according to ru mor he was seen in sicily at nicolosi among the volcanic pimples on the southern slope of mount etna next followed something of more curious and even startling interest a chemist at budapest where the first rumors of syxs reappearance had placed the mysterious doctor announced that he could pro duce artemisium and proved it although he kept his process secret hardly had the sensation caused by this news partially subsided when a similar report arrived from ekaterinburg then another from ba tang after that a fourth from nicolosi nobody could fail to notice the coincidence wherever the doctoror was it his ghostappear ed there shortly afterwards somebody discovered the muchsought secret after syxs apparitions rapidly increased in fre quency followed in each instance by the announce ment of another productive artemisium mill he appeared in germany italy france england and finally at many places in the united states it is the old doctors revenge said hall to me one day trying to smile although the matter was too serious to be taken humorously yes it is his revenge and i must admit that it is complete the price of artemisium has fallen onehalf within six months all the efforts we have made to hold back the floor have proved useless the secret itself is becoming public property we shall inevitably be overwhelmed with artemisium just as we were with gold and the last condition of the financial world will be worse than the first my friends gloomy prognostications came near being fulfilled to the letter ten thousand artemisi um mills shot their etheric rays upon the moon and our unfortunate satellites metal ribs were stripped by atomic force some of the great white rays that had been one of the telescopic wonders of the lunar landscapes disappeared and the face of the moon which had remained unchanged before the eyes of the children of adam from the beginning of their race now looked as if the blast of a furnace had swept it at night on the moonward side the earth was studded with brilliant spikes all pointed at the heart of its child in the sky but the looting of the moon brought disaster to the robber planet so mad were the efforts to get the precious metal that the surface of our globe was fairly showered with it productive fields were in some cases almost smothered under a metallic coating the air was filled with shining dust until finally famine and pestilence joined hands with fin ancial disaster to punish the grasping world then at last the various governments took effec tive measures to protect themselves and their people another combined effort resulted in an interna tional agreement whereby the production of the precious moon metal was once more rigidly con trolled but the existence of a monopoly such as dr syx had so long enjoyed and in the enjoyment of which andrew hall had for a brief period suc ceeded him was henceforth rendered impossible chapter xii the last of dr syx many years after the events last recorded i sat at the close of a brilliant autumn day side by side with my old friend andrew hall on a broad vineshaded piazza which faced the east where the full moon was just rising above the rim of the sierra and replacing the rosy coun terglow of sunset with its silvery radiance the sight was calculated to carry the minds of both back to the events of former years but i noticed that hall quickly changed the position of his chair and sat down again with his back to the rising moon he had managed to save some millions from the wreck of his vast fortune when artemisium started to go to the dogs and i was now paying him one of my annual visits at his palatial home in california did i ever tell you of my last trip to the teton he asked as i continued to gaze contemplatively at the broad lunar disk which slowly detached itself from the horizon and began to swim in the clear evening sky no i replied but i should like to hear about it or of my last sight of dr syx indeed i did not suppose that you ever saw him after that conference in your mill when he had to surrender half of the world to you once only i saw him again said hall with a peculiar intonation pray go ahead and tell me the whole story my friend lighted a fresh cigar tipped his chair into a more comfortable position and began it was about seven years ago i had long felt an unconquerable desire to have another look at the teton and the scenes amid which so many strange events in my life had occurred i thought of send ing for you to go with me but i knew you were abroad much of your time and i could not be cer tain of catching you finally i decided to go alone i travelled on horseback by way of the snake river canyon and arrived early one morning in jacksons hole i can tell you it was a gloomy place as barren and deserted as some of those arabian wadies that you have been describing to me the railroad had long ago been abandoned and the site of the mili tary camp could scarcely be recognized an immense cavity with ragged walls showed where dr syxs mill used to send up its plume of black smoke as i started up the gaunt form of the teton whose beetling precipices had been smashed and split by the great explosion i was seized with a resistless impulse to climb it i thought i should like to peer off again from that pinnacle which had once formed so fateful a watchtower for me turn ing my horse loose to graze in the grassy river bot tom and carrying my rope tether along as a pos sible aid in climbing i set out for the ascent i knew i could not get up the precipices on the east ern side which we were able to master with the aid of our balloon and so i bore round when i reached the steepest cliffs until i was on the south western side of the peak where the climbing was easier continued on page
