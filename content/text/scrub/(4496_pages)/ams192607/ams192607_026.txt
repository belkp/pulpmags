staion x now appeared the wisdom of captain evered in writing to professor rudge for had he not done so nothing further would have been heard of mac raes experiences on the island of station x the letter he received had not contained much in formation but enough to make him want to know more he had an interview with the first lord and as a result macraes account of his experiences was placed in his hands with the request that all requisite caution should be employed professor rudge read macraes account with un bounded astonishment when he had read the pages a second time his mind was made up he was a man of quick decision and equally quick action the next morning macrae received a letter from professor rudge enclosing a remittance for ex penses and asking him as a favor to come back to town and call on him at his earliest convenience with a view to the further investigation of your recent remarkable experience this phrase showed macrae that his correspondent must be in touch with the authorities and he felt bound to comply at once although not without a grumble both on his part and that of his fiancee examination of the operator again macrae found himself put through an examination this time it was more search ing more detailed more minute than any he had had before absolutely no point escaped the savant he was at least as competent as dr ander son to investigate the examinee as to his mental health far more competent to probe his character disposition ways of thought and general knowledge and form an accurate opinion as to his personal peculiarities macrae himself described the pro cess as that of being turned completely inside out before it was finished he had taken a great lik ing to the professor the training of the scientist had taught professor rudge to approach his sub ject without prejudice and under the influence of his sympathetic manner macrae opened out and laid himself bare as he would not have believed possible next the conversation was turned on the radio installation at the station and macrae found that on the subject he knew most of his knowledge was small compared with that of his examiner he was questioned on every detail however apparently irrelevant professor rudge decidcs to visit station x finally they went through almost word for word the communications of the voice in numerable questions were asked respecting the voice itself he was very especially questioned he could not tell why regarding any peculiarity in respect to stress or accent on the various syllables and modulation of intonation he was able to reply very intelligently to this being quick to understand the meaning of the question no doubt the more so from being himself bilingual he noticed that the professor seemed pleased at eliciting the informa tion that while the articulation and pronunciation were accurate accent and modulation were notably deficient making the style rather monotonous a special peculiarity volunteered by macrae was that every sentence seemed to end abruptly with no fall ing of the voice as though in fact it had been in tended to add more at last when the examination seemed almost over macrae himself ventured to put the question as to what conclusion if any his questioner had come to i have come to several macrae and as i ob served that you have an uncomfortable feeling that people will doubt your sincerity let me at once say that such a thing is not intelligently possible even with the greatest desire to deceive you could not possibly have duped me for a moment on this mat ter the voice spoke to me asked macrae eagerly undoubtedly there is not the least possibility that you are yourself deceived in that replied the professor i am very glad i came to see you sir said macrae with a sigh of relief and all i ask now is to forget the whole thing voice island and all then you ask a great deal too much my boy said professor rudge with a smile shall i tell you how much you have interested me the best way to do so is to tell you the intention i have formed i am going to visit station x and i am go ing to take you with me to be continued in the august issue back numbers of amazing stories no doubt
