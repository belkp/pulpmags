 amazing stories it was quite evident that we were being cast up wards by eruptive matter under the raft there was a mass of boiling water and under this was a heav ing mass of lava and an aggregate of rocks which on reaching the summit of the water would be dis persed in every direction that we were inside the chimney of a volcano there could no longer be the shadow of a doubt nothing more terrible could be conceived but on this occasion instead of sneffels an old and extinct volcano we were inside a mountain of fire in full activity several times i found myself asking what mountain was it and on what part of the world we should be shot out as if it were of any consequence in the northern regions there could be no reasonable doubt about that before it went decidedly mad the compass had never made the slightest mistake from the cape of saknus sem we had been swept away to the northward many hundreds of leagues now the question was were we once more under icelandshould we be belched forth on to the earth through the crater of mount hecla or should we reappear through one of the other seven firefunnels of the island tak ing in my mental vision a radius of five hundred leagues to the westward i could see under this parallel only the littleknown volcanoes of the northwest coasts of america to the east one only existed somewhere about the eightieth degree of latitude the esk upon the island of jean mayen not far from the frozen regions of spitzbergen it was not craters that were wanting and many of them were big enough to vomit a whole army all i wished to know was the particular one towards which we were making with such fearful velocity i often think now of my folly as if i should have expected to escape towards morning the ascending motion became greater and greater if the degree of heat in creased instead of decreasing as we approached the surface of the earth it was simply because the causes were local and wholly due to volcanic in fluence our very style of locomotion left in my mind no doubt upon the subject an enormous force a force of some hundred of combined atmos pheres produced by vapors accumulated and long compressed in the interior of the earth were hoist ing us upwards with irresistible power but though we were approaching the light of day to what fearful dangers were we about to be ex posed instant death appeared the only fate which we could expect or contemplate the worst period of the ascent soon a dim sepulchral light penetrated the vertical gallery which became wider and wider i could make out to the right and left long dark corridors like immense tunnels from which awful and horrid vapors poured out ton gues of fire sparkling and crackling appeared about to lick us up the hour had come look uncle look i cried well what you see are the great sulphurous flames nothing more common in connection with an eruption but if they lap us round i angrily replied they will not lap us round was his quiet and serene answer but it will be all the same in the end if they stifle us i cried we shall not be stifled the gallery is rapidly becoming wider and wider and if it be necessary we will presently leave the raft and take refuge in some fissure in the rock but the water the water which is continually ascending i despairingly replied there is no longer any water harry he an swered but a kind of lava paste which is heaving us up in company with itself to the mouth of the crater in truth the liquid column of water had wholly disappeared to give place to dense masses of seeth ing eruptive matter the temperature was becoming utterly insupportable and a thermometer exposed to this atmosphere would have marked between and degrees fahrenheit perspiration rushed from every pore but for the extraordinary rapidity of our ascent we should have been stifled nevertheless the professor did not carry out his proposition of abandoning the raft and he did quite wisely anyway those few illjoined beams offered a solid surfacea support which elsewhere must have utterly failed us towards eight oclock in the morning a new in cident startled us the ascensional movement sud denly ceased the raft became still and motionless what is the matter now i said querulously very much startled by this change a simple halt replied my uncle is the eruption about to fail i asked i hope not without making any reply i rose i tried to look around me perhaps the raft checked by some projecting rock opposed a momentary resistance to the eruptive mass in this case it was absolutely necessary to release it as quickly as possible nothing of the kind had occurred the column of cinders of scoriae of broken rocks and earth had wholly ceased to ascend i tell you uncle that the eruption has stopped was my oracular decision ah said my uncle you think so my boy you are wrong do not be in the least alarmed this sudden moment of calm will not last long be as sured it has already endured five minutes and be fore we are many minutes older we shall be con tinuing our journey to the mouth of the crater all the time he was speaking the professor con tinued to consult his chronometer and he was probably right in his prognostics soon the raft resumed its motion in a very rapid and disorderly way which lasted two minutes or thereabout and then again it stopped as suddenly as before good said my uncle observing the hour in ten minutes we shall start again in ten minutes yesprecisely we have to do with a volcano the eruption of which is intermittent we are com pelled to breathe just as it does a long lasting delirium as escape approaches nothing could be more true at the exact minute he had indicated we were again launched on high with extreme rapidity not to be cast off the raft it was necessary to hold on to the beams then the hoist again ceased many times since have i thought of this singular
