a trip to the center of the earth then as we advanced still farther the position of the cliffs the appearance of a stream the unex pected profile of a rock would throw me again into a state of bewildering doubt after some time i explained my state of mental indecision to my uncle he confessed to a similar feeling of hesita tion he was totally unable to make up his mind in the midst of this extraordinary but uniform panorama there can be no doubt i insisted that we have not landed exactly at the place whence we first took our departure but the tempest has brought us above our starting point i think there fore that if we follow the coast we shall once more find port gretchen in that case cried my uncle it is useless to continue our exploration the very best thing we can do is to make our way back to the raft are you quite sure harry that you are not mistaken it is difficult was my reply to come to any decision for all these rocks are exactly alike there is no marked difference between them at the same time the impression on my mind is that i recognize the promontory at the foot of which our worthy hans constructed the raft we are i am nearly convinced near the little port if this is not it i added carefully examining a creek which ap peared singularly familiar to my mind my dear harryif this were the case we should find traces of our own footsteps some signs of our passage and i can really see nothing to indi cate our having passed this way a rusty dagger is found deep in the earth but i see something i cried in an impetu ous tone of voice as i rushed forward and eagerly picked up something which shone in the sand under my feet what is it cried the astonished and bewildered professor this was my reply and i handed to my startled relative a rusty dagger of singular shape what made you bring with you so useless a weapon he exclaimed it was needlessly hamp ering yourself i bring itit is quite new to me i never saw it beforeare you sure it is not out of your collec tion not that i know of said the professor puzzled i have no recollection of the circumstance it was never my property this is very extraordinary i said musing over the novel and singular incident not at all there is a very simple explanation harry the icelanders are known to keep up the use of these antiquated weapons and this must have belonged to hans who has let it fall without know ing it i shook my head that dagger had never been in the possession of the pacific and taciturn hans i knew him and his habits too well what can it beunless it be the weapon of some antediluvian warrior i continued of some living man a con temporary of that mighty shepherd from whom we have just escaped but nomystery upon mystery this is no weapon of the stone epoch nor even of the bronze period it is made of excellent steel it is saknussems dagger ere i could finish my sentence my uncle stop ped me short from entering upon a whole train of theories and spoke in his most cold and decided tone of voice calm yourself my dear boy and endeavor to use your reason this weapon upon which we have fallen so unexpectedly is a true dague one of those worn by gentlemen in their belts during the sixteenth century its use was to give the coup de grace the final blow to the foe who would not surrender it is clearly of spanish work manship it belongs neither to you nor to me nor the eiderdown hunter nor to any of the living be ings who may still exist so marvelously in the in terior of the earth what can you mean uncle i said now lost in a host of surmises look closely at it he continued these jagged edges were never made by the resistance of human blood and bone the blade is covered with a reg ular coating of ironmould and rust which is not a day old not a year old not a century old but much more the professor began to get quite excited ac cording to custom and was allowing himself to be carried away by his fertile imagination i could have said something he stopped me harry he cried we are now on the verge of a great discov ery this blade of a dagger you have so marvelous ly discovered after being abandoned upon the sand for more than a hundred two hundred even three hundred years has been indented by someone en deavoring to carve an inscription on these rocks but this poignard never got here of itself i exclaimed it could not have twisted itself some one therefore must have preceded us upon the shores of this extraordinary sea yes a man but what man has been sufficiently desperate to do such a thing a man who has somewhere written his name with this very daggera man who has endeavored once more to indicate the right road to the interior of the earth let us look around my boy you know not the importance of your singular and happy discovery prodigiously interested we walked along the wall of rock examining the smallest fissures which might finally expand into the much wished for gully or shaft we at last reached a spot where the shore became extremely narrow the sea almost bathed the foot of the rocks which were here very lofty and steep there was scarcely a path wider than two yards at any point at last under a huge over hanging rock we discovered the entrance of a dark and gloomy tunnel there on a square tablet of granite which had been smoothed by rubbing it with another stone we could see two mysterious and much worn letters the two initials of the bold and extraordinary trav eler who had preceded us on our adventurous jour ney arne saknussem a s cried my uncle you see i was right arne saknussem always arne saknussem
