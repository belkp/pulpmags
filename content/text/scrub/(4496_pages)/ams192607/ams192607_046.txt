the moon metal tain and besides what object could dr syx have in pretending that there is free metal to be had for the digging he may have salted the mountain for all i know said hall as for his object i confess i am entirely in the dark but for all that i am convinced that we shall find no more metal if we dig ten miles for it nonsense said the president if we keep on we shall strike it did not dr syx himself admit that he found no free artemisium until his tunnel had reached the core of the peak we must go as deep as he has gone before we give up i fear the depths he attains are beyond most peoples reach was halls answer while a thought ful look crossed his clearcut brow but since you desire it of course the work shall go on i should like however to change the direction of the tun nel certainly replied mr boon bore in what ever direction you think proper only dont des pair about a month after this conversation andrew hall with whom a community of tastes in many things had made me intimately acquainted asked me one morning to accompany him into his tun nel i want to have a trusty friend at my elbow he said for unless i am a dreamer something re markable will happen within the next hour and two witnesses are better than one a friendly investigatorandrew hall proposes to solve the mystery i knew hall was not the person to make such a remark carelessly and my curiosity was in tensely excited but knowing his peculiarities i did not press him for an explanation when we arrived at the head of the tunnel i was surprised at finding no workmen there i stopped blasting some time ago said half in explanation for a reason which i hope will be come evident to you very soon lately i have been boring very slowly and yesterday i paid off the men and dismissed them with the announcement which i am confident president boon will sanction after he hears by reports of this mornings work that the tunnel is abandoned you see i am now using a drill which i can manage without assis tance i believe the work is almost completed and i want you to witness the end of it he then carefully applied the drill which noise lessly screwed its nose into the rock when it had sunk to a depth of a few inches he withdrew it and taking a handdrill capable of making a hole not more than an eighth of an inch in diameter cautiously began boring in the centre of the larger cavity he had made hardly a hundred turns of the handle when the drill shot through the rock a gratified smile illuminated his features and he said in a suppressed voice dont be alarmed im going to put out the light instantly we were in complete darkness but be ing close at halls side i could detect his move ments he pulled out the drill and for half a min ute remained motionless as if listening there was no sound i must enlarge the opening he whispered and immediately the faint grating of a sharp tool cut ting through the rock informed me of his pro gress there at last he said i think that will do now for a look i could tell that he had placed his eye at the hole and was gazing with breathless attention presently he pulled my sleeve put your eye here he whispered pushing me into the proper position for looking through the hole looking through a peephole at first i could discern nothing except a smoky blue glow but soon my vision cleared a little and then i perceived that i was gazing into a narrow tunnel which met ours directly end to end glancing along the axis of this gallery i saw some two hundred yards away a faint light which evi dently indicated the mouth of the tunnel at the end where we had met it the mysterious tunnel was considerably widened at one side as if the excavators had started to change direction and then abandoned the work and in this elbow i could just see the outlines of two or three flat cars loaded with broken stone while a heap of the same ma terial lay near them through the centre of the tunnel ran a railway track do you know what you are looking at asked hall in my ear i begin to suspect i replied that you have ac cidentally run into dr syxs mine if dr syx had been on his guard this accident wouldnt have happened replied hall with an al most inaudible chuckle i heard you remark a month ago i said that you were changing the direction of your tunnel has this been the aims of your labors ever since discoveries under halls auspices you have hit it he replied long ago i i becairie convinced that my company was throwing away its money in a vain attempt to strike a lode of pure artemisium but president boon has great faith in dr syx and would hot give up the work so i adopted what i regarded as the only practical method of proving the truth of my opinion and saving the companys funds an electric indicater of my invention enabled me to locate the syx tunnel when i got near it and i have met it on end and opened this peephole in order to observe the doctors operations i feet that such spying is entirely justified in the circumstances although i cannot yet explain just how or why i feel sure that dr syx was the cause of the sudden discovery of the surface nuggets and that he has encouraged the miners for his own ends until he has brought ruin to thousands who have spent their last cent in driving useless tunnels into this mountain it is a righteous thing to expose him but i interposed i do not see that you have exposed anything yet except the interior of a tun nel you will see more clearly after a while was the reply hall now placed his eye again at the aperture and was unable entirely to repress the exclamation
