 amazing stories numerous during the tertiary period which gave them birth were without color and without per fume something like paper discolored by long ex posure to the atmosphere a herd of mastodons my uncle ventured beneath the gigantic groves i followed him though not without a certain amount of apprehension since nature had shown herself capable of producing such stupendous vegetable productions why might we not meet with animals as large and therefore dangerous suddenly i stopped short and restrained my uncle the extreme diffuseness of the light en abled me to see the smallest objects in the distant copse i thought i sawno i really did see with my own eyesimmense gigantic animals moving about under the mighty trees yes they were truly gigantic animals a whole herd of mastodons not fossils but living yes i could see these enormous elephants whose trunks were tearing down large boughs and work ing in and out the trees like a legion of serpents i could hear the sounds of the mighty tusks up rooting huge trees the boughs crackled and whole masses of leaves and green branches went down the capacious throats of these terrible mon sters that wondrous dream when i saw the antehis torical times revivified when the tetiary and quat ernary periods passed before me was now realized and there we were alone far down in the bowels of the earth at the mercy of its ferocious inhabi tants my uncle paused full of wonder and astonish ment come he said at last when his first sur prise was over come along my boy and let us see them nearer no replied i restraining his efforts to drag me forward we are wholly without arms what should we do in the midst of that flock of gigantic quadrupeds come away uncle i implore you no human creature can with impunity brave the feroc ious anger of these monsters no human creature said my uncle suddenly lowering his voice to a mysterious whisper you are mistaken my dear harry look look yonder it seems to me that i behold a human beinga be ing like ourselvesa man a dream of prehistoric ages i looked shrugging my shoulders and decided to push incredulity to its very last limits but whatever might have been my wish i was com pelled to yield to the weight of ocular demonstration yesnot more than a quarter of a mile off leaning against the trunk of an enormous tree was a hu man beinga proteus of these subterranean re gions a new son of neptune keeping this innumer able herd of mastodons immanis pecoris custos immanior ipse the keeper of gigantic cattle him self a giant yesit was no longer a fossil whose corpse we had raised from the ground in the great cemetery but a giant capable of guiding and driv ing these prodigious monsters his height was above twelve feet his head as big as the head of a buffalo was lost in a mane of matted hair it was indeed a huge mane like those which belonged to the elephants of the earlier ages of the world in his hand was a branch of a tree which served as a crook for this antediluvian shepherd we remained profoundly still speechless with surprise but we might at any moment be seen by him nothing remained for us but instant flight come come i cried dragging my uncle along and for the first time he made no resistance to my wishes a quarter of an hour later we were far away from that terrible monster now that i think of the matter calmly and reflect upon it dispassionately now that months years have passed since this strange and unnatural adventure befell us what am i to think what am i to believe no it is utterly impossible our ears must have deceived us and our eyes have cheated us we have not seen what we believed we had seen no hu man being could by any possibility have existed in that subterranean world no generation of men could inhabit the lower caverns of the globe with out taking note of those who peopled the surface without communication with them it was folly folly folly nothing else i am rather inclined to admit the existence of some animal resembling in structure the human raceof some monkey of the first geological epochs like that discovered by m lartet in the os siferous deposits of sansan but this animal or being whichsoever it was surpassed in height all things known to modern science never mind however unlikely it may be it might have been a monkeybut a man a living man and with him a whole generation of gigantic animals buried in the entrails of the earthit was too monstrous to be believed chapter xxxvii the mysterious dagger during this time we had left the bright and transparent forest far behind us we were mute with astonishment overcome by a kind of feeling which was next door to apathy we kept running in spite of ourselves it was a per fect flight which resembled one of those horrible sensations we sometimes meet with in our dreams instinctively we made our way towards the cen tral sea and i cannot now tell what wild thoughts passed through my mind nor of what follies i might have been guilty but for a very serious pre occupation which brought me back to practical life though i was aware that we were treading on a soil quite new to us i every now and then noticed certain aggregation of rock the shape of which forcibly reminded me of those near port gretchen this confirmed moreover the indications of the compass and our extraordinary and unlookedfor as well as involuntary return to the north of this great central sea it was so like our starting point that i could scarcely doubt the reality of our posi tion streams and cascades fell in hundreds over the numerous projections of the rocks i actually thought i could see our faithful and monotonous hans and the wonderful grotto in which i have come back to life after my tremendous fall
