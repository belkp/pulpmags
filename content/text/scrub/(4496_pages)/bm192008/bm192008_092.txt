the strange story of martin colby by ward sterling this is martin colbys story not mine three of us heard him tell itwilloughby the eminent english clergyman who is now filling a number of lec ture engagements in this country mosby the attorney and myself and we are all firmly convinced that he spoke the truth i write it just as he gave it to us we were spending a few days in early spring at mosbys country place possibly the weather had some thing to do with the way the story impressed us it was a dark stormy night with drizzling gusts of rain and a shrieking howling wind that shook the window panes and whistled and moaned through the leafless treesone of those nights that make the shivers run up and down your backbone in pleasurable anticipation of the scare that never comesa night created especially for tales of yawning graves and spiritual mani festations seated in front of the huge open fireplace in mosbys big living room a room so large that there were shadows in every cornerit was only natural that the talk should drift onto haunted houses life after death and the supernatural in all its varying phases mosby who is something of an amateur psychologist had been read ing sir oliver lodge sir arthur doyle and other writers on spiritual lines and was filled with enthusiasm and a working idea of ouija boards spirit rappings and table tipping on the other hand willoughby like most clergyman was an opgn scoffer the argument continued for an hour or two without result finally colby who had been listening and saying nothing was ap pealed to there is no question in my mind he answered weighing his words carefully as he always does when he speaks seriously that our departed friends watch over us and given half a chance will offer us a helping hand bosh shouted the clergyman give us proofs man dont deal in generalities offer us something tangible colby hesitated before answering what i am about to tell you he said finally is a true story i have never repeated it to anyone before because i do not care to have people doubt my wordand the average man is prone to scoff at what he can not understand to me there is only one explanationthat of spirit inter vention perhaps you as a clergy man with a supposedly better knowl edge of the hereafter than is given us ordinary mortals can offer a solution to the puzzle and this is the story that martin colby told
