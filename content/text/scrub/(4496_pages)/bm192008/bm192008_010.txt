the man who was seven or early forties with neatly trimmed brown mustache and vandyke beard it was dressed in a suit of blue serge doublebreasted coat tan shoes on the floor near by lay a lightweight gray overcoat a broad brimmed black soft hat the broken pieces of what had been spectacles with large rimless egg shaped lenses a black gladstone bag and a soleleather suitcase the last named was empty but the bag was partially filled with pajamas shirts collars and the usual toilet acces sories of a man particular about his ap pearance in the pockets of the clothes there was found nothing by which to identify the dead man except a card case stamped with and containing cards engraved with the name samuel smith and receipted bills made out in the same name and all bearing the same date that of the previous day from seven seattle hotels but the foregoing might apply in a general way to the body of any dead man under normal circumstances what took this body out of the ordinary was not only its inexplicable presence in the locked and guarded vault but also the fact that from the back there protrud ed the handle of a large hunting knife one of the elkhorn variety never car ried except by chechahco hunters the long blade was buried in the body just below and to the right of the left shoul derblade between it and the spine and had been driven in with such a forceful blow that the haft made an indentation iri the flesh about the wound an inquiry conducted quietly and circumspectly out of regard for the tender feelings of the totem national developed the fact that a man answer ing to this description and the name of samuel smith had stopped at each and all of the hotels indicated by the bills that he had settled his accounts and de parted the day before wednesday for a destination unknown to any of the clerks leaving no forwarding address but the policeman in plain clothes who reported on this feature of the case was not gifted with imagination above carrying a message to garcia and so he did only what he was told to do and asked only what he had been told to ask thus he overlooked the coincidence in the times of arrival and departure of the said smith which later was de veloped the chief of police and the city de tectives working under him on the case were unanimous in their opinion of the dead mans part in the problem there was not the slightest doubt chief stein declared and the others echoed that the man must have been one of the gang that turned the trick and that he had been murdered by his confederates dur ing a quarrel over the division of the spoils the suitcase they pointed out un questionably had been provided for carrying away this smiths share of the proceeds of the robbery and its empti ness was conclusive evidence that he in turn had been cheated of that share and stabbed when he attempted to pro test to them the police the dead man simply was one crook the less to require their attentionand good rid dance nor to them did he even pro vide one of their dearly beloved clues the government officers were not in terested at all in the death or murder except for its possible value as an indi cation of the gangs identity presup posing that there was a gang that had turned the trick the mans face and description were not on file at any po lice headquarters in the country and cabled inquiry abroad did not serve to identify him as a known or suspected criminal the pinkerton operatives acting di rectly for the bank and the bankers protective association were like the secret servicemen far more interested
