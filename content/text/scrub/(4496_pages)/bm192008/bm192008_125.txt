brothersofthecoast by j g kofoed i dropped over the side of the mary rose when she steamed out of port royal and swam back to the wharf it was a foolish thing to do for the harbor was full of ground sharks but the heat and rather too much rumandsugar had made me reckless probably too i had imbibed some of the devilmaycare spirit of this ancient nesting place of the buccaneers when i reached the dock i was dizzy and blown from my exertions it was terribly hot something seemed drag ging at the nape of my neck and the winking lights in port royal harbor looked like the blazing eyes of mam moth animals i sat down on a cask and watched the red lantern on the mary roses stack disappear into the night i couldnt quite recall why i had come back to port royal it was be cause of something someone had told medamn that rum my head was like an empty barrel i could not re member a thing after a bit i lit my pipe having to bacco and matches safe in a waterproof bag as all sailormen should gradually the fog in my brain started to shred out i began to remember first it was mary logan she had promised to marry me back in new bedford she had laid her little hands in my great horny ones and pressed her lips against my cheeks murmuring words of endearment and promising to wed me in a fortnight all the time she knew she was lying for her plans had been laid to run away with benjy harrison that very night something snapped inside of me then the world went black before my eyes later i shipped on the mary rose bound for port royal but it wasnt marys treachery that had made me leave the old tramp what was it i pressed my fists against my aching temples and tried to think ah i had it it was on account of what hong fat showed methat and the sugared rum i guess the filthy sliteyed china man was a magician in his own coun try he said and ill give it to him that he was clever for two dollars he went through his whole bag of tricks but it didnt satisfy me im a deep water sailor and i come from a long line of bluenosed psalmsinging puritans but theres a streak of the mystic in me i always wanted to look behind the veil and hong fat said he could lift it for me so i gave him five dollars to do it he brought out a little bronze bowl from under his robe and made some passes over it with his ean longnailed fingers a thick oily smoke curled up from it and almost hid his emaciated yellow face and beady eyes then he asked me in his crooked shantung dialect if i could understand chinese i told him yes rather sourly for the smoke was making me drowsy sailor man he said in his singsong way you are a brave onea brave man but you have done enough wrong to offend the gods wrongs that you must atone for wrongs i said ive led a pretty rough life but a square one and i cant call to mind anyone in particular that
