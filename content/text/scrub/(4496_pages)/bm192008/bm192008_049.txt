 the face that stared back at blaisdell waking moments it all seemed ordi nary and commonplace blaisdell quietly mounted the stairs until he reached the second floor and there he paused before a closed door overcome by a suffocating sense of fear and repugnance he half turned away and then retraced his steps as if fasci nated something seemed to warn him away from that ominous door behind which lay a mystery that the everyday blaisdell millionaire and bon vivant did not care to penetrate but which this nocturnal prowling blaisdell seemed to insist upon then without any con scious volition on his part blaisdell placed his hand on the knob and the door opened noiselessly he found himself in a large square livingroom tastefully furnished and lined with builtin bookcases full of handsomely bound volumes every where he looked he saw bizarre weapons of defense and men in chinese and japanese armor looked threaten ingly at him from dim corners of the room it was either the apartment of an art connoisseur or a globetrotter with a propensity for the unusual from this room he stepped into a bedchamber and then started back with a little gasp it was a luxuriously fur nished room that appeared to have been transplanted by aladdins wonderful lamp straight from the perfumescented orient blaisdell advanced further into the room and his feet sank into a won derful mosslike carpet to one side of the room was an oldfashioned four poster bed topped by a crimson canopy in the exact centre of this bed lay a man asleep with his mouth open there was something strangely fa miliar about the sleeper and blaisdell drew closer and gazed at him steadily he was an oldish man with a sallow complexion and a wisp of a beard that was slightly tinged with grey the ghost of a smile lingered upon his lips a cruel smile that sleep could not make gentle nor mirthful and as he gazed upon the sleeper rage grew in blaisdells heart a rage so furious that it almost suffocated him without a moments hesitation he seized the sleeper by the throat and began throttling him the man struggled furiously his eyes popped open and gazed up into blaisdelfs with a look of freezing despair a slight froth gath ered upon his purpling lips and he squirmed and writhed like a snake in blaisdells unrelenting grasp god how he struggled blaisdelfs fingers sank into the throat as if it were satin and then suddenly there were no more struggles the body fell back inertly as the steellike fingers relaxed blaisdell pulled the bedclothes over the mask of horror and stole quietly from the room he felt that his errand had been accomplished as he went back over the route that he had just pursued he felt again that weird sense of unfamiliarity that had at first possessed him and this feeling of strangeness increased as he neared his own apartment house he walked in and hurried past the sleeping hallboy without waking him once inside his apartment he rushed into the bedroom but his counterpart was gone blaisdell undressed with trembling fingers but his head had scarcely touched the pillow before he was sound asleep ii a shaft of sunlight fell across blais dells face and he awoke with a shudder ugh what a horrible nightmare he said aloud i feel as if i actually did kill that man then he yawned and rang for his valet after a casual breakfast he was glancing through the newspaper when he received the shock that changed him
