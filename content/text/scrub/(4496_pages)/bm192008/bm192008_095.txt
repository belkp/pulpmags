 the strange story of martin colby suddenly i heard a screama piercing terrorstricken shriek coming out of the darkness of the night edith morley stood before me have you ever seen a poor hunted creature at bay she was panting desperately her arms were out stretched towards me her fingers working convulsively her dress was torn so that a glimpse of the round white shoulder showed in her eyes was a look of despair of helpless appeal her long golden hair hung about her waist in tangled disarray i knew that she was asking me for help i attempted to arouse myself from the horrible paralyzing constriction that held me to my chair but i was helpless bound down by invisible bands and then into the focus leaped a mana human beasta thicklipped coarsefeatured creature with snap ping black eyes that glowered and blazed between red swollen lids and a bluishdark growth of whisker that only served to emphasize the brutal viciousness of his undershot lower jaw i tell you he was a creature straight from the inferno at sight of the girl the bestial lips parted showing a glimpse of de caying tobaccostained teeth he raised one black hairy hand and beckoned the girl drew back a trifle further the look of desperation kindled anew in her eyes one white slender hand pressed against her pal pitating breast as heaven is my witness i saw that tragedy unfold itself in front of my eyes with all the vividness of a motion picture thrown upon the screen i struggled with every bit of strength at my command to tear my self loose from the invisible hands that glued me to my chair but in vain i watched the beast slowly drawing himself forward like a snake about to strike i could not move nearer and nearer he came passing so close to me that i could smell his whiskeyandtobaccoladen breath moving with catlike stealth and as he approached her she drew farther and farther away until she found her back against the wall her wild blue eyes looked into mine tense with fear desperateand i was helpless god the sweat poured from every pore in my body then sud denly he launched himself at her what a fight she put up to keep him from her striking clawing biting she was like a wounded tigress at bay her waist was torn into shreds on the white flesh of her arms the bruises stood out with startling vividness with an almost superhuman effort she twisted herself from his grasp and leaped away once more he drove her into a corner again that look of piteous appeal to me then be fore he could seize her again her con vulsive fingers reached into the bosom of her dress and returned with a tiny bottle on which the deaths head showed a brilliant scarlet under the electric lamp before she could convey it to her mouth the beast was upon her his talons tightened about her wrist she battled now with the energy of de spair backward he bent her arm un til i listened for the snap that tells of the agony of broken bones but again through some strange twist of fate she tore herself from his grasp her freedom was but for an instant yet it was long enough for her to carry the tiny vial to her lips then she crumpled up in a little heap on the floor and gentlemen i will swear that there was a smile of happiness on her face
