the abandoned house by beulah poynter i the blinding rain which had been steadily falling for the last hour cut and stung our faces and the wind wheezing through the trees about us rocked our little car until it made progress almost impossible an illuminating streak of lightning fol lowed by a deafening crash of thunder caused me to cower down in the seat and cover my ears with my hands well heres our finish exclaimed my brother who had valiantly striven to pilot the machine in the storm theres a tree lying directly across the road he brought the car to a standstill and turned his spotlight on the dark object blocking our path it was a huge tree evidently stricken down by the light ning and it covered the entire road what on earth are we going to do i sobbed hysterically we cant stay out in a storm like this and we are miles and miles away from anyone we had been steadily dimbing an up ward grade and the cavernlike ravines on either side and the depths of black ness behind me struck a chill in my heart i wish wed never come out on this crazy motor trip i wailed new york is good enough for me alan what can we do ill see he answered keep your hand on the brake this is a pretty stiff hill and the road is slippery if the car starts skidding its good night he spoke jocularly enough but i knew he was worried climbing out of the machine he went around to the big supine tree and examined it its no use nell he called to me pitching his voice above the roar of the wind i cant budge it in the brief light caused by a second flash of lightning i saw the stark bare outlines of a twostory house possibly a hundred feet ahead of us on my right alan theres a house a house up there further on the hill i cried wildly youre right there is its either an empty one or its occupants hit the hay early ill pull the car out onto the side of the road and well make a run for it he got back into his seat and with a few careful maneuvers of the wheel suc ceeded in bringing the machine around to a spot where it might stand in safety then he searched in the darkness until he found a rock which he placed under the wheel in case something should start it rolling downgrade turn up your collar the rain feels like icewater when youre out in it that house is probably farther off than it looks taking my hand he helped me out my feet went into deep mud and i al most lost my balance with a little shriek i clutched him to save myself then we started to run it was uphill all the way a much steeper and longer climb than i had an ticipated and as alan had said the rain was like icewater beating against the back of my neck and shoulders i was shaking and shivering like a drowned cat by the time we reached the stoop on the front of the building the house was barren of fence and surrounding trees and stood on a sort of knoll at the side of the hills no light was visible anywhere alan used
