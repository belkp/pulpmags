ghost town lady by eric howard the judge never could abide a weepy woman and so old mrs gray kept herself so busy helping out young folks she didnt have time to mourn there was no one living in chaco any more but old mrs gray her husband judge gray had died a year ago he had started the town and he had al ways been loyal to it believing that it would come back no one except mrs gray shared that belief all of the houses in the town had long since gone to pieces but the gray house largest and best was still in good repair it clung to the side of the canyon wall above the old street and mrs gray spent many sunny hours on the big porch she was small and frail she weighed not more than a hundred pounds but she claimed she was as tough as nails she kept the old house spic and span she took great pride in her garden and her chickens once a month or so someone from the railroad town of butte city visited her the doctor perhaps or parson hardy always they urged her to move down to butte city then she laughed at them and there was something youth ful and musical about her laughter in variably she would feed her guests fried chicken biscuits and rich gravy cooked as only she could cook them she had learned to cook she said be cause the judge was a man who liked good vittles she had spent her whole life in pleasing the judge and now
