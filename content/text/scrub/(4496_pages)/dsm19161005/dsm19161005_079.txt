 detective story magazine me i should judge that it is replied the detective where is mrs bennett thats the strangest part of it ex claimed wilson she has disap peared youre a smart man i dont think said fairman why did you let her get away i never thought of her going pro tested wilson its natural enough sneered fair man circumstances are against her now look here rejoined wilson warmly i dont set up to be a detec tive but i hope ive got common sense heres a woman who has lived in this community all her life and is known to be a good christian and a loving wife dont you try to tell me that she killed her husband i know her too well to believe you she had nothing to do with it then why has she run away i dont believe she has run away then whats become of her wilson threw up his hands with a gesture of utter bewilderment have you searched the house and barn asked nick weve searched everywhere re sponded wilson with something like a groan we cant find a trace of her or of sam bennetts body if youll allow me said nick ill take a look around the premises meanwhile permit me to suggest if theres any place where mrs bennett would be likely to go that you send there thats what i was about to do wilson replied these five men are going around to all the houses near here has she any relatives in the neigh borhood no she has a brother living about three miles down the road who occupied this house besides mr and mrs bennett nobody is here now they have lived alone since their daughter jennie was married about three months ago nick fairman and i walked toward the stable wilson and the other men went upon their several errands we were assured by a man named hamlin who was on guard in the stable that nothing had been disturbed ham lin was a sort of unofficial deputy of wilsons nick made a rapid general survey of the place glanced into the barn which was reached by a door from the stable and then turned his attention to the bloodstains there were some small irregular splashes on the floor and then a line of drops leading direct to the spot where the coat lay it was a muchworn garment spread flat upon the floor with the lining up ward the stains were all on the lin ing and close together they repre sented a considerable quantity of blood as nick rose from beside the coat i saw a peculiar smile upon his face heres something that will interest you he said to fairman between his thumb and finger he held half a dozen short gray hairs that fits my theory exactly cried fairman bennetts head has rested on that coat his hair was gray and he wore it about that length he must have been killed by a blow on the head and then this coat was wrapped around the fatal wound to prevent the blood from staining something else my belief is that the body was car ried in that wagon from the place where the crime was committed to the place where the murderer has concealed the corpse then probably the horse was turned loose and wandered here there is evidence in support of that last view said nick i suppose your sharp eyes noted the wagon tracks in the street and in the yard
