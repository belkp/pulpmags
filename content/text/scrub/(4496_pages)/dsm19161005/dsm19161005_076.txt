a rustic rival the feat to which he alluded had been performed on the afternoon be fore when we had fished in waverly pond i was not aware that anybody but myself had seen it your facts are scanty rejoined nick pleasantly but your conclusion is accurate what can i do for you the boots on the other leg re torted the young man im going to do something for you very kind of you im sure said nick what is it im going to put you on to one of the prettiest murder mysteries that ever you tackled said the young man with enthusiasm it happened last night but it wasnt discovered till this morn ing i was right there at the time and i knew what to do i said to all of em including dep uty sheriff wilson who got there al most as soon as i did dont disturb anything save it for nick carter and i made em do it too what was it that they saved asked nick there was his coat all covered with blood and the horse and wagon in the yard and the broken board over the hiding place where he kept his money and where who kept his money de manded nick the young man paused shame faced like a boy who had done some thing very foolish when he has tried to be especially smart he covered his embarrassment with a laugh guess im a bit rattled he said besides ive had a hard run and my breaths not as yet got back into my body ill be all right in a jiffy you come across the brooktheres a fallen tree for a bridge just below hereand by the time you get over ill be ready to talk nick said nothing but he started at once for the broken tree i followed him and we crossed the brook the young man was waiting for us i had already sized him up he was or fancied himself to be an ama teur detective with great talent for criminal investigation he had prob ably studied the subject as it is pre sented in fiction this crime which he had so imperfectly disclosed to us was doubtless his first opportunity for the display of his abilities and he intended to prove his merit under the eyes of the great master of detection it struck me that he was acting wisely a man of less sense would have tried to keep nick carter out of the case as long as possible in order to secure for himself the honor of de tecting the criminal the young man had fully recovered his selfcommand when we joined him after crossing the brook my name is walter fairman he said ive been teaching the school at waverly falls everybody round here knows me now for this crime i was coming along the highroad toward marvins about threequarters of an hour ago in tending to fish this stream just as i got opposite sam bennetts house which is about a third of a mile the other side of marvinsi heard a woman scream she seemed to be in bennetts stable which is built alongside his barn the barns back of the house and the stable stands out at right angles with both so that when you walk into the yard the stable faces you and the house is on the left as i came up i had noticed ben netts horse and wagon in the yard the horse was facing the stable doors which were closed it looked as if ben nett had just driven in and i wondered where he had been so early in the morn ing when i heard the scream i ran into the yard just as i did so mrs ben
