 detective story magazine detective left the house and uncon sciously approached his chief who was lounging at the comer as he passed flint the latter said quietly go around the corner and wait for me his assistant stiffened slightly at the wellknown voice but that was the only sign of surprise he gave with a grunt and a nod he turned about at right angles into the side street and along this flint presently followed him a short distance beyond the corner well out of sight from flints house judson paused and there his chief over took him i havent made any headway yet judson announced without any pre liminaries i located the car late this afternoon but there i came to a dead stop never mind about that flint said quickly it doesnt matter in the least i can lay my hands on greeneye gor don at any moment the deuce you can ejaculated judson then i should certainly say you dont need mefor the sort of leg work ive been doing today at any rate what about my double though flint put in swiftly without giving jud son time to ask any questions is he still at the house and if so what has he been doing hes there all right hes been writing letters in the bedroom he de clined to use the study ah flint murmured in a peculiar tone letters eh has he mailed them no i offered to do it for him a lit tle while ago but he said he would be going out himself later on flint thought over this information for a minute or two while his assistant watched him questioningly did you happen to see any of the letters flint inquired at length rous ing himself from his abstraction i mean could you tell whether they were stamped or not his assistant nodded i got a squint at a little pile of them he admitted the top one was stamped but i could not say as to the rest this required further thought on flints part he was tempted of course to end matters then and there before those letters could reach their destination and cause the consternation they were certain to create on the other hand he felt it necessary to give gordon a little more leeway and in order to do that it seemed essential that the letters be mailed he had searched gillespies private rooms on the theory that green eye might have left the stolen papers there but he had found nothing of the sort yet it was imperative that these papers be recovered if possible at the same time the rascal was captured unless that were done the precious records might not be returned at all for certainly gordon could not be counted on to restore them voluntarily to be sure the fact that he had been writing those lettersdoubtless black mailing onesunder flints own roof suggested that he had the documents there to refer to that however was by no means certain for he might have put the records in some remote place perhaps a safedeposit vault after mak ing a list of the names and addresses desired therefore it seemed wise to give the fellow his head for the time and mean while to keep him under observation in the hope that his movements would give some hint as to his possession or nonpossession of flints papers the detective was about to explain this to his assistant when the latter broke in excitedly for the love of pete whats up he demanded what are you cooking
