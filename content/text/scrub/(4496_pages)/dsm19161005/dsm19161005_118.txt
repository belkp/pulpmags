tales of the chemists club reader will remember ritchies unfortu nate condition of mind and his still more distressing condition of heart and will pity rather than censure him for agreeing to this nefarious proposition when winsted had gone the young man sat for many minutes with his head in his hands a prey to remorse then he sprang up and began to rave he swore that all was fair in love and gold mining that the moral law was well known not to extend north of the fiftyfifth parallel of latitude and that any man alive would do the same under similar conditions having relieved his mind in this way he went to work with vigor no leisure and short allowance of sleep was his rule from that time forth during the course of these analyses he was occa sionally interrupted by one of his three temptersfour indeed counting mr trippand he agreed to every propo sition made to him but he touched no bodys money it was four oclock on a certain morning when he finished his work and made the last of his calculations from the full report he made a brief abstract in which the results of his analyses were shown in three classifica tions as follows ounces of gold per ton value per ton no no no the yellow dog was a surprisingly good property judging from this assay and from what medway had said about the general characteristics of the lode if winsted could buy it for ten thou sand dollars he ought to be a good fatherinlaw to the man that had given him the opportunity this thought in confused form was in ritchies brain as he turned from his work in utter exhaustion throw ing an old fur coat upon the floor and drawing the first thing he could get his hand on over him for a coverlet he pre pared to sleep upon the problem in volved in his singular situation when he awoke it was noonday and the problem had solved itself for there sat winsted beside the table digesting the result of ritchies labors the young man had forgotten to lock his door before he slept well upon my word he ex claimed raising his stiffened and aching frame from the floor and glaring at his visitor winsted nodded pleasantly as he thrust the report into his pocket its all right he said im going to find atherton youd better take an other nap he was gone before ritchie could in terpose any objection as quickly as possible the chemist followed winsted was out of sight in these circum stances it seemed to be ritchies duty to hunt up atherton and medway and make a report to them he sought them all day and for some hours of the evening vainly at last in great weariness he went to bed on the following morning he decided that the best thing to do would be to wait in his laboratory it should be a certainty that those he wished to see would come here during the day at four oclock in the afternoon they had not appeared at five there came a young indian with a note it was from jennie winsted and it ran as fol lows dear mr ritchie i know that you are perfectly innocent but father is crazy ath erton tripp and medway have decamped together of course you know by this time that father bought the mine for fifteen thou sand dollars cash it was all a swindle the ore that you analyzed never came from the yellow dog mine it was bought some where else medway of course was in the plot they got that fellow cullom to give father the tip and they knew hed go to you because we all like you so much and you have been seen so often with father and me its dreadful but dont you worry i wont
