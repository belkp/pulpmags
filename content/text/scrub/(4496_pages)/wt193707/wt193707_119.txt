 weird tales cannot distinguish they move slowly through angles they have no bodies and they move slowly through out rageous angles it was then that i became aware of the odor in the room it was a pungent in describable odor so nauseous that i could scarcely endure it i stepped quick ly to the window and threw it open when i returned to chalmers and looked into his eyes i nearly fainted i think they have scented me he shrieked they are slowly turning to ward me he was trembling horribly for a mo ment he clawed at the air with his hands then his legs gave way beneath him and he fell forward on his face slobbering and moaning i watched him in silence as he dragged himself across the floor he was no longer a man his teeth were bared and saliva dripped from the comers of his mouth chalmers i cried chalmers stop it stop it do you hear as if in reply to my appeal he com menced to utter hoarse convulsive sounds which resembled nothing so much as the barking of a dog and began a sort of hideous writhing in a circle about the room i bent and seized him by the shoulders violently desperately i shook him he turned his head and snapped at my wrist i was sick with horror but i dared not release him for fear that he would destroy himself in a paroxysm of rage chalmers i muttered you must stop that there is nothing in this room that can harm you do you understand i continued to shake and admonish him and gradually the madness died out of his face shivering convulsively he crumpled into a grotesque heap on the chinese rug i carried him to the sofa and depos ited him upon it his features were twisted in pain and i knew that he was still struggling dumbly to escape from abominable memories whisky he muttered youll find a flask in the cabinet by the window upper lefthand drawer when i handed him the flask his fin gers tightened about it until the knuckles showed blue they nearly got me he gasped he drained the stimulant in im moderate gulps and gradually the color crept back into his face that drug was the very devil i murmured it wasnt the drug he moaned his eyes no longer glared insanely but he still wore the look of a lost soul they scented me in time he moaned i went too far what were they like i said to humor him he leaned forward and gripped my arm he was shivering horribly no words in our language can describe them he spoke in a hoarse whisper they are symbolized vaguely in the myth of the fall and in an obscene form which is occasionally found engraved on ancient tablets the greeks had a name for them which veiled their essential foulness the tree the snake and the applethese are the vague symbols of a most awful mystery his voice had risen to a scream frank frank a terrible and unspeak able deed was done in the beginning before time the deed and from the deed he had risen and was hysterically pacing the room the seeds of the deed move through angles in dim recesses of time they are hungry and athirst chalmers i pleaded to quiet him we are living in the third decade of the twentieth century
