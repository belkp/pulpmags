 weird tales been studying the mathematical formulăś of a celebrated contemporary physicist and that he had covered many sheets of thin yellow paper with curious geometric designs einstein and john dee are strange bedfellows i said as my gaze wandered from his mathematical charts to the sixty or seventy quaint books that comprised his strange little library plotinus and emanuel moscopulus st thomas aqui nas and frenicle de bessy stood elbow to elbow in the somber ebony bookcase and chairs table and desk were littered with pamphlets about mediaeval sorcery and witchcraft and black magic and all of the valiant glamorous things that the modern world has repudiated chalmers smiled engagingly and passed me a russian cigarette on a curi ously carved tray we are just discover ing now he said that the old alchem ists and sorcerers were twothirds right and that your modern biologist and ma terialist is ninetenths wrong you have always scoffed at modern science i said a little impatiently only at scientific dogmatism he re plied i have always been a rebel a champion of originality and lost causes that is why i have chosen to repudiate the conclusions of contemporary biolo gists and einstein i asked a priest of transcendental mathemat ics he murmured reverently a pro found mystic and explorer of the great suspected then you do not entirely despise science of course not he affirmed i mere ly distrust the scientific positivism of the past fifty years the positivism of haeckel and darwin and of mr bertrand russell i believe that biology has failed pitifully to explain the mystery of mans origin and destiny give them time i retorted chalmers eyes glowed my friend he murmured your pun is sublime give them time that is precisely what i would do but your modern biologist scoffs at time he has the key but he re fuses to use it what do we know of time really einstein believes that it is rela tive that it can be interpreted in terms of space of curved space but must we stop there when mathematics fails us can we not advance byinsight you are treading on dangerous ground i replied that is a pitfall that your true investigator avoids that is why modern science has advanced so slowly it accepts nothing that it cannot demonstrate but you i would take hashish opium all man ner of drugs i would emulate the sages of the east and then perhaps i would apprehend what the fourth dimension theosophical rubbish perhaps but i believe that drugs ex pand human consciousness william james agreed with me and i have dis covered a new one a new drug it was used centuries ago by chinese alchemists but it is virtually unknown in the west its occult properties are amaz ing with its aid and the aid of my mathematical knowledge i believe that i can go back through time i do not understand time is merely our imperfect percep tion of a new dimension of space time and motion are both illusions everything that has existed from the beginning of the world exists now events that oc curred centuries ago on this planet con tinue to exist in another dimension of space events that will occur centuries from now exist already we cannot per ceive their existence because we cannot w t
