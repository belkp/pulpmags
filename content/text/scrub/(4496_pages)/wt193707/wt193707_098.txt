the ocean ogre died from fright or from drinking salt water my friend didnt elaborate on de tails but not liking the unsociable com pany of corpses he naturally disposed of them thats his story and i accepted it at its face value i am not a man to go poking about and asking questions its enough that he brought us a boatload of provisions and his own buoying com panionship he has actually injected spirit we were growing to loathe each other we five he calls himself alain gervais june gervais he insisted we call him that has been with us now for three days he has the run of the ship and i have turned the mates cabin over to him the mate has no further need for a cabinhe spends his nights rolling on the ocean floor gervais is tall and emaciated his face is oystercolored drawn and haggard his eyes are set deeply in dark caverns and actually seem to consume you there is something devastating about those eyes sometimes they seem a hundred years old his fore head is high and as yellow and dry as parchment and his nose is shaped like a simitar with long gangling arms and thick wrists he presents an awesome pic ture a very peculiar fellow now that i get to know him better but he is one of us june gervais has kept more to himself he remained locked in his cabin all morning and answered my anxious questions curtly through the closed door but i was too busy to in vestigate there is a chill in the air that encourages hope for a wind in the near future some of the crew seem too tired to work they came across a bottle of rum in losiers locker and by mixing it with salt water they concocted an elixir to alleviate their suffering who am i to assert my authority but i hope for the first breeze as it will surely bolster the ships morale at that time i plan to re gain my old power of discipline june a breeze is surely coming it is eerily still all around us except for a sharp report every now and then as another deck plank snaps under the direct rays of a broiling sun i am working frantically on a miserable substitute of a rudder i am stripped to the waist and the sweat rolls down into my eyes almost blinding me i have been over the side twice this afternoon for relief but there is very little in the brackish water june gervais slept on the planks with the crew last night and this morn ing he looks ten years younger his face is flushed and full and the greenish hol lows have disappeared from beneath his eyes but hanson isnt well he com plains of pains in his chest and once or twice he spat a mixture of blood and rum his big face seems sandpapered by age and he is abnormally pale june no breeze hanson is sure ly stricken death hovers over him like an impatient doorman he lies in his cabin and groans and i can do nothing for him his pallor is genuinely alarm ing even his lips are bloodless he complains of his nose and noises in his ears and gervais has shown his first glints of illnature his eyes smolder when he speaks and for the first time i discern a hard cruelty in the man he is an alarming personality june hanson died this morning a horrible racking death it seemed as though he wanted to tell us something i laid my ear on his broken watery lips but was unable to make out anything in telligible from his forced moaning gervais actually gloated over his death what can it mean why such a meta morphosis in the man we befriended he owes everything to our generosity human beings are utterly despicable and
