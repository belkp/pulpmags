 weird tales hung there against the wall with the floodlights full on him he could fairly feel slugs tearing into him from the watch towers of course he was visible the guard who had flashed his light on him must have seen him after all and have passed on indifferently thinking he was praying he was going to die but no slugs came he hung there for what seemed two full minutes with the light strong on him and no shots sounded out he dropped it was fifteen feet to the yard pavement strong chance of a broken leg but he had not dared to make a rope of bedding that would show against the wall even if he did not he stood blinking with the dazzling lights on him he couldnt seem to see fog wisps at all now though they had been apparent from his window those lights surely surely he would be seen then fog shreds swirled once more he walked slowly across the court yard toward the high outer wall perhaps if he walked like that instead of making a dash for it he would be hailed instead of shot at once but still no slugs came and he began to thrill wildly with a sense of achieve ment he was going to make it harleys drug was all he claimed it to be there was no chance of a mistake nowno living thing could have crossed that yard as he was crossing it unless it was hidden by the chameleonlike power of taking on the absolute tint of the pavingstone over which he moved he looked up at the nearest tower distinctly he could see the guard in there gun slung across his arm the guard wasnt looking right at him but he was gazing in his direction and he made no sign littell got to the wall keeping as much as possible in the thin fog swirls that danced slowly over the courtyard almost like slowly dancing wraiths the wall was made of rough stone a glance could tell that a desperate man might ascend that wall clinging flylike to the slight roughnesses that didnt matter the warden didnt worry about the walls not with those towers spaced on them and the vigilant machine gunners hed worry about them from now on littell exulted as he clung with grasping fingertips and bare toes for his first step up there were going to be a lot of escapes over these walls for he had it already worked out in his mind he would pay harley for the formula of this stuff and then sell the drug to other prisoners who wanted to break out he had started his slow and painful ascent between two towers but the roughnesses making ascent possible slant ed toward the tower on the left littell began to know fear again as he drew near that tower and the top of the wall at the same time he had come a long way in powerful light without being seen but harley had admitted that the drug was not perfect he searched over and over again for possible handholds away from the tower but the only ones offering a chance were inevitably in that direction hey the voice of the guard in the near tower rang out as littell had his hands over the top of the wall littell froze there heart hammering sweat freezing on his body he caught a ragged sob behind closed lips before the sound could betray him to get so far and then be caught he hung there as motionless asas a chameleon in the light but no chattering shots followed the challenge only awful silence in which littell could fairly feel the gaze of the guard on him then
