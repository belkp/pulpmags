 weird tales abyss what could not be seen against the dusk of the corridora nightmare horde of rushing devils hatedistorted grotesquely panoplied halftransparent devils of a race no man might mistake the crawling reptiles of the nameless city and as the wind died away i was plunged into the ghoulpeopled dark ness of earths bowels for behind the last of the creatures the great brazen door clanged shut with a deafening peal of metallic music whose reverberations swelled out to the distant world to hail the rising sun as memnon hails it from the banks of the nile recompense by robert e howard i have not heard lutes beckon me nor the brazen bugles call but once in the dim of a haunted lea i heard the silence fall i have not heard the regal drum nor seen the flags unfurled but i have watched the dragons come fireeyed across the world i have not seen the horsemen fall before the hurtling host but i have paced a silent hall where each step waked a ghost i have not kissed the tigerfeet of a strangeeyed golden god but i have walked a citys street where no man else had trod i have not raised the canopies that shelter revelling kings but i have fled from crimson eyes and black unearthly wings i have not knelt outside the door to kiss a pallid queen but i have seen a ghostly shore that no man else has seen i have not seen the standards sweep from keep and castle wall but i have seen a woman leap from a dragons crimson stall and i have heard strange surges boom that no man heard before and seen a strange black city loom on a mystic nightblack shore and i have felt the sudden blow of a nameless winds cold breath and watched the grisly pilgrims go that walk the roads of death and i have seen black valleys gape abysses in the gloom and i have fought the deathless ape that guards the doors of doom i have not seen the face of pan nor mocked the dryads haste but i have trailed a darkeyed man across a windy waste i have not died as men may die nor sinned as men have sinned but i have reached a misty sky upon a granite wind
