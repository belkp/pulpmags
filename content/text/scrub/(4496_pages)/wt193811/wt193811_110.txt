the nameless city marked the quietness of the rest of the landscape once more i ventured with in those brooding ruins that swelled beneath the sand like an ogre under a coverlet and again dug vainly for relics of the forgotten race at noon i rested and in the afternoon i spent much time tracing the walls and the bygone streets and the outlines of the nearly vanished buildings i saw that the city had been mighty indeed and wondered at the sources of its greatness to myself i pictured all the splendors of an age so distant that chaldea could not recall it and thought of sarnath the doomed that stood in the land mnar when man kind was young and of ib that was carven of gray stone before mankind existed all at once i came upon a place where the bedrock rose stark through the sand and formed a low cliff and here i saw with joy what seemed to promise further traces of the antedilu vian people hewn rudely on the face of the cliff were the unmistakable facades of several small squat rock houses or temples whose interiors might preserve many secrets of ages too remote for calculation though sandstorms had long since effaced any carvings which may have been outside very low and sandchoked were all of the dark apertures near me but i cleared one with my spade and crawled through it carrying a torch to reveal whatever mysteries it might hold when i was inside i saw that the cav ern was indeed a temple and beheld plain signs of the race that had lived and worshipped before the desert was a desert primitive altars pillars and niches all curiously low were not ab sent and though i saw no sculptures nor frescoes there were many singular stones clearly shaped into symbols by artificial means the lowness of the chiselled chamber was very strange for i could hardly kneel upright but the area was so great that my torch showed only part of it at a time i shuddered oddly in some of the far corners for certain altars and stones suggested for gotten rites of terrible revolting and inexplicable nature and made me won der what manner of men could have made and frequented such a temple when i had seen all that the place con tained i crawled out again avid to find what the other temples might yield night had now approached yet the tangible things i had seen made curiosity stronger than fear so that i did not flee from the long moon cast shadows that had daunted me when first i saw the nameless city in the twilight i cleared another aperture and with a new torch crawled into it finding more vague stones and symbols though nothing more definite than the other temple had contained the room was just as low but much less broad ending in a very narrow passage crowded with obscure and cryptical shrines about these shrines i was pry ing when the noise of a wind and of my camel outside broke through the stillness and drew me forth to see what could have frightened the beast the moon was gleaming vividly over the primitive ruins lighting a dense cloud of sand that seemed blown by a strong but decreasing wind from some point along the cliff ahead of me i knew it was this chilly sandy wind which had disturbed the camel and was about to lead him to a place of better shelter when i chanced to glance up and saw that there was no wind atop the cliff this astonished me and made me fearful again but i immediately recalled the sudden local winds that i
