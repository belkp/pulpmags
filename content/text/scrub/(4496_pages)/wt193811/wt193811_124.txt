leonora became uneasy at our long journey and was reassured had he who sat behind the wheel refused to answer my questioning then perhaps i would then have become frantic with terror but his deep soothing voice worked a spell on me once more and in his reply i thought i could detect a real solicitude which comforted me i was assured that we would shortly reach my fathers house i would slip in before my father could possibly have waked and avoid questioning as the night grew older it became more dismal the moon which had swung high overhead sent long shad ows scurrying from every tree and shrub every hill and hummock as we dashed by the wind had fallen but yet blew hard enough to make a moan ing wailing sound which seemed to follow us through the night the clouds that had swept in great masses across the sky had changed their shapes and trailed in long somber broken stream ers like torn black banners the smell of dank soggy earth and rotting leaves of mold and decay was heavier since the wind had sunk a little suddenly i had a great need for reassurance and comfort my heart seemed breaking with loneliness and with a strange un reasoning despair i turned to the silent figure at my side and it seemed that he smelled of the stagnant odor of decay that filled the nightthat the smell and the oppression were heavier because i had leaned nearer to him i lookedwith a more intense gaze than i had yet turned on himnot at the face that bent above me now the face that still eluded and baffled me but down at the arm next me at the sleeve of his cloak of heavy black cloth for something had caught my eyesomething movedoh what was this horror and why was it so horrible a slowly moving worm upon his sleeve i shuddered so that i clashed my teeth together i must control myself and then as though my deep alarm were the cue for the hidden event to advance from the future upon me the car was gliding to a stop i tore my horrified gaze from the blackclad arm and looked out of the car we were gliding into a cemetery not here oh dont stop here i gasped the words as one gasps in a nightmare yes here the deep voice was deeper it was deep and hollow there was no com fort in it the mask was off my fear at least i was face to face with that though i had not yet seen that other face i leaped from the car and fell faint ing beside it black lowhung and long and narrowi had been to but one funeral in my life but i knew it now it was the shape of a coffin after that i had no hope i was with a madman or he dragged mein gloved hands through which the hard long fingers bruised my fleshpast graves past tombstones and marble statues and i was numb i saw among the graves or seemed to seeoh let me say i saw strange things for i have seen them since and i was numb he dragged me toward an old old sunken grave headed by a timestained stone that settled to one side so long it had marked that spot and suddenly the nightmare dreaminess that had dulled my senses gave way to some keener realization of the truth i strug gled i fought back with all my little strength till i tore the glove from his
