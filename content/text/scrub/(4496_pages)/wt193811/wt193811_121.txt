 weird tales could not suppress i must control my self or they will come and silence me and i must finish this tonight i must finish it before the hour of dawn that is the hour i fear worse than the hour of midnight it is the hour when those outside must seek their dreadful homes the hour when striking fleshless fingers against my windowpane is not enough but they would take me with them where they gowhere i but not an other living soul have been before and whence i never shall escape again i walked down slowly toward the crossroad i would not have lingered i would have been glad to find the crossroad empty it was not there stood the car blacki had not noticed its color beforelowhung spectral fingers of white light from its cowl lights piercing the mist the cross road was in the hollow and the mist lay very heavily thereso heavily that i could hardly breathe he was there in the car his face more indistinct in the shadow of his broadbrimmed hat than it had been before i thought his gloved hand rest ing as before upon the wheel and again with a thrill of fear there went a thrill of fascination through me he was differentdifferent from every one else i felt strangeness romance and his manner was that of a lover in my inexperience i knew it will you ride tonight leonora it had comethe next advance the invitation but i was not going with him i had got the thrill i had come for he had asked me and that was enough it was enough now if i never saw him again this was a better stoppingpoint re member that i was only sixteen a stranger had come out of the night had been mysteriously attracted to me and i to him he had asked me to ride with him i do not know what i said some how i must have communicated to him what i feltmy pleasure in being asked my refusal his gloved hand touched his hat in the farewell gesture i remembered another night leonora leonora the car glided forward and was gone but the echo of his voice was in my ears his voicedeep strange differentbut the voice of a lover my inexperience was sure and already i doubted if after all this would be enough for me if i never saw him again another time he would be as punctilious as little urgent but he might saywhat would he say the january moon we hardly saw so bitter were the storms of that winter so unbreaking the heavy clouds that shut us from the sky the february full moon was crystal clear in a sky of icy light the snow covered ground sparkled and the branches of the trees were icecoated and burned with white fire but i clung to the fireside and again crept early within my blankets drawing them over my head i was in the grip of the fear that had visited me before i was like a person in the grip of a phobia such as they say that i have now shunning the moonlight and the open air it was march next month would bring the spring and then would follow summer the world would be a soft and gentle world again in which fear would have no place yet i began to long for a rep etition of the meetings at the cross road a repetition that should have the same settingthe rigors of winter rather than the entirely different sur roundings of the season of new buds
