 the dark brown dress iii there was a murmuring at this and meroe waited for it to subside before he continued much of the above information not obtainable here at the claridge i ob tained from frank s harding whom i discovered to be the lawyer engaged to draw up the will some of it i have in ferred as necessary to make the tale co herent and now we will approach what i still choose to consider a mystery from another angle it has to do with henry grover here who came to me at sixthirty this morn ing over half an hour before mr bar hart had entered the room mr grover occupies a room directly opposite this one at the buckminster he came to me rather distressed because yesterday af ternoon at five or a little after he had been disturbed by the figure of a woman with slightly gray hair and a dark brown dress who stared at him from this room soon he discovered that she was not staring at him but at a man who was evidently talking to her and whose head he could see above the back of the settee in the window it had bothered him so much how ever that he stopped work and went out for a walk he remained for supper and did not return until dark not see ing a light in this window he presumed that the inmates had retired for the night but early this morning he dis covered them in exactly the same posi tion the position in which they were found later by mr barhart rushing over to the claridge he was stopped by the janitor who laughed at him called him crazy and refused to allow him to wake up the manager not long after this the janitor disappeared mr grover came to me at sixthirty told me the story and requested that i accompany him to his room to see for myself when we arrived we found that the situation had already been discovered so we made our way to the scene as quickly as possible at first my suspicions were aroused at the reluctance with which the house doctor and mr barhart accepted even the remotest suggestion that a crime had been committed i have since however come to the conclusion that it was but a natural instinct on the part of parties interested in the business end of the establishment to avoid encroachment upon its good name there was a slight bow of acknowl edgment from barhart it surprised me a great deal to be in formed that there were absolutely no in dications of a death other than natural so i examined the bodies myself and found what it would be only too easy to overlook that which i had every rea son to suspect was the mark of a hypo dermic needle there was one on the arm of the woman and one on the leg of the man i was therefore doubly surprised and disconcerted when the coroner informed me that there were absolutely no traces of drug or poison things had come to my notice which left no doubt whatso ever in my own mind that the whole thing was a very clever conspiracy or plot but the whole framework of my theory would fall away if mr and mrs brentore had died a natural death it all depended upon one fact when i rushed through to the bedroom a while ago it was to verify this the bodies were gone i called up jordan and asked him to look for the needle marks and tell me if they were situated each of them over a large vein his answer was yes now is it not true doctor that if air is introduced into a large vein it may be carried in the venous circulation to the right ventricle and be then forced by the systole of the latter into the pul monary artery or its primary branches
