the weeping killer there was considerable surprise when the leader of the woodchucks was sentenced to death for murder every resource was assembled to prevent his execution and obtain his freedom and these weapons had triumphed they had brought back their leader but found they had only a weakling in his stead why there had been tears in his eyes when the verdict of his acquittal was read in court twice he had been seen faltering in his step as he came from the loft building in which the woodchucks had their clubroom he started at the slightest sound of anything like a pistol shot andworst of allhe refused to carry a gun that was the situation during two weeks following the old leaders return then on a sunday morning terence moriarity brighteyed square of shoul der spring in his step and a smile on his face had gleefully pummeled two new members of the gang who ac cidentally blocked his path hurled a bottle through a clubroom window and undisputedly resumed his sway the night before as all of the world that mattered to him well knew jeff hardy had screamed moriaritys name as he died and the old leader had auto matically been crowned anew it did not matter so much to the woodchucks how hardy had died that was a matter for the police to find out the police didto their own satis faction at leastbut moriarity merely smiled at the sensation their theories caused he still refused to carry a gun but he still led the woodchucks more feared and respected than he ever was and with confidence that his path of glory need not lead a man of intel ligence again to the death house jeff hardys body had been found at the bottom of the elevator shaft in the old loft building in which his gang oc cupied a portion of an upper floor without doubt he had fallen or been hurled six stories to the concrete pit below that he had not committed sui cide was certain there was no reason why he should in the first place and in the second place two reliable witnesses swore they had heard him cry damn you moriarity as he fell moriarity had been arrested of course but released almost at once be cause policemen as well as eminently respectable citizens had seen him a block away from the building at the same time that hardys scream was heard by the night watchman and ele vator man of the building it had taken some time to drag hardys body from the pit and identify it this caused a delay but even at that the police admitted they probably would have been unable to make out a case against the old leader no matter how rapidly they worked captain bush who knows probably as much about gangsters and gang poli tics as any police officer in the city had ordered the arrest of moriarity as soon as he heard of hardys death he did that even before he knew that the old leader was the last man seen with the new chieftain he was also the one who recommended the discharge of the prisoner the next morning there are more ways than one of killing a cat captain bush remarked philosophically to some of his news paper friends and the law doesnt keep up with all of them but you admit hardy was alone when he fell down the elevator shaft persisted one of his questioners why do you think he was killed he was killed as surely as terence is again king of the woodchucks re plied the police veteran he was killed because moriarity had lost his nerve he was killed in the way he was be cause of the long nights moriarity had spent in the death house by a man who knew that if hardy was killed by a shot
