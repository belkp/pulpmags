fit for a king denied everything but as i described what i had seen he broke still further in a sort of superstitious terror which i couldnt understand for a time brierly was an adept at the game and as he picked up an axe and attacked the bed the fellow leaped back with a squeal of alarm so thats it eh said brierly with a grin come now show us how it was done and save a lot of trouble he gave up at that and showed the devils trap hidden in the head of the bed was a spring which when he pressed it released another spring in the side of the couch just where a mans knee would rest when he climbed into bed securing a pole he pressed this spring from a safe distance and swiftly the bed tilted at a sharp angle while a black hole opened in the floor for an instant and then closed again into its perfect jointures the scheme he explained as he grew calmer was to set the spring at the head of the bed only when the trap was to receive a victim at other times the room was perfectly safe he might have set it for us but did not believe we could ever prove anything against him and also feared that the fall of one of us would reveal his secret to the others his terror at my story he explained was due to the news that the bodies were still under the house he had found the chimney opening into the cave when he came there to build the house and the trap was a culmination of the discovery but he could hear the waves washing down below and believed that the bodies that fell through it would be washed away with the next tide then if they were ever found it would be supposed that they had tumbled from the cliff but why did you kill these men brierly demanded i didnt kill them he answered they fell while i was not here true but you set the trap and then invited them here why did you do it he was silent for a moment then set his jaws and straightened his shoulders they were enemies of my country he said they were making munitions to destroy my brothers why should i not destroy them but this house was built before the war brierly insisted why did you build this infernal trap because he answered slowly mr plainfield ordered this house built to entertain a king i do not believe in kings they are the enemies of man kind he ordered a house fit for a king i made it so we drew back startled at the hate that gleamed in his eyes and at the cruel cunning of the radical bared before us he saw his chance and before we could stop him leaped through the window another instant and he had thrown him self over the cliff to the rocks and surf below there isnt much else to tell we never found out who he really was no i havent said what king it was who sent me those letters perhaps you can figure it out for yourself
