the dark brown dress these unfortunate people have been ill fifteen minutes ago a telegram came for mr brentore and as they did not answer the phone i myself came up to see what was the matter i found them dead mrs brentore in the chair here and mr brentore on the settee by the window out of the corner of my eye i saw that grover had caught up with us and was standing in the doonvay what was the doctors verdict asked meroe of barhart at this point that they both had died of heart trouble perhaps after having eaten a very heavy meal he replied oh but they were not present in the diningroom at dinner time interrupted one of the guests meroe beckoned to grover mr barhart this man occupies a room on the sixth floor of the buck minster very nearly opposite these win dows yesterday afternoon he saw mr and mrs brentore in the positions in which you have informed me they were found this morning early this morn ing he saw them in the same position he rushed here to notify you your janitor laughed at him called him crazy and refused to let him wake you i am sorry mr barljart but i will have to ask all of you to remain in this room until i have investigated the situation a little more closely the telephone girl stepped forward and held up her hand lee harmon the janitor has disap peared she said he was seen by miss lougee the night operator at about six shortly after that there was a call for him about a water fixture but he was not to be found just then the doctor stepped forth from the bedroom these gentlemen are here under the impression that a crime has been com mitted said barhart with a sweep of the hand toward the three of us and perhapsperhaps we are wrong said grover with his rasping voice i was the one who suggested the idea i was very suspicious and con sulted mr meroe immediately know ing that he if anyone could throw light on the subject butbut perhaps i was overhastyyes perhaps i was over hasty y there is every evidence of a natural death said the doctor you are sure there were no marks of violence asked meroe absolutely mr meroe i have ex amined the bodies very carefully be sides they were found in a peaceful position one in the chair and one on the settee this would hardly indicate a death by violencet no the deaths were undoubtedly caused by heart failure al though i am at a loss to know the exact nature of this heart failure there is a total lack of other indications does it not strike you as odd doc tor said meroe that the two deaths should have occurred simultaneously at first yes but on second thought no he replied they were both in a weak condition and in sitting convers ing with each other as was evidently the case if one were to die suddenly it would not be unnatural that the shock of the discovery should cause heart failure in the other meroe shook his head doubtfully and you are absolutely certain that they were not poisoned he asked no i am not absolutely certain that they were not poisoned was the reply but i will assist in performing an autopsy this morning if you wish please make arrangements to do that said meroe and i will notify the coroner at once and by the way doctor mr barhart informs me that mr and mrs brentore had been ill may i ask what was the nature of that illness that i do not know mr meroe
