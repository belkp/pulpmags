the parthian shot doctor morris and that the bullet had been foundone of thirtytwo caliber he was also informed that his pres ence as a witness would he required at the coroners investigation the next morning at this investigation the testimony brought out the fact that mr reynolds had died from the effects of a bullet wound that the condition of his clothes indicated a struggle with some one that no weapon had been found that the windows of mr reynolds room were found to be locked when exam ined by the officers that all windows downstairs and the outside doors ex cept the front door opened by mrs reynolds were found to be locked when examined immediately after the tragedy that this front door was also locked against any outsider just be fore it was opened by mrs reynolds that the stub of a cigar of the kind smoked by mr harding had been found broken and under mr reyn olds body that this brand of cigar was not to be found in mr reynolds stock of cigars and in fact seemed not to be on sale at any of the cigar stores of the city that mr harding was the last person known to have been with mr reynolds before the latters death and that mr reynolds had objected to the frequency of mr hardings calls upon mrs reynolds and had enter tained an unfriendly feeling toward mr harding on that account to harding who with pale face had sat listening intently the presenta tion of these facts had been anything but reassuring his only comfort had been the expression of assurance upon the face of wynn who now addressed the coroner i should like to introduce further evidence proceed was the reply after the officers who had been sent to the reynolds house had com pleted their examination said wynn i made a further inspection of the room where the body was found under the couch i found this he continued holding up the object it is as you see a small plumb bob such as is used by masons and carpenters what in particular aroused my inter est however was the fact that the stout cord attached to the bob had a short piece of thread tied to it at the loose end and the fact that the plumb bob was found under the davenport and on a floor which the maid informed me had been swept on the day that mr reynolds met his death the maid further informed me that she was positive that the plumb bob was not on the floor at the time when the floor was swept and that she had never seen it before although i was unable to see any connection between this plumb bob and the death of mr reynolds i had the feeling that there was a connection and returned to the reynolds house the next morning with the hope of being able to find it from what i asked myself had the plumb bob been suspended why had it been fastened as apparently it had been by a thread tied to the cord instead of being fastened directly by the cord itself and why was it thrown or left on the floor of a room used by a man as orderly as mr reyn olds was known to be these questions i succeeded in an swering i found a short piece of thread tied to the lower end of the vertical tube of the electriclight chandelier which is in the center of mr reynolds room i also found that the plumb bob if it had been attached at this point would have cleared the floor by about a foot just over the chandelier in the at tic above this room there was a short section of flooring which apparently had been removedand then replaced
