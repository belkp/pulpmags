 detective story magazine but let me say that despite these considerations i could not believe him guilty humphrey steene had sug gested a connection between these dra matic happenings and the fact that bob brittain was his cousins heir i wished now that i had forced him to be ex plicit he had bidden me to learn if bob brittain was connected with the order of the white bear here he was wearing an insignia that pro claimed him at least a cub i was tempted there and then to question him regarding the order but refrained instead i feigned astonishment and allowed him to see something of my very real anxiety sit down bob i invited ill mix you something for you surely need a bracer he sank limply into a chair all right tom but tell me what to do i can scarcely think i handed him a stiff brandy and soda drink that i said and he obeyed now tell me what have you done i asked ive been to the police and they promised to send out a confidential alarm if if what they seemed to think i was crazy wanted to know how i knew if my cousin had been kidnaped she might have gone to friends and more than likely id hear from her in a day or two might they not be right he stared at me blankly then his face cleared slightly i forgot i thought i had given youthis he pulled a soiled envelope from his pocket and handed it to me i saw at a glance that it had been addressed in pencil by mildred brittain a man brought itan italian i think he left it at the club said hed picked it up in west fourth street i didnt show it to the police youll see why if youll read it i took a note from the envelope and read oh bob i am in terrible trouble had a raging headache and went walking in the park i was about to cross the driveway when an automobile drew up suddenly in front of me and before i could cry out i was hustled into it by two men who stepped out from some bushes i dont know where they are going to take me but i am terribly frightened from what i have overheard it will be useless to go to the police take this to doctor tom and get his advice i shall try to throw it into the street in the hope that it may reach you goodby milly bob brittains handsome face was turned eagerly to mine i recalled that even as a boy selfish and headstrong he had always looked to me for help and advice when he found himself in deep water but this time i felt almost as helpless as he instead of running directly across the city from the vicinity of the east river to the hudson as most of the num bered streets do west fourth street has a way of popping up suddenly at unexpected comers you find one end of it as far uptown as west thirteenth or almost the letter might have been picked up anywhere along its tor tuous length and we had small chance of tracing the manprobably an ital ianwho had brought it to the club and left it with a clerk the very trust mildred had seemed to place in me in bidding her cousin come to me wrung my heart i knew not what to dounless it was to trust to the vague promise of humphrey steene who had confessed that in pur suit of the great task he had under taken he was liable to lose sight of the individual but i had promised to work with him and i would do nothing likely to endanger his plans it was useless to go to him now for already he knew almost as much as i didif not more
