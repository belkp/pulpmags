 love in the jungle the double burden and as the river of crocodiles came into sight beyond the green of the jungle the man suddenly wished that this ride would not end so soonthat it might go on forever he looked down at the girl her damp light hair lay against his breast he could see the soft curve of her cheek the pink of her little ear the parted line of her mouth the sweetness of her was irresistible the moment was his goring bent over and kissed her on the lips then he leaned closer to see if she were angry but only a deepening of the color in her feverflushed face be trayed anything to him for she dropped her eyes so that he should not see the gladness in their blue depths a great joy stirred the man she was not the kind of a girl who would un protestingly let him kiss her unless she cared a little the wonder of it filled his hearthe gathered her closer to him something fiercely protective in his clasp she was his to guard and defend through these golden moments which when she had gone again as she must go would be the one real memory of his life so they went on oblivious of every thing but each other and the newfound glory of their love the girl quivering and radiant despite the pain that racked her body the mans heart big with pas sion and heavy with despair because he knew he must lose her so very soon it tied his tongue honor forbade him to tell her that he loved herto win from her a shy confession that she too cared his country needed him some of her sons she sent to the field of battle others she kept back to guard the outposts of her empire now was not the time to quit or shirk with the motherland fighting for her very exist ence heckers was good for twenty years and political agencies are not to be had every day in the i c s so while rhodas thoughts drifted happily the mans crashed from dreams of what might have been to the harsh est of realities in less than an hour he must bid her goodbye for months perhaps never to see her again there was no dodging the issuehe must not even win from her a promise not to forget her young life should not be ruined waiting for him nohe must let her go not knowing how much he cared nor how hard it was to give her up he must make their parting as commonplace as possible it was the little gurka sergeant who brought goring sharply back to present facts sahib he cried his yellow face wrinkled with alarm junglies hie he pointed to a bael tree from whose branches one of his men was just scrambling down goring peered back through the blur of rain in the distance half hidden by a low hillock he made out a dark mov ing mass weve got to make the river he said grimly spurring on his flagging horse the great elephant as if sensing danger quickened his pace the muggerudder or river of croco diles had overflowed its banks as the indian rivers do in the monsoon the low lying paddy fields lay deep under water the wreckage of some jungle huts floated past the surging rush of wa ters reached them as they came out along the inundated shore gorings horse splashed through the eddying mud a foot deep it reared on its haunches quivering with fear and refusing to go further the mans face grew gray with anx iety he tried in vain to spur on his beast yet knowing that it was useless the river was too deep to be forded for a moment he sat the girl clutched desperately against his heart at all costs she must get across
