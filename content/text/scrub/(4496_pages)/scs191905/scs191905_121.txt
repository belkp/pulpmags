 the fool even nowher husband would receive rather a crushing financial surprise that at the same time would give roy a small fortune that would take them to a new land and a new life for over the last year now happi ness of a sort had been hersbut a happiness that was tinged with an ach ing chafing regret that she might not in dulge in it openly since that glorious night when roy trafford at a house party up in the berkshires had told her that he loved her she had waited for just this moment from the very be ginning it seemed they had both been strongly drawn toward the other he had told her hotly passionately fierce ly that he wanted her and was going to have hermoney being the only thing that stood in their way the want of it that is he was struggling along down in wall street making about enough to enable him to keep up his end and get along passablybut he had no capital or resources behind him to speak of she though married to jasper walters had no fortune in her own right there fore they had but hoped and prayed that the time would come when roy made a gigantic coup that would give them enough to sail for other lands and spend their days in heavenly idleness always together it had seemed more and more hopeless as each day went by until roy had learned what he had a scant week ago flushed excited jubilant he had come to her and told her that if she could but discover the name of a cer tain stock jasper was intending to load he could make a veritable small fortune he had gone into the thing fully but it had all been so much greek to her it was something about jasper doing it as a ruse in order to lower the price so that he himself might get more later at a much lower figure but if roy bought it up he could come in on the big price when the time came jasper of course would be clever enough to sell several different onesand the point was to learn just which one was important that more or less was all that she understoodall that she wanted to roy knew and that was enough one thing however stood out should roy find out what he wanted he intended putting in the few thousands he had scraped together with what he could borrow and coming out with enough for life for them and at lastat last thank godshe had learned jasper last night had again indulged in a habit that had formerly been ex ceedingly annoyingtalking in his sleep he had seemed restless most of the night tossing about and mumbling in coherently at first in anger she had started to wake himbut then he had suddenly talked fairly clearly apparent ly speaking of the deal he intended exe cuting on the morrow it seemed that he was entirely engrossed with this stock he was going to unloadthe f l amp w whatever that meantand had named it repeatedly with tense body and held breath she had listened joy madly surging through her as she ob tained further and positive evidence that it was the name roy wanted to know f l amp wf l amp w how well she knew it there had been no sleep for her from then on with wide eyes and pounding heart she had waited through the night through the morning through breakfast and when jasper had finally quit the house she rushed to the telephone in her boudoir and told roy the glad news at first he had seemed surprised that it was the f l amp w but he had chuck lingly remarked that walters was sure ly a sly old fox and had told her that this very day would see him successful and that before many days were over they would be steaming off to start in on their glorious life together
