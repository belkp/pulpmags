love in the jungle gravel path a spray of roses swayed violently beg pardon said larry townsend his young face desperately white larry said the girl ive done wrong though you may come to for give me i shall not forgive myself i never loved you as i should have done but i hadnt the courage to refuse you i knew you did not care the way i did the boy answered i thought in time i could make you i see now that was impossible and he glanced bit terly at goring you are angry at me she said sadly how could i be he said i love you very much i dont regret that and just knowing you has given me back everything i thought was gone im not going to lose out just because the odds are against me he turned away for a moment his lips twitching then he held out his hand to goring good luck old man he said hoarse ly be good to her god helping me i will said gor ing i wish it had been i theyd sent to fix up the santals and you to fight the turks the boy said with a whimsical smile and turning slowly left them hand in hand the man and the girl watched him go in the deepening twilight a thousand fireflies flitted in the shrubbery like tiny dancing stars a crescent moon swung fairly in the violet sky as hidden by the roses goring kissed her again tragedy by frederick moxon you did not know and i must live remembering the hurt whose pain a poignant memory shall remain although i love you and forgive you did not know it was not any word you said your speech was honeyed kindliness that turned my joy to swift distress and struck my dearest rapture dead you did not know i smiled and still danced on for o how women hide their hurts from men and yet i could have killed you when you kicked the chilblain on my toe you did not know
