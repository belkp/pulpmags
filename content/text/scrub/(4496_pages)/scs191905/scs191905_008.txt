love in the jungle pected to return though this evening so i came to meet you that was very kind of you mr she hesitated das he answered ganesh das i am your fathers assistant they walked through the station to the rear he turned to give the coolies directions in rapid hindustani and the contrast in his almost obsequious man ner to her and his harsh imperiousness in addressing the coolies struck rhoda as singularly unpleasant of course she was immensely relieved that he had come for her but there was something scarcely definable about him that she did not like i am prejudiced rhoda said to her self its only because he isnt white i am afraid miss waler das said regretfully it may not be very com fortable for you getting to the bungalow from here the roads are almost im passable or i should suggest a tonga however i believe unless you would consent to ride my horse a palky would be the best way i do not ride said rhoda staring curiously at a large black coffinshaped box on the ground before them the mohammedan ladies use these das said tapping the palanquin with his riding crop they are quite purdah then he pushed back a little sliding shutter am i to get in that cried the girl in amazement i think it is really the best way he answered you will be carried and well make good time rhoda could not overcome her re luctance to get in it looked so stuffy and horrid imagine females boxing themselves up in this absurd fashion when they wanted to go out she knew that women in the east were veiled but somehow she thought it belonged more in fiction than fact smiling a little at the ridiculousness of the situation she crawled into the palky and settling herself on the cush ions felt the jerking lift as the coolies picked her up and started off you will find barampadar interest ing he said presently youre in a na tive state right in the heart of the jungle the natives are neither hindu nor moslem but one of the aboriginal tribes driven back into these hills they do not speak hindustani but have an unwritten language of their own as yet they are fairly unspoiled and abso lutely primitive youll see them go out into the jungle to hunt wild elephants and leopards armed with nothing but poisoned arrows and bows how thrilling cried rhoda and are they very ferocious not at all he said they are quite tame the santals are a very peaceful people until he paused significantly until aroused rhoda glanced up at him and sur prised on his face a flash of expression so utterly malevolent that she caught her breath sharply it frightened her but in a second it was gone and he was bending toward her suave pleasant and smiling just at present there is a little dis turbance simmering he continued that is what prevented mr waler from meeting you theres danger then the girl cried none he answered though i am sure had your father thought that you would be here so soon he might have made other arrangements for you however and his white teeth gleamed through his full lips theres nothing to be afraid of i assure you the santals are not like the warlike border tribes of whom you are probably thinking rhoda said no more she felt vague ly disturbed oppressed as by a forebod ing of evil you are a radcliffe girl i believe
