 street amp smiths love story magazine riding my husband seems to think these things are rather foolish though i dont see why i knew before we were married that he cared very little for the things i like but hardly thought about it then there is another problem which i have tried to combat if we are out riding with another couple and are having a good time it generally ends up with my hus bands getting drunk and spoiling what lit tle fun i manage to have i have tried drinking with him thinking maybe he wouldnt drink so much but it only made matters worse he makes a good salary and we have a car we could afford to have a good time together and be fine companions if he would only be more agreeable i love him dearly and he is as good to me as any husband can be in other ways than those i men tioned mrs brown is there any way i could get him to take me out more and enjoy the things i do i have tried everything i know even to talking it over with him but it doesnt seem to do any good i know he loves me but i dont understand why he cant quit drinking and be a real companion i will appreciate any suggestion you make unhappy wife being married to a man who does not care for any of the simple pleasures his wife enjoys would be hard on any woman it would seem only logical to suppose that if your husband loves you and knows his drinking makes you so unhappy an appeal to the affectionate side of his nature would encourage him to be more moderate to be fair of course you must consider the fact that he is good to you in other ways as you say wouldnt it be possible for you to enjoy with a girl friend some of the sports you like and although your husband dislikes dancing it ought not to be difficult for you to arrange informal parties at your home every now and then and dance to your hearts content every husband should make an effort to join in at least some of the social activities his wife enjoys if the marriage is to be a happy one husbands should avoid making it necessary for their wives to coax and flatter them into doing things dear mrs brown when i was fifteen years old i was obliged to plan my wed ding rather hurriedly my husband was five years older than i but we were very much in love with each other my mother was dead and until i got married i kept house for my father how ever my husbands parents wanted us to live with them and although i didnt want to i gave in at that time my motherin law was running a rooming house before i was married my husbands mother seemed to like me and wanted me to go with her son against my fathers wishes like a foolish child i didnt listen to him after i was married my motherinlaw treated me very well but when my baby was two months old she changed she couldnt be mean enough she wanted to show me what to do and what not to do about the baby saying i was too young to know anything then she started nagging me constantly insulted me in front of friends and even told the girls who helped her with the housework to flirt with my husband to make me jealous every time she got my husband alone shed tell him all sorts of lies about me we lived with her for three years and then my husband and i moved away sometime afterward a friend of mine told me that before i married my husband got one of his mothers hired girls into trouble and that there was a child i knew this girl because she was still with my motherinlaw when i got mar ried i asked my husband about this and he said it was all a lie and that he knew nothing about it my motherinlaw just laughed and said somebody was trying to make trouble by telling lies last christmas however i found a letter belonging to my motherinlaw it was from that girl and she talked about her child in such a way that i knew my hus band was the father when my husband came home i showed him the letter and he owned up and said it was true but he said he never loved this girl and didnt want me to find out the truth he also said he couldnt pre vent his folks going to see this girl and the baby
