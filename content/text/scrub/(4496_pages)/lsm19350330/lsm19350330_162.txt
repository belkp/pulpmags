the friend in need success and happiness should so often become a sorry mixup but although ife is hard and marriage may sometimes seem not at all worth while it is our job to show at least a little courage and where there are children a special effort is required hard as it is and sometimes im possible to rebuild broken trust no marriage can last without patience common sense and selfsacrifice sacrifices made for those we love are never in vain and sooner or later in one way or another loyalty and devotion begin to pay dividends so keep your chin up my dear evidently your husband means to make good his promises a little encouragement on your part will perhaps make the relationship still more agreeable try to forget the past it will not be easy i know but you can make the future so much brighter not only for the chil dren and your husband but for yourself too good luck dear mrs brown four years ago i met a man fifteen years my senior i was eighteen then he is very goodlooking and his folks are welleducated people bob makes a fine salary but money seems to mean little to him because he is the type of man who would give his last cent away to friends if they needed his help bob drinks and gambles but i dont really object to this because he never drinks to excess when we first met i didnt know much about him but after going with him for three or four months i found out that he also dated another girl but it was too late for me i was already deeply in love with him bob and i have been everything to each other he tells me that he could never forget me i know he thinks a lot of me and would do anything i asked him when my father died a short time ago bob attended to most of the details and he is always around whenever i need him however he cannot seem to forget this other girl i know she doesnt love him because the only time she dates him is when she knows he can spend a lot of money he takes her anywhere she wants to go this girl is teaching school and is supporting her parents and a brother another thing is that if she ever marries she can never be a mother and bob loves children bob knows i love him so much i would do anything in the world for him the difference in our ages does not matter be cause whenever i have been out with boys near my own age they seemed silly bob is very proud that i love him as much as i do even though others may say i love him not wisely but too well he isnt the type that would talk about a girl he is very popular but doesnt seem to care whether he ever gets married or not i wish i knew what to do to make him think of marriage wont you please ad vise me dotty to use an old axiom you can lead a horse to water but you cant make him drink im afraid dear that if your friend has felt no re sponsibility to marry you so far it is very doubtful if he ever will it is sad but true that in most cases of this kind the girl is leftholding the bag while the man transfers his interest to some one else my most sincere advice to you dotty is to drop this man at once and give yourself time to forget the entire incident it will not be easy at first but later on when you meet a man who will really deserve your love you will be glad that you made a break real love never thrives on things that must be hidden from the rest of the world real love is open and aboveboard and is always altar bound dear mrs brown i married at the age of sixteen after going steady for three years for four years we were very happy but my husband was in the habit of go ing out about twice a week he said he had to go to club meetings or out with the boys and i didnt object then my mother died and about four weeks later a girl friend told me that she saw my husband at a dance with another girl i asked him and he denied it
