borrowed man playing his part well this was a natural thing for two lovers to do with his arm about her waist he led her out onto the terrace like a balcony in the sky overlooking the lampsprinkled darkness of the city in the distance was the river and the slowly moving lights of a boat boxed evergreens behind them screened them from the bright open doorway to the dance floor a sudden painful bit of logic flashed through merrilees mind out here there was no need for harvey to act he couldnt be seen so he had come out for a respite but harvey apparently didnt re alize his opportunity instead of taking his arm from her waist he tightened it until they faced each other he put his other arm around her suddenly held her close to him and pressed his lips against hers in a long deep kiss it was so deep so burning that for a moment it felt real and it took all her will power to hold her cool senses she tried desperately to speak lightly thank you sir but you dont have to do that helen cant see us here you can relax he released her from his arms his willingness to let her go when there was no need to hold her some how scraped cruelly against her al ready raw taut nerves before she realized it she had spoken again bitterly besides nola mightnt like it the instant the words were ut tered she was sorry she hadnt put any pleasant bantering into her voice this time instead she had let it show that she was hurt now harvey would despise her but the look which came imme diately to his face for some reason wasnt a look of disdain it was a look of astonishment then of par tial understanding something like gladness hovered in his gray eyes ill have to confess about nola he said slowly shes a very nice girl but i only dated her because well look here merrilee your time was occupied with lots of other men i knew that from what nola told me and from what you said yourself i didnt want to pre sume an our fiftyfifty business re lationship you set the limits of it pretty clearly but i thought if i went out with nola now and then youd be along and if i could only be around you more i still had a vague hope that he hesitated merrilee put her handon his arm clasped it she looked up eagerly into hisgray eyes and the gladness that was hovering there seemed sud denly to have lit them for they were glowing tenderly now you had a hope that what she urged him he seized her in his arms held her crushed close against him kissed her soft yielding lips i hoped he whispered that we could go on with our fiftyfifty plan with a slight change though ill pay all the expenses you think up the ideas for games and things to pretend before your friends you think up all that sort of thing after we do one thing that ive thought up darling what is it dearest that we get married will you oh harvey dearest i thought that up long ago she murmured so did i the first time i went out with you sweetheart he kissed her again even if they hadnt been on the lofty ter race above the citys roofs above the river and its slowly moving lights shed have felt that she was just as high carried by her joyous soaring heart
