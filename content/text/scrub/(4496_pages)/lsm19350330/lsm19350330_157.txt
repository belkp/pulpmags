 street amp smiths love story magazine girl remained engaged to the fellow after hed lost his job and had to get on his feet again call that loyalty when a girl cant stick to a man because hes down so there you are girls youre always complaining about the boys but im at a loss as to how a fellow can find a decent girl a girl who has one or two oldfashioned ideas left and who would really be inter ested in homemaking rather than allnight parties busbee i believe ill just sit back and let you girls tell busbee how he may find his hearts desire how about it family dear mrs brown perhaps my prob lem may seem trivial to you but i would like to have your advice our home was broken up by divorce and i went to live with my father until two years ago when i went to stay with my mother since the divorce mother has been very bitter and now she doesnt want me to go out with any boy who is at all serious about me there is one boy four years my senior i am twenty he says he loves me and i am sure i love him but mother thinks i couldnt be happy with him because he is too quiet he doesnt care for dances parties or even card games but i dont really mind i was in love once before but the boy disappointed me terribly and now i cant seem to trust this young man as i probably should when he tells me how much he cares sometimes i imagine that it wont last or that he will get tired of me however at other times i think he is old enough to know his own mind he had had other girl friends before i started going with him he wants me to marry him at the end of the year but i really dont see how i can marry him feeling as i do besides my mother wants me to go out with other boys and forget him she thinks we are not well enough suited to each other of course i dont want to break with him do you think we could be happy to gether if we couldnt then i might as well give him up now instead of letting him think that ill marry him uncertain marion there is only one thing to do if you are not certain of your feelings for this boy and that is not to think of anything as serious as marriage at least not now no doubt your mother means well and understanding life so much better than you do dear she is probably right in saying that if you and this boy have such dif ferent likes and dislikes there would be friction however just because your mothers marriage ended so un happily it does not mean that yours will not work out give yourself more time to think it over and dont hesitate to have other friends if you can make your friend understand that you want to be fair and have his happiness at heart as much as your own he may not resent the fact that you are so undecided dear mrs brown for the past six months i have been in love with a girl who lives in the same house i have been out with her quite a lot and have told her i am in love with her however although she likes me and likes to go out with me she tells me frankly that she is not in love with me im quite heartbroken about the whole thing although she says she doesnt love me she leads me to think that she does her father doesnt like me because i have a quick temper and i cant go to this girls home as we live in the same house however its easy for us to see each other i am twentyone and she is sixteen shes a fine sensible girl and always the life of the party when we are out to gether i know i can never love another girl as i love her and i doubt whether i can be happy without her she seems to be quite grown up she admits she is fond of me but that it isnt love and has suggested that we wait two or three years to see how things turn out do you think that would be a good idea im afraid that if we wait she may fall for some other fellow later on should i ask her not to go with other boys wont you please advise me and tell me what you think would be best for us to do i know i will never be really happy unless she marries me willy of ohio i can well understand how dis couraged you feel but where love and marriage are concerned it is
