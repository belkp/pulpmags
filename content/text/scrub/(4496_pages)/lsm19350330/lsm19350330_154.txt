the friend in need the next time my motherinlaw came to see me i told her just what i thought of her i forbade my two children to go near her as she used to take them to her house and talk to them about me i told her never to step inside my door again i tried to be her friend but she didnt want me so i made up my mind not to care for her company she doesnt seem to know what friendship is anyway she has caused me only heartache ever since ive known her as for my husband he does not drink or smoke and is trying to be a man he tells me that he loves me and that he had never really loved any other girl before but i dont feel the same toward him i used to think there was no other man like him until i found this out i am only twentyfour now and i hate to think that my marriage is spoiled do you think i did right to refuse my motherinlaw to see my children every time she came she was looking for an argu ment and meddling in my affairs miserable bertha whenever anything happens to disillusion us about some one we love life and love never seem quite the same but it does not mean that we must give up hope of ever finding a measure of happiness it is indeed regrettable when in laws do not give two young people a free hand in working out their own marriage problems sometimes in laws try to be helpful but their de sire to help seems to turn into defeat and sooner or later other elements creep into a relationship that might otherwise have remained tolerable while it was not commendable on your husbands part to have evaded the responsibility of his former romance the fact that it all hap pened before you met and married him should enable you to stay and give him another chance for your childrens sakes no matter what the past may have been if a man tries to play fair he deserves an opportunity to prove that he is sincere dear mrs brown i am desperately in need of a friends advice and as i have no mother to turn to i hope you will help me i cant remember any real happiness in life until a short while ago i am twenty at sixteen i married not for love but to be independent but my marriage lasted only three months and then i was a divorcee a year later i married again but i only spent seven dreadfully unhappy months with a man any woman could have it ended up by his beating me to the extent of putting me in the hospital where i stayed for almost four months of course i sued for divorce when i got out by this time i was heartsick disap pointed and life seemed a failure how ever three months after my second divorce i met an old school chum of mine and a week later we were married for six weeks we were divinely happy then i was rushed to the hospital for an emergency operation while i was ill my husband met a woman let her drive my car and gave her a valuable diamond ring that belonged to me several weeks after i came home i caught them in my car however i wanted to make a success of the marriage and did not try to cause trouble a month later my husband took the money i had to pay the hospital bill my grandfather had given me this money as my husband was out of work i later found out hed lost his job because he had stolen money where he worked once more i was granted a divorce for the past eight months i have lived alone without faith in the future have i been the cause of all my failures i hardly think so here is my present problem just be fore christmas i met a very charming chap hes only a year older than i we were constantly together for ten days then he returned to his job in another city i visited him for five days and have just re turned however my mind is in a turmoil i am deeply in love for the first time and have dropped all other friends since i first met this man but he has heard con siderable talk about my past theres al ways some one to make my story a bigger one than it really is now he is very sus picious and jealous of me he has told me he could really love me if he dared but he doesnt want to be hurt and he doesnt completely trust me if he only knew the heartaches and un
