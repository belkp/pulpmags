the friend in need fess that i have had my share of unwelcome attentions from men who should have known better im a highschool graduate and because of poor business conditions i lost my job as secretary and had to take the first job that came along that was as waitress beyond city limits in a socalled respectable tavern in comparison to my previous knowledge of life i learned the cruder facts of human nature the people i met were of the wrong kind and i soon became disillu sioned i distrusted all men i lost faith so completely that when friends called to take me out i preferred to stay home and read fortunately i told my troubles to an old friend he said i had no reason to feel that way because i was merely an on looker while those fools openly petted in smokefilled rooms and drank bad whisky he advised me to get a job in a different place pick my friends more carefully and especially stop being alone so much and avoiding all men friends i followed his advice at first i found that all boys expected you to smoke drink and neck until all hours however i discarded those friends and tried to find others right now my ideals are normal again i have met many decent young men and have many good times without cause for complaint my advice to socrates is to stop being a crab and look for friends elsewhere if he is really as nice a young man as he says it shouldnt be hard for him to meet nice people and interest himself in some equally nice girl i know that from now on i will continue to look for a man who comes up to my standards and i hope i have the patience because ive met many poor examples when i have no place to go i sew or knit and try my hand at the things that make a girl a successful housekeeper girls do you think its foolish of me to wait and hope that some day i will find the right man id like to hear from any one who reads this letter i really think there are many good men left am i wrong babs i am sure you are not wrong in your belief that there are many good men left and i agree with you that it isnt fair to judge every one by the shortcomings of a few per haps after reading these two letters socrates and blue barney will take time to think things over however here is a young man who agrees with socrates that nice girls are almost nonexistent dear mrs brown i dont know whether this letter will ever find its way into print but after reading socratess letter i would certainly like to shake hands with a real man i agree with him that girls these days are nothing but playthings who revel in pet ting and kisses drink paint and smoke like a chimney none of them have any com mon sense every girl i have ever dated drank smoked and having a good time was her special interest if she met a fellow who could spend more on her than her cur rent boy friend all the better and the old friend was given the wellknown air with out so much as a thank you socrates said that if a fellow isnt what the girls call a good sport and if he doesnt join in drinking like the others he is seldom asked anywhere his deductions are cer tainly correct i dont care for liquor i could never see what fun people could have when they were tight and couldnt see straight as for easy kisses theres no glamour when a girl kisses every fellow who takes her out but that seems to be what the girls want girls also complain that boys get fresh and forget to behave like gentlemen girls may complain but they fall for a fellow just the same if only to add another scalp to their list maybe youll say i feel this way because i havent met the only girl ive met lots of girls but couldnt fall in love with any of them because i saw nothing to fall in love with i really dont believe there are any honesttogoodness girls and the boys i know think the same im twentythree have had two years of college and am now working in a con tractors office im considered goodlook ing and have been told i have a likable personality so i dont think that the rea son i havent found the right girl is be cause im not presentable another thing that jars me is that girls lack loyalty they are pals when a fellow can take them places but when hes broke well thats his hard luck and they openly admit there are plenty of other fellows who dont have to economize i have heard of only one ease where the
