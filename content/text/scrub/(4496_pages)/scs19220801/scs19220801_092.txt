the radio roadster correct and the driver of the machine had evidently been listening to the repeated volleys of air waves as he raced along in any event the occupant of the wrecked automobile had competely dis appeared what had become of him was a mystery even though the owner ship of the battered machine was not in fact the police had been suspicious of its identity from the first receipt of news about its radio equipment now they did not even need to consult the license tags to recognize the once smart roadster as the yellow speed car in which nick brewster rushed about the country the officers knew that brewster was a radio enthusiast and besides they had seen him at the wheel earlier in the evening th accidentif it was onegave a different complexion to the matter how ever the course of the car was known not only because of the plane but be cause the only way it could have come was past the harrington place the question was where was brewster then one of the policemen tumbled upon his side and uttered a howl of pain his companions sprang to his aid and more enraged than hurt he held up something soft which he had found in the road it was a satin slipper with a glistening rhinestone buckle and in step ping upon its high french heel the man had turned his ankle the roadster was quickly forgotten and the officers turned their attention to a search for the cinderella whose shoe they had found it was but the work of moments before their search lamps re vealed a feminine form in the under brush by the side of the road the unconscious woman was clad in a badly torn evening gown and her hands and face were cruelly lacerated but the thing which startled the officers most as they lifted her tenderly was the fact that her arms and ankles were se curely bound strips had been torn from the evening wrap which partly enveloped her and these bonds had been drawn so tightly that she could not move some of the same soft material was thrust into her mouth and a knotted handkerchief held the rude gag in place in one corner were the initials of carter harrington v alicia and ted van horn had very little trouble in substantiating their story to the police who had rushed in upon them at the harrington bungalow the sergeant in charge would not permit ted to call carefree by radio he wished the room to await the coroners coming precisely as it was but a tele phone to the camp had promptly vouched for them and the fact that they were not present when the murder was committed neither of them desired to take the officer into their confidence regarding nick brewster but on the plea that something might be learned there he readily consented to go with them to the brewster home so the sergeant left a detail in charge of the studio and the corpse and bundling into teds ma chine they started down the mountain both alicia and ted were more than dismayed at the turn affairs had taken they feared that unless his friends acted quickly nick would become in volved even they had been somewhat doubtful despite their affection for him and if left to the tender mercies of a blundering rural police force van horn imagined nicks chances would be slim indeed instead of resenting their eagerness to help in solving the crime the sergeant appeared to welcome their wish to co operate however he was not quite sat isfied that their purpose was not prompted by some ulterior motive
