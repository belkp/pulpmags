her friend the burglar and daughter ever pried him loose from a cent and i sort of figured that maybe yon were monkeying about that safe because you needed a little extra change yourself so i beat it over to kenyons home and took a look in the safe in his li brary saythe old boy had in there so i just lifted it and closed the safe again and i dont suppose he even knows its gone doris gave a little gasp and then her eyes twinkled as she thought of ken yons fury when he should learn the truth of course there was nothing more he could do with her but she did not care to be in town when he made the discovery he would be mad enough to chew nails for days to come she went on with the note when i found youd been locked up i worked that brother stunt and because kenyon would do any thing for a hundred dollars he fell for it hard of course he didnt know it was his own century note i sent him by messenger too bad but he wouldnt see the joke im enclosing four hundred dollars thais your half of the swagless the hundred iron men it took to get you out of jail take it and have a good time yon didnt steal it fts a gift from your admiring friend the burglar for a minute or two doris hesitated then she stuffed the note and the bills into her stocking and began to pack up four hundred dollars would buy a lot of the things in that mailorder catalog and give her a longer vacation at the shore there was a train out of town at eleven fiftysix and doris proposed to take it but as she went about her prep arations she wondered whether the bur glar would by any chance be at the sea side hotel it would be fun if they could laugh together over the joke on old kenyon
