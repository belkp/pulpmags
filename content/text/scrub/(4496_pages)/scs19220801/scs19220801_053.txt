 the house of the missing was much like approaching a house handsome in the distance only to find it deserted and falling into ruins on closer inspection as a portrait painter clayton had naturally studied faces but he had never before seen so great a change in a face without a definite cause to which the change could be ascribed it was not a good face at all events of that he was very certain mrs furneau smilingly signed to him to join her and he was presently shaking hands with mrs fawcette her manner was most cordial but he did not feel that she was particularly glad to see him i hear you have been round the world since last we met he told her oh no just a fairly long stay in egypt a little off the beaten track what enthusiasm clayton re marked life is a poor shabby thing at bestso i dont see that it matters much where we spend it but i dare say you enjoyed yourself mrs fawcette had found a seat on a sofa while they were talking and he sat down beside her without an invitation oh yes thank you i enjoyed my self she answered a little sharply how extraordinary clayton ex claimed i thought that faculty was dead in most of us she turned and stared at him sus piciously well it isnt dead in me at all events she snapped although your remarks might imply that you think it ought to be clayton was secretly delighted to find that she had so quick a temper for he hoped that reaction might loosen her tongue if there was anything to learn from her he sat up as though stung my dear lady i had no thought of implying any such thing if my words sounded discourteous i beg that you will pardon them to tell you the truth you may remember that i suffered a terrible loss some months ago and im afraid that that has made me selfcentred as well as costing me my own capacity for en joyment you remember it seemed to him that his companion started slightly and for an instant his heart stood still with a sudden fierce hope but she answered smoothly enough you poor man of course i remember it but surely you found your sister again i have been away you see and he shook his head no i never found herand now i am trying to forget he glanced at his companion but she was looking down at her hands you have stopped trying to find her she inquired without looking up what is the use he replied there was a moments silence then i think perhaps you are wise she said after all she probably ran away with someone and is quite happy she looked up at him at last and i am sure you will regain your capacity for enjoyment her glance lingered a moment and for the first time he became aware of a queer fascination of which she seemed to have the power she was undoubtedly a handsome woman and her long narrow eyes could express a great deal in a queer elusive way i feel that i am regaining it mo mentarily he answered he could have taken her and cheer fully choked her for the callous way in which she had referred to his sister fascination or no fascination but that would not have advanced his cause any he was beginning to be suspicious of everyone and mrs fawcette had been one of the last persons to see margaret she smiled into his eyes then a strange elusive smile that was yet vaguely repellant
