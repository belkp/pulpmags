 the lost heiress had still more occasion to wonder she wanted to stand by ray side all the time now no detective can work that way i finally told her and asked to be left alone assuring her that miss cornwalls possessions were safe in my hands when i started looking about it seemed so futile everything was in order on the dresser was a framed portrait of her fiance as it should be other portraits of friends were about the room people with whom i had already talked in her desk i dis covered some correspondence nat urally in a case like this i looked the letters over but they told me nothing i had hoped that she might keep a diary but it seems that she was too sensible a girl for even that bit of feminine foolishness and yet i did stumble on some thing that has always puzzled me in the bottom of the desk was a picture cut from a newspaper of a college football hero i slipped it into my pocket it might be nothing more than a romantic girls fancy but it made her seem more real to me for girls do cut out of the papers pictures of college athletes and movie stars iii i inquired of mrs cornwall if her daughter knew the man she said no at least he had never been entertained in their home he might have been an acquaintance of course well i went to see the chap barker was watching the others face closely but he was gazing out of the window seemingly indifferent and yet from the way he was listen ing barker knew he was not bored he was in business with a brokers firm on lower broadway i asked him if he knew miss corn wall he told me he did not and that he had never even met her naturally i didnt tell him that i had discovered his picture in her desk butnow comes something that has led me to believe he lied to me that afternoon one day i went to see mrs corn wall good lord i was at their home so often the butler would let me in without quibbling i was wait ing in the hall mrs cornwall was engaged the butler told me then from the drawingroom came this chap i have told you about he gave me a curt nod and left the house the business i had in hand waited until i had asked mrs cornwall what he was doing there she seemed sur prised at my question as if it were an impertinence and replied that it was a personal matter and that was all i could get out of her i reminded her that i had asked her a few days before if she had known the man and she had told me she did not she explained that she had never seen him until this day that was all yet i could not help but feel that she was concealing something from me from that day her man ner changed she seemed more rec onciled to her daughters loss now we detectives work on hunches and i felt that there was something in this visit that had to do with the missing girl i also dis covered that mrs cornwall had given this man a check for ten thou sand dollars i found that out at the bank a few days later and what did you make of that asked the man one of two things either she was purchasing some stockswhich made me wonder why she didnt do
