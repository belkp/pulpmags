a dead mans business bydixie willson letty pinkus was a pretty little thing not awfully striking nor awfully brilliant and not in position really to be either inasmuch as she was merely a waitress in her mothers boardinghouse but letty pinkus was mighty sweet and pretty there was no avoiding that of course she was only eighteen which is sweetness and prettiness in it self but she had something entirely un forgettable about her eyes and that was what old bill cooper fell madly in love with bill cooper had never really had any thing to love in all his life he was a sailora parrotnosed sailor as rough as they make em and rich enough to get drunk all he pleased he had no family at allexcept one crook of a nephewand like every old sailor though he had had eighty sweethearts hed wanted no one of them more than a week then one day in may he met letty pinkus he was just in from salvador with his ditty bag on his shoulder and his new fireeye pinned up tight in his pocket it was really the thought of his fire eye that first made him notice letty a piece of black velvet is all very well but theres nothing for jewels like a womans white neck bill didnt know just what his jewel was it looked like an opal yet was diamondlike in clearness and some times it seemed really crystallized fire no one had ever seen another it was as large as a berry and they said bill had a fortune in it it hypnotized a man like an eye look ing at him bill hadnt wanted the thing what did an old sailor want of a queens priceless gem he hadnt wanted itnobut hed gone back and gone back and gone back to look at it till finally hed spent every cent that he had to buy it from the son of the old caveman whod gone crazy watching the lights in it letty pinkus wore a dark blouse with the neck open and when bill passed the bench where she was sitting in the park it came into his whimsical old mind that maybe the girl would try his jewel on her neck for him hed been itching to see how it really would look with some other background than his dirty hand or the grimy velvet it was tied in it was strung on a cord through a hole in one end of it he walked past her once and then went back againwalked past her again and then went up and asked her she was startled at first but bill wasnt a bad sort and after a minute she smiled and saidyes she would so bill hung the fireeye on lettys white neck then he caught his breath and twitched his fingers it seemed that the sun moon and stars were shin ing there he hadnt dreamed the thing was like that he hadnt dreamed any thing in the world was like that it was almost alive it frightened letty pinkus so much that she immediately untied it and gave it back again
