the flapper fools them to be seated then he hurried away to the vaults in the rear of the place and madge sat on the chair staring with a bored expression at the tips of her tiny shoes the young man returned and displayed a bewildering number of bar pins each more alluring than the other yet despite their sparkling brilliance and really rare designs madge did not seem to be impressed by them this one at eight thousand is a beauty the salesman enthused it was done in our own studios and the stones are flawless it really doesnt look like much madge shook her head now that one isnt badin fact its rather different the salesman placed upon a velvet cushion the pin she indicated and nod ded when he realized she knew some thing worth while when she saw it the stones were even finer than in the pin he had suggested and the mounting was exceedingly novel be sides it cost a thousand dollars more i think ill take that madge an nounced consulting her wristwatch with sudden recollection of her haste ill just pin it on and be running she stopped abruptly as though puz zled at the change in the expression on the young mans face then she burst out laughing and put one little hand on the sleeve of his cutaway coat as though to reassure him you didnt think i wanted to charge it or have you send the bill to papa she pealed merrily of course you dont know me the salesman nodded his head in perfect understanding and regretted that what she said was the case of course i did not think he be gan awkwardly but her eyes silenced him of course you did think she con tradicted thats what you receive a salary forisnt it well dont worry ill pay for it then she turned away from him and bending down felt beneath her abbreviated skirt for a moment the salesman looked discreetly away but did not neglect in that moment to keep one eye on the barpin madge had chosen but now her glance met his again and a slight flush came over his fea tures as she counted out on the table top nine onethousanddollar bills there was just one remaining in her dainty fingers and she held it up to him with a look of girlish triumph in her eyes dont you dare breathe a word that i didnt spend it all she pleaded if dad knew i had this one left hed want it back again he lets me buy what ever i want but hes as stingy as can be with spending money the clerk gasped as he took the bills and then a perplexed look came over his face madge was watching him closely and he did not wish to make the slightest false moveyet he was not in the habit of selling such costly jewelry to unknown customers who paid cash for it if youll wait just a moment please he requested politely i shall have to report the sale to the cashier and show the pin at the office before i can let you take it you mean that youre not sure about the money madge sniffed contemptu ously then with a seeming effort she controlled her impatience and asked the man to make haste he didto the best of his ability but as he had foreseen the cashier wished to have the bank next door pass upon the genuineness of those bills a messenger was dispatched for that pur pose and the salesman loitered in the vicinity of the cashiers cage until the report should come back he had put away the other trays and the pin madge had purchased was safe in his hand
