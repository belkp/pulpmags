the friend in need every girl wants a husband of whom she can be proud and who will treat her with consideration but she cant blame any one but herself if she allows herself to be bullied into marriage as for the married man make it a final noand make it sound final im sure that if he sees you are firm he will stop calling dear mrs brown how can a girl be normal happy and carefree if all around her she sees nothing but bitterness and bickering that would drive any one crazy im a girl of sixteen my father died when i was quite young and my mother married again for a little while every thing seemed to be all right but you should visit my home now its fight fight fight all the time ive seen so many unhappy marriages that i dont think i will ever marry my mother goes out with other men and my stepfather does his share of going places with other women sometimes i think that i have seen enough of life to make any one sick of it ive had a little experience myself i started to date boys when i was fourteen at fifteen i kept company with a boy of twentytwo right now im going out with a married man who doesnt live with his wife he is thirty but whats the dif ference people say like mother like daughter they dont give me a chance they expect me to be bad and theyll talk anyway i often feel as if id like to give them something to talk about before i started going with this married man i was crazy about a young fellow i think i was really in love with him then some one lied to him about me and he be lieved that person he didnt even give me a chance to explain you may say he couldnt have cared for me and maybe he didnt care as much for me as i did for him but that didnt stop my loving him i still think of him even though i tell some of my friends that i hate him im so lonely that i could cry but i smile and pretend im happy all my socalled friends would laugh if they heard me say that i was lonely sad sixteen when a girl has such a poor ex ample of what happiness can really mean it is small wonder that she feels disillusioned and somewhat hopeless regarding marriage and her own future i sympathize with you my child but let me assure you that unhappy marriages are the ex ception and not the rule whenever young girls of sixteen moon around and think theyre in love it usually turns out to be nothing more than a schoolgirl in fatuation perhaps there is no harm in an attack of puppy love now and then but its unwise to allow yourself to think that life isnt worth living just because some boy disappoints you it isnt always a simple matter to erase unfavorable impressions from a youthful mind but i think that if you would stop dating boys drop them altogether for six months or longerand harness your in terests in other directions life would take on new meaning for you join girls clubs and if it is at all possible go to live with a relative for a while its really a pity that your mother has so little consideration for you and so little respect for herself perhaps you can even go back to school if you have to hold down a job go to night school where you can take up some course that might interest you if you throw yourself whole heartedly into the change a more balanced perspective will gradually return to you come again dear mrs brown im a young fellow of twenty but feel about fifty after all ive gone through ever since i was fifteen i have been going with a girl i knew from school and about a year ago we became engaged we planned to get married last may two weeks after our engagement was announced i found out that the previous spring she had been in trouble and that the man had paid her several hun dred dollars to straighten things out of course i thought that she had learned
