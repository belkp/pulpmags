 street amp smiths love story magazine i am sure there isnt another woman in the case mrs brown is it so unreason able for a wife to expect her husband to notice her and to show her that he ap preciates her as he used to do before marriage whenever i read about lonely wives and how some of them accept the attentions of other men i often think it serves a hus band right if he neglects his young wife to the point where she is starved for some attention as long as i love my husband and have my children to think of i suppose ill try to put up with this indifference on his part but it certainly isnt all honey for a wife once the sweetheart idea has worn off to a shadow i would love to hear from other readers and especially men as to why hus bands forget that a wife is human and needs as much attention after five or ten years of marriage as she did before mar riage almost disgusted it would seem that from time im memorial men have been used to feminine praise and have taken it for granted that such praise is due them because they have to go out and toil for their families but do they really forget that their wives also toil and that praise and an outward show of appreciation we humans find so sweet would be wel come when the monotony of house keeping is over for the day let us observe any two young people in love they compliment each other pay attention to each others likes and dislikes and are usually careful not to appear indif ferent to each others interests but what happens in so many cases after several years of mar riage judging from the countless letters that reach this department it would appear that husbands are often to blame for many unhappy marriages because they forget that wives are warmhearted human be ings hungry for compliments soft flatteries and comments of ap proval a man may love his wife think all the lovely things in the world about her but if he stints on words and actions of praise how can she know what he feels if men would only remember that a few sincere compliments mean so much to a woman one of the serious thorns in marriage would be quickly removed dear mrs brown may i say a few words to girls who are in doubt as to how they can keep their boy friends interested the main point id say is to know your man if my two experiences will be of help to some other girl here they are i went steady with a young man for a long time we became engaged but because i showed him that i did not care for the company of other boys and wanted him only he got the idea that no one else could possibly be interested in me with the result that our engagement is now a thing of the past then i met another boy i liked i thought i would try a different method with him i teased and led him a merry chase went out with other boys and he was never sure of me he finally decided that i couldnt possibly be constant so you see what you can do with one man you cant do with another some men like to be tackled and give the girl the reins to steer them hither and you while others like to be the hunters in love and feel dis gusted with highhanded tactics however i for one have decided to play highhat and wait for my phone calls even if i have to wait the rest of my life a girl has only her pride and reputation both of which men are ever so ready and willing to snatch why not give the boys a run for their money let them come after you i have had plenty of experience that showed me the wisdom of this de cision baby face your turn now family should men as baby face says be given a run for their money are they really so selfish and mercenary as to stand ready to snatch a girls pride and reputation lets hear from you dear mrs brown may i talk to you for a littie while and tell you my story about nine months ago i fell deeply in
