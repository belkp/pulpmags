cornflowerblue herself following indifferently so bill had invited adela for a swim well why not she was a marvel ous swimmer a spectacular swim mer with all the graceful diving and perfect strokes that went to make up an exhibition performance while she barbara had only two or three steady plugging strokes that were not notable for form but that man aged to keep her above water adela was chattering on and on about bill barbara found herself listening suddenly intent so here i am babs darling headoverheels in love and with a wild man from montana some deep secret little thing in barbaras heart winced and twisted youve been in love before she said dryly adela gave a quick backward glance over one shoulder the child grows cynical but its the real thing this time i might even go through with it and marry him and live on a ranch dont be weird hell have to give up the ranch not enough money to keep it going id get dad to give him a real job hashas bill said anything yet no of course not adela tossed her bright head thats what makes the game exciting he likes me tremendously but he doesnt know yet that he cant live without me the path dipped abruptly toward the water and they could see the landing below them framed by the sweeping branches of a willow the canoes bobbed with every ripple of the shining water and the boatman sat at the end of the wharf his legs dangling a corncob pipe in his mouth he saw them coming and stood up but adela was in no hurry she turned suddenly and looked up at barbara on the path above ill win of course ive never yet lost anything that i wanted ter ribly and i want bill i want him so much that i wouldnt stand for interferencefrom any one not even you barbara stared not even me what in the world do you mean you know what i mean do you suppose i didnt see those moon struck eyes of yours this afternoon when you sat there on the ground staring at him as though youd never seen the man before i wont have you making yourself pitiful it may be your only weapon but youre not to use it hes such a big soft ninny of a manas far as his hearts concernedthat hed fall in love with a caterpillar if he got sorry enough for one she turned about and went down the path to the landing all sweet ness now and charm so that the boatman bustled about fetching ex tra pillows from the other canoes barbara took his horny hand numbly and slipped into one of the low seats she felt chilled shocked terrified her fingers were stiff as she dipped her paddle in the rosy waters the canoe slid away from the landing and out onto the wide glassy world of the lake how really awful of adela to accuse her ofof making herself pitiful in order to attract bill ill go home tomorrow she said quietly its been kind of you to bring me here but of course i couldnt stay after this adela raised her paddle and twisted about in the seat ahead so that the canoe swayed dangerously dont be ridiculous i apologize ii lost my head for a minute it wouldnt do at all to have you leave suddenly in the middle of our stay
