the friend in need love my love was returned of that i am certain and for a while i was in heaven i wonder now if that sense of utter happiness is ever permanent we were both weak and all the time i was conscious of the fact that i was doing something wrong that no matter how much we loved each other i was lowering myself for him it was different at least i thought so because although i am a girl i believe in the double standard in other words it was wrong for me but not for him still i couldnt break away i was foolish enough to believe that if that was the way he wanted me id do anything even go as far as to fling everything i held sacred to the four winds about this time my aunt opened her winter home in florida and i went to spend three weeks with her during that time it seems ages i discovered what i was already almost certain of that other men might amuse me but never hold me i enjoyed their company even had mar velous times but i couldnt forget under neath it all i wasnt satisfied there was always something missing and i was dis contented the evening before i left for home i chucked my social obligations and rode alone almost all night trying to find the answer to at least a few of my questions and when i returned home it was with the determination to end things i saw him that evening mrs brown and before he left i had the courage to tell him we couldnt possibly go on as we had been i didnt ask the impossible that he change for me merely that he stop calling and when he told me he couldnt i used the only argument left i told him i no longer loved him i know i hurt him horribly but i couldnt help it when he kissed me goodby he said he didnt see how it was possible to love so completely as he loved me and not have that love returned but true to his word he hasnt tried to get in touch with me since i have lots of social obligations that must be fulfilled but each time i sit across the table from some chap i see another face and every time i dance its with his arms around me i know ive literally thrown away my chance of happiness and even though what i did took strength ive not a shred of it left to carry on with mother thinks i am plain crazy to have sent him away when i care so much but she doesnt know why and i pray she never may dad however agrees with me that i am too young to become serious and wants mother and me to go to europe for a change im so sick of doctors tonics warnings about not eating enough and nervous breakdowns that i really dont care where they take me one thing i do want you to know and that is that marriage doesnt enter into this at all im too young and though this boy is two years my senior hes not ready to settle down either do you think ive done the right thing in breaking up with him even though ive done wrong according to conventions i cant say i m sorry be cause this love has given me some wonder ful moments it will be very hard to for get him but i am not sure that our love will last until we are old enough and ready to marry do you think i should wait for him and expect him to wait for me poor little rich girl it is undeniable that experience is the great dispeller of illusions espe cially when youth begins to discover that there is a price to be paid for too much freedom where loves young dream is concerned you dont say how old you are but if neither you nor this boy is old enough to think of settling down to marriage then youre probably too young to think seriously of love its sad but true that very young people are apt to mistake the novelty of an exciting romantic ad venture for real love having a crush on a boy who has captured your fancy and forgetting conven tions does not balance the scales where real love is concerned much as i would like to do so i am not endowed with mystic power that would enable me to look ahead and tell you whether or not any affection that may now exist be tween you and this boy will last until you are older and ready to con sider marriage but if you have already sent your friend away wouldnt it be wiser to leave the matter as it stands continue with your other interests and let father time take care of your tomorrows
