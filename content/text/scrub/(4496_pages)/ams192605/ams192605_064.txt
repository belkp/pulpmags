off on a comet dry fogs which so often extend over the polar re gions of the earth the sky was always clear the sun shone by day and the stars by night without caus ing any perceptible difference in the temperature these peculiar conditions rendered the cold en durable even in the open air the cause of so many of the diseases that prove fatal to arctic explorers resides in the cutting winds unwholesome fogs or terrible snow drifts which by drying up relaxing or otherwise affecting the lungs hinder them from fulfilling their proper functions but during per iods of calm weather when the air was absolutely still many polar navigators wellclothed and prop erly fed were known to withstand a temperature when the thermometer fell to 째 below zero it was the experience of perry upon melville island of kane beyond latitude 째 north and of hall and the crew of the polaris that however intense the cold in the absence of the wind they could always brave its rigor notwithstanding then the extreme lowness of the temperature the little population found that they were able to move about in the open air with perfect immunity the governor general made it his special care to see that his people were all well fed and warmly clad food was both wholesome and abundant and besides the furs brought from the dobrynas stores fresh skins could very easily be procured and made up into wearing apparel a daily course of outdoor exercise was enforced upon everyone not even pablo and nina were exempted from the general rule the two children muffled up in furs like little esquimaux skated along to gether pablo ever at his companions side ready to give her a helping hand whenever she was weary from her exertions after his interview with the newly arrived astronomer isaac hakkabut slunk back again to his tartan a change had come over his ideas he could no longer resist the conviction that he was indeed millions and millions of miles away from the earth where he had carried on so varied and remunerative a traffic it might be imagined that this realization of his true position would have led him to a better mind and that in some degree at least he would have been induced to regard the few fellowcrea tures with whom his lot had been so strangely cast otherwise than as mere instruments to be turned to his own personal and pecuniary advantage but nothe desire of gain was too thoroughly in grained into his hard nature ever to be eradicated and secure in his knowledge that he was under the protection of a french officer who except under the most urgent necessity would not permit him to be molested in retaining his property he de termined to wait for some emergency to arise which should enable him to use his present situation for his own profit on the one hand the jew took it into account that although the chances of returning to the earth might be remote yet from what he had heard from the professor he could not believe that they were improbable on the other he knew that a considerable sum of money in english and russian coinage was in the possession of various members of the little colony and this although valueless now would be worth as much as ever if the proper condition of things should be restored accordingly he set his heart on getting all the monetary wealth of gallia into his possession and to do this he must sell his goods but he would not sell them yet there might come a time when for many articles the supply would not be equal to the demand that would be the time for him by waiting he reckoned he should be able to transact some lucrative busi ness such in his solitude were old isaacs cogitations whilst the universal population of ninas hive were congratulating themselves upon being rid of his odious presence as already stated in the message brought by the carrier pigeon the distance traveled by gallia in april was leagues and at the end of the month she was leagues from the sun a diagram representing the elliptical orbit of the planet accompanied by an ephemeris made out in minute detail had been drawn out by the professor the curve was divided into twentyfour sections of unequal length representing respectively the dis tance described in the twentyfour months of the gallian year the twelve former divisions according to keplers law gradually diminishing in length as they approached the point denoting the aphelion and increasing as they neared the perihelion it was on the th of may that rosette exhibited this result of his labors to servadac the count and the lieutenant who visited his apartment and nat urally examined the drawing with the keenest in terest gallias path extending beyond the orbit of jupiter lay clearly defined before their eyes the progress along the orbit and the solar distances be ing inserted for each month separately nothing could look plainer and if the professors calcula tions were correct a point upon which they dared not if they would express the semblance of a doubt gallia would accomplish her revolution in precisely two years and would meet the earth which would in the same period of time have com pleted two annual revolutions in the very same spot as before what would be the consequences of a second collision they scarcely ventured to think without lifting his eye from the diagram which he was still carefully scrutinizing servadac said i see that during the month of may gallia will only travel leagues and that this will leave her about leagues distant from the sun just so replied the professor then we have already passed the zone of the telescopic planets have we not asked the count can you not use your eyes said the professor testily if you will look you will see the zone marked clearly enough upon the map without noticing the interruption servadac con tinued his own remarks the comet then i see is to reach its aphelion on the th of january ex actly a twelvemonth after passing its perihelion a twelvemonth not a gallian twelvemonth exclaimed rosette servadac looked bewildered lieutenant procope could not suppress a smile what are you laughing at demanded the pro fessor turning round upon him angrily nothing sir only it amuses me to see how you want to revise the terrestrial calendar i want to be logical thats all by all manner of means my dear professor let us be logical
