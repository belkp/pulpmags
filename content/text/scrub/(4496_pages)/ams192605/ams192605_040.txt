the crystal egg gested observations to clear up difficult points noth ing indeed could have been less visionary and more matteroffact the attention of mr cave had been speedily di rected to the birdlike creatures he had seen so abundantly present in each of his earlier visions his first impression was soon corrected and he considered for a time that they might represent a diurnal species of bat then he thought grotesquely enough that they might be cherubs their heads were round and curiously human and it was the eyes of one of them that had so startled him on his second observation they had broad silvery wings not feathered but glistening almost as brilliantly as a newkilled fish and with the same subtle play of color and these wings were not built on the plan of birdwing or bat mr wace learned but supported by curved ribs radiating from the body a sort of butterfly wing with curved ribs seems best to express their appearance the body was small but fitted with two bunches of prehensile organs like long tentacles immediately under the mouth incredible as it appeared to mr wace the persuasion at last became irresistible that it was these creatures who owned the great quasihuman buildings and the magnificent garden that made the broad valley so splendid and mr cave perceived that the buildings with other peculiarities had no doors but that the great circular windows which opened freely gave the creatures egress and en trance they would alight upon their tentacles fold their wings to a smallness almost rodlike and hop into the interior but among them was a multitude of smallerwinged creatures like great dragonflies and moths and flying beetles and across the green sward brilliantlycolored gigantic groundbeetles crawled lazily to and fro moreover on the cause ways and terraces largeheaded creatures similar to the greater winged flies but wingless were visible hopping busily upon their handlike tangle of tentacles allusion has already been made to the glittering objects upon masts that stood upon the terrace of the nearer building it dawned upon mr cave after regarding one of these masts very fixedly on one particularly vivid day that the glittering object there was a crystal exactly like that into which he peered and a still more careful scrutiny convinced him that each mast in a vista of nearly twenty car ried a similar object occasionally one of the large flying creatures would flutter up to one and folding its wings and coiling a number of its tentacles about the mast would regard the crystal fixedly for a spacesome times for as long as fifteen minutes and a series of observations made at the suggestion of mr wace convinced both watchers that so far as this visionary world was concerned the crystal into which they peered actually stood at the summit of the endmost mast on the terrace and that on one occasion at least one of these inhabitants of this other world had looked into mr caves face while he was making these observations so much for the essential facts of this very singular story unless we dismiss it all as the in genious fabrication of mr wace we have to believe one of two things either that mr caves crystal was in two worlds at once and that while it was carried about in one it remained stationary in the other which seems altogether absurd or else that it had some peculiar relation of sympathy with an other and exactly similar crystal in this other world so that what was seen in the interior of the one in this world was under suitable conditions visible to an observer in the corresponding crystal in the other world and vice versa at present in deed we do not know of any way in which two crystals could so come en rapport but nowadays we know enough to understand that the thing is not altogether impossible this view of the crystals as en rapport was the supposition that occurred to mr wace and to me at least it seems extremely plaus ible and where was this other world on this also the alert intelligence of mr wace speedily threw light after sunset the sky darkened rapidlythere was a very brief twilight interval indeedand the stars shone out they were recognizably the same as those we see arranged in the same constellations mr cave recognized the bear the pleiades alde baran and sirius so that the other world must be somewhere in the solar system and at the ut most only a few hundreds of millions of miles from our own following up this clue mr wace learned that the midnight sky was a darker blue even than our midwinter sky and that the sun seemed a little smaller and there were two small moonslike our moon but smaller and quite differently marked one of which moved so rapidly that its motion was clearly visible as one regarded it these moons were never high in the sky but vanished as they rose that is every time they revolved they were eclipsed because they were so near their primary planet and all this answers quite completely although mr cave did not know it to what must be the condi tion of things on mars indeed it seems an exceedingly plausible con clusion that peering into this crystal mr cave did actually see the planet mars and its inhabitants and if that be the case then the evening star that shone so brilliantly in the sky of that distant vision was neither more nor less than our own familiar earth for a time the martiansif they were martians do not seem to have known of mr caves inspec tion once or twice one would come to peer and go away very shortly to some other mast as though the vision was unsatisfactory during this time mr cave was able to watch the proceedings of these winged people without being disturbed by their at tentions and although his report is necessarily vague and fragmentary it is nevertheless very sug gestive imagine the impression of humanity a martian observer would get who after a difficult process of preparation and with considerable fa tigue to the eyes was able to peer at london from the steeple of st martins church for stretches at longest of four minutes at a time mr cave was unable to ascertain if the winged martians were the same as the martians who hopped about the cause ways and terraces and if the latter could put on wings at will he several times saw certain clumsy bipeds dimly suggestive of apes white and partially translucent feeding among certain of the lichenous trees and once some of these fled before one of the hopping roundheaded martians the latter caught one in its tentacles and then the picture faded suddenly and left mr cave most tantalizingly
