the man from the atom learned in what fashion they interpreted my speech i told of my journey and of its consequences i told about my world at intervals they nodded i sup pose to assure me that they were listening after awhile i was given writing materials i wrote an appeal to them to explain their world to me so that i might take up the frayed ends of my life upon it but always they only nodded at me and at last they departed taking with them the words i had written a little while later several guards were sent to my cell they handled me as though i were an animal washing me with a peculiar sort of water cutting my hair shaving my beard when i was apparently clean enough for their sensibilities i was left alone again this went on for days and days sometimes the same two men who had first interviewed me came again sometimes there were other visitors every day i was forced to submit to the attendance of the guards like any caged beast i was never spoken to all day long when i was alone i would wander restlessly about thinking over and over again the old terrible thoughts of what i had seen and lost and would not know i should have gone mad i think had they not acceded finally to my request for writing materialsthe only sign they ever gave me that i was understood i might have given way to some murderous fit of rage against them had those guards not always been there with their tiny threatening weapons but i was at least a little consoled with the writ ing materials thereafter i was able to spend hours and hours setting down the details of my adventure recording all my thoughts and desires i have given here only a small portion of all that i wrote i think it must have been this relief in writing that kept me sane i had never before realized so fully the vast wonder of the alphabet of this thing we call writ ing by pouring out all my heart into words by expressing the things that hung so oppressively over my heart i was able to make them a little lighter and perhaps a little heroic a little flatter ing and epic but this thank god did not go on forever for one day vinda came she said afterward that it had been only curiosity which led her to my cell everybody in the city everybody in that world seems to have been wildly curious to see the strange creature from the distant star but vinda was the daughter of the king of the planet whose family so far as i could gather retained its su premacy only so long as it retained its great in tellectual power vindas father the king was a physicist vinda came in state with a guard of six men and an escort of six scientists i will not say that i loved her at first sight i was indeed amazed by her great beauty and the mobility of her fea tures so fine a contrast with the impassivity of the men she was not very tall either just about my own height and the most graceful woman i have ever known she smiled at me with a some what aloof interest and thenthen she spoke the first sounds of human speech i had heard on the planet and she spoke english only a few broken words it is true but i found afterward that she had learned them just for the amusement of it from the reports of the scientists who examined me she said youarekirby her accenthow could i reproduce the sweetness of that clear accent so exotic so perfectly in keeping with the delicacy of her own appearance for a long time i could say nothing just stare at her openmouthed amazed delighted then i managed to stutter some foolish reply kirby yes yes i am kirby yes and she smiled again and i smiled unaware of the scornful gleam in the eyes of the men she smiled even more brightly when she saw my own grin indeed i fancy she was about to laugh laugh at me but perhaps my very simplicity made her calm again fordo you seei did not learn for a long time that only women laughed and played and amused themselves with artistic pursuits on that planet they did indeed scorn me those men when they saw me laughing as we would scorn a man who talked with a piping voice and giggled and stepped mincingly about but i like to think that there was something in me more appealing to vinda than the impassive manhood of those scientists perhaps after all it is only that i was unique but she did like mei am certain of it now we said very little that time she was reserved formal i was too confused to speak coherently after a while she retired and it seemed to me that my cell was ten thousand times as bare and cold and hard as it had been before the next time she came alone except for a single guard she had appealed to her father the king telling him how harmless i was and how different from the men of that planet and that i should not be judged by their standards she had persuaded him so she came alone with writing materials and a small machine which recorded sound and vision and which took the place of books she had decided to learn my language knowing that hers was in comprehensible to me since it depended on a sense which is dormant or inexistent in us something re lated perhaps to the vague thing we call mental telepathy oh but i spent endless days of wonder and en chantment there with vinda never once was i permitted to leave my cell but i was content now for it seemed that she brought all the beauty of the universe in with her the sunshine the gold and the green of the fields the blue of the seaevery thing god knows how i ever failed to realize why those days were so beautiful but i did not not until i was gone and it was too late it was not long before we could converse together for she had what seemed to me a marvellous mind although apparently the minds of women were not very highly esteemed in that world she told me quite simply that women had never evolved there beyond a certain state of civilization while men had gone on thousands of years ahead women it seemed were kept for the sort of intellectual labour which corresponds to the manual labour of the savage women the men were creators and teach ers they discovered invented reproduced per fected endless marvellous things women on the other hand understood them only in the detailed way of those who tend them watch over them care for them but i had to confess to her that my own intellect probably was not so advanced as hers and it is this it seems that made our companionship so de
