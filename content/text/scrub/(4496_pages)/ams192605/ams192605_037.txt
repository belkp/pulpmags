 amazing stories ods and this action seemed a culminating folly its my opinion hes refused that crystal be fore said the stepson a looselimbed lout of eighteen but five pounds said the stepdaughter an argumentative young woman of sixandtwenty mr caves answers were wretched he could only mumble weak assertions that he knew his own business best they drove him from his halfeaten supper into the shop to close it for the night his ears aflame and tears of vexation behind his spectacles why had he left the crystal in the window so long the folly of it that was the trouble closest to his mind for a time he could see no way of evading the sale after supper his stepdaughter and stepson smartened themselves up and went out his wife retired upstairs and over a little sugar and lemon and so forth in hot water reflected upon the busi ness aspects of the crystal mr cave went into the shop and stayed there until late ostensibly to make ornamental rockeries for goldfish globes but really for a private purpose that will be better explained later the next day mrs cave found that the crystal had been removed from the window and was lying behind some secondhand books on angling she replaced it in a conspicuous position but she did not argue further about it as a nervous headache disinclined her from debate mr cave was always disinclined the day passed disagree ably mr cave was if anything more absent minded than usual and uncommonly irritable withal in the afternoon when his wife was taking her customary sleep he removed the crystal from the window again the next day mr cave had to deliver a con signment of dogfish at one of the hospital schools where they were needed for dissection in his ab sence mrs caves mind reverted to the topic of the crystal and the methods of expenditure suitable to a windfall of five pounds she had already devised some very agreeable expedients among others a dress of green silk for herself and a trip to rich mond when a jangling of the front door bell sum moned her into the shop the customer was an examination coach who came to complain of the nondelivery of certain frogs asked for on the pre vious day mrs cave did not approve of this par ticular branch of mr caves business and the gentleman who had called in a somewhat aggressive mood retired after a brief exchange of words entirely civil so far as he was concerned mrs caves eye then naturally turned to the window for the sight of the crystal was an assurance of five pounds and of her dreams what was her surprise to find it gone she went to the place behind the locker on the counter where she had discovered it the day be fore it was not there and she immediately began an eager search about the shop when mr cave returned from his business about the dogfish about a quarter to two in the after noon he found the shop in some confusion and his wife extremely exasperated and on her knees be hind the counter routing among his taxidermic material her face came up hot and angry over the counter as the jangling bell announced his re turn and she forthwith accused him of hiding it hid what asked mr cave the crystal where did you hide the crystal at that mr cave apparently much surprised rushed to the window isnt it here he said great heavens what has become of it just then mr caves stepson reentered the shop from the inner roomhe had come home a minute or so before mr caveand he was blas pheming freely he was apprenticed to a second hand furniture dealer down the road but he had his meals at home and he was naturally annoyed to find no dinner ready but when he heard of the loss of the crystal he forgot his meal and his anger was diverted from his mother to his stepfather their first idea of course was that he had hidden it but mr cave stoutly denied all knowledge of its fate freely offering his bedabbled affidavit in the mat terand at last was worked up to the point of ac cusing first his wife and then his stepson of hav ing taken it with a view to a private sale so began an exceedingly acrimonious and emotional discussion which ended for mrs cave in a peculiar nervous condition midway between hysterics and amuck and caused the stepson to be halfanhour late at the furniture establishment in the afternoon mr cave took refuge from his wifes emotions in the shop in the evening the topic was resumed with less passion and in a more judicial spirit under the presidency of the stepdaughter the supper passed unhappily and ended in a painful scene mr cave gave way at last to extreme exasperation and went out banging the front door violently the rest of the family having discussed him with the free dom which his absence warranted hunted the house from garret to cellar hoping to light upon the crystal the next day the two customers called again they were received by mrs cave almost in tears it transpired that no one could imagine all that she had stood from cave at various times in her mar ried pilgrimage she also gave a garbled account of the disappearance the clergyman and the oriental laughed silently at one another and said it was extraordinary as mrs cave seemed disposed to give them the complete history of her life they made to leave the shop thereupon mrs cave still clinging to hope asked for the clergy mans address so that if she could get anything out of cave she might communicate it the address was duly given but apparently was afterwards mislaid mrs cave can remember nothing about it by the evening of that day the caves seem to have exhausted their emotions and mr cave who had been out in the afternoon supped in a gloomy isolation that contrasted pleasantly with the im passioned controversy of the previous days for some time matters were very badly strained in the cave household but neither crystal nor customer reappeared now without mincing the matter we must admit that mr cave was a liar he knew perfectly well where the crystal was it was in the rooms of mr jacoby wace assistant demonstrator at st catherines hospital westbourne street it stood on the sideboard partially covered by a black velvet cloth beside a decanter of american whisky it is from mr wace indeed that the particulars upon which this narrative is based were derived cave
