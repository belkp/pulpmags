 amazing stories so large a portion of the vessel had been appro priated to the cargo that the space reserved for the cabin was of most meager dimensions in one corner of the compartment stood a small iron stove in which smoldered a bare handful of coals in an other was a trestleboard which served as a bed two or three stools and a rickety deal table together with a few cooking utensils completed a stock of furniture which was worthy of its proprietor on entering the cabin ben zoofs first proceeding was to throw on the fire a liberal supply of coals utterly regardless of the groans of poor isaac who would almost as soon have parted with his own bones as submit to such reckless expenditure of his fuel the perishing temperature of the cabin however was sufficient justification for the orderlys conduct and by a little skillful manipulation he soon suc ceeded in getting up a tolerable fire the visitors having taken what seats they could hakkabut closed the door and like a prisoner awaiting his sentence stood with folded hands ex pecting the captain to speak listen said servadac we have come to ask a favor imagining that at least half his property was to be confiscated the jew began to break out into his usual formula about being a poor man and having nothing to spare but servadac without heeding his complainings went on we are not going to ruin you you know hakkabut looked keenly into the captains face we have only come to know whether you can lend us a springbalance so far from showing any symptom of relief the old miser exclaimed with a stare of astonishment as if he had been asked for some thousand francs a springbalance yes echoed the professor impatiently a springbalance havent you one asked servadac to be sure he has said ben zoof old isaac stammered and stuttered but at last confessed that perhaps there might be one amongst the stores then surely you will not object to lend it to us said the captain only for one day added the professor the jew stammered again and began to object it is a very delicate instrument your excellency the cold you know the cold may do injury to the spring and perhaps you are going to use it to weigh something very heavy why old ephraim do you suppose we are going to weigh a mountain with it said ben zoof better than that cried out the professor triumphantly we are going to weigh gallia with itmy comet merciful heaven shrieked isaac feigning con sternation at the bare suggestion servadac knew well enough that the jew was hold ing out only for a good bargain and assured him that the scale was required for no other purpose than to weigh a kilogram which considering how much lighter everything had become could not pos sibly put the slightest strain upon the instrument the jew still spluttered and moaned and hesi tated well then said servadac if you do not like to lend us your scale do you object to selling it to us isaac fairly shrieked aloud god of israel he ejaculated sell my springbalance would you deprive me of one of the most indispensable of my means of livelihood how should i weigh my mer chandise without my springbalancemy solitary springbalance so delicate and so correct the orderly wondered how his master could re frain from strangling the old miser upon the spot but servadac rather amused than otherwise de termined to try another form of persuasion come hakkabut i see that you are not disposed either to lend or to sell your balance what do you say to letting us hire it the jews eyes twinkled with a satisfaction that he was unable to conceal but what security would you give the instrument is very valuable and he looked more cunning than ever what is it worth if it is worth twenty francs i will leave a deposit of a hundred will that satisfy you he shook his head doubtfully it is very little indeed it is too little your excellency consider it is the only springbalance in all this new world of ours it is worth more much more if i take your deposit it must be in goldall gold but how much do you agree to give me for the hirethe hire one day you shall have twenty francs said servadac oh it is dirt cheap but never mind for one day you shall have it deposit in gold money a hundred francs and twenty francs for the hire the old man folded his hands in meek resignation the fellow knows how to make a good bargain said servadac as isaac after casting a distrustful look around went out of the cabin detestable old wretch replied the count full of disgust hardly a minute elapsed before the jew was back again carrying his precious instrument with os tentatious care it was of an ordinary kind a spring balance fitted with a hook held the article to be weighed a pointer revolving on a disc indi cated the weight of the article professor rosette was manifestly right in asserting that such a ma chine would register results quite independently of any change in the force of attraction on the earth it would have registered a kilogram as a kilogram here it recorded a different value altogether as the result of the altered force of gravity gold coinage to the worth of one hundred and twenty francs was handed over to the jew who clutched at the money with unmistakable eager ness the balance was committed to the keeping of ben zoof and the visitors prepared to quit the hansa all at once it occurred to the professor that the balance would be absolutely useless to him unless he had the means for ascertaining the precise measure ment of the unit of the soil of gallia which he pro posed to weigh something more you must lend me he said addressing the jew i must have a measure and i must have a kilogram i have neither of them answered isaac i have neither i am sorry i am very sorry and this time the old jew spoke the truth he would have been really glad to do another stroke or two of business upon terms as advantageous as the transaction he had just concluded
