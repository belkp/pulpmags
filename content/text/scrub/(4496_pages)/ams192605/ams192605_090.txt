off on a comet erected it and moreover if it is moving there must be somebody working it now he was keenly disappointed looking towards the north he could distinguish gibraltar faintly visible in the extreme distance and upon the sum mit of the rock both ben zoof and he fancied they could make out another semaphore giving signals no doubt in response to the one here yes it is only too clear they have already occu pied it and established their communications said servadac and what are we to do then asked ben zoof we must pocket our chagrin and put as good a face on the matter as we can replied the captain but perhaps there are only four or five english men to protect the place said ben zoof as if meditating an assault no no ben zoof answered servadac we must do nothing rash we have had our warning and unless our representations can induce them to yield their position we must resign our hope thus discomfited they had reached the foot of the rock when all at once like a jackinthebox a sentinel started up before them with the chal lenge who goes there friends vive la france cried the captain hurrah for england replied the soldier by this time four other men had made their ap pearance from the upper part of the rock what do you want asked one of them whom servadac remembered to have seen before at gi braltar can i speak to your commanding officer ser vadac inquired which said the man the officer in command of ceuta yes if there is one i will acquaint him with your arrival answered the englishman and disappeared in a few minutes the commanding officer attired in full uniform was seen descending to the shore it was major oliphant himself servadac could no longer entertain a doubt that the englishmen had forestalled him in the occupa tion of ceuta provisions and fuel had evidently been conveyed thither in the boat from gibraltar before the sea had frozen and a solid casemate hollowed in the rock had afforded major oliphant and his contingent ample protection from the rigor of the winter the ascending smoke that rose above the rock was sufficient evidence that good fires were still kept up the soldier appeared to have thriven well on what no doubt had been a generous diet and the major himself although he would scarcely have been willing to allow it was slightly stouter than before being only about twelve miles distant from gibraltar the little garrison at ceuta had felt itself by no means isolated in its position but by fre quent excursions across the frozen strait and by the constant use of the telegraph had kept up their communication with their fellowcountrymen on the other island colonel murphy and the major had not even been forced to forego the pleasures of the chessboard the game that had been interrupted by captain servadacs former visit was not yet con cluded but like the two american clubs that played their celebrated game in between washington and baltimore the two gallant officers made use of the semaphore to communicate their welldigested moves the major stood waiting for his visitor to speak major oliphant i believe said servadac with a courteous bow yes sir major oliphant officer in command of the garrison at ceuta was the englishmans reply and to whom he added may i have the honor of speaking to captain servadac the governor general of gallia indeed said the major with a supercilious look allow me to express my surprise resumed the captain at seeing you installed as commanding of ficer upon what i have always understood to be spanish soil may i demand your claim to your position my claim is that of first occupant but do you not think that the party of spaniards now resident with me may at some future time as sert a prior right to the proprietorship i think not captain servadac but why not persisted the captain because these very spaniards have by formal contract made over ceuta in its integrity to the british government servadac uttered an exclamation of surprise and as the price of that important cession continued major oliphant they have received a fair equivalent in british gold ah cried ben zoof that accounts for that fellow negrete and his people having such a lot of money servadac was silent it had become clear to his mind what had been the object of that secret visit to ceuta which he had heard of as being made by the two english officers the arguments that he had intended to use had completely fallen through all that he had now to do was carefully to prevent any suspicion of his disappointed project may i be allowed to ask captain servadac to what i am indebted for the honor of this visit asked major oliphant presently i have come major oliphant in the hope of do ing you and your companions a service replied servadac rousing himself from his reverie ah indeed replied the major as though he felt himself quite independent of all services from exterior sources i thought major that it was not unlikely you were in ignorance of the fact that both ceuta and gibraltar have been traversing the solar regions on the surface of a comet the major smiled incredulously but servadac nothing daunted went on to detail the results of the collision between the comet and the earth adding that as there was the almost immediate prospect of another concussion it had occurred to him that it might be advisable for the whole population of gallia to unite in taking precautionary measures for the common welfare in fact major oliphant he said in conclusion i am here to inquire whether you and your friends would be disposed to join us in our present quar ters i am obliged to you captain servadac answered the major stiffly but we have not the
