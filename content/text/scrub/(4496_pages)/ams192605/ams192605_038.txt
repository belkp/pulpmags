the crystal egg had taken the thing off to the hospital hidden in the dogfish sack and there had pressed the young investigator to keep it for him mr wace was a little dubious at first his relationship to cave was peculiar he had a taste for singular characters and he had more than once invited the old man to smoke and drink in his rooms and to unfold his rather amusing views of life in general and of his wife in particular mr wace had encountered mrs cave too on occasions when mr cave was not at home to attend to him he knew the constant inter ference to which cave was subjected and having weighed the story judicially he decided to give the crystal a refuge mr cave promised to explain the reasons for his remarkable affection for the crystal more fully on a later occasion but he spoke dis tinctly of seeing visions therein he called on mr wace the same evening he told a complicated story the crystal he said had come into his possession with other oddments at the forced sale of another curiosity dealers effects and not knowing what its value might be he had ticketed it at ten shillings it had hung upon his hands at that price for some months and he was thinking of reducing the figure when he made a singular discovery at that time his health was very badand it must be borne in mind that throughout all this experi ence his physical condition was one of ebband he was in considerable distress by reason of the negligence the positive illtreatment even he re ceived from his wife and stepchildren his wife was vain extravagant unfeeling and had a grow ing taste for private drinking his stepdaughter was mean and overreaching and his stepson had conceived a violent dislike for him and lost no opportunity of showing it the requirements of his business pressed heavily upon him and mr wace does not think that he was altogether free from occasional intemperance he had begun life in a comfortable position he was a man of fair educa tion and he suffered for weeks at a stretch from melancholia and insomnia afraid to disturb his family he would slip quietly from his wifes side when his thoughts became intolerable and wander about the house and about three oclock one morn ing late in august chance directed him into the shop the dirty little place was impenetrably black ex cept in one spot where he perceived an unusual glow of light approaching this he discovered it to be the crystal egg which was standing on the corner of the counter towards the window a thin ray shot through a crack in the shutters impinged upon the object and seemed as it were to fill its entire interior it occurred to mr cave that this was not in accordance with the laws of optics as he had known them in his younger days he could understand the rays being reflected by the crystal and coming to a focus in its interior but this diffusion jarred with his physical conceptions he approached the crystal more nearly peering into it and around it with a transient revival of the scientific curiosity that in his youth had determined his choice of a calling he was surprised to find the light not steady but writhing within the substance of the egg as though that object was a hollow sphere of some luminous vapor in moving about to get differ ent points of view he suddenly found that he had come between it and the ray and that the crystal none the less remained luminous greatly as tonished he lifted it out of the light ray and car ried it to the darkest part of the shop it remained bright for some four or five minutes then it slowly faded and went out he placed it in the thin streak of daylight and its luminousness was almost im mediately restored so far at least mr wace was able to verify the remarkable story of mr cave he had himself repeatedly held this crystal in a ray of light which had to be of a smaller diameter than one milli metre and in a perfect darkness such as could be produced by velvet wrapping the crystal did undoubtedly appear very faintly phosphorescent it would seem however that the luminousness was of some exceptional sort and not equally visible to all eyes for mr harbingerwhose name will be familiar to the scientific reader in connection with the pasteur institutewas quite unable to see any light whatever and mr waces own capacity for its appreciation was out of comparison inferior to that of mr caves even with mr cave the power varied very considerably his vision was most vivid during states of extreme weakness and fatigue now from the outset this light in the crystal exercised a curious fascination upon mr cave and it says more for his loneliness of soul than a volume of pathetic writing could do that he told no human being of his curious observations he seems to have been living in such an atmosphere of petty spite that to admit the existence of a pleasure would have been to risk the loss of it he found that as the dawn advanced and the amount of diffused light increased the crystal became to all appearance non luminous and for some time he was unable to see anything in it except at nighttime in dark corners of the shop but the use of an old velvet cloth which he used as a background for a collection of minerals oc curred to him and by doubling this and putting it over his head and hands he was able to get a slight luminous movement within the crystal even in the daytime he was very cautious lest he should be thus discovered by his wife and he practised this occupation only in the afternoons while she was asleep upstairs and then circumspectly in a hollow under the counter and one day turning the crystal about in his hands he saw something it came and went like a flash but it gave him the impression that the object had for a moment opened to him the view of a wide and spacious and strange country and turning it about he did just as the light faded see the same vision again now it would be tedious and unnecessary to state all the phases of mr caves discovery from this point suffice that the effect was this the crystal being peered into at an angle of about degrees from the direction of the illuminating ray gave a clear and consistent picture of a wide and peculiar countryside it was not dreamlike at all it pro duced a definite impression of reality and the better the light the more real and solid it seemed it was a moving picture that is to say certain objects moved in it but slowly in an orderly manner like real things and according as the direction of the lighting and vision changed the picture changed also it must indeed have been like looking through
