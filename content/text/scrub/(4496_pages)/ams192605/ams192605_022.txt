a trip to the center of the earth fore we were aware of it there were three or four of these little ones on our shoulders as many on our boxes and the rest hanging about our legs those who could speak kept crying out saellvertu in every possible and impossible key those who did not speak only made all the more noise this concert was interrupted by the announce ment of supper just then our worthy guide the eiderduck hunter came in after seeing to the feed ing and stabling of the horseswhich consisted in letting them loose to browse on the stunted green of the icelandic prairies there was little for them to eat but moss and some very dry and innutritious grass next day they were ready before the door long before we were welcome said hans then tranquilly with the air of an automaton without any more expression in one kiss than another he embraced the host and hostess and their nineteen children this ceremony concluded to the satisfaction of all parties we all sat down to tablethat is twenty four of ussomewhat crowded those who were more fortunate had only two juveniles on their knees however as soon as the inevitable soup was placed on the table natural taciturnity common even to icelandic babies prevailed over all else our host filled our plates with a portion of lichen soup of iceland moss of by no means disagreeable flavor an enormous lump of fish floating in sour butter after that there came some skyr a kind of curds of whey served with biscuits and juniper berry juice to drink we had blandaskimmed milk with water i was hungry so hungry that by way of dessert i finished up with a basin of thick oatmeal porridge as soon as the supper was over the children dis appeared and the grown people sat around the fire place on which was placed turf heather cow dung and dried fishbones as soon as everybody was sufficiently warm a general dispersion took place all retiring to their respective couches our hostess offered to pull off our stockings and trousers ac cording to the custom of the country but as we graciously declined to be so honored she left us to our bed of dry fodder at five in the morning next day we took our leave my uncle had great difficulty in making them accept a sufficient and proper remuneration that evening after fording the alfa and the heta two rivers rich in trout and pike we were compelled to pass the night in a deserted house worthy of being haunted by all the fays of scandinavian mythology the king of cold had taken up his residence there and made us feel his presence all night the two following days were remarkable for their lack of any particular incidents always the same damp and swampy soil the same dreary uni formity the same sad and monotonous aspect of scenery i confess that fatigue began to tell severe ly upon me but my uncle was as firm and as hard as he had been when we started i could not help admiring both the excellent professor and the worthy guide for they appeared to regard this rugged expedition as a mere jaunt on saturday the th of june at six oclock in the evening we reached budir a small town pic turesquely situated on the shore of the ocean and here the guide asked for his money my uncle settled with him immediately it was now the family of hans himself that is to say his uncles his cousinsgerman who offered us hospitality we were exceedingly well received and without taking too much advantage of the goodness of these worthy people i should have liked very much to have rested with them after the fatigues of the journey but my uncle who did not require rest had no idea of anything of the kind and despite the fact that next day was sunday i was compelled once more to mount my steed the soil was again affected by the neighborhood of the mountains whose granite peered out of the ground like tops of an old oak we were skirting the enormous base of the mighty volcano my uncle never took his eyes from off it he could not keep from gesticulating and looked at it with a kind of sullen defiance as much as to say that is the giant i have made up my mind to conquer after four hours of steady traveling the horses stopped of themselves before the door of the presby tery of stapi we had reached the foot of the volcano chapter xi we reach mount sneffelsthe reykir stapi is a town consisting of thirty huts built on a large plain of lava exposed to the rays of the sun reflected from the volcano it stretches its humble tenements along the end of a little fjord surrounded by a basaltic wall of the most singular character here we found nature proceeding geo metrically and working quite after a human fashion as if she had employed the plummet line the compass and the rule if elsewhere she pro duces grand artistic effects by piling up huge masses without order or connectionif elsewhere we see truncated cones imperfect pyramids with an odd succession of lines here as if wishing to give a lesson in regularity and preceding the archi tects of the early ages she has erected a severe order of architecture which neither the splendors of babylon nor the marvels of greece ever sur passed the walls of the fjord like nearly the whole of the peninsula consisted of a series of vertical columns in height about thirty feet these upright pillars of stone of the finest proportions supported an archivault of horizontal columns which formed a kind of halfvaulted roof above the sea at cer tain intervals and below this natural basin the eye was pleased and surprised by the sight of oval openings through which the outward waves came thundering in volleys of foam some banks of basalt torn from their fastenings by the fury of the waves lay scattered on the ground like the ruins of an ancient templeruins eternally young over which the storms of ages swept without producing any perceptible effect this was the last stage of our journey hans had brought us along with fidelity and intelligence and i began to feel somewhat more comfortable when i reflected that he was to accompany us still farther on our way when we halted before the house of the rector a small and incommodious cabin neither handsome nor more comfortable than those of his neighbors i saw a man in the act of shoeing a horse a hammer
