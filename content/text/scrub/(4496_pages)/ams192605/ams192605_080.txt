off on a comet it was a matter of debate that night whether the professor should be invited to join the party it was scarcely likely that he would care to come but on the whole it was felt to be advisable to ask him at first captain servadac thought of going in per son with the invitation but remembering rosettes dislike to visitors he altered his mind and sent young pablo up to the observatory with a formal note requesting the pleasure of professor rosettes company at the new years făşte pablo was soon back bringing no answer except that the professor had told him that today was the th of june and that tomorrow would be the st of july consequently servadac and the count took it for granted that palmyrin rosette declined their in vitation an hour after sunrise on new years day frenchmen russians spaniards and little nina as the representative of italy sat down to a feast such as never before had been seen in gallia ben zoof and the russian cook had quite surpassed them selves the wines part of the dobrynas stores were of excellent quality those of the vintages of france and spain were drunk in toasting their re spective countries and even russia was honored in a similar way by means of a few bottles of kuemmel the company was more than contentedit was as jovial as ben zoof could desire and the ringing cheers that followed the great toast of the day a happy return to our mother earth must fairly have startled the professor in the silence of his ob servatory the dăšjeuner over there still remained three hours of daylight the sun was approaching the zenith but so dim and enfeebled were his days that they were very unlike what had produced the wines of bordeaux and burgundy which they had just been enjoying and it was necessary for all before starting upon an excursion that would last over nightfall to envelop themselves in the thickest of clothing full of spirits the party left the hive and chat tering and singing as they went made their way down to the frozen shore where they fastened on their skates once upon the ice everyone followed his own fancy and some singly some in groups scattered themselves in all directions captain servadac the count and the lieutenant were gen erally seen together negrete and the spaniards now masters of their novel exercise wandered fleetly and gracefully hither and thither occasion ally being out of sight completely the russian sailors following a northern custom skated in file maintaining their rank by means of a long pole passed under their right arms and in this way they described a trackway of singular regularity the two children blithe as birds flitted about now singly now arminarm now joining the captains party now making a short peregrination by them selves but always full of life and spirit as for ben zoof he was here there and everywhere his imperturbable good temper ensuring him a smile of welcome whenever he appeared thus coursing rapidly over the icy plain the whole party had soon exceeded the line that made the horizon from the shore first the rocks of the coast were lost to view then the white crests of the cliffs were no longer to be seen and at last the summit of the volcano with its corona of vapor was entirely out of sight occasionally the skaters were obliged to stop to recover their breath but fearful of frostbite they almost instantly resumed their exercise and proceeded nearly as far as gourbi island before they thought about retracing their course but night was coming on and the sun was al ready sinking in the east with the rapidity to which the residents on gallia were by this time well ac customed the sunset upon this contracted horizon was very remarkable there was not a cloud nor a vapor to catch the tints of the declining beams the surface of the ice did not as a liquid sea would re flect the last green ray of light but the radiant orb enlarged by the effect of refraction its circumfer ence sharply defined against the sky sank abruptly as though a trap had been opened in the ice for its reception before the daylight ended captain servadac had cautioned the party to collect themselves betimes into one group unless you are sure of your where abouts before dark he said you will not find it after we have come out like a party of skirmish ers let us go back in full force the night would be dark their moon was in con junction and would not be seen the stars would only give something of that pale radiance which the poet corneille has described immediately after sunset the torches were lighted and the long series of flames fanned by the rapid motion of their bearers had much the appearance of an enormous fiery banner an hour later the volcano appeared like a dim shadow on the horizon the light from the crater shedding a lurid glare upon the surrounding gloom in time the glow of the burning lava reflected in the icy mirror fell upon the troop of skaters and cast their length ened shadows grotesquely on the surface of the frozen sea later still half an hour or more afterwards the torches were all but dying out the shore was close at hand all at once ben zoof uttered a startled cry and pointed with bewildered excitement towards the mountain involuntarily one and all they plowed their heels into the ice and came to a halt exclamations of surprise and horror burst from every lip the volcano was extinguished the stream of burning lava had suddenly ceased to flow speechless with amazement they stood still for some moments there was not one of them that did not realize more or less how critical was their posi tion the sole source of the heat that had enabled them to brave the rigor of the cold had failed them death in the cruellest of all shapes seemed staring them in the facedeath from cold meanwhile the last torch had flickered out it was quite dark forward cried servadac firmly at the word of command they advanced to the shore clambered with no little difficulty up the slippery rocks gained the mouth of the gallery groped their way into the common hall how dreary how chill it seemed th fiery cataract no longer spread its glowing covering over the mouth of the grotto lieutenant procope leaned through the aperture the pool hitherto kept fluid by its proximity to the lava was already encrusted with a layer of ice
