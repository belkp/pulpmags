 a trip to the center of the earth by jules verne continued doubtlessi am very uneasy on the point we have certainly not enough water to last us five days be quite easy on that matter continued my uncle i answer for it we shall find plenty of water in fact far more than we shall want but when when we once get through this crust of lava how can you expect springs to force their way through these solid stone walls but what is there to prove that this concrete mass of lava does not extend to the center of the earth i dont think we have as yet done much in a vertical way what puts that into your head my boy asked my uncle mildly well it appears to me that if we had descended very far below the level of the seawe should find it rather hotter than we have according to your system said my uncle but what does the thermometer say scarcely degrees by reaumur which is only an increase of degrees since our departure well and what conclusion does that bring you to inquired the professor the deduction i draw from this is very simple according to the most exact observations the augmentation of the temperature of the interior of the earth is degree for every hundred feet but certain local causes may considerably modify this figure the difference evidently depends on the con ductibility of certain rocks in the neighborhood of an extinct volcano it has been remarked that the elevation of temperature was only degree in every feet let us then go upon this calculation which is most favorableand calculate calculate away my boy nothing easier said i pulling out my notebook and pencil nine times one hundred and twenty five feet make a depth of eleven hundrd and twenty five feet archimedes could not have spoken more geo metrically well well according to my observations we are at least ten thousand feet below the level of the sea can it be possible either my calculation is correct or there is no truth in figures the calculations of the professor were perfectly correct we were already six thousand feet deeper down in the bowels of the earth than anyone had ever been before the lowest known depth to which man had hitherto penetrated was in the mines of kitzbahl on the tyrol and those of wuttemburg in bohemia the temperature which should have been eighty one was in this place only fifteen this was a matter for serious consideration to be continued in our june issue to our readers some of our readers seem to have obtained the erroneous idea that amazing stories publishes only reprints that is stories that have appeared in print before this is not the case we have a great number of new manuscripts on hand at the present time and are buying quite a good many more today more than at any other time is the day of scientifiction authors great and small are taking more and more to this type of fiction and we are getting an excellent supply of stories right along our only problem at the present time is to find room enough to publish all the good ones if you or your friends know how to write a scientifiction story the editors will be only too glad to look them over at the present time only rather short stories are re quired as we are well stocked up for some time to come with serials and long stories if on the other hand you have heard of a good scientifiction story that may have appeared in print at some time or other and which you think should be published in amazing stories we shall be grateful to hear from you we have an index of most scientific stories that have ever been published but of course we can not know all of them if you know of a good one or have one in your possession we will be more than glad to have you send it in or put us in touch with the persons or parties who have such stories editor
