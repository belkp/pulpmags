 amazing stories and his humbler companions seated themselves on some piles of lava and looked silently on they clearly took my uncle for a lunatic andwaited the result suddenly the professor uttered a wild unearthly cry at first i imagined he had lost his footing and was falling headlong into one of the yawning gulfs nothing of the kind i saw him his arms spread out to their widest extent his legs stretched apart standing upright before an enormous pedestal high enough and black enough to bear a gigantic statue of pluto his attitude and mien were that of a man utterly stupefied but his stupefaction was speedily changed to the wildest joy harry harry come here he cried make hastewonderfulwon derful unable to understand what he meant i turned to obey his commands neither hans nor the other icelanders moved a step look said the professor in something of the manner of the french general pointing out the pyramids to his army and fully partaking his stupefaction if not his joy i read on the eastern side of the huge block of stone the same characters half eaten away by the corrosive action of time the name to me a thousand times accursed runes arne saknussem cried my uncle now un believer do you begin to have faith it was totally impossible for me to answer a single word i went back to my pile of lava in a state of silent awe the evidence was unanswer able overwhelming in a few moments however my thoughts were far away back in my german home with gretchen and the old cook what would i have given for one of my cousins smiles for one of the ancient domestics omelettes and for my own feather bed how long i remained in this state i know not all i can say is that when at last i raised my head from between my hands there remained at the bot tom of the crater only myself my uncle and hans the icelandic porters had been dismissed and were now descending the exterior slopes of mount snef fels on their way to stapi how heartily did i wish myself with them hans slept tranquilly at the foot of a rock in a kind of rill of lava where he had made himself a rough and ready bed my uncle was walking about the bottom of the crater like a wild beast in a cage i had no desire neither had i the strength to move from my recumbent position taking ex ample by the guide i gave way to a kind of painful somnolency during which i seemed both to hear and feel continual heavings and shudderings in the mountain in this way we passed our first night in the interior of a crater next morning a gray cloudy heavy sky hung like a funeralpall over the summit of the volcanic cone i did not notice it so much from the ob scurity that reigned around us as from the rage with which my uncle was devoured i fully understood the reason and again a glimpse of hope made my heart leap with joy i will briefly explain the cause of the three openings which yawned beneath our steps only one could have been followed by the adventurous saknussem according to the words of the learned icelander it was only to be known by that one particular mentioned in the cryptograph that the shadow of scartaris fell upon it just touching its mouth in the last days of the month of june we were in fact to con sider the point peak as the stylus of an immense sundial the shadow of which pointed on one given day like the inexorable finger of fate to the yawn ing chasm which led into the interior of the earth now as often happens in these regions should the sun fail to burst through the clouds there can be no shadow consequently no chance of discovering the right aperture we had already reached the th of june if the kindly heavens would only remain densely clouded for six more days we should have to put off our voyage of discovery for another year when there would certainly be one person fewer in the party i had already had sufficient of the mad and monstrous enterprise it would be utterly impossible to depict the im potent rage of professor hardwigg the day passed and not the faintest outline of a shadow could be seen at the bottom of the crater hans the guide never moved from his place he must have been curious to know what we were about if indeed he could believe we were about anything as for my uncle he never addressed a word to me he was nursing his wrath to keep it warm his eyes were fixed on the black ahd foggy atmosphere his com plexion hideous with suppressed passion never had his eyes appeared so fierce his nose so aquiline his mouth so hard and firm on the th no change for the better a mix ture of rain and snow fell during the whole day hans very quietly built himself a hut of lava into which he retired like diogenes into his tub i took a malicious delight in watching the thousand little cascades that flowed down the side of the cone carrying with them at times a stream of stones into the vasty deep below my uncle was almost frantic to be sure it was enough to make even a patient man angry he had reached to a certain extent the goal of his desires and yet he was likely to be wrecked in port but if the heavens and the elements are capable of causing us much pain and sorrow there are two sides to a medal and there was reserved for pro fessor hardwigg a brilliant and sudden surprise which was to compensate him for all his sufferings next day the sky was still overcast but on sunday the th the last day but one of the month with a sudden change of wind and a new moon there came a change of weather the sun poured its beam ing rays to the very bottom of the crater each hillock every rock every stone every asperity of the soil had its share of the luminous effulgence and its shadow fell heavily on the soil among others to his insane delight the shadow of scartaris was marked and clear and moved slowly with the radiant star of day my uncle moved with it in a state of mental ecstasy at twelve oclock exactly when the sun had attained its highest altitude for the day the shadow fell upon the edge of the central pit here it is gasped the professor in an agony of joy here it iswe have found it forward my friends into the interior of the earth i looked curiously at hans to see what reply he
