off on a comet the motion of the comet as being retrograde or unlike the planets from east to west rosette thus found himself able to calculate the date at which the comet would reach its perihelion and overjoyed at his discovery without thinking of calling it palmyra or rosette after his own name he resolved that it should be known as gallia his next business was to draw up a formal re port not only did he at once recognize that a col lision with the earth was possible but he soon fore saw that it was inevitable and that it must happen on the night of the st of december moreover as the bodies were moving in opposite directions the shock could hardly fail to be violent to say that he was elated at the prospect was far below the truth his delight amounted almost to delirium anyone else would have hurried from the solitude of formentera in sheer fright but without communicating a word of his startling dis covery he remained resolutely at his post from oc casional newspapers which he had received he had learnt that fogs dense as ever continued to envelop both hemispheres so that he was assured that the existence of the comet was utterly unknown else where and the ignorance of the world as to the peril that threatened it averted the panic that would have followed the publication of the facts and left the philosopher of formentera in sole possession of the great secret he clung to his post with the greater persistency because his calculations had led him to the conclusion that the comet would strike the earth somewhere to the south of algeria and as it had a solid nucleus he felt sure that as he expressed it the effect would be unique and he was anxious to be in the vicinity the shock came and with it the results already recorded palmyrin rosette was suddenly separated from his servant joseph and when after a long period of unconsciousness he came to himself he found that he was the solitary occupant of the only fragment that survived of the balearic archipelago such was the substance of the narrative which the professor gave with sundry repetitions and digressions while he was giving it he frequently paused and frowned as if irritated in a way that seemed by no means justified by the patient and goodhumored demeanor of his audience but now gentlemen added the professor i must tell you something more important changes have resulted from the collision the cardinal points have been displaced gravity has been diminished not that i ever supposed for a minute as you did that i was still upon the earth no the earth at tended by her moon continued to rotate along her proper orbit but we gentlemen have nothing to complain of our destiny might have been far worse we might all have been crushed to death or the comet might have remained in adhesion to the earth and in neither of these cases should we have had the satisfaction of making this marvelous ex cursion through untraversed solar regions no gentlemen i repeat it we have nothing to regret and as the professor spoke he seemed to kindle with the emotion of such supreme contentment that no one had the heart to gainsay his assertion ben zoof alone ventured an unlucky remark to the effect that if the comet had happened to strike against montmartre instead of a bit of africa it would have met with some resistance pshaw said rosette disdainfully a mole hill like montmartre would have been ground to powder in a moment molehill exclaimed ben zoof stung to the quick i can tell you it would have caught up your bit of a comet and worn it like a feather in a cap the professor looked angry and servadac having imposed silence upon his orderly explained the worthy soldiers sensitiveness on all that concerned montmartre always obedient to his master ben zoof held his tongue but he felt that he could never forgive the slight that had been cast upon his be loved home it was now allimportant to learn whether the astronomer had been able to continue his observa tions and whether he had learned sufficient of gallias path through space to make him competent to determine at least approximately the period of its revolution round the sun with as much tact and caution as he could lieutenant procope en deavored to intimate the general desire for some information on this point before the shock sir answered the professor i had conclusively demonstrated the path of the comet but in consequence of the modification which that shock has entailed upon my comets orbit i have been compelled to recommence my calculations entirely the lieutenant looked disappointed although the orbit of the earth was unaltered continued the professor the result of the collision was the projection of the comet into a new orbit altogether and may i ask said procope deferentially whether you have got the elements of the fresh orbit yes then perhaps you know i know this sir that at minutes sec onds after two oclock on the morning of the st of january last gallia in passing its ascending node came in contact with the earth that on the th of january it crossed the orbit of venus that it reached its perihelion on the th that it re crossed the orbit of venus that on the st of february it passed its descending node on the th crossed the orbit of mars entered the zone of the telescopic planets on the th of march and attracting neriria carried it off as a satellite servadac interposed we are already acquainted with well nigh all these extraordinary facts many of them moreover we learned from documents which we picked up and which although unsigned we cannot entertain a doubt have originated with you professor rosette drew himself up proudly and said of course they originated with me i sent them off by hundreds from whom else could they come from no one but yourself certainly rejoined the count with grave politeness hitherto the conversation had thrown no light upon the future movements of gallia and rosette was disposed apparently to evade or at least to post pone the subject when lieutenant procope was about to press his inquiries in a more categorical form therefore servadac thinking it inadvisable to press the little savant too far interrupted him by asking the professor how he accounted for the earth
