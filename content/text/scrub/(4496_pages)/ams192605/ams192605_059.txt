want to speak to his excellency the governor the governor is in bed and asleep i can wait until he awakes then wait where you are and with this inhospitable rejoinder the orderly was about to return to his place at the side of his patient when servadac who had been roused by the sound of voices called out whats the matter ben zoof oh nothing sir only that hound of a hakkabut says he wants to speak to you let him in then ben zoof hesitated let him in i say repeated the captain per emptorily however reluctantly ben zoof obeyed the door was unfastened and isaac hakkabut enveloped in an old overcoat shuffled into the gallery in a few moments servadac approached and the jew began to overwhelm him with the most obsequious epithets without vouchsafing any reply the captain beck oned to the old man to follow him and leading the way to the central hall stopped and turning so as to look him steadily in the face said now is your opportunity tell me what you want oh my lord my lord whined isaac you must have some news to tell me news what do you mean from my little tartan yonder i saw the yawl go out from the rock here on a journey and i saw it come back and it brought a stranger and i thoughti thoughti thought well you thoughtwhat did you think why that perhaps the stranger had come from the northern shores of the mediterranean and that i might ask him he paused again and gave a glance at the captain ask him what speak out man ask him if he brings any tidings of europe hakkabut blurted out at last servadac shrugged his shoulders in contempt and turned away here was a man who had been resi dent three months in gallia a living witness to all the abnormal phenomena that had occurred and yet refused to believe that his hope of making good bargains with european traders was at an end surely nothing thought the captain will convince the old rascal now and he moved off in disgust the orderly however who had listened with much amusement was by no means disinclined for the conversation to be continued are you satisfied old ezekiel he asked isnt it so am i not right didnt a stranger arrive here last night inquired the jew yes quite true where from from the balearic isles the balearic isles echoed isaac yes fine quarters for trade hardly twenty leagues from spain he must have brought news from europe well old manasseh what if he has i should like to see him cant be the jew sidled close up to ben zoof and laying his hand on his arm said in a low and insinuating tone i am poor you know but i would give you a few reals if you would let me talk to this stranger but as if he thought he was making too liberal an offer he added only it must be at once he is too tired he is worn out he is fast asleep answered ben zoof but i would pay you to wake him the captain had overheard the tenor of the con versation and interposed sternly hakkabut if you make the least attempt to disturb our visitor i shall have you turned outside that door imme diately no offense my lord i hope stammered out the jew i only meant silence shouted servadac the old man hung his head abashed i will tell you what said servadac after a brief interval i will give you leave to hear what this stranger has to tell as soon as he is able to tell us anything at present we have not heard a word from his lips the jew looked perplexed yes said servadac when we hear his story you shall hear it too
