a trip to the center of the earth next day when we awoke under the rays of a bright and glorious sun we were nearly frozen by the keen air i left my granite couch and made one of the party to enjoy a view of the magnificent spectacle which unrolled itself panoramalike at our feet i stood upon the lofty summit of mount sneffels southern peak thence i was able to obtain a view of a great part of the island the optical delusion common to all lofty heights raised the shores of the island while the central portions appeared de pressed it was by no means too great a flight of fancy to believe that a giant picture was stretched out before me i could see the deep valleys that crossed each other in every direction i could see precipices looking like sides of wells lakes that seemed to be changed into ponds ponds that looked like puddles and rivers that were transformed into petty brooks to my right were glaciers upon glaciers and multiplied peaks topped with light clouds of smoke the undulation of the infinite numbers of moun tains whose snowy summits make them look as though covered by foam recalled to my memory the surface of a stormbeaten ocean if i looked to wards the west the ocean lay before me in all its majestic grandeur a continuation as it were of these fleecy hilltops it was impossible for the eye to distinguish where the land ended and the sea began i soon felt that strange and mysterious sensation which is awakened in the mind when looking down from lofty hill tops and now i was able to do so without any feeling of nervousness having for tunately hardened myself to that kind of sublime contemplation i wholly forgot who i was and where i was i became intoxicated with a sense of lofty sublimity without thought of the abysses into which my daring was soon about to plunge me but i was presently brought back to the realities of life by the arrival of the professor and hans who joined me upon the lofty summit of the peak my uncle turning in a westerly direction pointed out to me a light cloud of vapor a kind of haze with a faint outline of land rising out of the waters greenland said he greenland cried i in reply yes continued my uncle who always when ex plaining anything spoke as if he were in a pro fessors chair we are not more than thirtyfive leagues distant from that wonderful land when the great annual break up of the ice takes place white bears come over to iceland carried by the floating masses of ice from the north this how ever is a matter of little consequence we are now on the summit of the great the transcendent snef fels and here are its two peaks north and south hans will tell you the name by which the people of iceland call that on which we stand my uncle turned to the imperturbable guide who nodded and spoke as usualone word scartaris my uncle looked at me with a proud and triumph ant glance a crater he said you hear i did hear but i was totally unable to make reply the crater of mount sneffels represented an in verted cone the gaping orifice apparently half a mile across the depth indefinite feet conceive what this hole must have been like when full of flame and thunder and lightning the bottom of the funnelshaped hollow was about five hundred feet in circumference by which it will be seen that the slope from the summit to the bottom was very gradual and we were therefore clearly able to get there without much fatigue or difficulty involun tarily i compared this crater to an enormous loaded cannon and the comparison completely terrified me to descend into the interior of a cannon i thought to myself when perhaps it is loaded and will go off at the least shock is the act of a mad man but there was no longer any opportunity for me to hesitate hans with a perfectly calm and in different air took his usual post at the head of the adventurous little band i followed without utter ing a syllable i felt like the lamb led to the slaughter in order to render the descent less difficult hans took his way down the interior of the cone in rather a zigzag fashion making as the sailors say long tracks to the eastward followed by equally long ones to the west it was necessary to walk through the midst of eruptive rocks some of which shaken in their balance went rolling down with thundering clamor to the bottom of the abyss these continual falls awoke echoes of singular power and effect many portions of the cone consisted of inferior glaciers hans whenever he met with one of these obstacles advanced with a great show of precaution sounding the snow with his long iron pole in order to discover fissures and layers of deep soft snow in many doubtful or dangerous places it became necessary for us to be tied together by a long rope in order that should any one of us be unfortunate enough to slip he would be supported by his com panions this connecting link was doubtless a pru dent precaution but not by any means unattended with danger nevertheless despite all the manifold difficulties of the descent along slopes with which our guide was wholly unacquainted we made considerable progress without accident one of our great parcels of rope slipped from one of the iceland porters and rushed by a short cut to the bottom of the abyss by midday we were at the end of our journey i looked upwards and saw only the upper orifice of the cone which served as a circular frame to a very small portion of the skya portion which seemed to me singularly beautiful should i ever again gaze on that lovely sunlit sky the only exception to this extraordinary land scape was the peak of scartaris which seemed lost in the great void of the heavens the bottom of the crater was composed of three separate shafts through which during periods of eruption when sneffels was in action the great central furnaces sent forth its burning lava and poisonous vapors each of these chimneys or shafts gaped openmouthed in our path i kept as far away from them as possible not even venturing to take the faintest peep downwards as for the professor after a rapid examination of their disposition and characteristics he became breathless and panting he ran from one to the other like a delighted schoolboy gesticulating wild ly and uttering incomprehensible and disjointed phrases in all sorts of languages hans the guide
