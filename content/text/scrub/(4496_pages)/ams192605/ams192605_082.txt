off on a comet had therefore reason to hope that a descent would be found practicable larger and larger grew the orifice at length it would admit a mans body and ben zoof carrying a torch pushed himself through it followed by the lieutenant and servadac procopes conjecture proved correct on entering the crater they found that the sides slanted at the angle of about four degrees moreover the eruption had evidently been of recent origin dating probably only from the shock which had invested gallia with a proportion of the atmosphere of the earth and beneath the coating of ashes with which they were covered there were various irregularities in the rock not yet worn away by the action of the lava and these af forded a tolerably safe footing rather a bad staircase said ben zoof as they began to make their way down in about half an hour proceeding in a southerly direction they had descended nearly five hundred feet from time to time they came upon large ex cavations that at first sight had all the appearance of galleries but by waving his torch ben zoof could always see their extreme limits and it was evident that the lower strata of the mountain did not present the same system of ramification that rendered the hive above so commodious a residence it was not a time to be fastidious they must be satisfied with such accommodation as they could get provided it was warm captain servadac was only too glad to find that his hopes about the temper ature were to a certain extent realized the lower they went the greater was the diminution in the cold a diminution that was far more rapid than that which is experienced in making the descent of ter restrial mines in this case it was a volcano not a colliery that was the object of exploration and thankful enough they were to find that it had not become extinct although the lava from some un known cause had ceased to rise in the crater yet plainly it existed somewhere in an incandescent state and was still transmitting considerable heat to inferior strata lieutenant procope had brought in his hand a mercurial thermometer and servadac carried an aneroid barometer by means of which he could esti mate the depth of their descent below the level of the gallian sea when they were six hundred feet below the orifice the mercury registered a tempera ture of 째 c below zero six degrees said servadac that will not suit us at this low temperature we could not survive the winter we must try deeper down i only hope the ventilation will hold out there was however nothing to fear on the score of ventilation the great current of air that rushed into the aperture penetrated everywhere and made respiration perfectly easy the descent was continued for about another three hundred feet which brought the explorers to a total depth of nine hundred feet from their old quarters here the thermometer registered 째 c above zeroa temperature which if only it were permanent was all they wanted there was no ad vantage in proceeding any further along the lava course they could already hear the dull rumblings that indicated that they were at no great distance from the central focus quite near enough for me exclaimed ben zoof those who are chilly are welcome to go as much lower as they like for my part i shall be quite warm enough here after throwing the gleams of torchlight in all directions the explorers seated themselves on a jut ting rock and began to debate whether it was prac ticable for the colony to make an abode in these lower depths of the mountain the prospect it must be owned was not inviting the crater it is true widened out into a cavern sufficiently large but here its accommodation ended above and below were a few ledges in the rock that would serve as receptacles for provisions but with the exception of a small recess that must be reserved for nina it was clear that henceforth they must all renounce the idea of having separate apartments the single cave must be their diningroom drawingroom and dor mitory all in one from living the life of rabbits in a warren they were reduced to the existence of moles with the difference that they could not like them forget their troubles in a long winters sleep the cavern however was quite capable of being lighted by means of lamps and lanterns among the stores were several barrels of oil and a considerable quantity of spirits of wine which might be burned when required for cooking purposes moreover it would be unnecessary for them to confine them selves entirely to the seclusion of their gloomy residence well wrapped up there would be nothing to prevent them making occasional excursions both to the hive and to the seashore a supply of fresh water would be constantly required ice for this purpose must be perpetually carried in from the coast and it would be necessary to arrange that everyone in turn should perform this office as it would be no sinecure to clamber up the sides of the crater for feet and descend the same distance with a heavy burden but the emergency was great and it was accord ingly soon decided that the little colony should forth with take up its quarters in the cave after all they said they should hardly be much worse off than thousands who annually winter in arctic regions on board the whalingvessels and in the establish ments of the hudsons bay company such luxuries as separate cabins or sleepingchambers are never thought of one large apartment well heated and ventilated with as few corners as possible is con sidered far more healthy and on board ship the entire hold and in forts a single floor is appro priated to this purpose the recollection of this fact served to reconcile them in a great degree to the change to which they felt it requisite to submit having remounted the ascent they made the re sult of their exploration known to the mass of the community who received the tidings with a sense of relief and cordially accepted the scheme of the migration the first step was to clear the cavern of its accumulation of ashes and then the labor of removal commenced in earnest never was a task undertaken with greater zest the fear of being to a certainty frozen to death if they remained where they were was a stimulus that made everyone put forth all his energies beds furniture cooking utensilsfirst the stores of the dobryna then the cargo of the tartanall were carried down with the greatest alacrity and the diminished weight combined with
