 amazing stories the dobrynas medical stores powerful enough one might think to rouse the very dead meanwhile the captain was racking his brain in his exertions to recall what were the circumstances of his previous acquaintance with the frenchman upon whose features he was gazing he only grew more and more convinced that he had once been familiar with them perhaps it was not altogether surprising that he had almost forgotten him he had never seen him since the days of his youth that time of life which with a certain show of justice has been termed the age of ingratitude for in point of fact the astronomer was none other than professor palmyrin rosette servadacs old science master at the lycăše charlemagne after completing his year of elementary studies hector servadac had entered the school at saint cyr and from that time he and his former tutor had never met so that naturally they would well nigh pass from each others recollection one thing on the other hand might conduce to a mutual and permanent impression on their memories during the year at the lycăše young servadac never of a very studious turn of mind had contrived as the ringleader of a set of like caliber as himself to lead the poor professor a life of perpetual torment on the discovery of each delinquency he would fume and rage in a manner that was a source of un bounded delight to his audience two years after servadac left the lycăše pro fessor rosette had thrown up all educational em ployment in order that he might devote himself entirely to the study of astronomy he endeavored to obtain a post at the observatory but his un genial character was so well known in scientific circles that he failed in his application however having some small private means he determined on his own account to carry on his researches with out any official salary he had really considerable genius for the science that he had adopted besides discovering three of the latest of the telescopic planets he had worked out the elements of the three hundred and twentyfifth comet in the catalogue but his chief delight was to criticize the publications of other astronomers and he was never better pleased than when he detected a flaw in their reck onings when ben zoof and negrete had extricated their patient from the envelope of furs in which he had been wrapped by servadac and the lieutenant they found themselves face to face with a shriveled little man about five feet two inches high with a round bald head smooth and shiny as an ostrichs egg no beardunless the unshorn growth of a week could be so describedand a long hooked nose that supported a pair of spectacles such as to many near sighted people seems to have become a part of their individuality his nervous system was remarkably developed and his body might not inaptly be com pared to one of the rhumkorff coils of which the wire hundreds of yards in length is permeated throughout by electric current but whatever he was his life if possible must be preserved when he had been partially divested of his clothing his heart was found to be still beating though faintly asserting that while there was life there was hope ben zoof recommenced his friction with more vigor than ever when the rubbing had been continued without a moments intermission for the best part of half an hour the astronomer heaved a faint sigh which ere long was followed by another and another he half opened his eyes closed them again then opened them completely but without exhibiting any con sciousness whatever of his situation a few words seemed to escape his lips but they were quite un intelligible presently he raised his right hand to his forehead as though instinctively feeling for something that was missing then all of a sudden his features became contracted his face flushed with apparent irritation and he exclaimed fretfully my spectacleswhere are my spectacles in order to facilitate his operations ben zoof had removed the spectacles in spite of the tenacity with which they seemed to adhere to the temples of his patient but he now rapidly brought them back and readjusted them as best he could to what seemed to be their natural position on the aquiline nose the professor heaved a long sigh of relief and once more closed his eyes before long the astronomer roused himself a little more and glanced inquiringly about him but soon relapsed into his comatose condition when next he opened his eyes captain servadac happened to be bending down closely over him examining his fea tures with curious scrutiny the old man darted an angry look at him through the spectacles and said sharply servadac five hundred lines to morrow it was an echo of days of old the words were few but they were enough to recall the identity which servadac was trying to make out is it possible he exclaimed here is my old teacher professor rosette in very flesh and blood cant say much for the flesh muttered ben zoof the old man had again fallen back into a torpid slumber ben zoof continued his sleep is getting more composed let him alone he will come round yet havent i heard of men more dried up than he is being brought all the way from egypt in cases covered with pictures you idiotthose were mummies they had been dead for ages ben zoof did not answer a word he went on preparing a warm bed into which he managed to remove his patient who soon fell into a calm and natural sleep too impatient to await the awakening of the astronomer and to hear what representations he had to make servadac the count and the lieutenant constituting themselves what might be designated the academy of sciences of the colony spent the whole of the remainder of the day in starting and discussing the wildest conjectures about their situa tion the hypothesis to which they had now ac customed themselves for so long that a new asteroid had been formed by a fracture of the earths sur face seemed to fall to the ground when they found that professor palmyrin rosette had associated the name of gallia not with their present home but with what he called my comet and that theory being abandoned they were driven to make the most improbable speculations to replace it alluding to rosette servadac took care to in form his companions that although the professor was always eccentric and at times very irascible yet he was really exceedingly goodhearted his
