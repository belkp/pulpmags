 amazing stories but he refused in one emphatic wordefter which being translated from icelandic into plain english meansafter the treaty concluded our worthy guide retired without another word a splendid fellow said my uncle only he little suspects the marvelous part he is about to play in the history of the world you mean then i cried in amazement that he shall accompany us to the interior of the earth yes replied my uncle why not there were fortyeight hours more to elapse before we made our final start our whole time was taken up in making preparations for our journey all our industry and ability were devoted to packing every object in the most advantageous mannerthe instruments on one side the arms on the other the tools here and the provisions there there were in fact four distinct groups the instruments were of course of the best manufacture a centigrade thermometer of eizel counting up to degrees which to me did not appear half enoughor too much too hot by half if the de gree of heat was to ascend so highin which case we should certainly be cookednot enough if we wanted to ascertain the exact temperature of springs or of minerals in a state of fusion a manometer worked by the pressure of the atmosphere an instrument used to ascertain the atmospheric pressure perhaps a common barometer would not have done as well the atmospheric pres sure being likely to increase in proportion as we descended below the surface of the earth a firstclass chronometer made by boissonnas of geneva set at the meridian of hamburg from which germans calculated as the english do from greenwich two compasses one for horizontal guidance the other to ascertain the dip a night glass two ruhmkorfs coils which by means of a current of electricity would ensure us a very ex cellent easily carried and certain means of obtain ing light a voltaic battery on the newest principle our arms consisted of two rifles with two re volvers why these arms were provided it was impossible for me to say i had every reason to believe that we had neither wild beasts nor savage natives to fear my uncle on the other hand was quite as devoted to his arsenal as to his collection of instruments and above all was very careful with his provision of fulminating or gun cotton war ranted to keep in any climate and of which the expansive force was known to be greater than that of ordinary gunpowder our tools consisted of two pickaxes two crow bars a silken rope ladder three ironshod alpine stocks a hatchet a hammer a dozen wedges some pointed pieces of iron and a quantity of strong rope you may conceive that the whole made a tolerable parcel especially when i mention that the ladder itself was three hundred feet long then there came the important question of pro visions the hamper was not very large but more or less satisfactory for i knew that in concentrated essence of meat and biscuit there was enough to last six months the only liquid provided by my uncle was scheidam of water not a drop we had how ever an ample supply of gourds and my uncle counted on finding water and enough to fill them as soon as we commenced our downward journey my remarks as to the temperature and quality of such water and even as to the possibility of none being found remained wholly without effect to make up the exact list of our traveling gear for the guidance of future travelersi will add that we carried a medicine and surgical chest with all apparatus necessary for wounds fractures and blows lint scissors lancetsa perfect collection of horriblelooking instruments a number of phials containing ammonia alcohol ether goulard water aromatic vinegar in fact every possible and im possible drugfinally all the materials for work ing the ruhmkorf coil my uncle had also been careful to lay in a goodly supply of tobacco several flasks of very fine gun powder boxes of tinder besides a large belt crammed full of notes and gold good boots ren dered watertight were to be found to the number of six in the toolbox my boy with such clothing with such boots and such general equipments said my uncle in a state of rapturous delight we may hope to travel far it took a whole day to put all these matters in order in the evening we dined with baron trampe in company with the mayor of reykjawik and doctor hyaltalin the great medical man of iceland m fridriksson was not present unfortunately therefore i did not understand a word that was said at dinnera kind of semiofficial reception one thing i can say my uncle never left off speaking the next day our labor came to an end our worthy host delighted my uncle professor hard wigg by giving him a good map of iceland a most important and precious document for a mineralogist our last evening was spent in a long conversation with m fridriksson whom i liked very much the more that i never expected to see him or any one else again after this agreeable way of spend ing an hour or so i tried to sleep in vain with the exception of a few dozes my night was miser able at five oclock in the morning i was awakened from the only real halfhours sleep of the night by the loud neighing of horses under my window i hastily dressed myself and went down into the street hans was engaged in putting the finishing stroke to our baggage which he did in a silent quiet way that won my admiration and yet he did it admirably well my uncle wasted a great deal of breath in giving him directions but worthy hans took not the slightest notice of his words at six oclock all our preparations were completed and m fridriksson shook hands heartily with us my uncle thanked him warmly in the icelandic lan guage for his kind hospitality speaking truly from the heart as for myself i put together a few of my best latin phrases and paid him the highest compliments i could this fraternal and friendly duty performed we sallied forth and mounted our horses as soon as we were quite ready m fridriksson advanced and
