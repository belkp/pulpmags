 amazing stories had no shadow of desire to return to the earth it would be only the first of these probabilities that could give him any concern total annihilation might not accord with his views but he would be quite content for gallia to miss its mark with re gard to the earth indifferent whether it revolved as a new satellite around jupiter or whether it wend ed its course through the untraversed regions of the milky way the rest of the community however by no means sympathized with the professors senti ments and the following month was a period of considerable doubt and anxiety on the st of september the distance between gallia and jupiter was precisely the same as the mean distance between the earth and the sun on the th the distance was further reduced to leagues the planet began to assume enormous dimensions and it almost seemed as if the comet had already been deflected from its elliptical orbit and was rushing on in a straight line towards the overwhelming luminary the more they contemplated the character of this gigantic planet the more they became impressed with the likelihood of a serious perturbation in their own course the diameter of jupiter is miles nearly eleven times as great as that of the earth its volume is times and its mass times greater and although the mean density is only about a third of that of water whence it has been supposed that the superficies of jupiter is liquid yet its other proportions were large enough to warrant the apprehension that important dis turbances might result from its proximity i forget my astronomy lieutenant said serva dac tell me all you can about this formidable neighbor the lieutenant having refreshed his memory by reference to flammarions răšcits de linfini of which he had a russian translation and some other books proceeded to recapitulate that jupiter ac complishes its revolution round the sun in days hours and minutes that it travels at the rate of miles a minute along an orbit meas uring millions of miles and that its rotation on its axis occupies only hours and minutes his days then are shorter than the earths days interrupted the captain considerably answered the lieutenant who went on to describe how the displacement of a point at the equator of jupiter was twentyseven times as rapid as on the earth causing the polar compres sion to be about miles how the axis being nearly perpendicular to the plane of its orbit caused the days and nights to be nearly of the same length and the seasons to be invariable and how the amount of light and heat received by the planet is only a twentyfifth part of that received by the earth the average distance from the sun being miles and how about these satellites sometimes i suppose jupiter has the benefit of four moons all shining at once asked servadac of the satellites lieutenant procope went on to say that one is rather smaller than our own moon that another moves round its primary at an inter val about equal to the moons distance from our selves but that they all revolve in considerably less time the first takes only day hours min utes the second takes days hours minutes the third days hours minutes whilst the largest of all takes but days hours min utes the most remote revolves round the planet at a distance of miles they have been enlisted into the service of science said procope it is by their movements that the velocity of light has been calculated and they have been made available for the determina tion of terrestrial longitudes it must be a wonderful sight said the captain yes answered procope i often think jupiter is like a prodigious clock with four hands i only hope that we are not destined to make a fifth hand answered servadac such was the style of the conversation that was day by day reiterated during the whole month of suspense whatever topic might be started it seemed soon to settle down upon the huge orb that was looming upon them with such threatening as pect the more remote that these planets are from the sun said procope the more venerable and ad vanced in formation are they found to be neptune situated miles from the sun issued from the solar nebulosity thousands of millions of centuries back uranus revolving miles from the center of the planetary system is of an age amounting to many hundred millions of cen turies jupiter the colossal planet gravitating at a distance of miles may be reckoned as centuries old mars has existed for years at a distance of miles the earth miles from the sun quitted his burning bosom years ago venus revolving now miles away may be as signed the age of years at least and mercury nearest of all and youngest of all has been revolving at a distance of miles for the space of yearsthe same time as the moon has been evolved from the earth servadac listened attentively he was at a loss what to say and the only reply he made to the re cital of this novel theory was to the effect that if it were true he would prefer being captured by mercury than by jupiter for mercury being so much the younger would probably prove the less imperative and selfwilled master it was on the st of september that the comet had crossed the orbit of jupiter and on the st of oc tober the two bodies were calculated to be at their minimum separation no direct shock however could be apprehended the demonstration was suf ficiently complete that the orbit of gallia did not coincide with that of the planet the orbit of jupiter being inclined at any angle of â to the orbit of the earth with which that of gallia was no doubt coincident as the month of september verged towards its close jupiter began to wear an aspect that must have excited the admiration of the most ignorant or the most indifferent observer its salient points were illumined with novel and radiant tints and the solar rays reflected from its disc glowed with a mingled softness and intensity upon gallia so that nerina had to pale her beauty who could wonder that rosette enthusiast as he was should be irremovable from his observatory
