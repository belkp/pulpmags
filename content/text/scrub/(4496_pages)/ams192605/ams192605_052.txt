the man from the atom tally any more than we can grasp time as a direc tion which extends from the small to the great that is to say when you grow you are really mov ing in a new dimension which is linked how i do not comprehend with the dimension of time the difference between this universe and the universe of which it is a part an atom is a difference in space through another dimensionsimilar to the difference in miles or lightyears between our sun and another sun of our universe but really that is too obscure for me for me too she acknowledged but our scientists understand we were silent for a long while she dreaming some private dream of her own i pondering these vast conceptions that were beyond my grasp i broke the silence first in all theories of time as a dimension this point has always raised itself in my mind if i were to return during some crisis in history and foretell the mistake that would be made could that mis take be rectified changing the whole course of his tory that she answered would come under the head of the progress which civilization makes from cycle to cycle i think you must remember that all these things are inevitable if it were your destiny to return at some earlier point in your worlds history it would be the result of natural laws and any changes you might effect in history would also be inevitable again we were silent at last i roused myself from my reveries all this i said seems very dim and unreal to me yet i suppose that is natural but we must begin to act could your scientists help me in the problem of finding the point in history where my world will be again as i left it she looked at me very steadily for a moment you are sure you wish to go she said i smiled i cannot imagine wishing not to i said oh fool that i was if i had only known how much i should some day wish to return to her then she answered averting her eyes i think i can help you you kept records of the time you spent in your journey as well as i could i replied can you draw a diagram of the stars as they looked from your earth when you left i am sure of it i assured her then i think it can be done and for the rest of that day i sat with her drawing my maps of the sky from memory setting down extracts from my tale of the journey when she left she had all the information which she thought would be required again i shall pass over the next few weeks with a few words during that time she came each day with news of the progress of her efforts once or twice she required new information of me she had persuaded her uncle to make the calculations for me in his moments of relaxation what an awful thought that conjured in my mind of the in tellectual labour of these men apparently the man by figuring the length of time i had been away and the position of my sun in space could identify it among the amazing records he possessed of all the stars in our universe past present or futurethings inconceivable to me having identi fied my world he could then figure just the size i should have to become and the time i should have to spend in my various sizes before i could return again to the world in its next cycle unimaginable millions of eons in the future when the day came on which all these calcula tions were finished vinda brought me my suit which had been preserved and the machine she brought also a chronometer which she said would record upon its numerous dials the passage of time in the universe i was leaving regardless of the various sizes i might assume it had been connected by those marvellous men in some fashion to the machine itself so that the growth of the machine acted upon the chronometer in such fashion that it would record a corresponding swiftness in the pas sage of time one dial recorded years when the needle reached a certain swiftness of revolution on the dial it ceased and the next highest dial in thousands of years continued the record alone hav ing followed the dial of the years so long as it re volved in turn this dial ceased to record while the millions of years were registered and so on the whole process being reversed as my size de creased each dial taking upon the record at the correct point the precise point when i must stop was recorded on the various dials and the precise point when i must stop my growth and shrink again was indi cated on the highest dial it was impossible that i could fail if i followed my directions explicitly when all was ready an escort of two guards was given me and vinda came with me very impassive very silent we went from my cell up through the building to the roof and entered the plane which awaited us this time i would not be chained to the rail but i would stand beside it with vinda we passed out through the city precisely as we had come in reached the sea and headed across it toward the isolated spot where i had first appeared vinda and i stood alone in the stern of the plat form looking out over the retreating water and the city do you not think she said that you will be disappointed when you return will you not find it very ironic to take up a humdrum life after all these exotic adventures no doubt i shall i answered for now that i was on my way back i could admit many things but there will be the compensations of friend ship and other things and anyhow it is my destiny she sighed yes it is your destiny is there perhaps someone whom you love and who calls you back to her i laughed lightly by no means i said i am immune i have never fallen in love for one lies many times without knowing it you are very unfortunate she said or per haps very fortunate it is hard to say are you then in love i asked her she looked out over the sea her face turned away yes she replied simply then i wish you the greatest success i said formally anddo you knowi was suddenly a little piqued without at all knowing why it may be that men are more intellectual than women but it is certain that they are sometimes more terrible fools so we went rushing on through the air cool fragrant quiet how can i ever have wished to
