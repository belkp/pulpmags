a trip to the center of the earth have been made for us travelers starting for an uncertain destination et quacunque viam dederit fortuna sequamur and whichsoever way fortune provides may we follow it chapter ix our startwe meet with adventures by the way the weather was overcast but settled when we commenced our adventurous and perilous journey we had neither to fear fatiguing heat nor drenching rain it was in fact real tourist weather as there is nothing i like better than horse exercise the pleasure of riding through an unknown country caused the early part of our enterprise to be particularly agreeable to me i began to enjoy the exhilarating delight of traveling a life of desire gratification and liberty the truth is that my spirits rose so rapidly that i began to be indifferent to what had once appeared to be a terrible journey after all i said to myself what do i risk simply to take a journey through a curious country to climb a remarkable mountain and if the worst comes to the worst to descend into the crater of an extinct volcano there could be no doubt that this was all this terrible saknussem had done as to the existence of a gallery or of subterraneous pas sages leading into the interior of the earth the idea was simply absurd the hallucination of a dis tempered imagination all then that may be re quired of me i will do cheerfully and will create no difficulty it was just before we left reykjawik that i came to this decision hans our extraordinary guide went first walking with a steady rapid and un varying step our two horses with the luggage fol lowed of their own accord without requiring whip or spur my uncle and i came behind cutting very tolerable figures upon our small but vigorous animals hans on taking his departure from reyk jawik had followed the line of the sea we took our way through poor and sparse meadows which made a desperate effort every year to show a little green they very rarely succeeded in a good show of yellow every now and then a spur of rock came down through the arid ground leaving us scarcely room to pass our horses however appeared not only well acquainted with the country but by a kind of instinct knew which was the best road my uncle had not even the satisfaction of urging his steed forward by whip spur or voice it was utterly useless to show any signs of impatience i could not help smiling to see him look so big on his little horse his long legs now and then touch ing the ground made him look like a sixfooted centaur good beast good beast he would cry i assure you harry that i begin to think no animal is more intelligent than an icelandic horse snow tempest impracticable roads rocks icebergsnothing stops him he is brave he is sober he is safe he never makes a false step never glides or slips from his path i dare to say that if any river any ford has to be crossedand i have no doubt there will be manyyou will see him enter the water without hesitation like an amphibious animal and reach the opposite side in safety we must not however at tempt to hurry him we must allow him to have his own way and i will undertake to say that between us we shall do our ten leagues a day we may do so was my reply but what about our worthy guide i have not the slightest anxiety about him that sort of person goes ahead without even knowing what he is about just look at hans he moves so little that it is impossible for him to become fatigued besides if he were to complain of weari ness he could have the loan of my horse i should have a violent attack of the cramp if i were not to have some sort of exercise my arms are all rightbut my legs are getting a little stiff all this while we were advancing at a rapid pace the country we had reached was already nearly a desert here and there could be seen an isolated farm some solitary boăťr or icelandic house built of wood earth fragments of lavalooking like beggars on the highway of life these wretched and miserable huts excited in us such pity that we felt half disposed to leave alms at every door in this country there are no roads paths are nearly unknown and vegetation poor as it was slowly as it reached its full growth soon obliterated all traces of the few travelers who passed from place to place a few stray cows and sheep were only seen oc casionally what then must we expect when we come to the upheaved regionsto the districts broken and roughened from volcanic eruptions and subterraneous commotions we were to learn all this in good time i saw however on consulting the map that we avoided a good deal of this rough country by following the winding and desolate shores of the sea in reality the great volcanic movement of the island and all its atttendant phenomena are concentrated in the interior of the island there horizontal layers or strata of rocks piled one upon the other eruptions of basaltic origin and streams of lava have given this country a kind of supernatural reputation little did i expect however the spectacle which awaited us when we reached the peninsula of sneffels where agglomerations of natures ruins form a kind of terrible chaos some two hours or more after we had left the city of reykjawik we reached the little town called aoalkirkja or the principal church it consists simply of a few housesnot what in england or germany we should call a hamlet hans stopped here onehalf hour he shared our frugal break fast answered yes and no to my uncles questions as to the nature of the road and at last when asked where we were to pass the night was as laconic as usual gardar was his oneworded reply i took occasion to consult the map to see where gardar was to be found after looking keenly i found a small town of that name on the borders of the hvalfjord about four miles from reykjawik i pointed this out to my uncle who made a very energetic grimace only four miles out of twentytwo why it is only a little walk he was about to make some energetic observa tion to the guide but hans without taking the slightest notice of him went in front of the horses and walked ahead with the same imperturbable phlegm he had always exhibited
