the crystal egg there was until a year ago a little and very grimylooking shop near seven dials over which in weatherworn yellow lettering the name of c cave naturalist and dealer in antiquities was inscribed the contents of its window were curiously variegated they comprised some ele phant tusks and an imperfect set of chessmen beads and weapons a box of glass eyes two skulls of tigers and one human several motheaten stuffed monkeys one holding a lamp an oldfashioned cabinet a flyblown ostrich egg or so some fishing tackle and an extraordinary dirty empty glass fishtank there was also at the moment the story begins a mass of crystal worked into the shape of an egg and brilliantly polished and at that two people who stood outside the window were looking one of them a tall thin clergyman the other a blackbearded young man of dusky com plexion and unobtrusive costume the dusky young man spoke with eager gesticulation and seemed anxious for his companion to purchase the article while they were there mr cave came into his shop his beard still wagging with the bread and butter of his tea when he saw these men and the object of their regard his countenance fell he glanced guiltily over his shoulder and softly shut the door he was a little old man with pale face and peculiar watery blue eyes his hair was a dirty grey and he wore a shabby blue frockcoat an ancient silk hat and carpet slippers very much down at the heel he remained watching the two men as they talked the clergyman went deep into his trouser pocket examined a handful of money and showed his teeth in an agreeable smile mr cave seemed still more depres sed when they came into the shop the clergyman without any ceremony asked the price of the crystal egg mr cave glanced ner vously towards the door leading into the parlor and said five pounds the clergyman protested to his companion as well as to mr cave that the price was highit was indeed very much more than mr cave had intended to ask when he had stocked the articleand an attempt at bargaining ensued mr cave stepped to the shop door and held it open five pounds is my price he said as though he wished to save himself the trouble of unprofitable discussion as he did so the upper portion of a womans face appeared above the blind in the glass upper panel of the door leading into the parlor and stared curiously at the two customers five pounds is my price said mr cave with a quiver in his voice the swarthy young man had so far remained a spectator watching cave keenly now he spoke give him five pounds he said the clergyman glanced at him to see if he were in earnest and when he looked at mr cave again he saw that the latters face was white its a lot of money said the clergyman and diving into his pocket began counting his resources he had little more than thirty shillings and he appealed to his com panion with whom he seemed to be on terms of considerable intimacy this gave mr cave an opportunity of collecting his thoughts and he began to explain in an agitated manner that the crystal was not as a matter of fact entirely free for sale his two customers were naturally surprised at this and inquired why he had not thought of that before he began to bargain mr cave became confused but he stuck to his story that the crystal was not in the market that afternoon that a prob able purchaser of it had already appeared the two treating this as an attempt to raise the price still further made as if they would leave the shop but at this point the parlor door opened and the owner of the dark fringe and the little eyes appeared she was a coarsefeatured corpulent woman younger and very much larger than mr cave she walked heavily and her face was flushed that crystal is for sale she said and five pounds is a good price for it i cant think what youre about cave not to take the gentlemans offer mr cave greatly perturbed by the interruption looked angrily at her over the rims of his spectacles and without excessive assurance asserted his right to manage his business in his own way an al tercation began the two customers watched the scene with interest and some amusement occasion ally assisting mrs cave with suggestions mr cave hard driven persisted in a confused and im possible story of an inquiry for the crystal that morning and his agita tion became painful but he stuck to his point with extraordinary persistence it was the young oriental who ended this curious controversy he proposed that they should call again in the course of two daysso as to give the alleged enquirer a fair chance and then we must insist said the cler gyman five pounds mrs cave took it on her self to apologize for her husband explaining that he was sometimes a little odd and as the two cus tomers left the couple prepared for a free dis cussion of the incident in all its bearings mrs cave talked to her husband with singular di rectness the poor little man quivering with emo tion muddled himself between his stories main taining on the one hand that he had another cus tomer in view and on the other asserting that the crystal was honestly worth ten guineas why did you ask five pounds said his wife do let me manage my business my own way said mr cave mr cave had living with him a stepdaughter and a stepson and at supper that night the transaction was rediscussed none of them had a very high opinion of mr caves business meth here is a tremendous story by one of the greatest liv ing scientifiction writers here is a story that will keep you guessing to the aida story which will recur to your mind many years hence mr wells imagination is not running loosehe knows his scienceand while the story at first glance may seem entirely too fantastic no one knows but that it may years from now be quite tame and of every day occurrence if a civilization on another world were sometime to com municate with us there might be thousands of methods to us undreamt of by which this could be achieved the crystal egg method which mr wells uses in this story may be one of them we who are accustomed to radio and who can bring voices out of the thin air with a pocket radio receptor will not think that the crystal egg is impossible of fulfillment at same future date we recommend this amazing story to you
