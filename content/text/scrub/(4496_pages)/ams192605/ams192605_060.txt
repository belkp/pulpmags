off on a comet hot and strong after draining it with much ap parent relish the professor got out of bed walked into the common hall round which he glanced with a preoccupied air and proceeded to seat himself in an armchair the most comfortable which the cabin of the dobryna had supplied then in a voice full of satisfaction which involuntarily recalled the ex clamations of delight that had wound up the two first of the mysterious documents that had been re ceived he burst out well gentlemen what do you think of gallia there was no time for anyone to make a reply before isaac hakkabut had darted forward by the god who is that asked the startled professor and he frowned and made a gesture of repugnance regardless of the efforts that were made to silence him the jew continued by the god of abraham i beseech you give me some tidings of europe europe shouted the professor springing from his seat as if he were electrified what does the man want with europe i want to get there screeched the jew and in spite of every exertion to get him away he clung most tenaciously to the professors chair and again implored for news of europe rosette made no immediate reply after a mo ment or two of reflection he turned to servadac and asked him whether it was not the middle of april it is the twentieth answered the captain then today said the astronomer speaking with the greatest deliberationtoday we are just three millions of leagues away from europe the jew was utterly crestfallen you seem here continued the professor to be very ignorant of the state of things how far we are ignorant rejoined servadac i cannot tell but i will tell you all that we do know and all that we have surmised and as briefly as he could he related all that had happened since the memorable night of the thirtyfirst of december how they had experienced the shock how the dobryna had made her voyage how they had discovered nothing except the fragments of the old continent at tunis sardinia gibraltar and now at formentera how at intervals the three anony mous documents had been received and finally how the settlement at gourbi island had been aban doned for their present quarters at ninas hive the astronomer had hardly patience to hear him to the end and what do you say is your surmise as to your present position he asked our supposition the captain replied is this we imagine that we are on a considerable fragment of the terrestrial globe that has been detached by collision with a planet to which you appear to have given the name of gallia better than that cried rosette starting to his feet with excitement how why what do you mean cried the voices of the listeners you are correct to a certain degree continued the professor it is quite true that at minutes seconds after two oclock on the morning of the first of january there was a collision my comet grazed the earth and the bits of the earth which you have named were carried clean away they were all fairly bewildered where then cried servadac eagerly where are we you are on my comet on gallia itself and the professor gazed around him with a per fect air of triumph chapter iii the professors experiences yes my comet repeated the professor and from time to time he knitted his brows and looked around him with a defiant air as though he could not get rid of the impression that someone was laying an unwarranted claim to its proprietorship or that the individuals before him were intruders upon his own proper domain but for a considerable while servadac the count and the lieutenant remained silent and sunk in thought here then at last was the unriddling of the enigma they had been so long endeavoring to solve both the hypotheses they had formed in suc cession had now to give way before the announce ment of the real truth the first supposition that the rotatory axis of the earth had been subject to some accidental modification and the conjecture that replaced it namely that a certain portion of the terrestrial sphere had been splintered off and carried into space had both now to yield to the representation that the earth had been grazed by an unknown comet which had caught up some scat tered fragments from its surface and was bearing them far away into sidereal regions unfolded lay the past and the present before them but this only served to awaken a keener interest about the future could the professor throw any light upon that they longed to inquire but did not yet venture to ask him meanwhile rosette assumed a pompous profes sional air and appeared to be waiting for the entire party to be ceremoniously introduced to him quite willing to humor the vanity of the eccentric little man servadac proceeded to go through the ex pected formalities allow me to present to you my excellent friend the count timascheff he said you are very welcome said rosette bowing to the count with a smile of condescension although i am not precisely a voluntary resi dent on your comet mr professor i beg to acknowl edge your courteous reception gravely responded timascheff servadac could not quite conceal his amusement at the counts irony but continued this is lieu tenant procope the officer in command of the dobryna the professor bowed again in frigid dignity his yacht has conveyed us right around gallia added the captain around gallia eagerly exclaimed the pro fessor yes entirely around it answered servadac and without allowing time for reply proceeded and this is my orderly ben zoof aidedecamp to his excellency the governor of gallia interposed ben zoof himself anxious to maintain his
