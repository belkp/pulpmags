a trip to the center of the earth chapter ii the mysterious parchment runes i declare cried my uncle striking the table fiercely with his fist i declare to you it is runicand contains some wonderful secret which i must get at at any price i was about to reply when he stopped me sit down he said quite fiercely and write to my dictation i obeyed i will substitute he said a letter of our alphabet for that of the runic we will then see what that will produce now begin and make no mistakes the dictation commenced with the following in comprehensible result mrnlls esruel seecjde sgtssmf unteief niedrke ktsamn atrates saodrrn emtnael nuaect rrilsa atvaar nscrc ieaabs ccdrmi eeutul frantu dtiac oseibo kediii scarcely giving me time to finish my uncle snatched the document from my hands and ex amined it with the most rapt and deep attention i should like to know what it means he said after a long period i certainly could not tell him nor did he expect me tohis conversation being uniformly answered by himself i declare it puts me in mind of a cryptograph he cried unless indeed the letters have been written without any real meaning and yet why take so much trouble who knows but i may be on the verge of some great discovery my candid opinion was that it was all rubbish but this opinion i kept carefully to myself as my uncles choler was not pleasant to bear all this time he was comparing the book with the parch ment the manuscript volume and the smaller docu ment are written in different hands he said the cryptograph is of much later date than the book there is an undoubted proof of the correctness of my surmise the first letter is a double m which was only added to the icelandic language in the twelfth centurythis makes the parchment two hundred years posterior to the volume the circumstances appeared very probable and very logical but it was all surmise to me to me it appears probable that this sentence was written by some owner of the book now who was the owner is the next important question per haps by great good luck it may be written some where in the volume with these words professor hardwigg took off his spectacles and taking a powerful magnifying glass examined the book carefully on the fly leaf was what appeared at first to be a blot of ink but on examination proved to be a line of writing almost effaced by time this was what he sought after considerable time he made out these letters runes arne saknussem he cried in a joyous and triumphant tone that is not only an icelandic name but the name of a learned professor of the sixteenth century a celebrated alchemist i bowed as a sign of respect these alchemists he continued avicena bacon lully paracelsus were the true the only learned men of the day they made surprising dis coveries may not this saknussem nephew mine have hidden on this bit of parchment some astound ing invention i believe the cryptograph to have a profound meaningwhich i must make out my uncle walked about the room in a state of excitement almost impossible to describe it may be so sir i timidly observed but why conceal it from posterity if it be a useful a worthy discovery whyhow should i know did not galileo make a secret of his discoveries in connection with saturn but we shall see until i discover the meaning of this sentence i will neither eat nor sleep my dear uncle i began nor you either he added it was lucky i had taken double allowance that day in the first place he continued there must be a clue to the meaning if we could find that the rest would be easy enough i began seriously to reflect the prospect of going without food and sleep was not a promising one so i determined to do my best to solve the mystery my uncle meanwhile went on with his soliloquy the way to discover it is easy enough in this document there are one hundred and thirtytwo let ters giving seventynine consonants to fiftythree vowels this is about the proportion found in most southern languages the idioms of the north being much more rich in consonants we may confidently predict therefore that we have to deal with a southern dialect nothing could be more logical now said professor hardwigg to trace the particular language as shakespeare says that is the question was my rather satirical reply this man saknussem he continued was a very learned man now as he did not write in the language of his birthplace he probably like most learned men of the sixteenth century wrote in latin if however i prove wrong in this guess we must try spanish french italian greek and even hebrew my own opinion though is decidedly in favor of latin this proposition startled me latin was my favorite study and it seemed sacrilege to believe this gibberish to belong to the country of virgil barbarous latin in all probability continued my uncle but still latin
