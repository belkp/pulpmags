find that the shores of the mediterranean had un dergone no change but they coincided in the opinion that it was prudent to keep their be wilderment entirely to them selves nothing induced them to break their reserve the very next day the small community was broken up the dobrynas crew with the count and the lieutenant start ed for russia and the span iards provided by the counts liberality with a competency that ensured them from want were despatched to their native shores the leave taking was accomplished by genuine tokens of regard and goodwill for isaac hakkabut alone there was no feeling of regret doubly ruined by the loss of his tarton and by the abandon ment of his fortune he disap peared entirely from the scene it is needless to say that no one troubled himself to institute
