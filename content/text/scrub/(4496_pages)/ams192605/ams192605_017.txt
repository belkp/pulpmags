 amazing stories beach drying salting and loading codfish the principal article of exportation the men appeared robust but heavy fairhaired like germans but of pensive mienexiles of a higher scale in the ladder of humanity than the esquimaux but i thought much more unhappy since with superior perceptions they are compelled to live within the limits of the polar circle chapter vii conversation and discovery when i returned dinner was ready this meal was devoured by my worthy relative with avidity and voracity his shipboard diet had turned his interior into a perfect gulf the repast which was more danish than icelandic was in itself nothing but the excessive hospitality of our host made us enjoy it doubly the conversation turned upon scientific matters and m fridriksson asked my uncle what he thought of the public library library sir cried my uncle it appears to me a collection of useless odd volumes and a beg garly amount of empty shelves what cried m fridriksson why we have eight thousand volumes of most rare and valuable workssome in the scandinavian language besides all the new publications from copenhagen eight thousand volumes my dear sirwhy where are they cried my uncle scattered over the country professor hard wigg we are very studious my dear sir though we do live in iceland every farmer every laborer every fisherman can both read and writeand we think that books instead of being locked up in cupboards far from the sight of students should be distributed as widely as possible the books of our library are therefore passed from hand to hand without returning to the library shelves perhaps for years then when foreigners visit you there is noth ing for them to see well sir foreigners have their own libraries and our first consideration is that our humbler classes should be highly educated fortunately the love of study is innate in the icelandic people in we founded a literary society and mechanics institute many foreign scholars of eminence are honorary members we publish books destined to educate our people and these books have rendered valuable services to our country allow me to have the honor professor hardwigg to enroll you as an honorary member my uncle who already belonged to nearly every literary and scientific institution in europe imme diately yielded to the amiable wishes of good m fridriksson and now said the latter after many expressions of gratitude and goodwill if you will tell me what books you expected to find perhaps i may be of some assistance to you i watched my uncle keenly for a minute or two he hesitated as if unwilling to speak to speak openly was perhaps to unveil his projects never theless after some reflection he made up his mind well m fridriksson he said in an easy un concerned kind of way i was desirous of ascer taining if among other valuable works you had any by the learned arne saknussem arne saknussem cried the professor of reyk jawik you speak of one of the most distinguished scholars of the sixteenth century of the great naturalist the great alchemist the great traveler exactly so one of the most distinguished men connected with icelandic science and literature as you say sir a man illustrious above all yes sir all this is true but his works we have none of them not in iceland there are none in iceland or elsewhere an swered the other sadly why so because arne saknussem was persecuted for heresy and in his works were publicly burnt at copenhagen by the hands of the common hang man very good capital murmured my uncle to the great astonishment of the worthy icelander you said sir yes yes all is clear i see the link in the chain everything is explained and i now understand why arne saknussem put out of court forced to hide his magnificent discoveries was compelled to con ceal beneath the veil of an incomprehensible crypto graph the secret what secret a secretwhich stammered my uncle have you discovered some wonderful manu script no no i was carried away by my enthusiasm a mere supposition very good sir but really to turn to another subject i hope you will not leave our island with out examination into its mineralogical riches well the fact is i am rather late so many learned men have been here before me yes yes but there is still much to be done cried m fridriksson you think so said my uncle his eyes twinkling with hidden satisfaction yes you have no idea how many unknown moun tains glaciers and volcanoes there are which remain to be studied without moving from where we sit i can show you one yonder on the edge of the hori zon you see sneffels oh yes sneffels said my uncle one of the most curious volcanoes in existence the crater of which has been rarely visited extinct extinct for the last five hundred years was the ready reply
