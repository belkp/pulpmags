 amazing stories board said m bjarne handing us our receipts excellent capital glorious remarked my uncle as we sat down to a late breakfast refresh yourself my boy and we will take a run through the town our meal concluded we went to the kongensnye torv to the kings magnificent palace to the beau tiful bridge over the canal near the museum to the immense cenotaph of thorwaldsen with its hideous naval groups to the castle of rosenborg and to all the other lions of the placenone of which my uncle even saw so absorbed was he in his antici pated triumphs but one thing struck his fancy and that was a certain singular church steeple situated on the island of amak which is the southeast quarter of the city of copenhagen my uncle at once ordered me to turn my steps that way this church exhibited nothing remarkable in itself in fact the worthy professor had only been attracted to it by one cir cumstance which was that its rather elevated steeple started from a circular platform after which there was an exterior staircase which wound round to the very summit let us ascend said my uncle but i never could climb church towers i cried i am subject to dizziness in my head the very reason why you should go up i want to cure you of a bad habit but my good sir i tell you to come what is the use of wasting so much valuable time it was impossible to dispute the dictatorial com mands of my uncle i yielded with a groan on payment of a fee a verger gave us the key he for one was not partial to the ascent my uncle at once showed me the way running up the steps like a schoolboy i followed as well as i could though no sooner was i outside the tower than my head began to swim there was nothing of the eagle about me the earth was enough for me and no ambitious desire to soar ever entered my mind still things did not go badly until i had ascended steps and was near the platform then i began to feel the rush of cold air i could scarcely stand but clutching the railings i looked upwards the railings were frail enough but they seemed good compared to those which skirted the terrible winding staircase that appeared from where i stood to ascend to the skies now then harry i cant do it i cried in accents of despair are you after all a coward sir said my uncle in a pitiless tone go up i say to this there was no reply possible and yet the keen air acted violently on my nervous system sky earth all seemed to swim round while the steeple rocked like a ship my legs gave way like those of a drunken man i crawled upon my hands and knees i hauled myself up slowly crawling like a snake presently i closed my eyes and allowed my self to be dragged upwards look around you said my uncle in a stern voice heaven knows what profound abysses you may have to look down this is excellent practice slowly and shivering all the while with cold i opened my eyes what then did i see my first glance was upwards at the cold fleecy clouds which as by some optical delusion appeared to stand still while the steeple the weathercock and our two selves were carried swiftly along far away on one side could be seen the grassy plain while on the other lay the sea bathed in translucent light the sund or sound as we call it could be discovered beyond the point of elsinore crowded with white sails which at that distance looked like the wings of seagulls while to the east could be discerned the faroff coast of sweden the whole appeared a magic panorama faint and bewildered as i was there was no remedy for it rise and stand up i must despite my protestations my first lesson lasted quite an hour when nearly two hours later i reached the bosom of mother earth i was like a rheumatic old man bent double with pain enough for one day said my uncle rubbing his hands we will begin again tomorrow there was no remedy my lessons lasted five days and at the end of that period i ascended blithely enough and found myself able to look down into the depths below without winking and even with some degree of pleasure chapter vi our voyage to iceland the hour of departure came at last the night before the worthy mr thompson brought us the most cordial letters of introduction for count trampe governor of iceland for mr pic tursson coadjutor to the bishop and for m finsen mayor of the town of reykjawik in return my uncle nearly crushed his hands so warmly did he shake them on the second of the month at two in the morn ing our precious cargo of luggage was taken on board the good ship valkyrie we followed and were very politely introduced by the captain to a small cabin with two standing bed places neither very well ventilated nor very comfortable but in the cause of science men are expected to suffer well and have we a fair wind cried my uncle in his most mellifluous accents an excellent wind replied captain bjarne we shall leave the sound going free with all sails set a few minutes afterwards the schooner started before the wind under all the canvas she could carry and entered the channel an hour later the capital of denmark seemed to sink into the waves and we were at no great distance from the coast of elsinore my uncle was delighted for myself moody and dissatisfied i appeared al most to expect a glimpse of the ghost of hamlet sublime madman thought i you doubtless would approve our proceedings you might per haps even follow us to the center of the earth there to resolve your eternal doubts how long will the voyage last asked my uncle well i should think about ten days replied the skipper unless indeed we meet with some northeast gales among the faroe islands at all events there will be no very considerable delay cried the impatient professor no mr hardwigg said the captain no fear of that at all events we shall get there some day the voyage offered no incident worthy of record
