off on a comet successfully grapple with them or in any way miti gate their consequences there was a general attitude of attention it was surprising how calmly they proceeded to discuss the circumstances that looked so threatening and ominous first of all resumed the lieutenant we will specify the different ways in which the shock may happen and the prime fact to be remembered inter posed servadac is that the combined velocity of the two bodies will be about miles an hour express speed and no mistake muttered ben zoof just so assented procope now the two bodies may impinge either directly or obliquely if the impact is sufficiently oblique gallia may do precisely what she did before she may graze the earth she may or she may not carry off a por tion of the earths atmosphere and substance and so she may float away again into space but her orbit would undoubtedly be deranged and if we survive the shock we shall have small chance of ever returning to the world of our fellowcreatures professor rosette i suppose ben zoof re marked would pretty soon find out all about that but we will leave this hypothesis said the lieu tenant our own experience has sufficiently shown us its advantages and its disadvantages we will proceed to consider the infinitely more serious alter native of direct impact of a shock that would hurl the comet straight on to the earth to which it would become attached a great wart upon her face said ben zoof laughing the captain held up his finger to his orderly making him understand that he should hold his tongue it is i presume to be taken for granted con tinued lieutenant procope that the mass of the earth is comparatively so large that in the event of a direct collision her own motion would not be sensibly retarded and that she would carry the comet along with her as part of herself very little question of that i should think said servadac well then the lieutenant went on what part of this comet of ours will be the part to come into collision with the earth it may be the equator where we are it may be at the exactly opposite point at our antipodes or it may be at either pole in any case it seems hard to foresee whence there is to come the faintest chance of deliverance is the case so desperate asked servadac i will tell you why it seems so if the side of the comet on which we are resident impinges on the earth it stands to reason that we must be crushed to atoms by the violence of the concussion regular mincemeat said ben zoof whom no admonitions could quite reduce to silence and if said the lieutenant after a moments pause and the slightest possible frown at the in terruptionand if the collision should occur at our antipodes the sudden check to the velocity of the comet would be quite equivalent to a shock in situ and another thing we should run the risk of being suffocated for all our comets atmosphere would be assimilated with the terrestrial atmos phere and we supposing we were not dashed to atoms should be left as it were upon the summit of an enormous mountain for such to all intents and purposes gallia would be miles above the level of the surface of the globe without a particle of air to breathe but would not our chances of escape be consid erably better asked count timascheff in the event of either of the comets poles being the point of contact taking the combined velocity into account answered the lieutenant i confess that i fear the violence of the shock will be too great to permit our destruction to be averted a general silence ensued which was broken by the lieutenant himself even if none of these contin gencies occur in the way we have contemplated i am driven to the suspicion that we shall be burnt alive burnt alive they all exclaimed in a chorus of horror yes if the deductions of modern science be true the speed of the comet when suddenly checked will be transmuted into heat and that heat will be so intense that the temperature of the comet will be raised to some millions of degrees no one having anything definite to allege in reply to lieutenant procopes forebodings they all re lapsed into silence presently ben zoof asked whether it was not possible for the comet to fall into the middle of the atlantic procope shook his head even so we should only be adding the fate of drowning to the list of our other perils then as i understand said captain servadac in whatever way or in whatever place the concus sion occurs we must be either crushed suffocated roasted or drowned is that your conclusion lieu tenant i confess i see no other alternative answered procope calmly but isnt there another thing to be done said ben zoof what do you mean his master asked why to get off the comet before the shock comes how could you get off gallia that i cant say replied the orderly i am not sure that that could not be accom plished said the lieutenant all eyes in a moment were riveted upon him as with his head resting on his hands he was mani festly cogitating a new idea yes i think it could be accomplished he repeated the project may appear extravagant but i do not know why it should be impossible ben zoof has hit the right nail on the head we must try and leave gallia before the shock leave gallia how said count timascheff the lieutenant did not at once reply he continued pondering for a time and at last said slowly and distinctly by making a balloon servadacs heart sank a balloon he exclaimed out of the ques tion balloons are exploded things you hardly find them in novels balloon indeed listen to me replied procope perhaps i can convince you that my idea is not so chimerical as you imagine and knitting his brow he proceed ed to establish the feasibility of his plan if we
