 amazing stories well then listen to me resumed the professor stiffly i presume you are taking it for granted that the gallian yearby which i mean the time in which gallia makes one revolution round the sun is equal in length to two terrestrial years they signified their assent and that year like every other year ought to be divided into twelve months yes certainly if you wish it said the captain acquiescing if i wish it exclaimed rosette nothing of the sort of course a year must have twelve months of course said the captain and how many days will make a month asked the professor i suppose sixty or sixtytwo as the case may be the days now are only half as long as they used to be answered the captain servadac dont be thoughtless cried rosette with all the petulant impatience of the old peda gogue if the days are only half as long as they were sixty of them cannot make up a twelfth part of gallias yearcannot be a month i suppose not replied the confused captain do you not see then continued the astronomer that if a gallian month is twice as long as a ter restrial month and a gallian day is only half as long as a terrestrial day there must be a hundred and twenty days in every month no doubt you are right professor said count timascheff but do you not think that the use of a new calendar such as this would practically be very troublesome not at all not at all i do not intend to use any other was the professors bluff reply after pondering for a few moments the captain spoke again according to this new calendar it isnt the middle of may at all it must now be some time in march yes said the professor today is the th of march it is the th day of the gallian year it corresponds with the d day of the terrestrial year you are quite correct it is the th of march strange muttered servadac and a month a terrestrial month thirty old days sixty new days hence it will be the th of march ha ha roared the captain this is logic with a vengeance the old professor had an undefined consciousness that his former pupil was laughing at him and as it was growing late he made an excuse that he had no more leisure the visitors accordingly quitted the observatory it must be owned that the revised calendar was left to the professors sole use and the colony was fairly puzzled whenever he referred to such unheard of dates as the th of april or the th of may according to the old calendar june had now ar rived and by the professors tables gallia during the month would have advanced leagues farther along its orbit and would have attained a distance of leagues from the sun the thermometer continued to fall the atmosphere re mained clear as heretofore the population per formed their daily avocations with systematic rou tine and almost the only thing that broke the mon otony of existence was an occasional visit from the blustering nervous little professor when some sudden fancy induced him to throw aside his as tronomical studies for a time and pay a visit to the common hall his arrival there was generally hailed as the precursor of a little season of excite ment somehow or other the conversation would eventually work its way round to the topic of a fu ture collision between the comet and the earth and in the same degree as this was a matter of sanguine anticipation to captain servadac and his friends it was a matter of aversion to the astrono mical enthusiast who had no desire to quit his present quarters in a sphere which being of his own discovery he could hardly have cared for more if it had been of his own creation the inter view would often terminate in a scene of consider able animation on the th of june old calendar the profes sor burst like a cannonball into the central hall where they were all assembled and without a word of salutation or of preface accosted the lieutenant in the way in which in earlier days he had been ac customed to speak to an idle schoolboy now lieutenant no evasions no shuffling tell me have you or have you not circumnavigated gallia the lieutenant drew himself up stiffly eva sions shufflings i am not accustomed sir he began in a tone evidencing no little resentment but catching a hint from the count he subdued his voice and simply said we have and may i ask continued the professor quite unaware of his previous discourtesy whether when you made your voyage you took any account of distances as approximately as i could replied the lieu tenant i did what i could by log and compass i was unable to take the altitude of sun or star at what result did you arrive what is the measurement of our equator i estimate the total circumference of the equa tor to be about miles ah said the professor more than half speak ing to himself a circumference of miles would give a diameter of about miles that would be approximately about onesixteenth of the diameter of the earth raising his voice he continued gentlemen in order to complete my account of my comet gallia i require to know its area its mass its volume its density its specific gravity since we know the diameter remarked the lieu tenant there can be no difficulty in finding its surface and its volume and did i say there was any difficulty asked the professor fiercely i have been able to reckon that ever since i was born cockadoodledoo cried ben zoof delighted at any opportunity to pay off his old grudge the professor looked at him but did not vouch safe a word addressing the captain he said now servadac take your paper and a pen and find me the surface of gallia with more submission than when he was a schoolboy the captain sat down and endeavored to recall the proper formula the surface of a sphere multiply circumfer ence by diameter
