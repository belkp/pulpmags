 amazing stories an oval glass at a view and turning the glass about to get at different aspects mr caves statements mr wace assures me were extremely circumstantial and entirely free from any of that emotional quality that taints hallucinatory impressions but it must be remem bered that all the efforts of mr wace to see with any similar clarity in the faint opalescence of the crystal were wholly unsuccessful try as he would the difference in intensity of the impressions re ceived by the two men was very great and it is quite conceivable that what was a view to mr cave was a mere blurred nebulosity to mr wace the view as mr cave described it was invari ably of an extensive plain and he seemed always to be looking at it from a considerable height as if from a tower or a mast to the east and to the west the plain was bounded at a remote distance by vast reddish cliffs which reminded him of those he had seen in some picture but what the picture was mr wace was unable to ascertain these cliffs passed north and southhe could tell the points of the compass by the stars that were visible of a night receding in an almost illimitable perspective and fading into the mists of the distance before they met he was nearer the eastern set of cliffs on the occasion of his first vision the sun was rising over them and black against the sunlight and pale against their shadow appeared a multitude of soar ing forms that mr cave regarded as birds a vast range of buildings spread below him he seemed to be looking down upon them and as they approached the blurred and refracted edge of the picture they became indistinct there were also trees curious in shape and in coloring a deep mossy green and an exquisite grey beside a wide and shining canal and something great and brilliantly colored flew across the picture but the first time mr cave saw these pictures he saw only in flashes his hands shook his head moved the vision came and went and grew foggy and indistinct and at first he had the greatest difficulty in finding the picture again once the direction of it was lost his next clear vision which came about a week after the first the interval having yielded nothing but tantalizing glimpses and some useful experi ence showed him the view down the length of the valley the view was different but he had a curious persuasion which his subsequent observations abundantly confirmed that he was regarding this strange world from exactly the same spot although he was looking in a different direction the long facade of the great building whose roof he had looked down upon before was now receding in per spective he recognized the roof in the front of the facade was a terrace of massive proportions and extraordinary length and down the middle of the terrace at certain intervals stood huge but very graceful masts bearing small shiny objects which reflected the setting sun the import of these small objects did not occur to mr cave until some time after as he was describing the scene to mr wace the terrace overhung a thicket of the most luxuriant and graceful vegetation and beyond this was a wide grassy lawn on which certain broad crea tures in form like beetles but enormously larger reposed beyond this again was a richly decorated causeway of pinkish stone and beyond that and lined with dense red weeds and passing up the val ley exactly parallel with the distant cliffs was a broad and mirrorlike expanse of water the air seemed full of squadrons of great birds manoeuvr ing in stately curves and across the river was a multitude of splendid buildings richly coloured and glittering with metallic tracery and facets among a forest of mosslike and lichenous trees and sud denly something flapped repeatedly across the vision like the fluttering of a jewelled fan or the beating of a wing and a face or rather the upper part of a face with very large eyes came as it were close to his own and as if on the other side of the crystal mr cave was so startled and so impressed by the absolute reality of these eyes that he drew his head back from the crystal to look behind it he had become so absorbed in watching that he was quite surprised to find himself in the cool darkness of his little shop with its familiar odor of methyl alcohol mustiness and decay and as he blinked about him the glowing crystal faded and went out such were the first general impressions of mr cave the story is curiously direct and circum stantial from the outset when the valley first flashed momentarily on his senses his imagination was strangely affected and as he began to appre ciate the details of the scene he saw his wonder rose to the point of a passion he went about his busi ness listless and distraught thinking only of the time when he should be able to return to his watch ing and then a few weeks after his first sight of the valley came the two customers the stress and excitement of their offer and the narrow escape of the crystal from sale as i have already told now while the thing was mr caves secret it remained a mere wonder a thing to creep to covert ly and peep at as a child might peep upon a for bidden garden but mr wace has for a young scientific investigator a particularly lucid and con secutive habit of mind directly the crystal and its story came to him and he had satisfied himself by seeing the phosphorescence with his own eyes that there really was a certain evidence for mr caves statements he proceeded to develop the mat ter systematically mr cave was only too eager to come and feast his eyes on this wonderland he saw and he came every night from halfpast eight until halfpast ten and sometimes in mr waces absence during the day on sunday afternoons also he came from the outset mr wace made copious notes and it was due to his scientific method that the relation between the direction from which the initiating ray entered the crystal and the orienta tion of the picture were proved and by cover ing the crystal in a box perforated only with a small aperture to admit the exciting ray and by sub stituting black holland for his buff blinds he greatly improved the conditions of the observations so that in a little while they were able to survey the valley in any direction they desired so having cleared the way we may give a brief account of this visionary world within the crystal the things were in all cases seen by mr cave and his method of working was invariably to watch the crystal and report what he saw while mr wace who as a science student had learned the trick of writing in the dark wrote a brief note of his re port when the crystal faded it was put into its box in the proper position and the electric light turned on mr wace asked questions and sug
