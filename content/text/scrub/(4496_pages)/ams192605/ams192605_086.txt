off on a comet the volcano showed no symptoms of resuming its activity for although a return of the eruption might have rendered their former resort again habitable any sudden outbreak would have been disastrous to them where they were the crater being the sole out let by which the burning lava could escape a wretched time we have had for the last seven months said the orderly one day to his master but what a comfort little nina has been to us all yes indeed replied servadac she is a charm ing little creature i hardly know how we should have got on without her what is to become of her when we arrive back at the earth not much fear ben zoof but that she will be well taken care of perhaps you and i had better adopt her ay yes assented the orderly you can be her father and i can be her mother servadac laughed then you and i shall be man and wife we have been as good as that for a long time observed ben zoof gravely by the beginning of october the temperature had so far moderated that it could scarcely be said to be intolerable the comets distance was scarcely three times as great from the sun as the earth from the sun so that the thermometer rarely sunk beyond ì§¸ below zero the whole party began to make al most daily visits to the hive and frequently pro ceeded to the shore where they resumed their skat ing exercise rejoicing in their recovered freedom like prisoners liberated from a dungeon whilst the rest were enjoying their recreation servadac and the count would hold long conversations with lieu tenant procope about their present position and fu ture prospects discussing all manner of speculations as to the results of the anticipated collision with the earth and wondering whether any measures could be devised for mitigating the violence of a shock which might be terrible in its consequences even if it did not entail a total annihilation of them selves there was no visitor to the hive more regular than rosette he had already directed his telescope to be moved back to his former observatory where as much as the cold would permit him he persisted in making his allabsorbing studies of the heavens the result of these studies no one ventured to in quire but it became generally noticed that some thing was very seriously disturbing the professors equanimity not only would he be seen toiling more frequently up the arduous way that lay between his nook below and his telescope above but he would be heard muttering in an angry tone that indicated considerable agitation one day as he was hurrying down to his study he met ben zoof who secretly entertaining a feel ing of delight at the professors manifest discomfi ture made some casual remark about things not being very straight the way in which his advance was received the good orderly never divulged but henceforward he maintained the firm conviction that there was something very much amiss up in the sky to servadac and his friends this continual dis quietude and illhumor on the part of the professor occasioned no little anxiety from what they asked could his dissatisfaction arise they could only conjecture that he had discovered some flaw in his reckonings and if this were so might there not be reason to apprehend that their anticipations of coming into contact with the earth at the settled time might all be falsified day followed day and still there was no cessation of the professors discomposure he was the most miserable of mortals if really his calculations and his observations were at variance this in a man of his irritable temperament would account for his perpetual perturbation but he entered into no ex planation he only climbed up to his telescope look ing haggard and distressed and when compelled by the frost to retire he would make his way back to his study more furious than ever at times he was heard giving vent to his vexation confound it what does it mean what is she doing all behind is newton a fool is the law of universal gravita tion the law of universal nonsense and the little man would seize his head in both hands and tear away at the scanty locks which he could ill afford to lose enough was overheard to confirm the suspicion that there was some irreconcilable discrepancy between the results of his computation and what he had actually observed and yet if he had been called upon to say he would have sooner insisted that there was derangement in the laws of celestial mechanism than have owned there was the least probability of error in any of his own calculations assuredly if the poor professor had had any flesh to lose he would have withered away to a shadow but this state of things was before long to come to an end on the th ben zoof who was hanging about outside the great hall of the cavern heard the professor inside utter a loud cry hurrying in to ascertain the cause he found rosette in a state of perfect frenzy in which ecstasy and rage seemed to be struggling for the predominance eureka eureka yelled the excited astronomer what in the name of peace do you mean bawled ben zoof in openmouthed amazement eureka again shrieked the little man how what where roared the bewildered orderly eureka i say repeated rosette and if you dont understand me you may go to the devil without availing himself of this polite invitation ben zoof betook himself to his master something has happened to the professor he said he is rushing about like a madman screeching and yell ing eureka eureka exclaimed servadac that means he has made a discovery and full of anxiety he hur ried off to meet the professor but however great was his desire to ascertain what this discovery implied his curiosity was not yet destined to be gratified the professor kept mut tering in incoherent phrases rascal he shall pay for it yet i will be even with him cheat thrown me out but he did not vouchsafe any reply to servadacs inquiries and withdrew to his study from that day rosette for some reason at pres ent incomprehensible quite altered his behavior to isaac hakkabut a man for whom he had always hitherto evinced the greatest repugnance and con tempt all at once he began to show a remarkable interest in the jew and his affairs paying several visits to the dark little storehouse making inquiries
