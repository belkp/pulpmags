 street amp smiths love story magazine toss a coin and take the conse quences all joking aside however although some people are inclined to look upon the timehonored honey moon custom as an upsetting ordeal many young couples feel it is the ideal way to begin married life most people feel that there is a rare sweetness and a feeling of ela tion in going away from the rest of the world if only for a short time on the other hand many young married couples would probably find just as much joy in marriage if they started housekeeping immediately after the wedding ceremony responsible jobs of course can not very well be left hanging in mid air but dont you think my dear that some one else could look after the more important details of your work until you returned if the responsibility of your job worries you perhaps you could go away for only two weeks or start in house keeping at once and make weekends your special kind of honeymoon holiday dear mrs brown at nineteen when i was a telegraph messenger boy i started going with a girl of sixteen i worked my self up until at twentyone i became a commercial telegraph operator the salary was good and i thought i was old enough to get married i proposed to my girl friend and was accepted the position i held however was a little too heavy for one of my short experience and the consequences were that i worried about it so much that i was obliged to give it up this of course changed all my plans regarding marriage and i de cided to try my luck in a distant state through a misunderstanding in our let ters my sweetheart and i broke our en gagement and we both started going out with other friends when i returned home a year later i met her again and some how we made up for a year everything ran smoothly although i was not working steadily and we couldnt get married a few weeks ago my fiancee went visit ing out of town and having nothing bet ter to do i went to a skating rink where i met a girl with whom i think i fell in love recently this girl admitted that she cared for me and has offered to give up all her other boy friends if i would break my engagement but how can i do that mrs brown i know that my fiancee loves me and i would hate to hurt her the question is should i break off with her and take a chance on wrecking our lives or would that be too selfish i am still very fond of my fiancăše and will always consider her a very fine person we might marry and i could try to make her happy but do you think that it would work out my new girl friend doesnt care whether i have a job or not she says that my future prospects make no difference in her affection for me i have tried to find out how my fiancee would feel if we were to break up again but she wouldnt even dis cuss it dont you think that she would forget me in time i feel sure that your opinion will be of great value to me steve as an engaged man no matter what the circumstances you are not being fair to your fiancee if you date another girl if you are very sure that you no longer care for the girl youre en gaged to it would be nothing less than sheer folly to go ahead with the marriage better to hurt her now than let her gradually realize that she does not possess your love it is tragic when after a fiveyear courtship a young couple are nearer a breaking point than the consum mation of their hopes and dreams on the other hand if you take stock and try to analyze your emo tions as well as your mental atti tude you may find that what seems to be love is merely the kind of mutual attraction that often springs up without the slightest warning between two young people whose tastes are mutual i suggest that you stop seeing this other girl for a few months before you take any serious steps toward breaking your engagement
