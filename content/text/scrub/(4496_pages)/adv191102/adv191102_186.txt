the mahogany garden across the beach ridge that barricaded the sea from the dried marsh the rows were twenty feet apart in the firmest part of the ridge the masons and carpenters were building a wooden sluicegate set in stone blocks its lowest level was lowwater mark the shovelers were at work taking out the sand on the landward side of the gate as they had taken out all but a small part on the seaward side to a level three feet below highwater mark do you mean you are really going to try to do a thing like that haskell wait just half an hour and see the tide is coming up now and he left the enthusiastic youngster to marshal more men on the landward wtork peters watched the tide creep up to near the threefoot sub level and then he saw haskell coming back taking a shovel from a workman as he came open the gates and lash them cried the engineer and he watched the water narrowiy as the gates were made ready then wading in at the edge of the water he threw a narrow channel through the slender sand barrier and saw the first rush of the seawater through the canal which was still twothirds choked with sand steadily the speed and volume of the rivulet grew as the tide increased one foot wide two feet wide four feet widemore and more the seawater rushing inland dug down and sideways into the sand and a yel low sandladen boiling flood tumbled into the nearest reaches of the marsh spreading the sand ripped out from between the piling over a wide area then at last the tide was at maximum and began to ebb in half an hour the water that had flowed in with a mad rush came out with decreased volume and by the middle of the afternoon the canal stood revealed two rows of glistening piling with every grain of sand and soil washed out down to lowwater level now haskell ordered the gates closed and all cracks sealed for the time being inland the floor of the marsh as far as could be seen was covered with a coating of wet sand that would not interfere with the lumbering in the least when dried but would make a far cleaner and better foundation than the salt peat of the bog when he understood the whole thing the younger man clapped an arm around the elder and said how i would like to see uncle john watching this he would have four joy spasms a minute it is great haskell it is great he is wondering just about now what i wtant with twenty saws to work from barges twenty donkeyengines to run them three towboats and everything needed to get the lumber in the water trim the logs get them through the canal and tow them in rafts to steamerside to be heaved inboard didnt you explain how you were going to do it no john peters doesnt want expla nations before or after great guns haskell that must mean a forty per cent saving fob nearer sixty jack on thirty mileslet me see his voice trailed off to a murmured following of his mental calculation till suddenly he clutch ed haskell by the arm and said almost aghast why man alive that means thirty million dollars about forty million lad when we figure the saving in getting out the timber farther inland by dredging a fivefoot canal on from the inland watermark but we are not through yet lad i thought it wise to put an order for one hundred rifles with three hundred rounds each in the requisi tion and i am sorry from something i saw last night that i did not order them shipped by special steamer from kingston you saw something last night yes some time about midnight juan waked me and i ran to the window just in time to see two men drop into the dry side of the canal after inspecting the gate and sneak off inland two white men no two mayas and both were armed rifle pistol and knife peters whistled significantly and then asked well what are you going to do about it just this i am going to leave you in camp tomorrow and i want you to trench both sides of the ridge to defend the gate and to start a timber stockade north side of the camptimbers that will stop high velocity subcaliber bullets have the masons build a tank that will hold a thou sand gallons of water and put it under cover then dig a cellar in the sand lined with masonry that will hold three or four boat loads of provisions i am going upshore for provisions all the arms in the village and all the fresh water i can float back
