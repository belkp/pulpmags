 adventure on the surface of it like a flaw in a big ruby the shiny end of a dirk handle he looked harder way down slowly coming out of the moraine was a hand a white hand stiff like it was made of ivory reaching out to the knife and blood then the storm shut in and he grabbed his head again for he was seeing red he swore the body moved was alive and fight ing to get up at himthis beast that had grafted like a fungus on the body of the girl he loved let gail at him first he must have dug with his fingernails or knife down through the rotting ice for he remembers yanking it by the feet ripping it out of the case it fitted so nicely next he knew he was blind and choking fighting for air like a rat in a pitcrazy to rise and breathe he must trample what was under him and so fighting and stamping he struggled up through the snow youve never killed a manno never lost your temper shot at him and missed yes well then you know how you feel on the rebound youre as meek as you were angry as scared and pitiful as you were dancingred and gail had the winter madness hadnt he and a grudge that may well make a monster of a man for good he remembers sitting in the snow looking at the body and thinking now im even i done my jobthe duty o my nature and the old coward stuck you from behind too you cuss poor fool you knew no better and youâťlooked like a good siwash i done this for you girl for you god help me but i love you you see gail was still mad to talk like that but could he help it ive never been in love i dont know how crazy it can make you a queer thinglove he started to crawl back to her in the cabin up out of the snowcones he was weak as broth and the blizzard was spouting drifts cutting his neck in sheets of snow before he got to the edge of the moraine the drowsiness strangled him and he lost hold upon his head it must have been before the storm broke that i saw the light of their cabin from down on the tundra when that science outfit had reached hope city again they reported having lost gail i was working in the store for his father and so got their dogteam we knew that when gail couldnt find that outfit hed hit for the mountains and whatever of him was left would lie along the face of the hills to be found by hitting northeast from the head of the south fork it was a bad trip alone breaking trail and two of the dogs died which is neither here nor there somehow i knew it was his cabin before i opened the door i found the girl still senseless on the floor when i brought her to it was pitiful the things she said stum bling to the window pointing out and wailing gails name i hunted an hour before i found him and was nearly all night bringing him to i try to forget the next few days before we hit out for the tanana gail and the girl would talk to me as if their hearts would break but not a word to each other i learned all perhaps i wouldnt have acted as i did if id been wise at first they both looked like creatures hid in a caveive seldom seen beings farther gone from scurvy the storm cleared the third day and i shot a caribou you know how meat cleans the blood and a new face clears the foolish ness from two wintering alone in the white darkness on the dark snow but no miner will tell you that all gails coarse work was foolish ought i to recon cile them i guess not gail was my part ner and the living taint was still with us but maybe no degradation is too low not to have its redemption and if your hands be put to blood doing of the ugly job may win iti dont know happiness is hard to choke when youve suffered for it each hardly moved from his sled the three weeks going out till we hit the tanana camps the first night living in the record ers tent i saw gail and her talking that was enough for me i took a job of burning up on the creeks and lit out when i came back in the spring the recorder said theyd left for down river almost at once i had never told him after the breakup the first steamer from st michaels brought me a letter i opened it before i knew it was from her perhaps i would have anyway it said that she and gail were leaving for the states for good because they couldnt face any of us in the north any more gail seems to be losing his memory of all that happened should i remind him i cantl well if he doesbut in the states they may look at things differently and some times i still think of gail as my partner
