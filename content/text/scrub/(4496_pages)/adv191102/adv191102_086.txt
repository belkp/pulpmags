a samaritan of the riverine men with a paltry ten thousand sheep or sohad cut out early and the clip of these small men came to the tilpa and filled the barge fairly well and this fact served to cheer the supercargo and the mate they would not be able to trade very much be cause the store was almost empty but they could get woolloading in early so that they would be ready to race to the market on the rise when it did come but they felt uneasy for all that simply because all the life of the stream seemed uneasy also the rats began to leave the river and scurry up the banks and on to the plains every day saw an exodus of rabbits and then there came that leaden hush of every thing which precedes any unusual occur rence in nature the river did not seem to ripple as it struck the floats of the tilpas wheels and the ducks flew away from their natural home the screaming cockatoos screamed no more and flew south instead of west as usual the gum leaves murmured not the air was heavy with suppressed feareven the birds of the month the para keets which were merely animated shrieks in a dress of emerald and crimson flying athwart the gold of the sun were strangely mute the whole earth seemed to hold its breath so that it might not sigh the appre hension which filled it and stephen been noting these signs stretched a wire cable from the towing frame of the tilpa to the great eucalypt growing in the billabong inside the southern bank and the engine rusted by its long rest drove the steamer to an opening in the tree fringe just abeam of the anchoring gum they prepared in short with the impudent daring of man for a standing fight with an inundation they saw no man belonging to the land they were as much alone as if the river had been a trackless sea no news of the flood had come to them they blamed bourke for not having sent warnings but bourke itself was wrestling despairingly with the water giant the founders of the town have built it in the shorter parallel of a horseshoe bend just where the river can do its greatest most destructive work while the people of the tilpa grew sick with anxiety bourke was up to its armpits in waterbourke was disheveled and drunken with the flood it came to the tilpa in a wall of water and wreckagea wall of water that broke and reformed and fell upon itself with the sound of thunder a wall that tore patriarchal trees from their roots and hurled them along like matches a wall that hissed like a great serpent and gathered and crushed the face of the world in its constricting folds it came with the batteringrams of trees of wreckage covered with snakes and other creeping things huddled together like friends their venom sapped by fear as the tilpa and her barge rose with the flood the crew hauled on the cable and started the engines and so byandby drew the steamer and her charge up to the tree which the mate said would stand forty floods but at three oclock the next morning when the rain was falling in sheets the mate recanted the fastening of the cable dis appeared the water crept into the limbs of the tree and shook it till it groaned and still they held on in midcurrent the water was black with timber and living trees rafts of debris car rying hopeless animalsopossums swooning with fear bears wailing like little children lost in the streets of a great city at four oclock they heard a steamers whistle shrieking above the roar of the water and a few minutes later a woolladen barge shot past them then followed a steamer her red lights tinging the water as with blood her stack vomiting sparks the men on the tilpa could see that one wheel had been carried away by the battering of wreckage very probably the rudder had gone also and she was attempting to steer out of the cur rent with the remaining wheel it was the warrego she had ridden from louth on the face of the flood the warrego disappeared then came more wreckage the flood drew back for an effort advanced again and passed tri umphant carrying with it the tilpas barge and âł worth of the seasons clip just after daylight the savior eucalypt was torn from the soil stephen been sprang to the towingframe and cut the cable with two lightning strokes of the axe and the tilpa went full speed ahead steering south on to the plain which was now a sea any one of these logs that came down with the current like stones from a sling would sink the steamer in an instant and they tried to make for the dead water but it took time to leave the current its force was so great that the helm answered spas
