 adventure came and they could draw enough grub on handsleds to reach the tanana but the day the cabin was finished the two men left her without a word she tracked them up the glacier to the edge of a crevice there the snow was all beaten down and no tracks went farther they was good friends the boy asked frowninghad had no words between them prospectors dont fall like rocks into crevices what reason had they to quit you they took no grub if theyve left you here to starve by god no no she told him quickly theres a years grub for three in the cabin but their guns are with them bad enough without that too said gail thoughtful and you was the last seen them alive what suspicions have you she studied him awhile and answered i couldnt tell you why they went up there to die even if i knew dont ask me never never talk of this again i beg you and she began to cry gail started to speak but she was hitting back toward the cabin and he followed her gail knew nothing of good wo men having seen none and with the buckskintrousered sort that sell whis ky from sled and saddle he had never im proved his chances yet what you might call instinct told him that the girls weath ered little face was pure and he must treat her like she was his sister he did though for a week they hardly spoke she put him off when he tried to cheer her seeming so taken up with thought of the dead she cooked and gail built himself a bed and shelter with logs and slabs left over from the dead mens carpentering he knew that before they sledded out they must live as if they were alone on the moon seeing no eyes but their own each hearing the pitch of no other voice he knew his veins were young and his blood warm that she was young too and in dis tress but he was the sort that thought more than he ever said and at first he fell in the icewhat she knew about it and did no more than wonder how the men wouldnt tell so as they ate or playing piquet by the slushlamp at nights they would just re mark on their tally or how low the sour dough was in the box and if she softened as she looked across the table at gail and those high cheekbones and that snow tanned skin of his she never showed it by one blush nor did gail let on so he said how the widows peak on her rumpled fore head where the hair grew low seemed each day to belong to a different woman whom he must learn to know and respect and be decent to all over again he had never been in love he was only half sure what love was but what man needs to be taught so he began to be happy just thinking of the wait with her till snow came it seemed that two young ones like them couldnt help being drawn together all his life up to date became a blankthe fake stampedes hed all but died on rows with squawmenand he forgot the mystery why her folks died and overlooked her loyalty to them and what shed said about staying near the glacier till the bodies should come out only for fear of scurvy he would have looked forward to living there with her the long winter through though he knew that the white darkness and the dark snow and the stillness like the inside of a glacier cave arent good for the minds of two strong men but he never even saw the chance of this since with no guns and no fresh meat scurvy was sure to take them so he built sleds and snow shoes for the trip out and hauled wood from the timber to keep the stove going meantime october had come the first snow sugared the hills melting fast so that they looked like polished jet it was a night about the middle of the month that gail saw the first sign of her sorrows letting up their hands did no more than touch over the cards after supper gail said hers burned him and she was slow in drawing back her fingers out of his and turned her head away that was all but he jumped up excited and walked up and clown the floor some photographs had been tacked in a sort of oval to the logs over the red blan kets of her boxboard bed one he had always noted was of a big siwash buck he stopped before them and only half knowing what was in his mind he said good face that siwash has you think so she answered him and her voice seemed to come from miles and miles away i think so too
