 adventure lagoon tempted to this step at any rate a flagstaff was planted sheds were put up for the good australian anthracite and pro vision was made for a resident keeper most of the coal is still there the flag still flies and the keeper is visited by a gunboat once in four or five months but the same keeper seldom sees many visits of the ship coulson accepted the berth because he had played the prodigal son in melbourne and sydney and had come to the end of even his husks he knew it would be lonely but he did not think he would mind he would have time for meditation and for reading he had always had a great idea of improv ing his mind and he packed in his chest a history of europe in seventeen volumes green cloth gilt which he had got from a man who owed him thirty pounds it was a ten days run from sydney they set down his chest in the galvanizediron house on the beach and coulson saw the steamer evaporate into a smudge of smoke on the glittering horizon turning to look round he could see almost the whole extent of his domain the clustered palms rustled unceasingly in the wind with the flagstaff standing bare among them and the ugly heaps of coal below the surf circled him rhythmically with its monotonous ssfl oras h sshcrash sky and sea were as empty and shining as twin silver mirrors and between the double immensities the island seemed like a speck under the glaring lens of a great microscope thus began the strangest period of coul sons life at first he found it as peaceful and pleasant as he had anticipated he bathed in the surf he fished from a canoe he looked for pearls he read his history of europe to the middle of the first volume and then marked the place in case he should ever want to come back to it the atmos phere of the island was not favorable to hard reading but he discoveredthat there was a mild amusement to be derived from solitaire games of euchre and sevenup his right hand against his left he played checkers in the same way and tried chess but gave it up it was too much like trying to lift oneself by ones bootstraps it was a foregone conclusion that this could not last only a saint or an idiot can endure solitude it is said and coulson was neither he had been there about a month when the sudden sense of his hideous isola tion struck him like a thunderbolt from a clear sky a vivid picture flashed through his mind of the roaring streets of sydney of the theaters the cafes the bars where he met a friend at every turn and as he looked over the cloudless circle of untroubled sea a sick horror of the place came upon him an overpowering terror of the sky and the water of everything that was so beautiful and so unhuman so that he crept back trembling into his little bungalow with the sweat streaming down his face for a timehe could never have told how longcoulson scarcely ate or slept he tramped the beaches he paddled far out to sea trying mechanically to find relief in fatigue and finding none all day the great blue circles glared at him unwinkingly mockingly he hated them at night the blues were merely three shades darker and fired with incandescent planets and he loathed them and day and night the merciless pulse of the surf beat like a swing ing pendulum in his brain he could never get beyond hearing of that sound it was the very voice of the solitude at mo ments it seemed that he could endure no more and he would fling himself down and sob and curse in rage and loneliness but this period of torment wore it self out his nerves became dulled and coulson regained a little of his old equanimity it was not the same however the almost narcotic peace of the first days was gone and he found himself sinking into a black melancholia never had he been so conscious with a strange terror of the omnipotent forces around him the wind in the palms seemed to murmur threats or warnings sky and sea were full of menace and he watched the revolution of the days with suspicion he felt certain that disastrous events of some sort were about to take place and his heart was filled with a sullen bitterness against the men who had exiled him on this reef to be the play thing of these invisible powers this state of nervous expectancy lasted for weeks but nothing happened now and again to relieve the strain he resumed his games of cards his right hand against his left and it was through this amusement that he came to his great discovery in these highly introspective games he always identified himself with his left hand the cards he dealt to the right he considered as those of his opponent and he could not
