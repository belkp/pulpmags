the flies in amber come out on top yet we know just how good a siwash is hes a hero at facing danger has christian honesty till we corrupt him and weve all fought his battles against the blows and sneers of chechawkos our respect for him in his place is as big as our hate of him out of it for a squaws father and brothers are beasts too when a white man rules their shack the beach knew that i had been gail cressets partner and had found him in a bad way some winters before in a valley of the tordrillo mountains which rise out of the kuskokwim tundras six hundred miles inland from sourdough but no details how or why out of respect for gail and the other person concerned i had never told everything but as both were then out of alaska for good their interests couldnt be prejudiced by a clean breast gail at that time was a cleanskinned boy of twenty born in alaska who had taken his medicine with starving rations and win tering alone he hired out for the summer as horserustier to a scientific outfit going to explore the kuskokwim their cayuses fought mudholes and mosquitoes for two months till one morning in late august a pinto mare backtrailed from camp gail started to track her and though no man was cuter to the tricks of the tundra it fooled him as it has others as wise lost he was and with no gun he prowled about three weeks the yellow moss sucking away strength and courage sour blueberries cheating him with hopes of surviving till he felt he was starving not being hungry any more specks would float before his eyes which he knew were caribou prancing in the distance and he would wave a hand at them and laugh as a man does when hes flattered one day he came out of the timber across four miles of moss and ponds rose the foothills in a string of shiny black cones and there perched in a valley over the gray thumb of a glacier coming down from the big peaks behind was a cabin with smoke rising from it on he crawled over the stones of the river boiling out of the ice to find the shack new and fitted up for three prospectors but empty staring empty still he got at a pan of bread on a bench brewed tea and when he felt himself again explored about outside he saw footprints in the moss and followed them back along the shelf above where the glacier is just a hell of gravel cones and soon the sight of a human figure stopped him as he ran it was a woman bending over in a ragged coat in one hand she held a narrow white band in the other a thick disk always facing the ice so that gail saw only her back she walked slowly toward him from the edge of a pond every moment she stooped paying out the tapeline measur ing the moss yard by yard and when she reached the boulder by his side she stood up straight and bareheaded her black hair scattered over her shoulders and shading her eyes gazed out on the glacier throwing forward an arm as if to choose some object there gail choked his wonder and remarked in his quiet way that he guessed that his car cass was the first shed ever saved the life of she dropped her reel and grew stiff to the muscles of her neck she told him to go away get out quick but he had begun his hard luck story so she listened and lie saw the fear die away from her eyes till she cut in and said no pity here and sighed when he was done she brightened up then you must be a scientist so you can tell me how fast do glaciers move gail gave her that queer gentle smile of his and said she had him bad but that hed heard them saynodding to his outfit down in the timberthat some glaciers move thirty feet a day some forty and faster in the middle ive been measuring she went on pointing to a boulder that hung at a tick lish angle from a cone of ice that rock out yonder was thirty feet nearer the moun tain yesterday and that would mean that by next march the bodies look y here whose bodies cut in he solemnly my husband and my father are buried in that glacier down in the ice like flies in amber she told him flies in amber and im waiting here for the ice to give up its deaduntil they come out at the moraine so i can give them a decent burial i will wait forever if i must gail stared at her and whistled being such a savage then with a warmth in his heart he never felt before he seized her hand and said poor girl and asked her why the men fell in she told him how the three of them had prospected along the face of the range how flies had killed their horses forcing them to camp till snow
