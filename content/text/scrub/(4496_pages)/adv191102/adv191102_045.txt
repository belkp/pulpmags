 adventure that hurt the savage in him just too much so he struck back you aint told me yet the whole truth about how them bodies died he said quietlike from way down in his stomach youre the last seen them alive theres law even in this land you stay in here and scurvy or no i stay here too she saw those brown eyes of his shake and her mouth took in one long breath oh oh she gasped you think i killed them i then what for else did you try to drown yourself he said when i asked you about your husband she looked him in the eye and told him that he had the reason wrong and i dont mean it he laughed you know i dont but if you had killed them id love you just the same then he sobered and said itll be a devilish winter with you half crazy for these dead ones pretending your love for me is hate with me burning for youand the cold and stillness settling on our minds god cant hold us to account for what we do but she had run away back toward the cabin from there on the moraine you can see the river twist away in tangles and small coils on its big bed where the boulders are round and white and stained with a moss thats red as blood then twist to where the woods touch the tundra and are purple like a cloud gail stood awhile then looked up the dumb ice avenue growing white and still under the night cloud and the stee ples of the hills that rose clean from the black drift through air cold and heady as it is in autumn looked down on him and his heart pounded on flushing him hot with love and shame curse me for speaking that wtay he said aloud forgive me girli love you so we got to live it out the best we can and keep a hold upon ourselves but he was thinking too of that winter sky so like brass it seems you can sound it with a stone and the one cloud on it no bigger than your hand that doesnt move once in a month you dont act and think then as if you wrere on earth you dont think you are on earth the threads in your brain stretch till they breakand you dont know whalt you do your partner takes a spare spoonful of sugar and you flare up and maybewell only listen snow fell to stay before november gail held himself in better than he anticipated and her seeming devotion to a memory de fied his living love he couldnt persuade her to sled out and when he wrould ask forgiveness for calling her a murderess she fled away from him there wtas no more touching of hands things went on as before she tried to drown herself he got to be simply happy again at being in her presence over the meals and at cards it grew to be january there lay the cabin a dot in the white darkness on the dark snow the jet hills white and fluffy the hellish moraine soft and rumpled like a bedspread the pothole frozen as if it were a mound of slag glass clean and even the glacier swept back to the big mountains wthere it hung on cliffs that seemed to be lace from window curtains though three sheer miles high and snow whipping in smoke from the top so the cold and still ness covered them like an ocean as may be at the north pole on the planet jupiter and though the sky wras brass and from ten to three oclock the sun burned a curve through it low over the mean timber in the south gail felt no need to throw a stone at it he got todoubt all he had heardand knew himselfof the strain of winter on your mind of sure scurvy without fresh meat though every morning he searched his legs for the stains that are its first signs and exercised regularly hauling wood often taking the girl with him living seemed to have got on a dead center of course it couldnt last it was the dead center of a boys top asleepquietest before it breaks loose and reels crazy thats always the way with the winter madness like the skin stains it gets into you when you think its the last thing likely in the world and the longest calm leads to the fiercest outburst some telling little things happened which gail ought to have noticed and didnt first he began to worry again over why the girl had tried to kill herself then the mystery of how her folks got in the glacier kept him awrake nightsreckoning the day when theyd come out if the ice moved at the rate of thirty feet which she said once she had proved it did he would count over the few times their names had been mentioned one day while checking over the grubsacks he saw a tag hanging
