 adventure selim was no mohammedan teetotaler he gulped down his brandy with as much zest and as little water as any christian toper in all tetino and got drunk as often his desire to justify an irrepressible craving had taken the form of a sort of fixed idea that brandy cleared his brain when he wanted to be alert and snappy in his move ments and this fixed idea persisted in spite of abundant proof of many a sad experience to the contrary so when stanko returned from his cellar selim effendi for a moment forgot the object of his journey to livady having shaken himself up a little bit the effendi looked about the place a younker evidently stankos apprentice in the ton sorial art was lathering some ones face apparently dozing on the divan however his face turned toward the window was a priest in a cassock the beard was flowing enough at the sound of selims voice the priest had sleepily turned toward him and halfopened his eyes then turned back and dropped into a doze again iii not in selim effendis most opti mistic dreams had it occurred to him that he would stumble upon the apostle napping the moment he entered stankos precincts now the tipsy bloodhound was no fool and he knew that apostle boyan had equally little claim to membership in the category of idiots that a man who knew himself to be so fiercely hounded should be so reckless as to indulge in the luxury of a public nap was hard to explain on any other supposition than perhaps complete physical and mental exhaustion but was he really asleep for the one hasty glance the apparently dozing priest had given him before resuming his slumbers was far too keen and intelligent for a man just dis turbed in his nap the entire situation flashed on selim the apostle was on the watch for his man from poliany and was simulating sleepiness in order to avoid unnecessary and unde sirable conversations with other parties evidently he had full faith in the complete ness of his incognito the turkish police might be on the lookout for him in tetino in places like dedov rid and poliany where comitajis were plenty but not in a char coalhole like livady you ubiquitous rascal selim thought if you only knew that your messenger is starving in my cellar this minute and that a copy of your letter to robespierre is in my pocket he sat down on the divan next to the priestlyclad figure and absorb ing stankos intoxicants to thaw his blood beat his brains to hatch out some scheme of making sure of the apostle selim effendi had come to livady in the guise of an ikondealer the choice of this particular form of disguise had suggested itself by the disguise dictated by the apos tle himself in his letter to the poliany school master for it seemed to him that an ikon dealer had natural claims on the attention of a man in cassock and once he could get at his man without exciting suspicion he could trust his twelveshotstraight revolver and the steel grip of osmans paw a plan was slowly assuming definite shape in his minda plan that appealed to se lims sense of humor besides being safe and effective he had stanko move the mangal to the corner of the room nearer the barber shop where he could look into the street and seating himself a la urque on a cushion in front of it went on sipping at his brandy and looking out of the low grimy window then his eyes turned to the st george killing the dragon which beautified the corner diagonally opposite innkeeper he asked who is that half naked bully thats trying to tickle a lizard with his goad in your picture over there halfnaked bully tickling a lizard good lord deliver us poor sinners stanko began crossing himself piously be you a catholic or an unbeliever traveler that you dont recognize st george and the dragon st george of all saints sir oh it is st george killing the dragon eh well now innkeeper i meant no harm by my question but my eyes are giving out and i just couldnt tell what it stood for the st georges i sell to be sure are a dif ferent matter you can tell my st georges at a hundred paces so tis an ikonpedler you be traveler stanko inquired an ikonmerchant right you have it my brother is the archdeacon of the st panteleimon monastery in the holy athos his hermits paint those ikons between mid night and sunrise and every blessed one is blessed with holywater from the fountain
