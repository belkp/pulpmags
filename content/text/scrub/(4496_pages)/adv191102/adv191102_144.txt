the strangler it was that deadest of all dead and lifeless periods two oclock in the morning some where near at hand a rooster flopped his wings and crowed raucously id like to have a hind leg of you fried the strangler grumbled as he finished unla cing the second of his shoes and pulled it off with a jerk i could pretty near get it down raw with the feathers on thats the old bucks house all right ill go in by that half windowthe pantry or maybe a bath room he straightened up and walked across the dewy turf pausing below the open window just long enough to look back and to listen for any sound from within or without the world was as still as it could have been before the first sunrise however and with an easy movement blondie reached up hooked his hands over the sill and lifted himself till he was staring into the darkness of the room beyond cautiously he slid through and felt the cool touch of polished wood beneath his bare feet in his earlier years before he became a garroter blondie had done work of this kind the memory of old times came to him now and he worked with the poise and mas tery of a thorough tradesman he found the door and let himself into a corridor then felt his way forward touching doors on each side and stopping at the end of the passage to consider he had kept his turnings and advances straight in mind and knew exactly where he was in relation to the outer lines of the building also he knew where he was according to a sketch which his em ployer had drawn for him he listened attentively again then grasped the knob of the door before him drew it firmly toward him and turned it quickly to avoid any chance squeaks or quavers with the same swift motion he shoved the door open and was standing inside the room at the end of the passage straggling blue rays from a distant arc light were reflected from rows of bottles and scattered articles of glass and metal on benches about the wall and by this uncer tain light blondie made out that he had entered a large room fitted up as a labora tory from it there opened at the side farthest from the strangler a smaller room toward this he headed this is going to be chickenpie for me he mumbled ten thousand plunkssay ill buy a buzzwagon n ill ride around below the line n show em how to hit her up ill cheered almost intoxicated by thoughts of his own coming grandeur blondie was nevertheless alert enough to hear a stealthy sound near him he whirled jerking up one arm automatically to fend off a possible blow aimed at his head or face at the same instant he became conscious of some thing tightening about his chest binding one arm firmly to his side and biting and burning into his flesh till he cried out in agony he realized that a noose had settled over him and that he was being lifted from the floor next moment the room was filled with blinding blue light and as the strangler spun slowly about like some great bird trussed before a fire he saw a tall old man dancing about in imminent danger of falling from a gallery near the ceiling so ho my birdmy fishmy dainty gazelle i have you fast and safe at the first shot dont pluck at the rope my beauty for its made of steel fibers carefully tem pered ill let you down after ive looked you over blondie caught fleeting glimpses of him stalking along the gallery and down the narrow stairs at the end then the old man was standing beside him he was a tall lean whitehaired old man garbed in some nondescript nightgarment in two pieces and bound about the waist with a doubled strand of cord the stran gler took in these details one at a time as he slowed to a standstill and hung swaying his captor was looking him over with his head tipped back and his thin highbridged nose apparently ready to peck at blondie like an eagles beak what did you come here for the old man demanded suddenly blondie stared at him with a sort of fas cination that bound his tongue and held him almost hypnotized the feeling had come over him that the old man was a dream that this whole night of vicissitudes and misadventures was a series of very evil nightmares caused by dope in his drink or too much free lunch a glint of anger kindled in the old mans eyes and he whirled about and strode away he refuses to talk the strangler heard him muttering well i have a cure for thathe shall experience the exquisite torture
