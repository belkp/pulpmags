 my road to the stars hopes to discard it sold a scenario to the famous films and has an order for another shall i stick around for a minute everything whirled be fore my eyes but i quickly pulled my self together thanks eddie i said but it isnt necessarywith ted bromley thought you might like me to drive you home not tonight i wanted to get rid of him i had no great hopes from this first meeting with ted but i could not go from it to another man where is mr bromley saw him talking to the chief a min ute ago oh there he is i followed the direction of his glance and saw a man in a gray suit limping toward us eddie rolfe melted away and i stood still waiting until ted bromley should join me as he came closer i could see that he was thinner than of old paler but there was complete sanity in his hazel eyes and a forward thrust to his clear cut chin this was what i had wanted more than anything else in the world i reminded myself but somehow it didnt make me happy as it should have done he held out his hand words are poor things to express thanks for what you did for me pam i shall go on being grateful to you all my life he said his tones were deeper than formerly and an under current of sadness ran through them i lifted my eyes to his and i read the death sentence to my hopes he brought me gratitudeand nothing more i wish you wouldnt feel that way about it i owe you my chance here so i think that ought to wipe the slate clean between us i answered brightly a faint personal interest showed in his eyes i knew youd make good and i dont need to tell you im glad i hear great things of youyoure selling scenarios im not fit for the road with my game left leg so i might as well use my time somehow youre looking fine like it over here yes but i miss peter gunning hes the best ever well youre anxious to be out of your costume and on your waywe were walking towards the studio may i take you home he was trying to be polite and i could not bear it its not necessary i told him curtly but he would not have it that way were friends arent we pam i nodded if that was all he wanted i would accept he walked with me to the entrance and left me at the end of the corridor that led to my room and said he would wait while i changed into street clothes as i unfastened my frock with fingers that trembled i thought how dear he looked more of a man than i remembered him he had touched the depths and emerged better and stronger and i had had my share in that surely that knowledge was its own reward i had on my street suit but my hair was still down preparatory to doing it up again and it fell in a cloud about my shoulders i glanced into the mirror and then i stiffened with unreasoning horror as i saw the door between my room and the next open slowly and a mans form block the doorway it was bryam hogan and he came swiftly toward me
