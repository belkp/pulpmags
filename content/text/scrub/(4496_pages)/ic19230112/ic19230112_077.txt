 my road to the stars bromley was operated upon today chief and hes going to get well no good reason as far as i can see for you and miss crowell to be embrac ing you know i wont stand for that sort of thing between my actresses and their directors peter gunning had been a high priced director when bryam hogan was still making soap and i wondered how he would take the insult hurled at him in this fashion he answered no i suppose you think yourself entitled to a monopoly on that sort of thing hogans temper blazed up his fists were readier than his tongue and now he lunged out and struck with terrific force i expected to see peter gunning crumple under such a blow but to my surprise he got to his feet the next moment they were fighting like mad i screamed my overwrought nerves could not stand the sight and the next moment the tiny office was crowded with onlookers hogan and gunning were separated but not pacified come on outside and well finish this gunning was breathing heav ily one eye was closed but he was eager to continue the fight hogan seemed to have enough well settle it in my office he re torted this will cost you your job not necessarily nothing in my contract about personal rows but im leaving when my year is updont care for the atmosphere here sallie pushed through the group of men she had a bottle of witch hazel in her hand and a towel first aid she cried one of the other girls took me away and after a time sallie came to me there i was lying in an easy chair my head throbbing and my thoughts confused but sallie helped me to dress and called a taxi to take us to the ferry on the way down i pulled myself to gether and asked will pete really lose his job lord no sallie returned cheer fully whats a black eye or two in a studio but pete is leaving anyway when his contract expires and i shouldnt wonder if he took us with him im for pete every day in the week i was too and i hastened to say it the news from the hospital con tinued hopeful but of course they wouldnt let any of us see ted at the studio work went on without any reference to the fight but the next afternoon as i was leaving i passed by the anteroom to hogans office and the door was open hogan was inside and he called to me i had to stop and obey a rather per emptory summons to step in i had seen the chiefs den before but a glance around made me realize the room looked singularly empty glorias pictures had all disappeared the ones that had hung on the walls and those on the desk even the colored photographs mounted in silver were gone perhaps her rumored desire to become the next mrs hogan had found no echo in the chiefs wishes hogan was sitting in front of his desk he motioned me to a chair i preferred to stand to make the inter view as brief as possible but that was not his plan before i realized his intention he had reached out swung me up on the flat topped table before him and held me there with his hands clinching my shoulder
