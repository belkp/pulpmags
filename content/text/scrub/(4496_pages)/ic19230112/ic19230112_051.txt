the price of a flophouse bunk told by a downandout eagerly a newspaper is caught up and padded under the coat when you see a shabby human wreck shuffle past on a bitter night dont you wonder what brought him to want this is the story one poor wretch tells do you know what a flop joint is was there ever a time in your life you walked the midnight streets endlessly jingling the few coins in your pocket debating whether to buy a bed for the night or hold the money for that muchdesired breakfast in the morning did you ever watch the stars slowly fade behind a murky wall of banking clouds while the chill wind shrieks through the deserted streets as the first snowflakes drift downadvance warn ing of the white pall that will soon cover the city to think of a bench in the park is sheer nonsense lynxeyed policemen prevent any doorway comfort saloons are a thing of the past and the allnight pool rooms and eating houses dont want you unless you can pay the flakes come in feathery puffs now the wind from across the court house park whistles through the bare trees and penetrates the thin clothes you wear bed or breakfastthe three nickels in your pocket will pay for one or the other a crumpled newspaper hurtles across the pavement that means a whole lot tonight eagerly it is caught up and padded under the ragged coat to help keep warm the flakes are thick now then a harder blast brings a hail of sleet and frozen drops pelt the face like bullets
