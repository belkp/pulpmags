 thrills thirty years ago my father would be waiting at the boat that meant an end to eloping these fears i communicated to alfred who was lashing dixie along furiously theres no use hurrying i pointed out we cant get the boat till five anyway cant risk the boat said alfred shortly got to sleep out tonight and catch a train from maysville in the morning cant make this damned horse go any farther tonight he turned dixie into the black creek woods where a slim tracery of moonlight fell through ghostly trees i was fright ened at these gloomy surroundings and clung to alfred well have to find a farmhouse i cried if we find a farmhouse your father will find us said alfred no miss prisms here we stay perhaps my daughter would smile at my shock he could not have horrified me more had he asked me to commit a murder all the conventions i had been taught to hold sacred were violated i wont i said and jumped down into the crackling carpet of autumn leaves i wont do any such thing im going back home alfred was beside me he grasped my arms and held them tight no you dont he snarled see here young lady youve done enough to deserve anything i want to do now you got me down here by writing fake letters and let me be made fun of by a bunch of country jakes now youre going to stay right here with me be sides youre a darned pretty girl why the hurry my polished city beau was distress ingly transformed he pressed close against me and his breath was hot on my cheek there we struggled silently savagely in the darkness i bit his hand hit at him finally i was free and i ran tripping on roots hampered by my awkward bustle heed less of where i was going i could hear his footsteps crunching through the leaves after me i paused behind a tree and watched his dark silhouette go plunging on i dared not cry for help for i knew he would be the only one to hear i sat there beside the tree shaking with cold sick with disgust at my own silly mistakes again his footsteps approached blind with fear i ran once more and this time i found a path clear in the moonlight though half covered with leaves i picked up my skirts and sped along rounded a corner and almost col lided with a horseman one glance at his face in the moonlight sufficed to set me laughing and crying together it was tom i clung to his boots and begged him to take me home nor paused to con sider the fortunate coincidence that had brought him here he lifted me up before him and then only thenspoke he said in a quiet ominous voice where is that fellow how did you know i was aghast oh tom im ashamed i wonder if the true swain of a girl today would be as enraged as tom was did he suspect the same thing tom suspected ill kill him he muttered kate ill kill him for this nohehe didnt even get to kiss me tom i ran away he is some where in the woods tom vented his relief in a gusty sigh even as i spoke alfred stumbled out
