big and brave as a herring he drawled but you cant fool ben cloaker no more and he caught me to him with a hideous chuckle of pleasure let me go i screamed again twist ing for the moment out of his grasp im going to tell captain seeley the truth i stood gasping and sobbing with my back against the companion way he folded his arms and faced me his lip curling yes youll tell he jeered unfortunately these be seamen as aint got what you calls compny manners with a galnot aboard ship but youll tell you will then with an entire change of man ner he adopted a wheedling tone its lucky you be that not a soul aboard this here brig has eyes in his head but ol ben cloaker and he wont say a word you may lay to that so you lets well enough alone you does and nobody the wiser but you and me at that he lunged toward me but quick as a flash i ducked and was across the floor before he could turn then back and forth between the rows of bunks we dodged once i caught up a peajacket from a disordered bunk and flung it wildly at his face but divining my purpose he caught the thing easily in his hand with a laugh of triumph that i shall never forget in another moment he would have been upon me but as i ran my foot struck against a low stool that stood under the porthole with a swift backward kick i sent it spinning across the floor cloaker stumbled and fell flat it was an instant only before he was on his feet filling the place with the sound of his curses but in that instant i had made the companion and was rattling up i heard the mans quick breathing just behind as i gained the deck and started running aft i was on the left side of the focsle so that when i turned the deck house hid me for a moment from my pursuer as i rounded it out of the tail of my eye i caught a glimpse of the other ves sel she was overhauling us fast that one fleeting glance was enough to decide me flinging myself over the bulwarks i hung for an instant to the rail in that instant cloaker rounded the deck house after me grunting and puffing then he stopped with such a look of bewilderment on his face that fright ened as i was i could almost have laughed while he stood there gaping at the empty deck i loosed my hold upon the rail at the same time giving a vigorous push with my feet against the ships side to send me clear of it down down i went with the rush and roar of the water above my head and the pounding of it in my ears my eyes must have been open for i remem ber the great ghostly hull of the vessel looking like a huge shadow beside me as i came up the thought flashed into my mind that someone aboard the edelise might have heard the splash and endeavor to rescue me so gulping in one brief grateful breath of air i dove again to swim under water a distance of several yards when i rose to the surface gasping and exhausted the edelise was sailing blithely on her course the last i ever saw of ben cloaker was the picture i had of him then lean ing far over the starboard bulwarks shading his staring eyes with his hand
