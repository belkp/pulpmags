my road to the stars i hastily decided not to antagonize my employer if i could escape without being forced to do so girlie you are the demure kind al ways had me guessing but youre all alikeat least kipling says so now listen to me be nice and ill lift you to the top of the ladder his eyes bored into mine but i ignored real meaning i answered nothing he seemed to enjoy the situation see here ill lay the cards on the table we needed someone to play lees roles and while you do show promise youre no alice leeyet whether youre starred or not depends upon yourself ive never had a chance to talk to you about your future so well do it now ill meet you at the ferry no use starting tongues wragging by leaving here together well run up to arrowhead for tea agreeable i hesitated would you be angry if i said no mr hogan perhaps id be poor company ive been so upset over mr bromley it was a weak excuse but the best i could think of want me to think he means as much as that to you i wanted to resent that but i dared not he was very good to me he gave me my start and i gave you your real chance dont you owe me anything the best i have to giveto my work his grasp had relaxed on my shoul der and i took advantage of it to slip to the floor then help came eddie rolfe walked into the office unan nounced a sheaf of letters in his hand hogan said irritably dont go miss crowell i want to talk to you after ive signed these but rolfes lips formed two words beat it and i followed his advice after my little scene in hogans office i was certainly unprepared for the truce that ensued the chief still came upstairs while we were at work but his visits were brief and he made no attempt to talk to me alone gunning rushed the finish of the pic ture he took us upstate for the out ofdoors scenes and being away from the city was just what i needed at that time we were out on location for ten days and by that time ted was con valescing in the westchester hills the day after we returned gunning went up to see him and the morning after he sent for me to let me know ted was getting on in every way the operation had been a complete success the removal of the pressure on the spine would give him back the use of his legs and allow his brain to function normally ted knew now that i had masqueraded as gloria and he sent me a message of gratitude he was very glad to learn that i was making good but he did not ask to see me gently gunning explained that he seemed overwhelmed by his indebted ness to me but its not a bad thing for ted pam its supplying the incentive to work he told me he was planning a scenario and dictating it now he wants to finish it and sell it in order to pay us all back the money we laid out for him i didnt discourage him a healthy horror of debt is a fine sign that hes come to himself i had been telling myself for weeks
