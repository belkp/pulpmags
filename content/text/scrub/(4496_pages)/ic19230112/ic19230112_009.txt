 the highest law days for he got ugly at times after hed tried to ring me in on some of his thiev ing schemes where he needed a woman when i wouldnt help him hed get sore and he gave me a black eye many a time i guess he loved me though for no matter how often he threatened to quit me he always came back and would be so kind and loving it made it harder for me to refuse every time he had two pals who used to come over to see him of evenings and theyd sit by the table and play poker while i sewed or read the paper half dead with sleep wishing theyd go home and let me go to bed their names were tim callahan and shorty camp shorty was little and skinny and all withered up like a dried apple his eyes were little and squinty and what hair he had was gray like his eyes and his face was like crinkled gray leather it made me sick just to look at him the way he grinned at me and showed his yellow teeth he always looked so un clean i couldnt understand why pete ever had him around because pete was neat even when he was drinking tim callahan was almost as big as pete but he was an ugly hairy red irishman and generally half drunk both shorty and tim seemed to be afraid of pete though and did every thing he told them one night id been to a picture show and when i came home i found pete shorty and tim sitting in the corner as usual but they were talking in an undertone instead of playing cards and seemed awfully excited about some thing they had a newspaper spread out in front of them but when i came in pete crumpled the paper up and threw it in the wastebasket and began to laugh as though something funny had hap pened i dont know whybut i felt cer tain there was something in that paper they didnt want me to see i felt some thing terrible was going to happen pete had sworn to me once that hed never killed anyone and never would that was the one thing i was always afraid of pretty soon he and the others went out together and the minute they were gone i rummaged in the basket and found the newspaper pete had thrown away i spread it out and looked it all over but i couldnt find anything in it that looked suspicious though there was a red mark drawn around some headlines about a millionaire from texas who was stopping at the alcazar hotel his name was canfield george canfield and the paper said he was rich as croesus whoever that was pete caught me reading the article and got so mad i thought hed choke me why the are you snoopin about he snarled at me lemme tell you ann if you cant mind your own business you can pack your doll rags and beat it but when he discovered i didnt know what he was up to he changed his tone and seemed sorry for the way hed acted that was pete all overa devil one minute and a darling the next but it planted the seeds of a new fear in my mind what was he up to i had a feeling i couldnt shake off that some thing awful was going to happen it was just about that time i dis covered i was going to have a baby i loved babies and if pete hadnt been a thief id a been the happiest woman on
