my road to the stars i meant what i saidyoure wel come around this studio to anything i dont want and she laughed rudely but im not yet ready to step out of the place the chief has made for me so fade out of his line of vision or ill break you i was glad to shut the door of my dressing room but i could not shut out the memory of gloria mundis face as she had threatened to break me if i interfered with her ambitions i had no wish to do so bryam hogan forty and coarsegrained did not appeal to me he was the only person on the placeexcept mundiwhom i could not regard in a friendly fashion i had learned to accept peter gunnings short phrases as indicative of his absorption in his work i had learned to steer tim foley from sentimental vaporings which he somehow thought went with the game i had come to offer an ear into which roger gordon could pour a stream of discontent without really tak ing it in i tried to be nice to the cam era men to the electricians to the work men about the place and i felt that they liked me for they always greeted me with a nod and they never grum bled at being ordered to rebuild one of my setsthough i had heard them swear at being asked to make over a room or a garden for gloria mundi i even got on with eddie rolfe with all his temperament but there was a look in bryam hogans eyes which disturbed me and i was very careful to avoid more than the briefest exchange of greetings with him although i knew the next morn ing that they were wheeling ted into the operating room at eleven oclock i got myself up in my khaki skirt laced my long boots smeared a little dirt on one cheek and went up stairs to play a silly scene with roger gordon i was nervous and showed it but gunning was very patient with me and when we laid off at noon he linked his arm through mine and we went down stairs together he led me along the other corridor to his office and he pushed me gently into his armchair before he lifted the receiver from the hook lets hear the news he said he avoided looking at me for which i was very grateful for i felt i had grown white even under the thick coating of the slightly yellowish powder i used for makeup it seemed an eternity before he got the hospital asked for teds special nurse i leaned close hoping to overhear it was good news the operation had been successful and ted was resting as comfortably as they could expect i collapsed the strain had been too great and now that it was easing i gave way to my emotions and burst into tears gunning stretched out a hand and clasped mine and i let my head rest on his shoulder with no thought except that he understood my breaking down but there were others who could not see how natural it was for him to com fort me and suddenly i heard a voice boom out what do you mean by this gun ning why have you two left a set and come down here together from over gunnings shoulder i glimpsed hogan in the doorway his face twisted in an angry scowl gunning put me from him gently and said in a curiously quiet voice
