on receiving a luncheon invitation by laura kent mason dear alfredo i am not going to have lunch eon with you on tuesday the reason is that i am dead not really dead of course i havent suddenly de parted this life and left behind an astral body to scrawl this on my best paper on tuesday instead of lunching with you i shall probably be at bernice evans calmly eating my way through a womans luncheon and adding my bit to the usual talk of husbands high prices and housekeeping the part of me that you think you like is deadthough it died before you met me so of course the part of me that would have wanted to be with you is dead too i am writing this alfredo because i am old and being old and a woman and quite average i am a fool and it pleases me to be frank this one time and to journey into sentimentality of course you will say that i am not oldor i hope you willand it is dear of you you wont understand just here at first what i mean by being dead when you have finished per haps of course i like you alfredo you know that so that is not the reason i am refusing now and for always to have luncheon or tea or dinner with youor to see you at all except in a crowd and then i shall be quite unin teresting and impersonal i have always liked youweve known each other such a little while your type i mean i dont know whether we found each other at the rayolds party because you like the type of woman i used to bebefore i went outor because your type makes love to all women every man i have ever been in love with or interested in except my husbandhas been your type and too men of your type boys i should say since it is a type that remains forever youthfulare the only ones i have ever attracted so at the rayolds party when after fifteen minutes we were well be yond the first stages of getting ac quainted and i could see the weeks stretch out our weeks it came to me that i was deadhad been for a long time the night i met you and the next day i thought of you i knew you would write or phone me i knew youd be at the parkinson dinner and that id have tea with you the next day and the nextand then a note it was a dear little note alfredo but theres no use going on there was a faint thrill alfredo when you took my hand a stirring of a thousand memories but the dead do not waken easily and too it is more peaceful pleasant being dead i shall miss the live things of course colour brilliancy emotions but we who are dead cannot choose for contentment for the absence of sensation of ecstasy and pain we must pay and truth fully i prefer being the way i am if we saw the thing through i know what would happen you know too unless you are very young first there would be hours of pleasure in seeing one another the bringing of
