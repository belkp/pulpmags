twilight of love the memory of this incident passed for the glowing days overshadowed it they were very close to each other now and in his secret way he indulged all the minutse of love he wrote her nearly every day fill ing his letters with sentimental phrases that stirred him deeply as they flowed poetically from under his eager pen he brought her flowers and gifts he watched her moods by her side he in clined his head to catch her lowspoken words oblivious to any that might watch him she was always tender al ways sweet yet presently he thought he observed a change she seemed to pass from the languor of her customary moods to an almost inevitable and surprising ar dour as if some fresh flame burned in her heart this was manifested to him not so much in embraces of greater fervour in kisses that pressed more warmly on his lips as in the surprising new glow of her eyes the sudden enigmatic smiles the unexpected rapturous in takings of breathin ways that curi ously were almost divorced from his participation sometimes when he talked to her she scarcely seemed to hear watching her face he would see her eyes open wider looking past him as if at some thing precious beyond his forgotten nearness frequently he was surprised on coming to her home to find her al most cold she would take his hand press his fingers perfunctorily and without apparent response and then yield herself to his greeting embrace perhaps a moment later she would seem all fire that remote fire confus ing that began to bring him doubts he found too that they were not to gether so frequently for a long time he had seen her nearly every evening now she made excuses but often after an absence of several days she repaid him with hysterical embraces nevertheless his assurance was dim inished by disturbing uncertainties he no longer felt in a continuous un swerving stream that consciousness of superiority and pride something had interposed itself betwixt them an im palpable veil fogging his certainties one evening as he was preparing to call at her home his telephone rang on answering he found it was she ask ing to be excused pleading a headache deeply disappointed he consented and the hours before bedtime loomed up before him like impassable obstacles it had been three days since they were together he seated himself in a chair discon solate and stared down at the carpet slowly he reviewed the difficulties of the past few weeks no word of any change had passed between themand suddenly he felt that an understanding was necessary in a measure they had lost the habit of confidence accepting each other too easily they no longer had those inti mate talks that searched out inner mu tual secrets he felt that he must tell her of his fears of his perturbations she would see then she would confide and the days of old assurance like a returning tide would flow warmly back again as he resolved upon this his doubts cleared he felt easier and the simple confession seemed all that was neces sary but he was impatient to make it many times he got up and walked about the room strode to the window and stared down at the crowded street full of shadows and the hurry of dusk shapes it seemed impossible to wait for another day he determined to go now she would be glad in the end for his coming a few minutes later he was in the street as he neared her house his mood ex panded his heart beat faster and his pace was more hurried some of the old confident delight was in his blood again the romantic joy of playing the young lover he turned a corner he was on her street passing an arc lamp he glanced at his watch and found it later than he had supposedafter ten oclock per s sdec
