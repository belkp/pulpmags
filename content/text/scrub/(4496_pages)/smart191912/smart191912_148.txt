exeunt omnes reuth baritone seven feet in height and a german soprano weighing at least three hundred pounds but if dr weber thus neglects music he at least gives full measure in all other departments his book runs to nearly eight hundred pages and is largely set in very fine type but i have gone through it from end to end with the utmost interest the material in the main is excellently arranged instead of presenting it chronologically the author sorts it out by content and so gives in each chap ter a brief history of the idea with which it deals now and then he falls into an error though not often on page for example he says that albert bartholomews famous monu ment aux morts in pere lachaise cemetery represents the apotheosis of earthly existence the very gateway into knowledge and eternal life a glance at the monument is sufficient to show that this is not true bar tholomew candidates for immortality have anything but an air of facing apotheosis on the contrary they are plainly eager to remain in paris one could not imagine more reluctant dying but this perhaps is pushing criticism too far dr weber is en titled to his opinions his facts are not to be disputed his book is a model of diligent scholarship i commend it to you as a curious and fascinating novelty it will entertain you more than a wagonload of novels ii one idea i do not find in it the conception of death as the last and worst of all the practical jokes played upon poor mortals by the gods that idea apparently never occurred to the greeks who thought of almost every thing but nevertheless it has a cer tain soundness the hardest thing about death is not that men die tragic ally but that most of them die ri diculously if it were possible for all of us to make our exits at great moments swiftly cleanly decorously and in fine attitudes then the experi ence would be something to face heroically and with high and beautiful words but we commonly go off in no such gorgeous poetical way instead we die in raucous prose of arteriosclerosis of diabetes of tox emia of a noisome perforation in the ileocaecal region of carcinoma of the liver the abominable acidosis of dr crile sneaks upon us gradually paralyzing the adrenals flabbergasting the thyroid crippling the poor dear old liver and throwing its fog upon the brain thus the ontogenetic process is recapitulated in reverse order and we pass into the mental obscurity of infancy and then into the blank unconsciousness of the pre natal state and finally into the con dition of undifferentiated protoplasm a man does not die quickly and bril liantly like a lightning stroke he passes out by inches hesitatingly and one may almost add gingerly it is hard to say just when he is fully dead long after his heart has ceased to beat and his lungs have ceased to swell him up with the vanity of his species there are remote and obscure parts of him that still live on quite uncon cerned about the central catastrophe dr alexis carrel has cut them out and kept them alive for months the hair keeps on growing for a long while every time another one of the corpses of barbarossa or king james i is exhumed it is found that the hair is longer than it was the last time no doubt there are many parts of the body and perhaps even whole organs which wonder what it is all about when they find that they are on the way to the crematory burn a mans mortal remains and you inevitably bum a good portion of him alive and no doubt that portion sends alarmed messages to the unconscious brain like dissected tissue under anesthesia and the resultant shock brings the deceased before the hierarchy of heaven in a state of collapse with his face white sweat bespangling his forehead and a great thirst upon him
