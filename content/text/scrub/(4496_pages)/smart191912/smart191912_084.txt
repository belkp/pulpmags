lost love and houses of woodnot to live in but to look at for two or three hours a week i had heard several versions of the story that she left new york over weekends but this i knew to be the true explanation suzanne repeated the statement that she was inherently good but you know i had to live and i had to learn how i did it pretty well i suppose it was because i was partly french and being bad with me was not as is usual in america merely being vulgar but you understand all thatin fact i think you told me to go ahead it was on one of my much talkedabout walks in the country that i met curtis i was walking along a country road on one side of me was a field with a springhouse and a little beyond it a stream on the other side was a farm yard filled with sheep i was watching the stream and wondering whether or not i could still swim when i nearly stumbled over a man who was sitting down taking sand out of his shoe it was curtis i went right on after ex cusing myself and didnt think any more about him a little further down the road i went over to the stream took off my shoes and dabbled my feet in the water the place was nearly a hundred yards off the road and the pool was screened by a grove of young maple trees i had been there only a few minutes when curtis appeared he was terri bly fussed but i knew what to do and what to say so in ten minutes we were talking easily he didnt know who i was and i didnt tell him i was out in the coun ty and i wanted to fit in to go away from myself so we talked along for some time and i left him about five oclock to go back into town he had told me that he lived in the country to be alone and i realized that my dream would come true if i could get away well i did get away and i left him thinking that he had been talking to an angel it was a kindness on my part you would understand that he had appealed to me almost more than anyone i had ever known somehow and then too he hadnt fallen in love with me most men didor thought they didand said so but i went back to the city i still remembered the boy on the road and once i looked for him but he wasnt there that day it must have been three months later that i met him at the stage door and went off with him in a taxi how did you find me i asked i just happened in town and went to the theater isnt it nice but you didnt know who you were talking to before did you i should say i didnt he was as shy as a kid and i saw that he was impressed instead of dis illusioned it rather spoiled my dream though where are you taking me now i asked him to eat and drink i thought that you didnt approve of that sort of thing i drink some he was no more sophisticated or at ease with me than a schoolboy i saw my game and began playing it you see he had come into the spiders web and it was his own fault but what will people say when they see you with me i asked i dont know do you know what a reputation i have no i am supposedly the worst girl in that company are you oh i know how to kiss i an swered and laughed we dined and drank champagne the wine went straight to his head as i had done and in the taxi going back he kissed me suzanne stopped talking while the waiter poured her another cup of cof
