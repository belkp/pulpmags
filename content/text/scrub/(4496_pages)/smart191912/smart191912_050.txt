twilight of love by l m hussey i he entered the library as a part of his routine a way to put behind him certain of the hours this afternoon it was very quiet and he chose one of the long tables that was deserted save for a young woman frowning over a book as if the typog raphy were extraordinarily poor he seated himself and fingered without opening two or three abandoned vol umes on the table meanwhile glancing about the room he recognized some of the habitues a short swarthy man with black eyes set a little slantwiseprobably a hindu was taking notes from a volume printed in some oriental tongue pome roy had seen him a score of times once he had looked idly over the fellows shoulder at the book he seemed to be translating it was printed in scrolllike characters sanscrit no doubt a very old man in a corner was read ing a romance another old man who came there every day read nothing at all but staring down at the floor seemed to have achieved almost a nir vana of emptiness pomeroy sighed it was depressing he formulated a half wish that he had gone back to his rooms however he could have done nothing there but sleep now he glanced sideways at the girl he observed that her brow was still furrowed her lips moved slowly like those of a child that can scarcely read dropping his eyes to her book he saw that it was printed in german evi dently she knew very little of the lan guage her presence gave him a mild curiosity now he scrutinized her more thor oughly her features were not bad but they had an indefinable touch of insufficiency something was wanting to make them attractive more definitely she was too pale and her brown hair luxuriant enough he thought needed a skilful touch here and there to bring out the charm of pleasant curves in all she gave him a vague impression of pathosthe pathetic air that arises from selfdepreciation disagreeable in a woman presently she turned a page he observed her perplexed frown deep en he wondered why she was endeav ouring to read a language obviously un familiar whilst he still regarded her speculat ing in his minds idleness she suddenly dropped the book gave it a little push away from her and uttered a low ex clamation of discontent then aware that someone was near she looked up met his eyes and flushed a little he smiled struck a snag he asked for a moment she hesitated as if conventionally weighing the propriety of answering him her eyes passed over his face in a swift appraisal evi dently the fact that he was not young reassured her of course i have she replied when i went to school i studied some french and some german but not enough to know anything about either just enough to tantalize me every now and then i get the idea that ill do some hard work on one or the other of these languagesi al ways fail she frowned naively her rather un usual purpose amused him why did she trouble herself with such concerns
