the man from the atom startling possibly fatal i had no delusions con cerning my luck i found professor martyn in his laboratory bend ing with the eyes of a miser counting his gold over a tiny machine that might easily have fitted in my pocket he did not see me for a moment but when he finally looked up with a sigh of regret that he must tear his eyes away from his new and wonder ful brainchild whatever it might be he waved me a little unsteadily into a chair and sank down in one himself with the machine in his lap i waited placing myself in what i considered a receptive mood kirby he began abruptly at last have you ever read your alice in wonderland i gasped perhaps in my surprise alice in are you joking professor certainly not he assured me i speak in all seriousness why yes i have read it many times in fact it has always struck me as a book to appeal more to an adult than to a child but whati cant see just how that is important he smiled perhaps i am playing with you unduly he said but do you remember the episode of the two pieces of cheese if my own recollection is correct one of which made one grow the other shrink i assented but i said incredulously certainly you cannot tell me you have spent your time in pre paring magical cheeses he laughed aloud this time and then seeing my discomfort unburdened himself of his latest triumph no kirby not just that but i have indeed con structed a machine that you will be incapable of be lieving until you try it with this little object in my lap you could grow forever until there was nothing left in the universe to surpass or you could shrink so as to observe the minutest of atoms standing upon it as you now stand upon the earth it is an invention that will make scientific knowl edge perfect he halted with flushed face and gleaming eyes i could find nothing to say for the thing was collossal magnificent in its possi bilities if it worked but i could not resist a suspi cion of so tiny a machine professor are you in absolute earnest i cried have i ever jested about so wonderful a thing he retorted quietly i knew he had not but surely that is merely a model it is the machine itself ii i was too astounded to speak at first but finally tell me about it i gasped this is certainly the most fantastic invention you have made yet how does it work i am afraid suggested professor martyn that you could not understand all the technical details it is horribly complicated and besides i am anx ious to try it out but i will give you an idea of it of course you know that an object may be divi ded in half forever as you have learned in high school without being entirely exhausted it is this principle that is used in shrinking i hardly understand the things mechanism myselfit was the result of an accidentbut i know that the ma chine not only divides every atom every molecule every electron of the body into two exactly equal parts but it accomplishes the same feat in itself thus keeping pace with its manipulator the matter it removes from the body is reduced to a gaseous form and left in the air there are six wires that you do not see which connect with the body while the machine itself is placed on the chest held by a small belt that carries wires to the front of the body where the two controlling buttons are placed when the user wishes to grow he presses the upper button and the machine then extracts atoms from the air which it converts by a reverse method from the first into atoms identical to certain others in the body the two atoms thus formed joining into one large particle of twice the original size as i said i have little idea of my invention ex cept that it works by means of atomic energy i was intending to make an atomic energy motor when i observed certain parts to increase and diminish strangely in size it was practically by blind instinct that i have worked the thing up and now i fear i shall not be able to discover the source of my atomic energy until i can put together with great care another such machine for i am afraid to risk taking this apart for analysis and i i said suddenly with the awe i felt for such a discovery quite perceptible i fear in my tone i am to try out this machine if you are willing he said simply you must realize of course that there are a multitude of un known dangers i know nothing of the complete effects of the machine but my experiments on in animate objects have seemed satisfactory i am willing to take any risks i said enthu siastically if you are willing to risk your great machine why dont you realize professor that this will revolutionize science there is noth ing hardly that will be unknown astronomy will be complete for there will be nothing to do but to in crease in size enough to observe beyond our at mosphere or one could stand upon worlds like rocks to examine others exactly i have calculated that the effect of a huge foot covering whole countries would be slight so equally distributed would the weights be prob ably it would rest upon tall buildings and trees with ease but in space of course no support should be necessary and then as you said one could shrink until the mysteries of electrons would be revealed of course there would be danger in descending into apparent nothingness not knowing where a new worldatom could be found upon which to stand but dangers must be risked but now kirby remarked the professor offi cially time passes and i should like you to make in alice in the looking glass the beautiful play of of fancy which gave immortal fame to a logician and mathematician we read of the mysterious change in sice of the heroine the charming little alice it tells how she grew large and small according to what she ate but here we have increase in size and pushed to its utmost limit here we have treated the growth of a man to cosmic dimensions and we are told of his strange sensation and are led up to a sudden startling and impressive conclusion and are taken through the picture of his emotions and despair
