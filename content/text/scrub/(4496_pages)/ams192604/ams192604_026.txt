off on a comet chapter xi an island tomb no longer then could there be any doubt as to the annihilation of a considerable portion of the colony not merely had there been a submersion of the land but the impression was more and more confirmed that the very bowels of the earth must have yawned and closed again upon a large terri tory of the rocky substratum of the province it became more evident than ever that not a trace re mained and a new soil of unknown formation had certainly taken the place of the old sandy seabot tom as it altogether transcended the powers of those on board to elucidate the origin of this catas trophe it was felt to be incumbent on them at least to ascertain its extent after a long and somewhat wavering discussion it was at length decided that the schooner should take advantage of the favorable wind and weather and proceed at first towards the east thus following the outline of what had formerly represented the coast of africa until that coast had been lost in boundless sea not a vestige of it all remained from cape mata fuz to tunis it had all gone as though it had never been the maritime town of dellis built like algiers amphitheaterwise had totally disap peared the highest points were quite invisible not a trace on the horizon was left of the jurjura chain the topmost point of which was known to have an altitude of more than feet unsparing of her fuel the dobryna made her way at full steam towards cape blanc neither cape negro nor cape serrat was to be seen the town of bizerta once charming in its oriental beauty had vanished utterly its marabouts or temple tombs shaded by magnificent palms that fringed the gulf which by reason of its narrow mouth had the semblance of a lake all had disappeared giving place to a vast waste of sea the transparent waters of which as still demonstrated by the soundingline had ever the same uniform and arid bottom in the course of the day the schooner rounded the point where five weeks previously cape blanc had been so conspicuous an object and she was now stemming the waters of what once had been the bay of tunis but bay there was none and the town from which it had derived its name with the arsenal the goletta and the two peaks of bou kournein had all vanished from the view cape bon too the most northern promontory of africa and the point of the continent nearest to the island of sicily had been included in the general devas tation before the occurrence of the recent prodigy the bottom of the mediterranean just at this point had formed a sudden ridge across the straits of libya the sides of the ridge had shelved to so great an extent that while the depth of water on the summit had been little more than eleven fathoms that on either hand of the elevation was little short of a hundred fathoms a formation such as this plainly indicated that at some remote epoch cape bon had been connected with cape furina the extremity of sicily in the same manner as ceuta has doubtless been connected with gibraltar lieutenant procope was too well acquainted with the mediterranean to be unaware of this peculiarity and would not lose the opportunity of ascertaining whether the submarine ridge still existed or whether the seabottom between sicily and africa had undergone any modification both timascheff and servadac were much in terested in jvatching the operations at a sign from the lieutenant a sailor who was stationed at the foot of the foreshrouds dropped the soundinglead into the water and in reply to procopes inquiries reportedfive fathoms and a flat bottom the next aim was to determine the amount of depression on either side of the ridge and for this purpose the dobryna was shifted for a distance of half a mile both to the right and left and the sound ings taken at each station five fathoms and a flat bottom was the unvaried announcement after each operation not only therefore was it evident that the submerged chain between cape bon and cape furina no longer existed but it was equally clear that the convulsion had caused a general level ing of the seabottom and that the soil degenerated as it has been said into a metallic dust of unrecog nized composition bore no trace of the sponges seaanemones starfish seanettles hydrophytes and shells with which the submarine rocks of the mediterranean had hitherto been prodigally clothed the dobryna now put about and resumed her explorations in a southerly direction it remained however as remarkable as ever how completely throughout the voyage the sea continued to be de serted all expectations of hailing a vessel bearing news from europe were entirely falsified so that more and more each member of the crew began to be conscious of his isolation and to believe that the schooner like a second noahs ark carried the sole survivors of a calamity that had overwhelmed the earth on the th of february the dobryna passed over the site of the city of dido the ancient byrsa a carthage however which was now more com pletely annihilated than ever punic carthage had been destroyed by scipio africanus or roman carthage by hassan the saracen in the evening as the sun was sinking below the eastern horizon captain servadac was lounging moodily against the taffrail from the heaven above where stars kept peeping fitfully from be hind the moving clouds his eye wandered mechan ically to the waters below where the long waves were rising and falling with the evening breeze all at once his attention was arrested by a lu minous speck straight ahead on the southern hor izon at first imagining that he was the victim of some spectral illusion he observed it with silent attention but when after some minutes he became convinced that what he saw was actually a distant light he appealed to one of the sailors by whom his impression was fully corroborated the intelligence was immediately imparted to count timascheff and the lieutenant is it land do you suppose inquired servadac eagerly i should be more inclined to think it is a light on board some ship replied the count whatever it is in another hour we shall know all about it said servadac no captain interposed lieutenant procope we shall know nothing until tomorrow
