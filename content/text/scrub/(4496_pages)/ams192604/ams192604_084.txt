the man who saved the earth now clear enough for perception reeled at the dis tance the depth was nauseating his whole body succumbed to a sudden qualm of weakness the sickness that comes just before falling he went limp in the saddle but the horse fought backward warned by in stinct it drew back from the sheer banks of the gulf it had no reason but its nature at the in stant it sensed the snapping of the iron will of its master in a moment it had turned and was racing on its wild way out of the mountains at supreme moments a cattle horse will always hit for home the pinto and its limp rider were fleeing on the road to jackson pizzozi had no knowledge of what had occurred in oakland to him the whole thing had been but a flash of miracle he could not reason he did not curb his horse that he was still in the saddle was due more to the nearinstinct of his training than to his volition he did not even draw up at the cabin that he could make better time with his motor than with his pinto did not occur to him his mind was far too busy and now that the thing was passed too full of terror it was fortyfour miles to town it was night and the stars were shining when he rode into jackson chapter iv mana great little bug and what of charley huyck it was his antici pation and his training which leaves us here to tell the story were it not for the strange manner of his rearing and the keen faith and appreciation of dr robold there would be today no tale to tell the little incident of the burningglass had grown if there is no such thing as fate there is at least something that comes very close to being destiny on this night we find charley at the observatory in arizona he is a grown man and a great one and though mature not so very far drawn from the lad we met on the street selling papers tall slender very slightly stooped and with the same idealistic dreaming eyes of the poet surely no one at first glance would have taken him for a scien tist which he was and was not indeed there is something vastly different about the science of charley huyck science to be sure but not prosaic he was the first and perhaps the last of the school of dr robold a peculiar combination of poetry and fact a man of vision of vast farseeing faith and idealism linked and based on the coldest and sternest truths of materialism a peculiar tenet of the theory of robold true science to be itself should be half poetry which any of us who have read or been at school know it is not it is a peculiar theory and though rather wild still with some points in favor we all of us know our schoolmasters especially those of science and what they stand for facts facts nothing but facts no dreams or romance looking back we can grant them just about the emotions of cucumbers we remember their cold hard features the prodding after fact the accumu lation of data surely there is no poetry in them yet we must not deny that they have been by far the most potent of all men in the progress of civilzation not even robold would deny it the point is this the doctor maintained that from the beginning the progress of material civilization had been along three distinct channels science invention and ad ministration it was simply his theory that the first two should be one that the scientist deal not alone with dry fact but with invention and that the inventor unless he is a scientist has mastered but half his trade the really great scientist should be a visionary said robold and an in ventor is merely a poet with tools which is where we get charley huyck he was a visionary a scientist a poet with tools the protge of dr robold he dreamed things that no scientist had thought of and we are thankful for his dreaming the one great friend of huyck was professor williams a man from charleys home city who had known him even back in the days of selling papers they had been cronies in boyhood in their teens and again at college in after years when huyck had become the visionary the mysterious man of the mountain and williams a great professor of astronomy the friendship was as strong as ever but there was a difference between them wil liams was exact to acuteness with not a whit of vision beyond pure science he had been reared in the old stonecold theory of exactness he lived in figures he could not understand huyck or his reasoning perfectly willing to follow as far as facts permitted he refused to step off into specu lation which was the point between them charley huyck had vision although exact as any man he had ever one part of his mind soaring out into speculation what is and what might be and the gulf between to bridge the gulf was the life work of charley huyck in the snug little office in arizona we find them charley with his feet poised on the desk and wil liams precise and punctilious true to his training defending the exactness of his philosophy it was the cool of the evening the sun was just mellowing the heat of the desert through the open door and windows a cool wind was blowing charley was smoking the same old pipe had been the bane of williamss life at college then we know he was asking yes spoke the professor what we know charley we know though of course it is not much it is very hard nay impossible to deny figures we have not only the proofs of geology but of astro nomical calculation we have facts and figuies plus our sidereal relations all about us the world must come to an end it is a hard thing to say it but it is a fact of science slowly inevitably ruthlessly the end will come a mere question of arithmetic huyck nodded it was his special function in life to differ with his former roommate he had come down from his own mountain in colorado just for the delight of difference i see your old calculations of tidal retarda tion or if that doesnt work the loss of oxygen and the water either one or the other a matter of figures the earth is being drawn every day by the sun its ro tation is slowing up when the time comes it will
