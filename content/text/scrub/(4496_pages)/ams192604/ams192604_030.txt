off on a comet upon the cliff when a ringing shout was heard quick boys quick hoist the jib and right the helm sudden and startling as the unexpected orders were they were executed as if by magic the lieutenant who had shouted from the bow rushed astern and took the helm and before any one had time to speculate upon the object of his maneuvers he shouted again look out sharp watch the sheets an involuntary cry broke forth from all on board but it was no cry of terror right ahead was a narrow opening in the solid rock it was hardly forty feet wide whether it was a passage or not it mattered little it was at least a refuge and driven by wind and wave the dobryna under the dexterous guidance of the lieutenant dashed in between its perpendicular walls had she not immured herself in a perpetual prison chapter xiii a royal salute then i take your bishop major said colonel murphy as he made a move that he had taken since the previous evening to consider i was afraid you would replied major oliphant looking intently at the chessboard such was the way in which a long silence was broken on the morning of the th of february by the old calendar another day elapsed before another move was made it was a protracted game it had in fact already lasted some monthsthe players being so deliberate and so fearful of taking a step without the most mature consideration that even now they were only making the twentieth move both of them moreover were rigid disciples of the renowned philidor who pronounces that to play the pawns well is the soul of chess and accord ingly not one pawn had been sacrificed without a most vigorous defense the men who were thus beguiling their leisure were two officers in the british armycolonel heneage finch murphy and major sir john temple oliphant remarkably similar in personal appear ance they were hardly less so in personal character both of them were about forty years of age both of them were tall and fair with bushy whiskers and mustaches both of them were phlegmatic in tem perament and both much addicted to the wearing of their uniforms they were proud of their na tionality and exhibited a manifest dislike verging upon contempt for everything foreign probably they would have felt no surprise if they had been told that anglosaxons were fashioned out of some specific clay the properties of which surpassed the investigation of chemical analysis without any intentional disparagement they might in a certain way be compared to two scarecrows which though perfectly harmless in themselves inspire some measure of respect and are excellently adapted to protect the territory intrusted to their guardian ship englishlike the two officers had made themselves thoroughly at home in the station abroad in which it had been their lot to be quartered the faculty of colonization seems to be indigenous to the native character once let an englishman plant his na tional standard on the surface of the moon and it would not be long before a colony would be estab lished around it the officers had a servant named kirke and a company of ten soldiers of the line this party of thirteen men were apparently the sole survivors of an overwhelming catastrophe which on the st of january had transformed an enormous rock gar risoned with wellnigh two thousand troops into an insignificant island far out to sea but although the transformation had been so marvelous it can not be said that either colonel murphy or major oliphant had made much demonstration of astonish ment this is all very peculiar sir john observed the colonel yes colonel very peculiar replied the major england will be sure to send for us said one officer no doubt she will answered the other accordingly they came to the mutual resolution that they would stick to their post to say the truth it would have been a difficult matter for the gallant officers to do otherwise they had but one small boat therefore it was well that they made a virtue of necessity and resigned them selves to patient expectation of the british ship which in due time would bring relief they had no fear of starvation their island was mined with subterranean stores more than ample for thirteen mennay for thirteen englishmen for the next five years at least preserved meat ale brandyall were in abundance consequently as the men expressed it they were in this respect all right of course the physical changes that had taken place had attracted the notice both of officers and men but the reversed position of east and west the diminution of the force of gravity the altered rotation of the earth and her projection upon a new orbit were all things that gave them little con cern and no uneasiness and when the colonel and the major had replaced the pieces on the board which had been disturbed by the convulsion any surprise they might have felt at the chessmen los ing some portion of their weight was quite for gotten in the satisfaction of seeing them retain their equilibrium one phenomenon however did not fail to make its due impression upon the men this was the dim inution in the length of day and night three days after the catastrophe corporal pim on behalf of himself and his comrades solicited a formal inter view with the officers the request having been granted pim with the nine soldiers all punctili ously wearing the regimental tunic of scarlet and trousers of invisible green presented themselves at the door of the colonels room where he and his brotherofficer were continuing their game raising his hand respectfully to his cap which he wore poised jauntily over his right ear and scarcely held on by the strap below his under lip the corporal waited permission to speak after a lingering survey of the chessboard the colonel slowly lifted his eyes and said with official dignity well men what is it first of all sir replied the corporal we want to speak to you about our pay and then we wish
