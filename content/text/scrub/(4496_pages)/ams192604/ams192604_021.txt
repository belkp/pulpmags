 amazing stories miles if the just equilibrium of the earth had thus been destroyed and should this diminution of distance still continue would there not be reason to fear that the terrestrial world would be carried onwards to actual contact with the sun which must result in its total annihilation the continuance of the splendid weather afforded servadac every facility for observing the heavens night after night constellations in their beauty lay stretched before his eyesan alphabet which to his mortification not to say his rage he was unable to decipher in the apparent dimensions of the fixed stars in their distance in their relative posi tion with regard to each other he could observe no change although it is established that our sun is approaching the constellation of hercules at the rate of more than miles a year and although arcturus is traveling through space at the rate of fiftyfour miles a secondthree time faster than the earth goes round the sunyet such is the remoteness of those stars that no appreciable change is evident to the senses the fixed stars taught him nothing far otherwise was it with the planets the orbits of venus and mercury are within the orbit of the earth venus rotating at an average distance of miles from the sun and mercury at that of after pondering long and as profoundly as he could upon these figures captain servadac came to the conclusion that as the earth was now receiving about double the amount of light and heat that it had been receiving before the catas trophe it was receiving about the same as the planet venus he was driven therefore to the estimate of the measure in which the earth must have approxi mated to the sun a deduction in which he was con firmed when the opportunity came for him to ob serve venus herself in the splendid proportions that she now assumed that magnificent planet whichas phosphorus or lucifer hesperus or vesper the evening star the morning star or the shepherds starhas never failed to attract the rapturous admiration of the most indifferent observers here revealed herself with unprecedented glory exhibiting all the phases of a lustrous moon in miniature various indenta tions in the outline of its crescent showed that the solar beams were refracted into regions of its sur face where the sun had already set and proved beyond a doubt that the planet had an atmosphere of her own and certain luminous points projecting from the crescent as plainly marked the existence of mountains as the result of servadacs computa tions he formed the opinion that venus could hardly be at a greater distance than miles from the earth and a very safe distance too said ben zoof when his master told him the conclusion at which he had arrived all very well for two armies but for a couple of planets not quite so safe perhaps as you may imagine it is my impression that it is more than likely we may run foul of venus said the captain plenty of air and water there sir inquired the orderly yes as far as i can tell plenty replied ser vadac then why shouldnt we go and visit venus servadac did his best to explain that as the two planets were of about equal volume and were travel ing with great velocity in opposite directions any collision between them must be attended with the most disastrous consequences to one or both of them but ben zoof failed to see that even at the worst the catastrophe could be much more serious than the collision of two railway trains the captain became exasperated you idiot he angrily exclaimed cannot you understand that the planets are traveling a thousand times faster than the fastest express and that if they meet either one or the other must be destroyed what would become of your darling montmartre then the captain had touched a tender chord for a moment ben zoof stood with clenched teeth and contracted muscles then in a voice of real concern he inquired whether anything could be done to avert the calamity nothing whatever so you may go about your own business was the captains brusque rejoinder all discomfited and bewildered ben zoof retired without a word during the ensuing days the distance between the two planets continued to decrease and it be came more and more obvious that the earth on her new orbit was about to cross the orbit of venus throughout this time the earth had been making a perceptible approach towards mercury and that planetwhich is rarely visible to the naked eye and then only at what are termed the periods of its greatest eastern and western elongationsnow ap peared in all its splendor it amply justified the epithet of sparkling which the ancients were ac customed to confer upon it and could scarcely fail to awaken a new interest the periodic recurrence of its phases its reflection of the suns rays shed ding upon it a light and a heat seven times greater than that received by the earth its glacial and its torrid zones which on account of the great inclination of the axis are scarcely separable its equatorial bands its mountains eleven miles high were all subjects of observation worthy of the most studious regard but no danger was to be apprehended from mer cury with venus only did collision appear im minent by the th of january the distance be tween that planet and the earth had become reduced to between two and three millions of miles and the intensity of its light cast heavy shadows from all terrestrial objects it might be observed to turn upon its own axis in twentythree hours twentyone minutesan evidence from th unaltered duration of its days that the planet had not shared in the disturbance on its disc the clouds formed from its atmospheric vapor were plainly perceptible as also were the seven spots which according to bian chini are a chain of seas it was now visible in broad daylight bonaparte when under the direc tory once had his attention called to venus at noon and immediately hailed it joyfully recognizing it as his own peculiar star in the ascendant captain servadac it may well be imagined did not experi ence the same gratifying emotion on the th the distance between the two bodies had again sensibly diminished the captain had ceased to be surprised that no vessel had been sent to rescue himself and his companion from their strange imprisonment the governor general and the minister of war were doubtless far differently
