off on a comet whether or not it was desirable for ben zoof to accompany his master there were various reasons why he should be left behind not the least im portant being that the schooner had no accommoda tion for horses and the orderly would have found it hard to part with zephyr and much more with his own favorite galette besides it was advisable that there should be some one left to receive any stisingers that might possibly arrive as well as to keep an eye upon the herds of cattle which in the dubious prospect before them might prove to be the sole resource of the survivors of the catas trophe altogether taking into consideration that the grave fellow would incur no personal risk by remaining upon the island the captain was induced with much reluctance to forego the attendance of his servant hoping very shortly to return and to restore him to his country when he had ascertained the solution of the mysteries in which they were enveloped on the st then ben zoof was invested with governors powers and took an affecting leave of his master begging him if chance should carry him near montmartre to ascertain whether the be loved mountain had been left unmoved farewells over the dobryna was carefully steered through the creek and was soon upon the open seas chapter x a search for algeria the dobryna a strong craft of tons burden had been built in the famous shipbuilding yards of the isle of wight her seagoing qualities were excellent and would have amply sufficed for a cir cumnavigation of the globe count timascheff was himself no sailor but had the greatest confidence in leaving the command of his yacht in the hands of lieutenant procope a man of about thirty years of age and an excellent seaman born on the counts estates the son of a serf who had been emancipated long before the famous edict of the emperor alexander procope was sincerely attached by a tie of gratitude as well as of duty and affection to his patrons service after an apprenticeship on a merchant ship he had entered the imperial navy and had already reached the rank of lieutenant when the count appointed him to the charge of his own private yacht in which he was accustomed to spend by far the greater part of his time throughout the winter generally cruis ing in the mediterranean whilst in the summer he visited more northern waters the ship could not have been in better hands the lieutenant was well informed in many matters out side the pale of his profession and his attainments were alike creditable to himself and to the liberal friend who had given him his education he had an excellent crew consisting of tiglew the engineer four sailors named niegoch tolstoy etkef and ponafka and mochel the cook these men without exception were all sons of the counts tenants and so tenaciously even out at sea did they cling to their old traditions that it mattered little to them what physical disorganization ensued so long as they felt they were sharing the experiences of their lord and master the late astounding events how ever had rendered procope manifestly uneasy and not the less so from his consciousness that the count secretly partook of his own anxiety steam up and canvas spread the schooner started eastward with a favorable wind she would cer tainly have made eleven knots an hour had not the high waves somewhat impeded her progress al though only a moderate breeze was blowing the sea was rough a circumstance to be accounted for only by the diminution in the force of the earths attrac tion rendering the liquid particles so buoyant that by the mere effect of oscillation they were carried to a height that was quite unprecedented m arago has fixed twentyfive or twentysix feet as the maxi mum elevation ever attained by the highest waves and his astonishment would have been very great to see them rising fifty or even sixty feet nor did these waves in the usual way partially unfurl them selves and rebound against the sides of the vessel they might rather be described as long undulations carrying the schooner its weight diminished from the same cause as that of the water alternately to such heights and depths that if captain ser vadac had been subject to seasickness he must have found himself in sorry plight as the pitching however was the result of a long uniform swell the yacht did not labor much harder than she would against the ordinary short strong waves of the mediterranean the main inconvenience that was experienced was the diminution in her proper rate of speed for a few miles she followed the line hitherto presumably occupied by the coast of algeria but no land appeared to the south the changed posi tions of the planets rendered them of no avail for purposes of nautical observation nor could lieu tenant procope calculate his latitude and longitude by the altitude of the sun as his reckonings would be useless when applied to charts that had been constructed for the old order of things but never theless by means of the log which gave him the rate of progress and by the compass which indi cated the direction in which they were sailing he was able to form an estimate of his position that was sufficiently free from error for his immediate need happily the recent phenomena had no effect upon the compass the magnetic needle which in these regions had pointed about ì§¸ from the north pole had never deviated in the leasta proof that although east and west had apparently changed places north and south continued to retain their normal position as cardinal points the log and the compass therefore were now to be called upon to do the work of the sextant and chronometer which had become utterly useless on the first morning of the cruise lieutenant procope who like most russians spoke french fluently was explaining these peculiarities to cap tain servadac the count was present and the con versation perpetually recurred as naturally it would to the phenomena which remained so inex plicable to them all it is very evident said the lieutenant that ever since the st of january the earth has been moving in a new orbit and from some unknown cause has drawn nearer to the sun no doubt about that said servadac and i suppose that having crossed the orbit of venus we
