 amazing stories isles this fragment must be very small it must be smaller than the remaining splinter of gibraltar or ceuta otherwise surely it would never have es caped our observation however small it may be replied servadac we must find it how far off do you suppose it is it must be a hundred and twenty leagues away said the lieutenant thoughtfully and i do not quite understand how you would propose to get there why on skates of course no difficulty in that i should imagine answered servadac and he ap pealed to the count for confirmation of his opinion the count assented but procope looked doubtful your enterprise is generous he said and i should be most unwilling to throw any unnecessary obstacle in the way of its execution but pardon me if i submit to you a few considerations which to my mind are very important first of all the thermometer is already down to ì§¸ below zero and the keen wind from the south is making the tem perature absolutely unendurable in the second place supposing you travel at the rate of twenty leagues a day you would be exposed for at least six consecutive days and thirdly your expedition will be of small avail unless you convey provisions not only for yourselves but for those whom you hope to relieve we can carry our own provisions on our backs in knapsacks interposed servadac quickly un willing to recognize any difficulty in the way granted that you can answered the lieutenant quietly but where on this level icefield will you find shelter in your periods of rest you must perish with cold you will not have the chance of digging out icehuts like the esquimaux as to rest said servadac we shall take none we shall keep on our way continuously by traveling day and night without intermission we shall not be more than three days in reaching formentera believe me persisted the lieutenant calmly your enthusiasm is carrying you too far the feat you propose is impossible but even conceding the possibility of your success in reaching your destina tion what service do you imagine that you half starved and halffrozen yourself could render to those who are already perishing by want and ex posure you would only bring them away to die the obvious and dispassionate reasoning of the lieutenant could not fail to impress the minds of those who listened to him the impracticability of the journey became more and more apparent un protected on that drear expanse any traveler must assuredly succumb to the snowdrifts that were con tinually being whirled across it but hector ser vadac animated by the generous desire of rescuing a suffering fellowcreature could scarcely be brought within the bounds of common sense against his better judgment he was still bent upon the expedition and ben zoof declared himself ready to accompany his master in the event of count timascheff hesitating to encounter the peril which the undertaking involved but the count entirely repudiated all idea of shrinking from what quite as much as the captain he regarded as a sacred duty and turning to lieutenant procope told him that unless some better plan could be devised he was prepared to start off at once and make the at tempt to skate across to formentera the lieuten ant who was lost in thought made no immediate reply i wish we had a sledge said ben zoof i dare say that a sledge of some sort could be contrived said the count but then we should have no dogs or reindeers to draw it why not roughshoe the two horses they would never be able to endure the cold objected the count never mind said servadac let us get our sledge and put them to the test something must be done i think said lieutenant procope breaking his thoughtful silence that i can tell you of a sledge already provided for your hand and i can suggest a motive power surer and swifter than horses what do you mean was the eager inquiry i mean the dobrynas yawl answered the lieu tenant and i have no doubt that the wind would carry her rapidly along the ice the idea seemed admirable lieutenant procope was well aware to what marvelous perfection the americans had brought their sailsledges and had heard how in the vast prairies of the united states they had been known to outvie the speed of an ex press train occasionally attaining a rate of more than a hundred miles an hour the wind was still blowing hard from the south and assuming that the yawl could be propelled with a velocity of about fifteen or at least twelve leagues an hour he reck oned that it was quite possible to reach formentera within twelve hours that is to say in a single day between the intervals of sunrise and sunrise the yawl was about twelve feet long and capable of holding five or six people the addition of a couple of iron runners would be all that was requisite to convert it into an excellent sledge which if a sail were hoisted might be deemed certain to make a rapid progress over the smooth surface of the ice for the protection of the passengers it was proposed to erect a kind of wooden roof lined with strong cloth beneath this could be packed a supply of pro visions some warm furs some cordials and a port able stove to be heated by spirits of wine for the outward journey the wind was as favor able as could be desired but it was to be apprehend ed that unless the direction of the wind should change the return would be a matter of some diffi culty a system of tacking might be carried out to a certain degree but it was not likely that the yawl would answer her helm in any way corresponding to what would occur in the open sea captain servadac however would not listen to any representation of probable difficulties the future he said must pro vide for itself the engineer and several of the sailors set vigor ously to work and before the close of the day the yawl was furnished with a pair of stout iron run ners curved upwards in front and fitted with a metal fin designed to assist in maintaining the directness of her course the roof was put on and beneath it were stored the provisions the wraps and the cooking utensils a strong desire was expressed by lieutenant procope that he should be allowed to accompany captain servadac instead of count timascheff it was inadvisable for all three of them to go as in case of there being several persons to be rescued the
