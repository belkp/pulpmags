off on a comet whence the guns mouth projected over a sloping embrasure the two officers in cocked hats and full staff uniform attended to take charge of the proceedings the gun was maneuvered in strict accordance with the rules of the artillerymans manual and the firing commenced not unmindful of the warning he had received the corporal was most careful between each dis charge to see that every vestige of fire was extin guished so as to prevent an untimely explosion while the men were reloading and accidents such as so frequently mar public rejoicings were all happily avoided much to the chagrin of both colonel murphy and major oliphant the effect of the salute fell alto gether short of their anticipations the weight of the atmosphere was so reduced that there was com paratively little resistance to the explosive force of the gases liberated at the cannons mouth and there was consequently none of the reverberation like rolling thunder that ordinarily follows the dis charge of heavy artillery twenty times had the gun been fired and it was on the point of being loaded for the last time when the colonel laid his hand upon the arm of the man who had the ramrod stop he said we will have a ball this time let us put the range of the piece to the test a good idea replied the major corporal you hear the orders in quick time an artillerywagon was on the spot and the men lifted out a fullsized shot weighing lbs which under ordinary circumstances the cannon would carry about four miles it was pro posed by means of telescopes to note the place where the ball first touched the water and thus to obtain an approximation sufficiently accurate as to the true range having been duly charged with powder and ball the gun was raised to an angle of something under ì§¸ so as to allow proper development to the curve that the projectile would make and at a signal from the major the light was applied to the priming heavens by all thats good exclaimed both officers in one breath as standing openmouthed they hardly knew whether they were to believe the evidence of their own senses is it possible the diminution of the force of attraction at the earths surface was so considerable that the ball had sped beyond the horizon incredible ejaculated the colonel incredible echoed the major six miles at least observed the one ay more than that replied the other awhile they gazed at the sea and at each other in mute amazement but in the midst of their per plexity what sound was that which startled them was it mere fancy was it the reverberation of the cannon still booming in their ears or was it not truly the report of another and a distant gun in answer to their own attentively and eagerly they listened twice thrice did the sound repeat itself it was quite distinct there could be no mistake i told you so cried the colonel triumphantly i knew our country would not forsake us it is an english ship no doubt in half an hour two masts were visible above the horizon see was i not right our country was sure to send to our relief here is the ship yes replied the major she responded to our gun it is to be hoped muttered the corporal that our ball has done her no damage before long the hull was full in sight a long trail of smoke betokened her to be a steamer and very soon by the aid of the glass it could be as certained that she was a schooneryacht and mak ing straight for the island a flag at her mast head fluttered in the breeze and towards this the two officers with the keenest attention respectively adjusted their glasses simultaneously the two telescopes were lowered the colonel and the major stared at each other in blank astonishment russian they gasped and true it was that the flag that floated at the head of yonder mast was the blue cross of russia chapter xiv sensitive nationality when the schooner had approached the island the englishmen were able to make out the name dobryna painted on the stern a sinuous irregularity of the coast had formed a kind of cove which though hardly spacious enough for a few fishingsmacks would afford the yacht a temporary anchorage so long as the wind did not blow violently from either west or south into this cove the dob ryna was duly signaled and as soon as she was safely moored she lowered her fouroar and count timascheff and captain servadac made their way at once to land colonel heneage finch murphy and major sir john temple oliphant stood grave and prim form ally awaiting the arrival of their visitors captain servadac with the uncontrolled vivacity natural to a frenchman was the first to speak a joyful sight gentlemen he exclaimed it will give us unbounded pleasure to shake hands again with some of our fellowcreatures you no doubt have escaped the same disaster as ourselves but the english officers neither by word nor gesture made the slightest acknowledgment of this familiar greeting what news can you give us of france england or russia continued servadac perfectly uncons cious of the stolid rigidity with which his advances were received we are anxious to hear anything you can tell us have you had communications with europe have you to whom have we the honor of speaking at last interposed colonel murphy in the coldest and most measured tone and drawing himself up to his full height ah how stupid i forgot said servadac with the slightest possible shrug of the shoulders we have not been introduced then with a wave of his hand towards his com panion who meanwhile had exhibited a reserve hardly less than that of the british officers he said allow me to introduce you to count wassili timascheff major sir john temple oliphant replied the colonel the russian and the englishman mutually ex changed the stiffest of bows
