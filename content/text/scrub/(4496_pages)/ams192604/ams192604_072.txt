the thing fromoutside you mean the professor demanded dryly if thehmthis suppositious thing wants to itll do any infernal thing it takes a fancy to yes if it happens to want us but what could things like that want of us why should they come here at all oh for various reasons for inanimate objects at times and then again for living beings theyve come here lots of times i tell you jandron as serted with strange irritation and got what they wanted and then gone away tosomewhere if one of them happens to want us for any reason it will take us thats all if it doesnt want us it will ignore us as wed ignore gorillas in africa if we were looking for gold but if it was gorilla fur we wanted that would be different for the gorillas wouldnt it what in the world asked vivian could a well a thing from outside want of us what do men want say of guineapigs men experiment with em of course superior beings use inferior for their own ends to assume that man is the supreme product of evolution is gross selfconceit might not some superior thing want to experiment with human beings but how demanded marr the human brain is the most highlyorganized form of matter known to this planet suppose now nonsense interrupted the professor all hands to the sleepingbags and no more of this ive got a wretched headache lets anchor in blan ket bay he and both the women turned in jandron and marr sat a while longer by the fire they kept plenty of wood piled on it too for an unnatural chill transfixed the nightair the fire burned strangely blue with greenish flicks of flame at length after vast acerbities of disagreement the geologist and the newspaperman sought their sleepingbags the fire was a comfort not that a fire could avail a pins weight against a thing from interstellar space but subjectively it was a comfort the instincts of a million years center ing around protection by fire cannot be obliterated after a timeworn out by a day of nervestrain and of battling with swift currents of flight from something invisible intangiblethey all slept the depths of space starsprinkled hung above them with vastness immeasurable cold beyond all understanding of the human mind jandron woke first in a red dawn he blinked at the fire as he crawled from his sleepingbag the fire was dead and yet it had not burned out much wood remained unconsumed charred over as if some gigantic extinguisher had in the night been lowered over it hmmm growled jandron he glanced about him on the ledge prints too i might have known he aroused marr despite all the jouralists mocking hostility jandron felt more in common with this man of his own age than with the pro fessor who was close on sixty look here now said he it has been all around here see it put out our firemaybe the fire an noyed it some wayand it walked round us every where his gray eyes smouldered i guess by gad youve got to admit facts now the journalist could only shiver and stare lord what a head ive got on me this morning he chattered he rubbed his forehead with a shak ing hand and started for the river most of his assurance had vanished he looked badly done up well what say demanded jandron see these fresh prints damn the prints retorted marr and fell to grumbling some unintelligible thing he washed unsteadily and remained crouching at the rivers lip inert numbed jandron despite a gnawing at the base of his brain carefully examined the ledge he found prints scattered everywhere and some even on the riverbottom near the shore wherever water had collected in the prints on the rock it had frozen hard each print in the riverbed too was white with ice ice that the rushing current could not melt well by gad he exclaimed he lighted his pipe and tried to think horribly afraidyes he felt horribly afraid but determined presently as a little power of concentration came back he noticed that all the prints were in straight lines each mark about two feet from the next it was observing us while we slept said jan dron what nonsense are you talking eh demanded marr his dark heavy face sagged fire now and grub he got up and shuffled unsteadily away from the river then he stopped with a jerk staring look look a that axe he gulped pointing jandron picked up the axe by the handle taking good care not to touch the steel the blade was whitefurred with frost and deep into it punching out part of the edge one of the prints was stamped this metal said he is clean gone its been absorbed the thing doesnt recognize any differ ence in materials water and steel and rock are all the same to it youre crazy snarled the journalist how could a thing travel on one leg hopping along mak ing marks like that it could roll if it was diskshaped and a cry from the professor turned them thor burn was stumbling toward them hands out and tremulous my wife he choked vivian was kneeling beside her sister frightened dazed somethings happened stammered the profes sor here come here mrs thorburn was beyond any power of theirs to help she was still breathing but her respira tions were stertorous and a complete paralysis had stricken her her eyes halfopen and expression less showed pupils staitlingly dilated no resources of the partys drugkit produced the slightest effect on the woman the next halfhour was a confused panic break ing camp getting mrs thorburn into a canoe and leaving that accursed place with a furious energy of terror that could no longer reason upstream ever up against the swirl of the current the party fought driven by horror with no thought of food or drink
