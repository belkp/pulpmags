 amazing stories no means of judging the extent of diminution in the apparent disc of the sun did not afford sufficient basis even for an approximate calculation and captain servadac was perpetually regretting that they could receive no further tidings from the an onymous correspondent whom he persisted in re garding as a fellowcountryman the solidity of the ice was perfect the utter stillness of the air at the time when the final con gelation of the waters had taken place had resulted in the formation of a surface that for smoothness would rival a skatingrink without a crack or flaw it extended far beyond the range of vision the contrast to the ordinary aspect of polar seas was very remarkable there the icefields are an agglomeration of hummocks and icebergs massed in wild confusion often towering higher than the masts of the largest whalers and from the instabil ity of their foundations liable to an instantaneous loss of equilibrium a breath of wind a slight modi fication of the temperature not infrequently serv ing to bring about a series of changes outrivaling the most elaborate transformation scenes of a pan tomime here on the contrary the vast white plain was level as the desert of sahara or the rus sian steppes the waters of the gallian sea were imprisoned beneath the solid sheet which became continually thicker in the increasing cold accustomed to the uneven crystallizations of their own frozen seas the russians could not be other wise than delighted with the polished surface that afforded them such excellent opportunity for en joying their favorite pastime of skating a supply of skates found hidden away amongst the dob rynas stores was speedily brought into use the russians undertook the instruction of the span iards and at the end of a few days during which the temperature was only endurable through the absence of wind there was not a gallian who could not skate tolerably well while many of them could describe figures involving the most complicated curves nina and pablo earned loud applause by their rapid proficiency captain servadac an adept in athletics almost outvied his instructor the count and ben zoof who had upon some rare occa sions skated upon the lake pi montmartre in his eyes of course a sea performed prodigies in the art this exercise was not only healthful in itself but it was acknowledged that in case of necessity it might become a very useful means of locomotion as captain servadac remarked it was almost a substitute for railways and as if to illustrate this proposition lieutenant procope perhaps the great est expert in the party accomplished the twenty miles to gourbi island and back in considerably less than four hours the temperature meanwhile continued to de crease and the average reading of the thermometer was about ì§¸ c below zero the light also dimin ished in proportion and all objects appeared to be enveloped in a halfdefined shadow as though the sun were undergoing a perpetual eclipse it was not surprising that the effect of this continuously overhanging gloom should be to induce a frequent depression of spirits amongst the majority of the little population exiles as they were from their mother earth and not unlikely as it seemed to be swept far away into the regions of another planet ary sphere probably count timascheff captain servadac and lieutenant procope were the only members of the community who could bring any scientific judgment to bear upon the uncertainty that was before them but a general sense of the strangeness of their situation could not fail at times to weigh heavily upon the minds of all under these circumstances it was very necessary to counteract the tendency to despond by continual diversion and the recreation of skating thus op portunely provided seemed just the thing to arouse the flagging spirits and to restore a wholesome excitement with dogged obstinacy isaac hakkabut refused to take any share either in the labors or the amuse ments of the colony in spite of the cold he had not been seen since the day of his arrival from gourbi island captain servadac had strictly for bidden any communication with him and the smoke that rose from the cabin chimney of the hansa was the sole indication of the proprietor being still on board there was nothing to prevent him if he chose from partaking gratuitously of the volcanic light and heat which were being enjoyed by all be sides but rather than abandon his close and per sonal oversight of his precious cargo he preferred to sacrifice his own slender stock of fuel both the schooner and the tartan had been care fully moored in the way that seemed to promise best for withstanding the rigor of the winter after seeing the vessels made secure in the frozen creek lieutenant procope following the example of many arctic explorers had the precaution to have the ice beveled away from the keels so that there should be no risk of the ships sides being crushed by the increasing pressure he hoped that they would follow any rise in the level of the ice field and when the thaw should come that they would easily regain their proper waterline on his last visit to gourbi island the lieutenant had ascertained that north east and west far as the eye could reach the gallian sea had become one uniform sheet of ice one spot alone refused to freeze this was the pool immediately below the central cavern the receptacle for the stream of burning lava it was entirely enclosed by rocks and if ever a few icicles were formed there by the action of the cold they were very soon melted by the fiery shower hissing and spluttering as the hot lava came in contact with it the water was in a continual state of ebullition and the fish that abounded in its depths defied the anglers craft they were as ben zoof remarked too much boiled to bite at the beginning of april the weather changed the sky became overcast but there was no rise in the temperature unlike the polar winters of the earth which ordinarily are affected by atmospheric influence and liable to slight intermissions of their severity at various shiftings of the wind gallias winter was caused by her immense distance from the source of all light and heat and the cold was consequently destined to go on steadily increasing until it reached the limit ascertained by fourier to be the normal temperature of the realms of space with the overclouding of the heavens there arose a violent tempest but although the wind raged with an almost inconceivable fury it was unac companied by either snow or rain its effect upon
