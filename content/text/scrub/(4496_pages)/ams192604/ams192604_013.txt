 amazing stories i am puzzled dont you see the sun is in the west it must be near setting setting captain why it is rising finely like a conscript at the sound of the reveille it is con siderably higher since we have been talking incredible as it might appear the fact was un deniable that the sun was rising over the shelif from that quarter of the horizon behind which it usually sank for the latter portion of its daily round they were utterly bewildered some mys terious phenomenon must not only have altered the position of the sun in the sidereal system but must even have brought about an important modi fication of the earths rotation on her axis captain servadac consoled himself with the pros pect of reading an explanation of the mystery in next weeks newspapers and turned his attention to what was to him of more immediate importance come let us be off said he to his orderly though heaven and earth be topsyturvy i must be at my post this morning to do count timascheff the honor of running him through the body added ben zoof if servadac and his orderly had been less pre occupied they would have noticed that a variety of other physical changes besides the apparent altera tion in the movement of the sun had been evolved during the atmospheric disturbances of that new years night as they descended the steep footpath leading from the cliff towards the shelif they were conscious that their respiration became forced and rapid like that of a mountaineer when he has reached an altitude where the air has become less charged with oxygen they were also conscious that their voices were thin and feeble either they must themselves have become rather deaf or it was evident that the air had become less capable of transmitting sound the weather which on the previous evening had been very foggy had entirely changed the sky had assumed a singular tint and was soon covered with lowering clouds that completely hid the sun there were indeed all the signs of a coming storm but the vapor on account of the insufficient condensa tion failed to fall the sea appeared quite deserted a most unusual circumstance along this coast and not a sail nor a trail of smoke broke the gray monotony of water and sky the limits of the horizon too had be come much circumscribed on land as well as on sea the remote distance had completely disappeared and it seemed as though the globe had assumed a more decided convexity at the pace at which they were walking it was very evident that the captain and his attendant would not take long to accomplish the three miles that lay between the gourbi and the place of ren dezvous they did not exchange a word but each was conscious of an unusual buoyancy which ap peared to lift up their bodies and give as it were wings to their feet if ben zoof had expressed his sensations in words he would have said that he felt up to anything and he had even forgotten to taste so much as a crust of bread a lapse of memory of which the worthy soldier was rarely guilty as these thoughts were crossing his mind a harsh bark was heard to the left of the footpath and a jackal was seen emerging from a large grove of lentisks regarding the two wayfarers with manifest uneasiness the beast took up its position at the foot of a rock more than thirty feet in height it belonged to an african species dis tinguished by a black spotted skin and a black line down the front of the legs at nighttime when they scour the country in herds the crea tures are somewhat formidable but singly they are no more dangerous than a dog though by no means afraid of them ben zoof had a particular aversion to jackals perhaps because they had no place among the fauna of his beloved montmartre he accordingly began to make threatening gestures when to the unmitigated astonishment of himself and the captain the animal darted forward and in one single bound gained the summit of the rock good heavens cried ben zoof that leap must have been thirty feet at least true enough replied the captain i never saw such a jump meantime the jackal had seated itself upon its haunches and was staring at the two men with an air of impudent defiance this was too much for ben zoofs forbearance and stooping down he caught up a huge stone when to his surprise he found that it was no heavier than a piece of petri fied sponge confound the brute he exclaimed i might as well throw a piece of bread at him what accounts for its being as light as this nothing daunted however he hurled the stone into the air it missed its aim but the jackal deeming it on the whole prudent to decamp dis appeared across the trees and hedges with a series of bounds which could only be likened to those that might be made by an indiarubber kangaroo ben zoof was sure that his own powers of propelling must equal those of a howitzer for his stone after a lengthened flight through the air fell to the ground full five hundred paces the other side of the rock the orderly was now some yards ahead of his master and had reached a ditch full of water and about ten feet wide with the intention of clear ing it he made a spring when a loud cry burst from servadac ben zoof you idiot what are you about you will break your back and well might he be alarmed for ben zoof had sprung to a height of forty feet into the air fear ful of the consequences that would attend the des cent of his servant to terra firma servadac bounded forwards to be on the other side of the ditch in time to break his fall but the muscular effort that he made carried him in his turn to an altitude of thirty feet in his ascent he passed ben zoof who had al ready commenced his downward course and then obedient to the laws of gravitation he descended with increasing rapidity and alighted upon the earth without experiencing a shock greater than if he had merely made a bound of four or five feet high ben zoof burst into a roar of laughter bravo he said we should make a good pair of clowns but the captain was inclined to take a more seri ous view of the matter for a few seconds he stood lost in thought then said solemnly ben zoof i must be dreaming pinch me hard i must be either asleep or mad it is very certain that something has happened to us said ben zoof i have occasionally dreamed
