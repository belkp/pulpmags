the man who saved the earth danger past vigor of the ring is abating cal culation has deduced that the wave is slowly de creasing in potentiality it is too early yet to say that there will be recessions as the wave is just reaching its zenith what it is we cannot say but it cannot be inexplicable after a little time it will all be explained say to the world there is no cause for alarm but the world was now aroused as it doubted the truth before it doubted now the reassurance did the scientists know could they have only seen the future we know now that they did not there was but one man in all the world great enough to foresee disaster that man was charley huyck chapter iii the mountain that was on the same day on which all this happened a young man pizzozi by name and of italian paren tage left the little town of lone in amador county california with a small truckload of salt he was one of the cattlemen whose headquarters or homefarms are clustered about the foothills of the sierras in the wet season they stay with their homeland in the valley in the summer they pene trate into the mountains pizzozi had driven in from the mountains the night before after salt he had been on the road since midnight two thousand salthungry cattle do not allow time for gossip with the thrift of his race joe had loaded up his truck and after a running snatch at breakfast was headed back into the mountains when the news out of oakland was thrilling around the world he was far into the sierras the summer quarters of pizzozi were close to mt heckla whose looming shoulders rose square in the center of the pasture of the three brothers it was not a noted mountainthat is until this dayand had no reason for a name other than that it was a peak outstanding from the range like a thousand others rugged pine clad coated with deerbrush red soil and mountain miserie it was the deerbrush that gave it value to the pizzozisa succulent feed richer than alfalfa in the early summer they would come up with bony cattle when they returned in the fall they went out driving beefsteaks but inland cattle must have more than forage salt is the tincture that makes them healthy it was far past the time of the regular salting pizzozi was in a hurry it was nine oclock when he passed through the raining town of jackson and by twelve oclockthe minute of the disasterhe was well beyond the last little hamlet that linked up with civilization it was four oclock when he drew up at the little pinesheltered cabin that was his headquarters for the summer he had been on the road since midnight he was tired the long weary hours of driving the grades the unvaried stress though the deep red dust the heat the stretch of a night and day had worn both mind and muscle it had been his turn to go after salt now that he was here he could lie in for a bit of rest while his brothers did the salting it was a peaceful spot this cabin of the piz zozis nestled among the virgin shade trees great tall feathery sugarpines with a mountain liveoak spreading over the door yard to the east the rising heights of the sierras misty graygreen undulating into the distance to the pinkwhite snow crests of little alpine below in the canyon the waters of the mokolumne to the west the heavy dark masses of mt heckla deep verdant in the cool of coming evening joe drew up under the shade of the live oak the air was full of cool sweet scent of the afternoon no moment could have been more peaceful the blue clear sky overhead the breath of summer and the soothing spice of the pine trees a shepherd dog came bounding from the doorway to meet him it was his favorite cow dog usually when joe came back the dog would be far down the road to forestall him he had wondered absently coming up at the dogs delay a dog is most of all a creature of habit only something unusual would detain him however the dog was here as the man drew up he rushed out to greet him a rush a circle a bark and a whine of welcome perhaps the dog had been asleep but joe noticed that whine he was wise in the ways of dogs when ponto whined like that there was something unusual it was not effusive or spontaneous but rather of the delight of succor after scarce a minute of petting the dog squatted and faced to the westward his whine was start ling almost fearful pizzozi knew that something was wrong the dog drew up his stub tail erect and his hair all bristled one look was for his master and the other whining and alert to mt heckla puzzled joe gazed at the mountain but he saw nothing was it the canine instinct or was it coincidence we have the aceount from pizzozi from the words of the italian the dog was afraid it was not the way of ponto usually in the face of danger he was alert and eager now he drew away to the cabin joe wondered inside the shack he found nothing but evidence of departure there was no sign of his brothers at was his turn to go to sleep he was wearied almost to numbness for fortyeight hours he had not closed an eyelid on the table were a few unwashed dishes and crumbs of eating one of the three rifles that hung usually on the wall was missing the cof fee pot was on the floor with the lid open on the bed the coverlets wยงre mussed up it was a temp tation to go to sleep back of him the open door and ponto the whine of the dog drew his will and his consciousness into correlation a faint rustle in the sugarpines soughed from the canyon joe watched the dog the sun was just glowing over the crest of the mountain on the western line the deep lacy silhouettes of the pine trees and the bare bald head of heckla what was it his brothers should be on hand for the salting it was not their custom to put things off for the morrow shading his eyes he stepped out of the doorway the dog rose stealthily and walked behind him uneasily with the same insistent whine and ruffled hair joe listened only the mountain murmurs the sweet breath of the forest and in the lapse of bated breath the rippling melody of the river far below him what you see ponto what you see at the words the dog sniffed and advanced slight
