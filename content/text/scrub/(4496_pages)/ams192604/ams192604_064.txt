the new accelerator with him he had dashed forward snatched the un fortunate animal out of visible existence and was runniug violently with it towards the cliff of the leas it was most extraordinary the little brute you know didnt bark or wriggle or make the slightest sign of vitality it kept quite stiffly in an attitude of somnolent repose and gibberne held it by the neck it was like running about with a dog of wood gibberne i cried put it down then i said something else if you run like that gib berne i cried youll set your clothes on fire your linen trousers are going brown as it is he clapped his hand on his thigh and stood hesitating on the verge gibberne i cried com ing up put it down this heat is too much its our running so two or three miles a second fric tion of the air what he said glancing at the dog friction of the air i shouted friction of the air going too fast like meteorites and things too hot and gibberne gibberne im all over pricking and a sort of perspiration you cansee people stirring slightly i believe the stuffs work ing off put that dog down eh he said its working off i repeated were too hot and the stuffs working off im wet through he stared at me then at the band the wheezy rattle of whose performance was certainly going faster then with a tremendous sweep of his arm he hurled the dog away from him and it went spin ning upward still inanimate and hung at last over the grouped parasols of a knot of chattering people gibberne was gripping my elbow by jove he cried i believe it is a sort of hot pricking and yes that mans moving his pockethandkerchief perceptibly we must get out of this sharp but we could not get out of it sharply enough luckily perhaps for we might have run and if we had run we should i believe have burst into flames almost certainly we should have burst into flames you know we had neither of us thought of that but before we could even begin to run the action of the drug had ceased it was the business of a minute fraction of a second the effect of the new accelerator passed like the draw ing of a curtain vanished in the movement of a hand i heard gibbernes voice in infinite alarm sit down he said and flop down upon the turf at the edge of the leas i satscorching as i sat there is a patch of burnt grass there still where i sat down the whole stagnation seemed to wake up as i did so the disarticulated vibiation of the band rushed together into a blast of music the promenaders put their feet down and walked their ways the papers and flags began flapping smiles passed into words the winker finished his wink and went on his way complacently and all the seated people moved and spoke the whole world had come alive again was going as fast as we were or rather we were going no faster than the rest of the world it was like slowing down as one comes into a railway station everything seemed to spin around for a second or two i had the most transient feeling of nausea and that was all and the little dog which had seemed to hang for a moment when the force of gibbernes arm was expended fell with a swift acceleration clean through a ladys parasol that was the saving of us unless it was for one corpulent old gentleman in a bathchair who cer tainly did start at the sight of us and afterwards regarded us at intervals with a darkly suspicious eye and finally i believe said something to his nurse about us doubt if a solitary person re marked our sudden appearance among them plop we must have appeared abruptly we ceased to smoulder almost at once though the turf beneath me was uncomfortably hot the attention of everyone including even the amusements association band which on this occasion for the only time in its history got out of tune was arrested by the amazing fact and the still more amazing yapping and uproar caused by the fact that a respectable overfed lapdog sleeping quietly to the east of the bandstand should suddenly fall through the parasol of a lady on the westin a slightly singed condition due to the ex treme velocity of its movements through the air in these absurd days too when we are all trying to be as psychic and silly and superstitious as possible people got up and trod on other people chairs were overturned the leas policeman ian how the matter settled itself i do not knowwe were much too anxious to disentangle ourselves from the affair and get out of range of the eye of the old gentleman in the bathchair to make minute inquiries as soon as we were sufficiently cool and sufficiently recovered from our giddiness and nausea and confusion of mind to do so we stood up and skirting the crowd directed our steps back along the road below the metropole towards gibbernes house but amidst the din i heard very distinctly the gentleman who had been sitting beside the lady of the ruptured sunshade using quite unjustifiable threats and language to one of those chairattend ants who have inspector written on their caps if you didnt throw the dog he said who did the sudden return of movement and familiar noises and our natural anxiety about onrselves our clothes were still dreadfully hot and the fronts of the thighs of gibbernes white trousers were scorched a drabbish brown prevented the minute observations i should have liked to make on all these things indeed i really made no observations of any scientific value on that return the bee of course had gone i looked for that cyclist but he was already out of sight as we came into the upper sandgate hoad or hidden from us by traffic the charabanc however with its people now all alive and stirring was clattering along at a spanking pace almost abreast of the nearer church we noted however that the windowsill on which we had stepped in getting out of the house was slightly singed and that the impressions of our feet on the gravel of the path were unusually deep so it was i had my first experience of the new accelerator practically we had been running about and saying and doing all sorts of things in the space of a second or so of time we had lived half an hour while the band had played perhaps two bars but the effect it had upon us was that the whole world had stopped for our convenient inspection considering all things and particularly considering our rashness in venturing out of the house the experience might certainly have been much more disagreeable than it was it showed no doubt that gibberne has still much to learn before his continued on page
