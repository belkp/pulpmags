the man who saved the earth gone to school were now playing with the destiny of the earth but only huyck knew it winters wondered through miles and miles of fleeting sagebrush cacti and sand and desolation he rolled over the problem steady as a rock slight ly stooped grim and as certain as steel he held to the north charley huyck by his side hatless coat less his hair dancing to the wind all impatience why was it surely a man even for death would have time to get his hat the whole thing spelled speed to bob winters perhaps it was the infusion of spirit or the inten sity of his companion but the thrill ran into his vitals thirty thousand dollarsfor a stake like thatwhat was the balance he had been called wild bob for his daring some had called him in sane on this night his insanity was enchantment it was wild the lee of the giant roadster a whir ring shower of gravel into the darkness into the night the car fought over the distance the terrific momentum and the friction of the air fought in their faces huycks face was unprotected in no time his lips were cracked and long before they had crossed the level his whole face was bleeding but he heeded it not he only knew that they were moving that slowly minute by minute they were cutting down the odds that bore disaster in his mind a maze of figures the terrible sight he had seen in the telescope and the thing impending why had he kept his secret over and again he impeached himself and dr robold it had come to this the whole world sleeping and only himself to save it oh for a few minutes for one short moment would he get it at last they reached the mountains a rough rocky road and but little traveled happily winters had made it once before and knew it he took it with every bit of speed they could stand but even at that it was diminished to a minimum for hours they fought over grades and gulches dry washouts and boulders it was dawn and the sky was growing pink when they rode down again upon the level it was here that they ran across their first trouble and it was here that winters began to realize vaguely what a race they might be running the particular level which they had entered was an elbow of the desert projecting into the mountains just below a massive newly constructed dam the reservoir had but lately been filled and all was being put in readiness for the dedication an immense sheet of water extending far back into the mountainsit was intended before long to transform the desert into a garden below in the valley was a town already the center of a prosper ous irrigation settlement but soon with the added area to become a flourishing city the elbow where they struck it was perhaps twenty miles across their northward path would take them just outside the tip where the foothills of the opposite mountain chain melted into the desert without ado winters put on all speed and plunged across the sands and then it was much like winking but for all that some thing far more impressive to winters on the left hand of the car and with the east on the right hand it was much as if the sun had suddenly leaped up and as suddenly plumped down behind the horizon a vast vividness of scintillating opalescence an azure flaming diamond shot by a million fire points instantaneous and beautiful in the pale dawn of the desert air its wonder and color were beyond all beauty winters caught it out of the corner of his eye it was so instantaneous and so illusive that he was not certain instinctively he looked to his companion but charley too had seen it his attitude of waiting and hoping was vigorized into vivid action he knew just what it was with one hand he clutched winters and fairly shouted on on bob on as you value your life put into her every bit of speed you have got at the same instant at the same breath came a roar that was not to be forgotten crunching roll ing terriblelike the mountain moving bob knew it it was the dam something had broken it to the east the great wall of water fall out of the mountains a beautiful sight and ter rible a relentless glassy roller fringed along its base by a lace of racing foam the upper part was as smooth as crystal the storedup waters of the mountain moving out compactly the man thought of the little town below and its peril but huyck thought also he shouted in winters ear never mind the town keep straight north over yonder to the point of the water the town will have to drown it was inexorable there was no pity the very strength and purpose of the command drove into the others understanding dimly now he realized that they were really running a race against time winters was a daredevil the very catastrophe sent a thrill of exultation through him it was the cli max the great moment of his life to be driving at a hundred miles an hour under that wall of water the roar was terrible before they were half across it seemed to the two men that the very sound would drown them there was nothing in the world but pandemonium the strange flash was forgotten in the terror of the living wall that was reaching out to engulf them like insects they whizzed in the open face of the deluge when they had reached the tip they were so close that the out running fringe of the surf was at their wheels around the point with the wide open plain be fore them with the flood behind them it was noth ing to outrun it the waters with a wider stretch spread out in a few moments they had left all be hind them but winters wondered what was the strange flash of evanescent beauty he knew this dam and its construction to outlast the centuries it had been whiffed in a second it was not lightning he had heard no sound other than the rush of the waters he looked to his companion hucyk nodded thats the thing we are racing we have only a few hours can we make it bob had thought that he was getting all the speed possible out of his motor what it yielded from that moment on was a revelation it is not safe and hardly possible to be driving at such speed on the desert only the best car and a firm roadway can stand it a sudden rut squirrel hole or pocket of sand is as good as destruction they rushed on till noon
