 amazing stories claimed ben zoof if every household could be furnished with its own private volcano the large cavern at the general junction of the galleries was fitted up as a drawingroom and ar ranged with all the best furniture both of the gourbi and of the cabin of the dobryna hither was also brought the shooners library containing a good variety of french and russian books lamps were suspended over the different tables and the walls of the apartment were tapestried with the sails and adorned with the flags belonging to the yacht the curtain of fire extending over the opening of the cavern provided it as already stated with light and heat the torrent of lava fell into a small rockbound basin that had no apparent communication with the sea and was evidently the aperture of a deep abyss of which the waters heated by the descent of the eruptive matter would no doubt retain their liquid condition long after the gallian sea had be come a sheet of ice a small excavation to the left of the common hall was allotted for the special use of servadac and the count another on the right was appropriated to the lieutenant and ben zoof whilst a third recess im mediately at the back made a convenient little chamber for nina the spaniards and the russian sailors took up their sleepingquarters in the ad jacent galleries and found the temperature quite comfortable such were the internal arrangements of ninas hive the refuge where the little colony were full of hope that they would be able to brave the rigors of the stern wintertime that lay before thema wintertime during which gallia might possibly be projected even to the orbit of jupiter where the temperature would not exceed one twentyfifth of the normal winter temperature of the earth the only discontented spirit was isaac hakka but throughout all the preparations which roused even the spaniards to activity the jew still in credulous and deaf to every representation of the true state of things insisted upon remaining in the creek at gourbi island nothing could induce him to leave his tartan where like a miser he would keep guard over his precious cargo ever grumbling and growling but with his weathereye open in the hope of catching sight of some passing sail it must be owned that the whole party were far from sorry to be relieved of his presence his uncomely figure and repulsive countenance was a perpetual bugbear he had given out in plain terms that he did not intend to part with any of his property except for current money and servadac equally resolute had strictly forbidden any pur chases to be made hoping to wear out the rascals obstinacy hakkabut persistently refused to credit the real situation he could not absolutely deny that some portions of the terrestrial globe had undeigone a certain degree of modification but nothing could bring him to believe that he was not sooner or later to resume his old line of business in the med iterranean with his wonted distrust of all with whom he came in contact he regarded every argu ment that was urged upon him only as evidence of a plot that had been devised to deprive him of his goods repudiating as he did utterly the hypo thesis that a fragment had beome detached from the earth he scanned the horizon for hours to gether with an old telescope the case of which had been patched up till it looked like a rusty stovepipe hoping to descry the passing trader with which he might effect some bartering jpon advantageous terms at first he professed to regard the proposed re moval into winterquarters as an attempt to impose upon his credulity but the frequent voyages made by the dobryna to the south and the repeated con signments of corn and cattle soon served to make him aware that captain servadac and his compan ions were really contemplating a departure from gourbi island the movement set him thinking what he be gan to ask himselfwhat if all that was told him was true what if this sea was no longer the mediterranean what if he should never again behold his german fatherland what if his marts for business were gone for ever a vague idea of ruin began to take possession of his mind he must yield to necessity he must do the best he could as the result of his cogitations he occa sionally left his tartan and made a visit to the shore at length he endeavored to mingle with the busy group who were hurrying on their prep arations but his advances were only met by jeers and scorn and ridiculed by all the rest he was fain to turn his attention to ben zoof to whom he of fered a few pinches of tobacco no old

french officer to deceive a poor old man like himself tell you the truth man cried servadac con found it i have told you the truth twenty times once for all i tell you now you have left yourself
