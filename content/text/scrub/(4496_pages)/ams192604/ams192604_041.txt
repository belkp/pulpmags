 amazing stories most to regald the coming of the child as the ap pearance of an angel and incredible as it may seam more than one of them wondered whether she had wings and amongst themselves they commonly referred to her as the little madonna soon out of sight of madalena the dobryna for some hours held a southeasterly course along the shore which here was fifty leagues in advance of the former coastline of italy demonstrating that a new continent must have been formed substituted as it were for the old peninsula of which not a vestige could be identified at a latitude corre sponding with the latitude of rome the sea took the form of a deep gulf extending back far beyond the site of the eternal city the coast making a wide sweep round to the former position of cala bria and jutting far beyond the outline of the boot which italy resembles but the beacon of messina was not to be discerned no trace indeed survived of any portion of sicily the very peak of etna feet as it had reared itself above the level of the sea had vanished utterly another sixty leagues to the south and the dob ryna sighted the entrance of the strait which had afforded her so piovidential a refuge from the tempest and had conducted her to the fragmentary relic of gibraltar hence to the gulf of cabes had been already explored and as it was universally al lowed that it was unnecessary to renew the search in that direction the lieutenant started off in a transverse course towards a point hitherto unin vestigated that point was reached on the rd of march and thence the coast was continuously fol lowed as it led through what had been tunis across the province of constantine away to the oasis of ziban where taking a sharp turn it first reached a latitude of ì§¸ n and then returned again thus forming a sort of irregular gulf enclosed by the same unvarying border of mineral concrete this colossal boundary then stretched away for nearly leagues over the sahara desert and extending to the south of gourbi island occupied what if morocco had still existed would have been its natural frontier adapting her course to these deviations of the coastline the dobryna was steering northwards and had barely reached the limit of the bay when the attention of all on board was arrested by the phenomenon of a volcano at least feet high its crater crowned with smoke which occasionally was streaked by tongues of flame a burning mountain they exclaimed gallia then has some internal heat said ser vadac and why not captain rejoined the lieutenant if our asteroid has carried with it a portion of the old earths atmosphere why should it not like wise retain something of its central fire ah welll said the captain shrugging his shoulders i dare say there is caloric enough in our little world to supply the wants of its popula tion count timascheff interrupted the silence that followed this conversation by saying and now gentlemen as our course has brought us on our way once more towards gibraltar what do you say to our renewing our acquaintance with the english men they will be interested in the result of our voyage for my part said servadac i have no desire that way they know where to find gourbi island they can betake themselves thither just when they please they have plenty of provisions if the water freezes leagues is no very great distance the reception they gave us was not so cordial that we need put ourselves out of the way to repeat our visit what you say is too true replied the count i hope we shall show them better manners when they condescend to visit us ay said servadac we must remember that we are all one people now no longer russian french or english nationality is extinct i am sadly afraid however continued the count that an englishman will be an englishman ever yes said the captain that is always their failing and thus all further thought of making their way again to the little garrison of gibraltar was abandoned but even if their spirit of courtesy had disposed them to renew their acquaintance with the british officers there were two circumstances that just then would have rendered such a proposal very in advisable in the first place lieutenant procope was convinced that it could not be much longer now before the sea would be entirely frozen and besides this the consumption of their coal through the speed they had maintained had been so great that there was only too much reason to fear that fuel would fail them anyhow the strictest econ omy was necessary and it was accordingly resolved that the voyage should not be much prolonged be yond the volcanic peak moreover the waters seemed to expand into a boundless ocean and it might be a thing full of risk to be frozen up while the yacht was so inadequately provisioned taking all these things into account it was agreed that further in vestigations should be deferred to a more favorable season and that without delay the dobryna should return to gourbi island this decision was especially welcome to hector servadac who throughout the whole of the last five weeks had been agitated by much anxious thought on account of the faithful servant he had left behind the transit from the volcano to the island was not long and was marked by only one noticeable incident this was the finding of a second mysteri ous document in character precisely similar to what they had found before the writer of it was evi dently engaged upon a calculation probably con tinued from day to day as to the motions of the planet gallia upon its orbit and committing the results of his reckonings to the waves as the chan nel of communication instead of being enclosed in a telescopecase it was this time secured in a preservedmeat tin hermetically sealed and stamped with the same initials on the wax that fastened it the greatest care was used in opening it and it was found to contain the following message gallia ab sole au mars dist chemin parcouru de fev a mars va bene all right nil desperandum enchante
