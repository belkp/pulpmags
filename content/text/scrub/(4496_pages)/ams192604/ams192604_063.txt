 amazing stories curtain frozen as it were corner high in the act of flapping briskly in the breeze no said i thats odd and here he said and opened the hand that held the glass naturally i winced expecting the glass to smash but so far from smashing it did not even seem to stir it hung in midairmotion less roughly speaking said gibberne an ob ject in these latitudes falls feet in a second now only you see it hasnt fallen yet for the hundredth part of a second that gives you some idea of the pace of my accelerator and he waved his hand round and round over and under the slowly sinking glass finally he took it by the bottom pulled it down and placed it very carefully on the table eh he said to me and laughed that seems all right i said and began very gingerly to raise myself from my chair i felt per fectly well very light and comfortable and quite confident in my mind i was going fast all over my heart for example was beating a thousand times a second but that caused me no discomfort at all i looked out of the window an immovable cyclist head down and with a frozen puff of dust behind his drivingwheel scorched to overtake a galloping charabanc that did not stir i gaped in amazement at this incredible spectacle gibberne i cried how long will this confounded stuff last heaven knows he answered last time i took it went to bed and slept it off i tell you i was frightened it must have lasted some minutes i thinkit seemed like hours but after a bit it slows down rather suddenly i believe i was proud to observe that i did not feel fright enedi suppose because there were two of us why shouldnt we go out i asked why not theyll see us not they goodness no we shall be going a thousand times faster than the quickest con juring trick that was ever done come along which way shall we go window or door and out by the window we went assuredly of all the strange experiences that i have ever had or imagined or read of other people having or imagining that little raid i made with gibberne on the folkestone leas under the in fluence of the new accelerator was the strangest and maddest of all we went out by his gate into the road and there we made a minute examination of the statuesque passing traffic the tops of the wheels and some of the legs of the horses of this charabanc the end of the whiplash and the lower jaw of the conductorwho was just beginning to yawnwere perceptibly in motion but all the rest of the lumbering conveyance seemed still and quite noiseless except for a faint rattling that came from one mans throat and as parts of this frozen edifice there were a driver you know and a conductor and eleven people the effect as we walked about the thing began by being madly queer and ended by beingdisagreeable there they were people like ourselves and yet not like ourselves frozen in care less attitudes caught in midgesture a girl and a man smiled at one another a leering smile that threatened to last for evermore a woman in a floppy capelline rested her arm on the rail and stared at gibbernes house with the unwinking stare of eternity a man stroked his mustaohe like a figure of wax and another stretched a tiresome stiff hand with extended fingers towards his loosened hat we stared at them we laughed at them we made faces at them and then a sort of disgust of them came upon us and we turned away and walked around in front of the cyclist towards the leas goodness cried gibberne suddenly look there he pointed and there at the tip of his finger and sliding down the air with wings flapping slowly and at the speed of an exceptionally languid srailwas a bee and so we came out upon the leas there the thing seemed madder than ever the band was playing in the upper stand though all the sound it made for us was a lowpitched wheezy rattle a sort of prolonged last sigh that passed at times into a sound like the slow muffled ticking of some mon strous clock frozen people stood erect strange silent selfconsciouslooking dummies hung unstab ly in midstride promenading upon the grass i passed close to a little poodle dog suspended in the act of leaping and watched the slow movement of his legs as he sank to earth lord look here cried gibberne and we halted a moment before a magnifi cent person in white faintstriped flannels white shoes and a panama hat who turned back to wink at two gaily dressed ladies he had passed a wink studied with such leisurely deliberation as we could afford is an unattractive thing it loses any quality of alert gaiety and one remarks that the winking eye does not completely close that under its drooping lid appears the lower edge of an eye ball and a little line of white heaven give me memory said i and i will never wink again or smile said gibberne with his eye on the ladys answering teeth its infernally hot somehow said i lets go slower oh come along said gibberne we picked our way among the bathchairs in the path many of the people sitting in the chairs seemed almost natural in their passive poses but the contorted scarlet of the bandsmen was not a restful thing to see a purplefaced little gentle man was frozen in the midst of a violent struggle to refold his newspaper against the wind there were many evidences that all these people in their sluggish way were exposed to a considerable breeze a breeze that had no existence so far as our sensa tions went we came out and walked a little way from the crowd and turned and regarded it to see all that multitude changed to a picture smitten rigid as it were into the semblance of realistic wax was impossibly wonderful it was absurd of course but it filled me with an irrational an exultant sense of superior advantage consider the wonder of it all that i had said and thought and done since the stuff had begun to work in my veins had happened so far as those people so far as the world in general went in the twinkling of an eye the new ac celerator i began but gibberne interrupted me theres that infernal old woman he said what old woman lives next door to me said gibberne has a lapdog that yaps gods the temptation is strong there is something very boyish and impulsive about gibberne at times before i could expostulate
