 amazing stories dacs ears besieged with descriptions of the unpar alleled beauties and advantages of this eighteenth arrondissement of paris that he could scarcely hear the name of montmartre without a conscious thrill of aversion ben zoof however did not des pair of ultimately converting the captain and meanwhile had resolved never to leave him when a private in the th cavalry he had been on the point of quitting the army at twentyeight years of age but unexpectedly he had been appointed orderly to captain servadac side by side they fought in two campaigns servadac had saved ben zoofs life in japan ben zoof had rendered his master a like service in the soudan the bond of union thus effected could never be severed and although ben zoofs achievements had fairly earned him the right of retirement he firmly declined all honors or any pension that might part him from his superior officer two stout arms an iron constitu tion a powerful frame and an indomitable courage were all loyally devoted to his masters service and fairly entitled him to his soidisant designation or the rampart of montmartre unlike his master he made no pretension to any gift of poetic power but his inexhaustible memory made him a living en cycloptedia and for his stock of anecdotes and trooperss tales he was matchless thoroughly appreciating his servants good qual ities captain servadac endured with imperturbable good humor those idiosyncrasies which in a less faithful follower would have been intolerable and from time to time he would drop a word of sympa thy that served to deepen his subordinates devotion on one occasion when ben zoof had mounted his hobbyhorse and was indulging in highflown praises about his beloved eighteenth arrondisse ment the captain had remarked gravely do you know ben zoof that montmartre only requires a matter of some thirteen thousand feet to make it as high as mont blanc ben zoofs eyes glistened with delight and from that moment hector servadac and montmartre held equal places in his affection chapter iii interrupted effusions composed of mud and loose stones and covered with a thatch of turf and straw known to the na tives by the name of driss the gourbi though a grade better than the tents of the nomad arabs was yet far inferior to any habitation built of brick or stone it adjoined an old stone hostelry previously occupied by a detachment of engineers and which now afforded shelter for ben zoof and the two horses it still contained a considerable number of tools such as mattocks shovels and pickaxes uncomfortable as was their temporary abode servadac and his attendant made no complaints neither of them was dainty in the matter either of board or lodging after dinner leaving his orderly to stow away the remains of the repast in what he was pleased to term the cupboard of his stomach captain servadac turned out into the open air to smoke his pipe upon the edge of the cliff the shades of night were drawing on an hour previ ously veiled in heavy clouds the sun had sunk below the horizon that bounded the plain beyond the shelif the sky presented a most singular appearance towards the north although the darkness rendered it impossible to see beyond a quarter of a mile the upper strata of the atmosphere were suffused with a rosy glare no welldefined fringe of light nor arch of luminous rays betokened a display of aurora borealis even had such a phenomenon been possible in these latitudes and the most experienced meteor ologist would have been puzzled to explain the cause of this striking illumination on this st of decem ber the last evening of the passing year but captain servadac was no meteorologist and it is to be doubted whether since leaving school he had ever opened his course of cosmography besides he had other thoughts to occupy his mind the prospects of the morrow offered serious matter for consideration the captain was actuated by no personal animosity against the count though rivals the two men regarded each other with sin cere respect they had simply reached a crisis in which one of them was de trop which of them fate must decide at eight oclock captain servadac reentered the gourbi the

and ensconcing himself in a corner of the gourbi he endeavored to dozea task which the unusual agitation of his master rendered somewhat difficult captain servadac was evidently in no hurry to betake himself to rest but seating himself at his table with a pair of compasses and a sheet of drawingpaper he began to draw with red and blue crayons a variety of colored lines which could hardly be supposed to have much connection with a topographical survey in truth his char acter of staffofficer was now entirely absorbed in that of gascon poet whether he imagined that the compasses would bestow upon his verses the meas ure of a mathematical accuracy or whether he fan cied that the particolored lines would lend variety to his rhythm it is impossible to determine be that as it may he was devoting all his energies to the compilation of his rondo and supremely difficult he found the task hang it he ejaculated whatever induced me to choose this meter it is as hard to find rhymes as to rally fugitives in a battle but by all the powers it shant be said that a french officer cannot cope with a piece of poetry one battalion has foughtnow for the rest perseverance had its reward presently two lines one red the other blue appeared upon the paper and the captain murmured words mere words cannot avail telling true hearts tender tale what on earth ails my master muttered ben zoof
