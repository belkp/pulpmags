did not notice the man beside him why should he the round dot the brownish smoke the red spark and the flash of flame he stamped upon it a moment out of boyhood an experimental miracle as old as the age of glass and just as delightful the boy had spoiled the name of a great governor of a great state but the paper was still salable he had had his moment mark that moment a hand touched his shoulder the lad leaped up yessir star or bulletin ill take one of each said the man there now i was just watching you do you know what you were doing yessir burning paper startin fire thats the way the indians did it the man smiled at the perversion of fact there is not such a distance between sticks and glass in the age of childhood i know he saidthe indians but do you know how it was done the

sun there laughed the man of course you said you knew but you dont why doesnt the sun without the glass burn the paper tell me that the boy was still looking up at him he saw that the man was not like the others on the street it may be that the strange intimacy kindled into being at that moment certainly it was a strange unbending for the doctor it would if it was hot enough or you could get enough
