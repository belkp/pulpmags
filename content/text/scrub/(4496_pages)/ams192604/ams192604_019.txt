 amazing stories that a future supply would fail them the condition of the cereals was such as to promise a fine ingath ering of wheat maize and rice so that for the governor and his population with their two horses not only was there ample provision but even if other human inhabitants besides themselves should yet be discovered there was not the remotest pros pect of any of them perishing by starvation from the th to the th of january the rain came down in torrents and what was quite an unusual occurrence at this season of the year sev eral heavy storms broke over the island in spite however of the continual downfall the heavens still remained veiled in cloud servadac moreover did not fail to observe that for the season the tempera ture was unusually high and as a matter still more surprising that it kept steadily increasing as though the earth were gradually and continuously approximating to the sun in proportion to the rise of temperature the light also assumed greater intensity and if it had not been for the screen of vapor interposed between the sky and the island the irradiation which would have illumined all ter restrial objects would have been vivid beyond all precedent but neither sun moon nor star ever appeared and servadacs irritation and annoyance at being unable to identify any one point of the firmament may be more readily imagined than described on one occasion ben zoof endeavored to mitigate his masters impatience by exhorting him to assume the resignation even if he did not feel the indif ference which he himself experienced but his advice was received with so angry a rebuff that he retired in all haste abashed to resume his watch mans duty which he performed with exemplary perseverance day and night with the shortest possible intervals of rest despite wind rain and storm he mounted guard upon the cliffbut all in vain not a speck appeared upon the desolate horizon to say the truth no vessel could have stood against the weather the hurricane raged with tremendous fury and the waves rose to a height that seemed to defy calculation never even in the second era of creation when under the influ ence of internal heat the waters rose in vapor to descend in deluge back upon the world could mete orological phenomena have been developed with more impressive intensity but by the night of the th the tempest appeared to have spent its fury the wind dropped the rain ccased as if by a spell and servadac who for the last six days had confined himself to the shelter of his roof hastened to join ben zoof at his post upon the cliff now he thought there might be a chance of solving his perplexity perhaps now the huge disc of which he had an imperfect glimpse on the night of the st of december might again reveal itself at any rate he hoped for an oppor tunity of observing the constellations in a clear firmament above the night was magnificent not a cloud dimmed the luster of the stars which spangled the heavens in surpassing brilliancy and several nebulse which hitherto no astronomer had been able to discern without the aid of a telescope were clearly visible to the naked eye by a natural impulse servadacs first thought was to observe the position of the polestar it was in sight but so near to the horizon as to suggest the utter impossibility of its being any longer the central pivot of the sidereal system it occupied a position through which it was out of the question that the axis of the earth indefinitely prolonged could ever pass in his impression he was more thoroughly confirmed when an hour later he no ticed that the star had approached still nearer the horizon as though it had belonged to one of the zodiacal constellations the polestar being manifestly thus displaced it remained to be discovered whether any other of the celestial bodies had become a fixed center around which the constellations made their apparent daily revolutions to the solution of this problem ser vadac applied himself with the most thoughtful diligence after patient observation he satisfied himself that the required conditions were answered by a certain star that was stationary not far from the horizon this was vega in the constellation lyra a star which according to the precession of the equinoxes will take the place of our polestar years hence the most daring imagination could not suppose that a period of years had been crowded into the space of a fortnight and therefore the captain came as to an easier conclu sion to the opinion that the earths axis had been suddenly and immensely shifted and from the fact that the axis if produced would pass through a point so litle removed above the horizon he deduced the inference that the mediterranean must have been transported to the equator lost in bewildering maze of thought he gazed long and intently upon the heavens his eyes wan dered from where the tail of the great bear now a zodiacal constellation was scarcely visible above the waters to where the stars of the southern hemi sphere were just breaking on his view a cry from ben zoof recalled him to himself the moon shouted the orderly as though over joyed at once again beholding what the poet has called the kind companion of terrestrial night and he pointed to a disc that was rising at a spot precisely opposite the place where they would have expected to see the sun the moon again he cried but captain servadac could not altogether enter into his servants enthusiasm if this were actually the moon her distance from the earth must have been increased by some millions of miles he was rather disposed to suspect that it was not the earths satellite at all but some planet with its apparent magnitude greatly enlarged by its approximation to the earth taking up the powerful fieldglass which he was accustomed to use in his surveying operations he proceeded to investigate more care fully the luminous orb but he failed to trace any of the lineaments supposed to resemble a human face that mark the lunar surface he failed to decipher any indications of hill and plain nor could he make out the aureole of light which emanates from what astronomers have designated mount tycho it is not the moon he said slowly not the moon cried ben zoof why not it is not the moon again affirmed the captain why not repeated ben zoof unwilling to re nounce his first impression
