the man from the atom more than a couple of inches in diameter it was getting much darker the sun no longer gave much light for there was no atmosphere to diffuse it it was a great blinding ball of fire near my feet now and the planets were traveling about it swiftly i could see the light reflected on one side dark on the other on each planet the sun could be seen to move perceptibly too though very slightly as my feet grew larger threatening to touch it i hastily drew them up with ease and hung suspended in the sky in a halfsitting position as i grew turning my head away all at once i observed in some surprise that some of the stars were grow ing larger coming nearer and nearer for a time i watched their swift approach but they gradually seemed to be getting smaller rather than larger i looked again at my own system to my amazement it had moved what seemed about a yard from its former position and was much smaller the planets i saw no longer but there were faint streaks of light in circles about the sun and i understood that these were the tracks of the worlds that now moved about their parent too swiftly to be followed with the eye i could see all the stars moving hither and yon now although they still continued to appear closer and closer together i found a number lying prac tically on the plane of my chest but above that they seemed to cease i could now see no planets only the tiny sun moving farther and farther faster and faster along its path i could discern it seemed to me a trend in its and its companions path for on one side they seemed to be going one way and the opposite way on the other in front they seemed to move across my vision gradually i came to un derstand that this was a great circle swinging vast ly about me faster and faster i had grown until the stars were circling now about my legs i seemed to be the center of a huge vortex and they were coming closer and closer together as though to hem me about yet i could not move all of me away i could only move my limbs and head in relation to my stationary body the nearest star a tiny bright speck was a few yards away my own sun was like a bright period upon a blackboard but the stars were coming nearer and nearer it seemed necessary for me to move somehow so i drew my legs up and shot them out with all my force i began to move slowly away having acted upon what little material sub stance there was in the ether the stars were soon only a few feet apart below me then a few inches and suddenly looking out beyond them i was struck with the fact that they seemed to be a great group isolated from a number of far distant blotches that were apart from these the stars were moving with incredible swiftness now about a center near which was what i imagined to be the sun though i had lost track of it somehow they merged closer and closer together the vast group shrunk more and more until finally they had become indistinguishable as entities they were all part of a huge cloud now that seemed somehow familiar what did it suggest it was pale dif fused at the ends but thick and white in the center like a nebula nebula that was it a great light broke over me all these stars were part of a great system that formed a nebula it explained the mys tery of the nebulae and there were now other nebulae approaching as this grew smaller they took on the resemblance of stars and they began to repeat the process of closing in as the stars had done the stars uni verses within universes and those universes but nebulae in another great universe suddenly i be gan to wonder could there be nothing more in infinity than universe after universe each a part of another greater one so it would seem yet the spell was upon me and i was not ready to admit such simplicity yet i must go on and my earth it could not even be found this sphere that had itself seemed almost the universe but my growth was terribly fast now the other nebulae were merging it would seem at first upon me but my slow progress through space became faster as i grew larger and even as they came upon me like flying arrows now i shot above them then they too merged the result was a vast nucleus of glowing material a great light began to grow all about me above i suddenly observed far away a huge brightness that seemed to extend all over the universe but it began definitely it was as though one were in a great ball and the nebulae a sunlike body now were in the center but as i became larger with every instant the rooflike thing diffused even as before things had converged and formed into separ ate bodies like stars i passed through them final ly and they came together again behind me as i shot away another great body a coincidence suddenly struck me was not this system of a great ball effect with a nucleus within similar to what the atom was said to be could the nucleus and its great shell be opposite poles of electrical energy then in other words was this an electron a huge electron composed of univer ses the idea was terrible in its magnitude some thing too huge for comprehension and so i grew on many more of these electrons if such they were gathered together but my luck held and i passed beyond this new body thus formed a molecule i wondered suddenly i tired of the endless procession of stars coming together form ing ever into new stars that came together too i was getting homesick i wanted to see human faces about me again to be rid of this fantastic nightmare it was unreal it was impossible it must stop a sudden impulse of fear took hold upon me this should not go on forever i had to see my earth again all at once i reached down and pressed the central button to stop but just as a swiftly moving vehicle may not stop at once so could not i the terrific momentum of my growth carried me on and the machine moved still though slower the stars seemed shoot ing upon me closing about me i could see no end of them before me i must stop or they would be about me closer in they came but smaller and smaller they became a thousand pinpoints shooting about me they merged into a thick tenuous cloud about me thicker and thicker i was shooting up now but my growth had stopped the cloud became a cold clammy thing that yielded to the touch and
