the man who saved the earth long could the thing keep up and whence did it come what was it he sought for the ascraaus lucus and he be held a strange sight at the very spot where should have been the juncture of the canals he caught what at first looked like a pinpoint flame a strange twinkling light with flitting glow of opalescence he watched it and he wondered it seemed to the professor to grow and he noticed that the green about it was of different color it was winking like a great force and much as if alive baneful it was what charley huyck had seen the pro fessor thought of charley he had hurried to the mountain what could huyck a mere man do against a thing like this there was naught to do but sit and watch it drink of our lifeblood and then it was the message the strange assurance that huyck was flashing over the world there was no lack of confidence in the words he was speaking celestial kinetics so that was the answer cer tainly it must be so with the truth before him wil liams was a doubter no longer and charley huyck could save them the man he had humored eag erly he waited and stuck by the lens the whole world waited it was perhaps the most terrific moment since creation to describe it would be like describing doomsday we all of us went through it and we all of us thought the end had come that the earth was torn to atoms and to chaos the state of colorado was lurid with a red light of terror for a thousand miles the flame shot above the earth and into space if ever spirit went out in glory that spirit was charley huyck he had come to the moment and to archimedes the whole world rocked to the recoil compared to it the mightiest earthquake was but a tender shiver the conscious ness of the earth had spoken the professor was knocked upon the floor he knew not what had happened out of the windows and to the north the flame of colorado like the whole world going up it was the last moment but he was a scientist to the end he had sprained his ankle and his face was bleeding but for all that he struggled fought his way to the telescope and he saw the great planet with its sinister baleful wicked light in the center and another light vastly larger covering up half of mars what was it it was moving the truth set him almost to shouting it was the answer of charley huyck and of the world the light grew smaller smaller and almost to a pinpoint on its way to mars the real climax was in silence and of all the world only professor williams beheld it the two lights coalesced and spread out what it was on mars of course we do not know but in a few moments all was gone only the green of the martian sea winked in the sunlight the luminous opal was gone from the sargasso the ocean lay in peace it was a terrible three days had it not been for the work of robold and huyck life would have been destroyed the pity of it that all of their discov eries have gone with them not even charley real ized how terrific the force he was about to loosen he had carefully locked everything in vaults for a safe delivery to man he had expected death but not the cataclysm the whole of mount robold was shorn away in its place we have a lake fifty miles in diameter so much for celestial kinetics and we look to a green and beautiful mars we hold no enmity it was but the law of selfpreserva tion let us hope they have enough water and that their seas will hold we dont blame them and we dont blame ourselves either for that matter we need what we have and we hope to keep it the end the thing from outside by george allen england concluded that marr was dead and the girl alivethat much at all events was solid he could hold to that he could climb back with that to the real world again jandron climbed back came back time healed him as it healed the girl after a long long while they had speech together cautiously he sounded her wells of memory he saw that she recalled nothing so he told her white lies about capsized canoes and the sad deathin realisticallydescribed rapidsof all the party except herself and him vivian believed fate jandron knew was being very kind to both of them but vivian could never understand in the least hy her husband not very long after marriage asked her not to wear a weddingring or any ring whatever men are so queer covers a multitude of psychic agonies life for jandxonlife softened by vivianknit itself up into some reasonable semblance of a nor mal pattern but when at lengthening intervals memories even now awakememories ciawlingamid the slime of cosmic mysteries that it is madness to approachor when at certain times jandron sees a ring of any sort his heart chills with a cold that reeks of the horrors of infinity and from shadows past the boundaries of our universe seem to beckon things that god grant can never till the end of time be known on earth the end
