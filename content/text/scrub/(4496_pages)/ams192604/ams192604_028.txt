off on a comet newly discovered land was of very irregular eleva tion that it extended due east and west across the horizon thus dividing the gulf into two separate sections and completely concealing the island of jerba which must lie behind its position was duly traced on the dobrynas chart how strange exclaimed hector servadac that after sailing all this time over sea where we ex pected to find land we have at last come upon land where we thought to find sea strange indeed replied lieutenant procope and what appears to me almost as remarkable is that we have never once caught sight either of one of the maltese tartans or one of the levantine xebecs that traffic so regularly on the mediterra nean eastwards or westwards asked the count which shall be our course all farther progress to the south is checked westwards by all means replied servadac quickly i am longing to know whether anything of algeria is left beyond the shelif besides as we pass gourbi island we might take ben zoof on board and then make away for gibraltar where we should be sure to learn something at least of european news with his usual air of stately courtesy count tima scheff begged the captain to consider the yacht at his own disposal and desired him to give the lieu tenant instructions accordingly lieutenant procope however hesitated and after revolving matters for a few moments in his mind pointed out that as the wind was blowing directly from the west and seemed likely to increase if they went to the west in the teeth of the weather the schooner would be reduced to the use of her engine only and would have much difficulty in making good headway on the other hand by taking an eastward course not only would they have the advantage of the wind but under steam and canvas might hope in a few days to be off the coast of egypt and from alexandria or some other port they would have the same opportunity of getting tidings from europe as they would at gibraltar intensely anxious as he was to revisit the prov ince of oran and eager too to satisfy himself of the welfare of his faithful ben zoof servadac could not but own the reasonableness of the lieutenants objections and yielded to the proposal that the east ward course should be adopted the wind gave signs only too threatening of the breeze rising to a gale but fortunately the waves did not culminate in combers but rather in a long swell which ran in the same direction as the vessel during the last fortnight the high temperature had been gradually diminishing until it now reached an average of cent or fahr and sometimes descended as low as that this dim inution was to be attributed to the change in the earths orbit was a question that admitted of little doubt after approaching so near to the sun as to cross the orbit of venus the earth must now have receded so far from the sun that its normal distance of ninetyone millions of miles was greatly in creased and the probability was great that it was approximating to the orbit of mars that planet which in its physical constitution most nearly re sembles our own nor was this supposition sug gested merely by the lowering of the temperature it was strongly corroborated by the reduction of the apparent diameter of the suns disc to the pre cise dimensions which it would assume to an ob server actually stationed on the surface of mars the necessary inference that seemed to follow from these phenomena was that the earth had been pro jected into a new orbit which had the form of a very elongated ellipse very slight however in comparison was the re gard which these astronomical wonders attracted on board the dobryna all interest there was too much absorbed in terrestrial matters and in ascertaining what changes had taken place in the configuration of the earth itself to permit much attention to be paid to its erratic movements through space the schooner kept bravely on her way but well out to sea at a distance of two miles from land there was good need of this precaution for so precipitous was the shore that a vessel driven upon it must inevitably have gone to pieces it did not offer a single harbor of refuge but smooth and perpendicular as the walls of a fortress it rose to a height of two hundred and occasionally of three hundred feet the waves dashed violently against its base upon the general substratum rested a massive conglomerate the crystallizations of which rose like a forest of gigantic pyramids and obelisks but what struck the explorers more than anything was the appearance of singular newness that per vaded the whole of the region it all seemed so recent in its formation that the atmosphere had had no opportunity of producing its wonted effect in softening the hardness of its lines in rounding the sharpness of its angles or in modifying the color of its surface its outline was clearly marked against the sky and its substance smooth and polished as though fresh from a founders mold glittered with the metallic brilliancy that is char acteristic of pyrites it seemed impossible to come to any other conclusion but that the land before them continent or island had been upheaved by subterranean forces above the surface of the sea and that it was mainly composed of the same metal lic element as had characterized the dust so fre quently uplifted from the bottom the extreme nakedness of the entire tract was likewise very extraordinary elsewhere in various quarters of the globe there may be sterile rocks but there are none so adamant as to be altogether unfurrowed by the crevices engendered in the moist residuum of the condensed vapor elsewhere there may be barren steeps but none so arid as not to afford some hold to vegetation however low and elementary may be its type but here all was bare and blank and desolatenot a symptom of vitality was visible such being the condition of the adjacent land it could hardly be a matter of surprise that all the seabirds the albatross the gull the seamew sought continual refuge on the schooner day and night they perched fearlessly upon the yards the report of a gun failing to dislodge them and when food of any sort was thrown upon the deck they would dart down and fight with eager voracity for the prize their extreme avidity was recognized as a proof that any land where they could obtain a sustenance must be very remote onwards thus for several days the dobryna fol lowed the contour of the inhospitable coast of which
