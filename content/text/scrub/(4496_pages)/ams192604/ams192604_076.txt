the thing fromoutside demanded the journalist holding his gun steadily enough jandron wholly indifferent watched the muzzle vague curiosity possessed him just what he won dered did it feel like to be shot marr pulled trigger snap the cartridge missed fire not even powder would burn marr laughed horribly and shambled forward serves him right he mouthed hed better not come back again jandron understood that marr had seen him fall but still he felt himself standing there alive he shuffled away from the door no matter whether he was alive or dead there was always vivian to be saved the journalist came to the door paused looked down grunted and passed into the camp he shut the door jandron heard the rotten wooden bar of the latch drop from within echoed a laugh monstrous in its brutality then quivering the geologist felt a touch on his arm why did you desert us like that he heard vivians reproach why he turned hardly able to see her at all listen he said thickly ill admit anything its all right but just forget it for now weve got to get out o here the professor is dead in there and marrs gone mad and barricaded himself in there so theres no use staying theres a chance for us yet come along he took her by the arm and tried to draw her toward the river but she held back the hate in her face sickened him he shook in the grip of a mighty chill go withyou she demanded yes by god he retorted in a swift blaze of anger or ill kill you where you stand it shant get you anyhow swiftly piercing a greater cold smote to his inner marrows a long row of the cupshaped prints had just appeared in the snow beside the camp and from these marks wafted a faint bluish vapor of unthinkable cold what are you staring at the girl demanded those prints in the snow theresee he pointed a shaking finger how can there be snow at this season he could have wept for the pity of her the love of her on her red tam her tangle of rebel hair her sweater the snow came steadily drifting yet there she stood before him and prated of summer jandron heaved himself out of a very slough of downdragging lassitudes he whipped himself into action summer winterno matter he flung at her youre coming along with me he seized her arm with the brutality of desperation that must hurt to save and murder too lay in his soul he knew that he would strangle her with his naked hands if need were before he would ever leave her there for it to work its horrible will upon you come with me he mouthed or by the almighty marrs scream in the camp whirled him toward the door that scream rose higher higher even more and more piercing just like the screams of the runaway indian guides in what now appeared the infinitely long ago it seemed to last hours and always it rose rose as if being wrung out of a human body by some kind of agony not conceivable in this world higher higher then it stopped jandron hurled himself against the plank doox the bar smashed the door shivered inward with a cry jandron recoiled he covered his eyes with a hand that quivered clawlike go away vivian dont come heredont look he stumbled away babbling out of the door crept something like a man a queer broken bent over thing a thing crippled shrunken and flabby that whined this thingyes it was still marrcrouched down at one side quivering whimpering it moved its hands as a crushed ant moves its antennas jerkily without significance all at once jandron no longer felt afraid he walked quite steadily to marr who was breathing in little gasps from the camp issued an odor unlike anything terrestrial a thin grayish grease covered the sill jandron caught hold of the crumpling journalists arm marrs eyes leered filmed unseeing he gave the impression of a creature whose back has been broken whose whole essence and energy have been wrenched asunder yet in which life somehow clings palpitant a creature vivisected away through the snow jandron dragged him marr made no resistance just let himself be led whining a little palsied rickety shattered the girl her face whitely cold as the snow that fell on it came after thus they reached the landing at the river come now lets get away jandron made shift to articulate marr said nothing but when jan dron tried to bundle him into a canoe something in the journalist revived with swift mad hatefulness that something lashed him into a spasm of wiry incredibly venomous resistance slaveis of blood and foam streaked marrs lips he made horrid noises like an animal he howled dismally and bit clawed writhed and grovelled he tried to sink his teeth into jandrons leg he fought appallingly as men must have fought in the inconceivably re mote days even before the stone age and vivian helped him her fury was a tigercats between the pair of them they almost did him in they almost dragged jandron downand them selves toointo the black river that ran swiftly sucking under the ice not till jandron had quite flung off all vague notions and restraints of gal lantry not until he struck from the shoulderto kill if need weredid he best them he beat the pair of them unconscious trussed them hand and foot with the painters of the canoes rolled them into the larger canoe and shoved off after that the blankness of a measureless ob livion descended only from what he was told weeks after in the royal victoria hospital at montreal did jandron ever learn how
