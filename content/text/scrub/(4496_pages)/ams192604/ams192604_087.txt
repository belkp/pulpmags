 amazing stories he was going to take it the words were not out of his mouth before his long legs were leaping down the stairway in the flash of seconds his mind was rushing into clear action he had

mountain in six jumps he was in the office it was empty the professor had not returned he thought rather grimly and fleetingly of their conversation a few minutes before what would williams think now of science and consciousness he picked up the telephone receiver while he waited he saw out of the corner of his eye the car in the driveway it was hello the professor what gone down to town no well

laughter a long thin nose and lips drooped at the corners then as suddenly tipping upa queer creature half devil half laughter and all fun easy charley easy how much did you say whisper it it was bob winters bob winters and his car and waiting surely no twist of fortune could nave been greater he was a college chum of huycks and of the professors if there was one man that could make the run in the
