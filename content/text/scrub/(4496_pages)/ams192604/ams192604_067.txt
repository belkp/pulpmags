 amazing stories your little journey soon that i may quickly know its results have you any affairs you would like to put in order in case none i said i was always ready for these ex periments and though this promised to be magni ficently momentous i was all ready no if i re turn in a few hours i shall find everything all right if not i am still prepared he beamed in ap proval fine of course you understand that our ex periment must take place at some secluded spot if you are ready we can proceed at once to a coun try laboratory of mine that will i think be safe i assented and we hastily donned our overcoats the professor spending a moment or two collecting some necessary apparatus then we packed the ma chine in a safe box and left his home are you all ready kirby the professors voice was firm but my practiced ear could detect the slightest vibrations that indicated to me his in tense inner feelings i hesitated a moment i was not afraid of going never that but there seemed something partaking almost of finality about this departure it was different from anything i had ever felt before all ready professor i said cheerfully after a brief moment are you going to magnify or minimize your self it shall be growth i answered without a mo ments hesitation there the stars and what lay beyond it was that i cared for the profes sor looked at me earnestly deeply engrossed in thought finally he said kirby if you are to make an excursion into interstellar space you realize that not only would you freeze to death but also die from lack of air walking to a cabinet in the rear of the room he opened it and withdrew from it some strange look ing paraphernalia this he said holding up a queer looking suit is made of a great quantity of interlocking metal cells hermetically sealed from which the air has been completely exhausted so as to give the cells a high vacuum these separate cells are then woven into the fabric when you wear this suit you will in fact be enclosed in a sort of thermos bottle no heat can leave this suit and the most intensive cold cannot penetrate through it i quickly got into the suit which was not as heavy as one might imagine it covered not only the en tire body but the feet and hands as well the hand part being a sort of mitten after i had gotten into the suit the professor placed over my head a sort of transparent dome which he explained was made of strong unbreak able bakelite the globe itself really was made of several globes one within the other the globes only touched at the lower rim the interstices where the globes did not touch formed a vacuum the air having been drawn from the spaces conse quently heat could not escape from the transparent head piece nor could the cold come in from the back of this head gear a flexible tube led into the interior this tube being connected to a small com pressed oxygen tank which the professor strapped to my back he then placed the wonder machine with its row of buttons on my chest and connected the six wires to the arms and other parts of my body professor martyn grasped my hand then and said in his firm quiet voice then goodbye kirby for awhile press the first button when you are ready to go may the fates be with you the professor next placed the transparent head gear over my head and secured it with attachments to my vacuum suit a strange feeling of quietness and solitude came over me while i could still see the professor i could hear him talk no longer as sounds cannot pierce a vacuum once more the professor shook my hand warmly then somehow i found myself pressing down the uppermost of three buttons instantly there was a tingling electric flash all through my body martyn trees distant buildings all seemed to shoot away into nothingness almost in panic i pushed the middle button i stopped i could not help it for this disappearing of all my world acted upon my consciousness i had a strange feeling that i was leaving forever i looked down and professor martyn a tiny speck in an automobile far below waved up to me cheerfully as he started his car and began to speed away he was fleeing the immediate danger of my growth when my feet would begin to cover an im mense area until i could be almost entirely in space i gathered my cpurage quickly fiercely and pressed the top button again once more the earth began to get smaller little by little but faster a ting ling sensation was all over me exhilarating if al most painful where the wires were connected upon my forearms my legs about the forehead and upon my chest it did never seem as though i was changing but rather that the world was shrinking away faster and faster the clouds were falling upon me with threatening swiftness until my head broke suddenly through them and my body was obscured and the earth below save tiny glimpses as though of a dis tant landscape through a fog far away i could see a few tall crags that broke through even as had i scorning from their majestic height the world be low now indeed if never before was my head among the clouds but even the clouds were going i began to get an idea of the earth as a great ball of thick cloud there was a pricking sensation beneath my feet as though i stood upon pine needles it gave me a feeling of power to know that these were trees and hills i began to feel insecure as though my support were doing something stealthy beneath me have you ever seen an elephant perform upon a little roll ing ball well that is how i felt the earth was rotating while i no longer could move upon it while i pondered watching in some alarm as it be came more and more like a little ball a few feet thick it took matters in its own hand my feet slipped off suddenly and i was lying absolutely motionless powerless to move in space i watched the earth awhile as it shrank and even observed it now as it moved about the sun i could see other planets that had grown at first a trifle larger and were now getting smaller again about the same size as the earth tiny balls of no
