 amazing stories off on a comet of the ravine in some degree facilitated their prog ress but it was not until they had been toiling up for two hours more that they succeeded in reaching the summit of the cliff eagerly and anxiously did they look around to the south there was nothing but the sea they had traversed to the north nothing but one drear in hospitable stretch servadac could not suppress a cry of dismay where was his beloved france had he gained this arduous height only to behold the rocks carpeted with ice and snow and reaching interminably to the faroff horizon his heart sank within him the whole region appeared to consist of nothing but the same strange uniform mineral conglomer ate crystallized into regular hexagonal prisms but whatever was its geological character it was only too evident that it had entirely replaced the former soil so that not a vestige of the old continent of europe could be discerned the lovely scenery of provence with the grace of its rich and undulating landscape its gardens of citrons and oranges rising tier upon tier from the deep red soilall all had vanished of the vegetable kingdom there was not a single representative the most meager of arctic plants the most insignificant of lichens could obtain no hold upon that stony waste nor did the animal world assert the feeblest sway the mineral kingdom reigned supreme captain servadacs deep dejection was in strange contrast to his general hilarity silent and tear ful he stood upon an icebound rock straining his eyes across the boundless vista of the mysterious territory it cannot be he exclaimed we must somehow have mistaken our bearings true we have encountered this barrier but france is there beyond yes france is there come count come by all thats pitiful i entreat you come and ex plore the farthest verge of the icebound track he pushed onwards along the rugged surface of the rock but had not proceeded far before he came to a sudden pause his foot had come in contact with something hard beneath the snow and stoop ing down he picked up a little block of stony sub stance which the first glance revealed to be of a geological character altogether alien to the uni versal rocks around it proved to be a fragment of discolored marble on which several letters were inscribed of which the only part at all decipherable was the syllable vil vilvilla he cried out in his excitement dropping the marble which was broken into atoms by the fall what else could this fragment be but the sole surviving remnant of some sumptuous mansion that once had stood on this unrivaled site was it not the residue of some edifice that had crowned the luxuriant headlands of antibes overlooking nice and commanding the gorgeous panorama that embraced the maritime alps and reached beyond monaco and mentone to the italian height of bor dighera and did it not give in its sad and too convincing testimony that antibes itself had been involved in the great destruction servadac gazed upon the shattered marble pensive and dis heartened count timascheff laid his hand kindly on the captains shoulder and said my friend do you not remember the motto of the old hope family he shook his head mournfully orbe fracto spes illaesa continued the count though the world be shattered hope is unim paired servadac smiled faintly and replied that he felt rather compelled to take up the despairing cry of dante all hope abandon ye who enter here nay not so answered the count for the pres ent at least let our maxim be nil desperandum chapter xvii a second enigma upon reembarking the bewildered explorers began to discuss the question whether it would not now be desirable to make their way back to gourbi island which was apparently the only spot in their new world from which they could hope to derive their future sustenance captain servadac tried to console himself with the reflection that gourbi is land was after all a fragment of a french colony and as such almost like a bit of his dear france and the plan of returning thither was on the point of being adopted when lieutenant procope re marked that they ought to remember that they had not hitherto made an entire circuit of the new shores of the sea on which they were sailing we have he said neither investigated the northern shore from the site of cape antibes to the strait that brought us to gibraltar nor have we followed the southern shore that stretches from the strait to the gulf of cabes it is the old coast and not the new that we have been tracing as yet we cannot say positively that there is no out let to the south as yet we cannot assert that no oasis of the african desert has escaped the catas trophe perhaps even here in the north we may find that italy and sicily and the larger islands of the mediterranean may still maintain their exist ence i entirely concur with you said count tima scheff i quite think we ought to make our survey of the confines of this new basin as complete as possible before we withdraw servadac although he acknowledged the justness of these observations could not help pleading that the explorations might be deferred until after a visit had been paid to gourbi island depend upon it captain you are mistaken replied the lieutenant the right thing to do is to use the dobryna while she is available available what do you mean asked the count somewhat taken by surprise i mean said procope that the farther this gallia of ours recedes from the sun the lower the temperature will fall it is likely enough i think that before long the sea will be frozen over and navigation will be impossible already you have learned something of the difficulties of traversing a field of ice and i am sure therefore you will acquiesce in my wish to continue our explorations while the water is still open no doubt you are right lieutenant said the count we will continue our search while we can for some remaining fragment of europe who shall tell whether we may not meet with some more sur vivors from the catastrophe to whom it might be in our power to afford assistance before we go into our winter quarters
