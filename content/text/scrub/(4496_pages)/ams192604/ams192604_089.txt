 amazing stories not even winters with all his alertness could avoid it perhaps he was weary the tedious hours the racking speed had worn him to exhaustion they had ceased to individualize their way a blur a nightmare of speed and distance it came suddenly a blind barrancaone of those sunken useless channels that are death to the un wary no warning it was over just that quickly a mere flash of consciousness plus a sensation of flying two men broken on the sands and the great beautiful roads ter a twisted ruin chapter vii a riven continent but back to the world no one knew about charley huyck nor what was occurring on the desert even if we had it would have been impos sible to construe connection after the news out of oakland and the destruc tion of mt heckla we were far too appalled the whole thing was beyond us not even the scientists with all their data could find one thing to work on the wires of the world buzzed with wonder and with panic we were civilized it is really strange how quickly in spite of our boasted powers we revert to the primitive superstition cannot die where was no explana tion must be miracle the thing had been repeated when would it strike again and where there was not long to wait but this time the stroke was of far more consequence and of far more terror the sheer might of the thing shook the earth not a man or government that would not resign in the face of such destruction it was omnipotent a whole continent had been riven it would be impossible to give description of such catastrophe no pen can tell it any more than it could describe the creation we can only follow in its path on the morning after the first catastrophe at eight oclock just south of the little city of santa cruz on the north shore of the bay of monterey the same light and the same though not quite the same instantaneousness those who beheld it re port a vast ball of azure blue and opalescent fire and motion a strange sensation of vitalized vibra tion of personified living force in shape like a marble as round as a full moon in its glory but of infinitely more beauty it came from nowhere neither from above the earth nor below it seeming to leap out of nothing it glided or rather vanished to the eastward still the effect of winking though this time perhaps from a distanced focus more vivid a dot or marble like a full moon burning opal soaring to the eastward and instantaneous gone as soon as it was come noiseless and of phantom beauty like a finger of the omnipotent tracing across the world and as ter rible the human mind had never conceived a thing so vast beginning at the sands of the ocean the whole country had vanished a chasm twelve miles wide and of unknown depth running straight to the east ward where had been farms and homes was noth ing the mountains had been seared like butter straight as an arrow then the roar of the deluge the waters of the pacific breaking through its sands and rolling into the gulf of mexico that there was no heatj was evidenced by the fact that there was no steam the thing could not be internal yet what was it one can only conceive in figures from the shores of santa cruz to the atlantica few sec onds then out into the eastern ocean straight out into the sea of the sargasso a great gulf riven straight across the face of north america the path seemed to follow the sun it bore to the eastward with a slight southern deviation the mountains it cut like cheese passing just north of fresno it seared through the gigantic sierras halfway between the yosemite and mt whitney through the great desert to southern nevada thence across northern arizona new mexico texas ar kansas mississippi alabama and georgia entering the atlantic at a point halfway between brunswick and jacksonville a great canal twelve miles in width linking the oceans a cataclysmic blessing today with thousands of ships bearing freight over its water we can bless that part of the dis aster but there was more to come so far the miracle had been sporadic whatever had been its force it had been fatal only on point and occasion in a way it had been local the deadly atmospheric com bination of its aftermath was invariable in its re cession there was no suffering the death that it dealt was the death of obliteration but now it entered on another stage the world is one vast ball and though large still a very small place to live in there are few of us perhaps who look upon it or even stop to think of it as a living being yet it is just that it has its currents life pulse and its fevers it is coordinate a million things such as the great streams of the ocean the swirls of the atmosphere make it a place to live in and we are conscious only or mostly through disaster a strange thing happened the great opal like a mountain of fire had riven across the continent from the beginning and with each succession the thing was magnified but it was not until it had struck the waters of the at lantic that we became aware of its full potency and its fatality the earth quivered at the shock and man stood on his toes in terror in twentyfour hours our civilization was literally falling to pieces we were powerful with the forces that we understood but against this that had been literally ripped from the unknown we were insignificant the whole world was frozen let us see into the atlantic the transition hitherto silence but now the roar of ten thousand million niagaras the waters of the ocean rolling catapult ing roaring into the gulf that had been seared in its bosom the gulf stream cut in two the cur rents that tempered our civilization sheared in a second straight into the sargasso sea the great opal liquid fire luminiscent a ball like the setting sun lay poised upon the ocean it was the end of the earth what was this thing the whole world knew of
