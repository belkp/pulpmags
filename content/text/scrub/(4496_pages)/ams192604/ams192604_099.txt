 amazing stories the mesmeric trance i made use of the customary passes these for a time were unsuccessful the first indication of revival was afforded by a partial descent of the iris it was observed as especially remarkable that this lowering of the pupil was accompanied by the profuse outflowing of a yel lowish ichor from beneath the lids of a pungent and highly offensive odor it was now suggested that i should attempt to influence the patients arm as heretofore i made the attempt and failed dr f then intimated a desire to have me put a question i did so as follows m valdemar can you explain to us what are your feelings or wishes now there was an instant return of the hectic circles on the cheeks the tongue quivered or rather rolled violently in the mouth although the jaws and lips remained rigid as before and at length the same hideous voice which i have already described broke forth for gods sakequickquickput me to sleepor quickwaken mequicki say to you that i am dead i was thoroughly unnerved and or an instant remained undecided what to do at firt made an endeavor to recompose he patient hut failing in this through total abeyaiee of the will re traced my steps and as earnestly struggled to awaken him in this attempt soon saw that i should be successfulor at least i soon fancied that my success would be completeand i am sure that all in the room were prepared to see the patient awaken for what really occurred however it is quite impossible that any human being could have been prepared as i rapidly made the mesmeric passes amid ejaculations of dead dead absolutely bursting from the tongue and not from the lips of the sufferer his whole frame at oncewithin the space of a single minute or even less shrunkcrumbled absolutely rotted away beneath my hands upon the bed before that whole company there lay a nearly liquid mass of loathsomeof detestable putrescence the end the new accelerator by h g wells concluded preparation is a manageable convenience but its practicability is certainly demonstrated beyond all cavil since that adventure he has been steadily bring ing its use under control and i have several times and without the slightest bad result taken measured doses under his direction though i must confess i have not yet ventured abroad again while under its influence i may mention for example that this story has been written at one sitting and with out interruption except for the nibbling of some chocolate by its means i began at and my watch is now very nearly at the minute pastthe halfhour the convenience of securing a long un interrupted spell of work in the midst of a day full of engagements cannot be exaggerated gibberne is now working at the quantitative handling of his preparation with especial reference to its distinc tive effects upon different types of constitution he then hopes to find a retarder with which to dilute its present rather excessive potency the retarder will of course have an effect the reverse of the accelerators used alone it should enable the patient to spread a few seconds over many hours of ordinary time and so to maintain an apathetic in action a glacierlike absence of alacrity amidst the most animated or irritating surroundings the two things together must necessarily work an entire revolution in civilized existence it is the beginning of our escape from that time garment of which carlyle speaks while this accelerator will enable us to concentrate ourselves with tremendous impact upon any moment or occasion that demands our ut most sense and vigor the retarder will enable us to pass in passive tranquility through infinite hard ship and tedium perhaps i am a little optimistic about the retarder which has indeed still to be discovered but about the accelerator there is no possible sort of doubt whatever its appearance upon the market in a convenient controllable and assimilable form is a matter of the next few months it will be obtainable of all chemists and druggists in small green bottles at a high but considering its extraordinary qualities by no means excessive price gibbemes nervous accelerator it will be called and he hopes to be able to supply it in three strengths one in one in and one in distinguished by yellow pink and white labels re spectively no doubt its use renders a great number of very extraordinary things possible for of course the most remarkable and possibly even criminal pro ceedings may be effected with impunity by thus dodging as it were into the interstices of time like all potent preparations it will be liable to abuse we have however discussed this aspect of the ques tion very thoroughly and we have decided that this is purely a matter of medical jurisprudence and altogether outside our province we shall manu facture and sell the accelerator and as for the consequenceswe shall see the end dr hackensaws secrets those who read the famous dr hackensaws secrets in science and invention magazine may be interested to know that we have on hand a great many of dr hackensaws manuscripts which have never been published hitherto before printing these in amazing stories however we would like to have an expression from our readers as to just how they feel about these stories and whether they would like to have more of them wont you please write the editor a few lines stating your feelings in this mattereditor
