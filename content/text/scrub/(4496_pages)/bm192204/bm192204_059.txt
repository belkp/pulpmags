 the extra dozen eggs sounds silly i know he continued but its a fact that from your using the word antidote in something you were saying came the idea that set me on the right track remember i was searching madly for someone besides grayson who might have poisoned marsh until you used that word it seemed impossible that anyone else could have done so since all the wit nesses agreed that only he had touched the decanter from which two glasses were servedone harmless which went to cumberland and the other deadly then came my inspiration you said antidote and as suddenly as lightning illumines a dark sky my mind was lighted i saw as in a vision how a man could poison another and keep himself from suspicion by taking some of the poison himself saving himself from its deadly effects by taking an antidote al ready prepared i left you and rushed to the library where i read that the best antidote for corrosive sublimate was a mixture of the whites of eggs the man toward whom my suspicions were now directed was of course cum berland since the poisoned wine came from his decanter and he was the man who had taken the other glass of wine poured by the innocent grayson i made the rounds of the groceries and dairies until i found the store where he had purchased a dozen eggs on the day of the murder then hoping to find something else that might incriminate him i went snooping around his house and there back of his bam in a pile of refuse i found the parts of a broken bottle that had once contained corro sive sublimate one of the pieces bore the druggists label i wired to him and in less than an hour had a reply that proved to me that my case against cumberland was complete i found you and brought you to his house so that i might have a witness when i accused him and that is all
