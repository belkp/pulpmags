the trap by r t m scott i the dusty sunbaked train of the madras railway rumbled across the long bridge over the kistna river and came to a halt at bez wada smith of the criminal intelli gence department of india threw open the door of his firstclass compartment and strolled indolently through the throng of shouting natives toward the station restaurant shrillvoiced paw neewallahs lugged their skins of water from window to window of the third class carriages and sweetmeat venders cried the virtues of their confections as they held their trays aloft it was an old story to smith and one might have thought that he paid no at tention whatever to his surroundings he gave no sign of interest but in reality he was keenly interested three times during the last ten days had his life been attempted it was well for him to be on the alert after a light tiffin smith sauntered up and down the platform for a few minutes before the train was due to re sume its long journey to calcutta he was the only white man among the crowds of natives indeed there were only two firstclass compartments on the entire train one of thesedirectly in rear of smiths compartmentwas reserved for ladies an unusually old ayah scuttled backwards and forwards between this compartment and the res taurant she was busy with refresh ments for her mistress who preferred not to leave the train and who kept her blinds drawn against the curious gaze of the natives sharp toots of warning from the engine caused smith to turn abruptly and enter his compartment as he closed the door behind him he heard it opened again and he turned like a flash to ascertain the cause unexpected oc currences had come to have ominous significance for him of late what smith saw upon turning how ever did not seem very dangerous he was a dapper little man who entered smooth shaven and far from strong in physical appearance he threw his topee into the rack for small parcels and sat down upon the seat opposite to the one upon which smiths kit was lying no word was spoken white men who live in india do not talk much without a formal introduction smith paid as little outward attention to his new traveling companion as he had paid to the throngs of natives upon the station platform as the train gathered way he stretched himself full length upon his seat and lighted a cigarette notwithstanding his ap parent indifference however smith had noted several things which the ordinary observer might have failed to perceive instinctively he felt that the little man had attempted to display an easy manner that he did not feel when he threw the topee into the rack smith felt that the act was an at tempt at nonchalance and was not genuine he noted too that the man had no native servant which is unusual for the firstclass traveler of the east in addition to this the eyes of the little man had a story to tell they were not straight eyes they were shifty and it was smiths profession to read eyes
