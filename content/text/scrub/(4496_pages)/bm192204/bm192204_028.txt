the finger of guilt lange neatly upon his haunches in furiated the tears of chagrin streaming down his face lange drew his gun as he staggered to his feet farris closed in they wrestled farris slipped and in his attempt to keep the gun from being twisted against his chest he unfortunately put his hand over the front of the barrel just as lange pulled the trigger his left hand crushed by ball and powder farris backed away he reached his desk and jerked at a drawer lange sent a second bullet through far ris left shoulder farris fell from a sitting position he reached into the drawer and fetched his revolver quite deliberately he aimed at lange who was sneaking out of the room he fired and lange crumpled to the floor then farris too lapsed into uncon sciousness a woman in the next apartment tele phoned fo the police iii the next morning detective mckeane after a visit to the hospital called on the district attorney and an nounced that both farris and lange would pull through and even though hes already dis posed of the jewels i got a confession covering the scofield and ellingwood robberies said mckeane look here know what this is the district attorney looked at the curious thing mckeane had handed him and shook his head its all shot to piecesdoesnt look like much now but it was once the most perfect artificial finger ever fash ioned by man it took farris one year to make itand he was an expert at the manufacture of artificial limbs lost his own finger in an accidentthe finger next to the pinky on the left hand cut off just above the knuckle well he took his own finger and made a plaster mold of it in the mold he made this artificial finger of rubber and other substances feel it you cant tell it from flesh look at the ridges the veins painted in and he could get a perfect fingerprint with it it will stand a microscopic test it is hollow thats where he hid the lavalliere but how was the finger kept he made a thin silver ring which fitted snugly around his stump this sil ver ring was threaded inside the open end of the artificial finger he had an other silver ring also threaded he simply screwed the finger onand off matter of a few seconds the artificial finger came over the stump there was a slight visible line which wras painted fleshcolor and then protected again by a gold band ring he always wore around the place where the finger and the stump joined and the finger was perfect in every respect but two by sight or touch it could not be distinguished from a flesh and bone finger and by a few months practice he had even learned to move it you see with his stump he could move it up to the first joint the other joint he manipulated by pressure with his pinky but in these two respects the finger was wanting it did not take tem perature and if you squeezed hard you could press it together but in these latter respects he was in little danger since he shook hands with his right hand of course and there was no other reason why anyone should ever feel his left try to imagine me searching that guy for a lavalliere hm i should say its a good thing hes in for a long siesta well hes already promised that when he gets out hes going to make an artificial hand to replace the one lange blew off of him then he says hell be able to hide half a jewelry store
