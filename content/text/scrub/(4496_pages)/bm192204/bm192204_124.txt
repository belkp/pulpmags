hankensons perfect crime should be killed in the field and by his own gun but how it took hankenson several weeks to decide this point here as before de tails were mentally discussed cata logued and discarded the solution was finally reached through the applica tion of chemistry and having arrived at a decision hankenson applied him self vigorously and with his usual painstaking thoroughness to the task of putting the affair through to a success ful conclusion in an obscure drug store in another city he purchased a small bottle of nitric acid several weeks later he motored to the metropolis a hundred miles dis tant in order to secure fifteen cents worth of sulphuric acid laying both purchases aside he waited several weeks finally finding occasion to make a trip to a third town where he bought a bottle of glycerin he now had the ingredients to manufacture enough nitroglycerin to blow up a regiment all purchased in such a way that suspi cion could never be traced to him but he was wary the time was not yet ripe there was always the chance that some overalert clerk might through some unforeseen circumstance remember his face and connect him with the purchase of one of the chemi cals it was best to wait until the memory of his small purchases faded from their minds it was lack of at tention to such small details that had caused others to be caught in his case nothing was too tiny to be overlooked his was a brain that could foresee all contingencies six weeks passed before he was ready to act one day while visiting ohearns bachelor apartments he man aged to pocket half a dozen shells such as his cousin used in his favorite gun again he waited for weeks to see if the theft was noticed finding that it was not he proceeded to carefully draw the wads from three of the shells uncrimp ing the edges in such a way that it would not be noticed he even wore gloves to avoid telltale fingerprints pouring out the charges of powder and shot he poured into the empty shells enough nitroglycerinwhich he compounded from his chemicalsto make small bombs out of each replaced the wads and turning back the edges carefully he looked over his handiwork to all appearances the shells were identical with their mates yet when the hammer struck the cap it would create an explosion sufficient to tear the very head off of the unfortunate ohearn the terrific jar would ex plode the other shells and the remaining evidence would be destroyed naturally as hankenson knew there would be an inquiry but as a method of committing a murder it was so unique that it would never be suspected instead the company which manufac tured the cartridges would be blamed accidents are always likely to happen in powder factories in the end the coroners jury would decide that some thing had gone wrong with the formula when the powder was made he as ohearns next of kin would bring suit against the manufacturers and the lat ter for their own protection wdld set tle as speedily as possible in order to avoid unnecessary publicity he next poured the acid and glycerin down the sewer the bottles in which the chemicals came he broke into small pieces and buried in the ashes thus he covered his tracks as he went along the hunting season opened next day he and ohearn had made all arrange ments to leave early in the morning for a forenoons sport among the ducks a large party of friends was to accom pany them the friends were to be the necessary witnesses waiting until late in the evening he
