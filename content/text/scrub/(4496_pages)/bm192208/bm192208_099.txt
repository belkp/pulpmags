 his thirteenth wife the clockmaker was ready for him and the box itself was a beautyas creditable a piece of work as bruckner had ever seen it did not weigh too much nor too little and while he was assured that the watch was perfect in its mechanism and timing it did not give forth the slightest sound the clockmaker beamed when he saw the look of admiration in bruck ners eyes and told him that he might trust the little bomb implicitly it is worthy to blow up a prime minister enthused its author unfortunately these days kings are few and trade is far from good the war seems to have caused an unreasoning dislike for ex plosives on the part of my very best customers bruckner condoled with the man and took his departure he had received the professional word of the watch maker that the bomb would not go off if he were to drop it and that it would not explode until eightfifteen precisely that was as bruckner wished the detonation would be heard just as the motorboat was entering the waters about calders point and would startle those on shore waiting for his wife in all probability the bomb would tear her to pieces and wreck the boat completely at least it would utterly destroy itself and the gasoline tank that was of course essentialfor there must be no remaining evidence even though no clue could possibly point to him but because the time schedule of the railroad had been changed without his knowledge bruckner did not arrive at the bungalow until almost seven oclock it had been a narrow escape from being too late and the incident made him nervous yet in a way he thought it was fortunate mrs bruckner was down at the land ing dressed in her best bib and tucker and she greeted him with a smile and an inquiry as to his health you look tired my dear she sympathized in a motherly sort of fashion i really hate to go away and leave you i am tired bruckner confessed i guess im not as young as i used to be and i havent been right pert for the last few weeks ill soon be better how ever he added cheerfully just you go on and have a good time and dont give a thought to me then he produced the candy box and displayed it to her the boatman who had brought him was gone by this time and he had not seen the package which bruckner had kept wrapped in a news paper until this very moment now mrs bruckner took it in her hands and plucked at the ribbon but he shook his finger at her as he might do to a naughty child now dont be impatient or selfish he reproved keep it until you get to the party then offer some to the others with my compliments i suppose i should do that she agreed with him and now i must be going theres a light under the coffee on the stove and your suppers on the table you wont mind a cold snack will you no said bruckner and then the one flaw in his plan occurred to him how could he make sure that she would put the candy box where it would cer tainly destroy the gasoline tank he could not if he left it in her possession of course it would kill her but that was not enough his plan must work out exactly as he had intended and the only way to insure its perfect success was to go along in the boat that in a way was a risk but bruck ner was equal to the situation it re quired quick thinking but he had a bright idea on the spot well he reproached himself if i didnt forget my tobacco i guess id better go back as far as the station with you and then get one of the public
