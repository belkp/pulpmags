the vault i loot the vault tap you on the head take off your bonds and put you in here then i push on the switch the doors close on you and i get away with the stuff in the morning theyll find you inside and the stuff gone your finger prints will be on the knobs inference will inevitably be that the trap got you as you were handing out the stuff to a confederate pretty scheme isnt it jack the man seemed to be gloating a little over the agony of his prospective victim mike struggling to massage his leg into some semblance of life and to make no noise in doing so heard the infinitely faint sound of the bound man struggling upon the floor he made a curious moan utterly despairing just one more trip jack said the voice filled with a terrifying amuse ment then ill come back for you mikes throat was dry he feared that man he had not seen feared him with the ultimate of terror and in a moment or two more he would have to fight him struggle with him cold to the marrow drylipped with fear his little eyes staring mike started to raise himself to his feet as he heard the other man enter the vault his leg was numb it would barely hold his weight up mikes teeth began to chat ter he heard the man rummaging about inside the steel tomb and then mike felt a sudden agonizing pain in his back something jabbed cruelly into his backbone hurting horribly and then with a spitting flash of bluish light the pain ceased but outside there was a sudden rumbling and a cushioned crash then a distant muffled scream barely audible glassyeyed with terror mike flung open the door to run he saw a small electric lantern upon the floor its beam directed at the two huge doors of the vault and they zvere closed in the fraction of an instant mike knew what had happened rising in the closet he had jammed his back into the knifeswitch that turned on the cur rent for the burglartrap it had closed the doors imprisoning the unknown saunders in the airtight vault and he the imprisoned man had cut the wiies that would have warned the police of his predicament uttering a little gasp that was com pounded of horror and fear mike started forward only to have his numbed leg give way beneath him the fall sobered him to a curious fictitious calmness he flashed his lamp on the bound still figure its eyes were closed the face was utterly white fainted said mike to himself shakily safe enough though he suddenly scrambled to his feet again and ran through the dark hall ways and down the steps he fled he was possessed by an unreasoning terror the window through which he had entered was open evidently the other man had arranged it for his own ingress mike fairly fell outside and suddenly was in complete possession of himself again with the quiet dark night all around him he felt secure and he abruptly became conscious that he was carrying something in one hand he had picked it up when his leg gave way he let a faint ray trickle through his fingers upon it then he grinned uncer tainly evidently he had happened upon a portion of the payroll he saw yellow backs at any rate with the bills in the bundle he held mmy gawd said mike unevenly that was a shock thereve been shocks all around tonight that feller in the vault an the feller that fainted saya thought struck himwonder if hell come out of that faint in time to tell about a feller bein in th vault mmy gawd may be he dont know
