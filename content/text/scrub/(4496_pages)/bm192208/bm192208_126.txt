the finger print bureau by j h taylor beginning with this issue the finger print department will be conducted by mr j h taylor mr taylor is superintendent bureau of identification department of navigation of the navy department readers desiring information or advice on subjects relating to finger prints may communicate with mr taylor in care of the black mask magazine there is no charge for this service mr taylor requests however that letters requiring replies be accompanied by a stamped addressed envelope letters of general interest together with their answers will be printed in each issue ever since the world began some one has endeavored to find two things that are exactly alike but from a scientific point of view this has never been accomplished the leaves on the trees resemble each other so closely that it is extremely difficult for anyone not experienced in botany to detect the difference an experienced botanist can at a glance see that there is no resemblance whatever the closest resemblance ever found in the world is believed to have been between twins their facial expression is in a great many cases as near alike as it is possible to be even their man nerisms likes and dislikes are the same and if these twins are dressed alike it is practically impossible to tell one from the other it is a wellknown fact in the case of the mother of the twins who could not tell one from the other that she washed one baby twice and did not wash the other as she said that it was impossible for her to tell which was which when they were undressed their physical appearance being so near alike the reason for twins resembling each other so closely has been thoroughly explained in several magazine articles and it is claimed that identical twins spring from a single germ which is fer tile and breaks thereby producing twins and it can be clearly understood why the disposition and facial expressions of these children would be exactly alike but god in his wonderful workings has made it possible for the scientific world to differentiate these twins by the lines on the soles of the feet the palms of the hands and the fingertips in identical twins it is known to those who have had occasion to examine the impressions of the feet that the pat terns of the right foot of a twin will be very similar to the patterns on the right foot of the other twin this has confused a great many people and they are of the opinion that twins are iden tical in every way but when the minute ridge characteristics in the finger prints and the soles of the feet are examined to the finger print expert it is easily shown that there is no more resemblance between the twins than there is between people of different parentage of all the people in the world since the year b c there have never been found two individuals who have had the same finger prints or foot prints photographs and descriptions have been found very misleading to the various police departments throughout the country and at times they have caused very serious mistakes in identity as it is a wellknown fact that there are a great many people who though they are not related have practically the same facial expression walk or mannerisms and by a person not experienced in iden tification the persons would to all in tents and purposes be pronounced the same
