 the weight of a feather a man in the courtroom who doubted for a moment that the feather in his hand was a swallows feather and when the prisoners attorney excused him he went back to his table conscious of hav ing won another victory over the defense he replaced the feather upon his own table beside the bronze bust and sat down a smile rode across his heavy jowl a verdict of guilty seemed a fore gone conclusion now by his rambling digressions the prisoners counsel had strengthened the case of the state in stead of weakening it and now the counsel seemed to realize it for the first time he sat slumped back in his chair with his stubby fingers interlocked across his loosefitting vest his puttylike face sunk deep in apparent gloom only his china blue eyes were alert those who sat near him noted the odd veiled look that had crept into them please proceed colonel the judges voice roused him to ac tion running his hand into his pocket he pulled out an old thumbmarked notebook opened it and took from it a feather identical with the one on the prosecutors table leaning over he laid the second feather beside the first one i took this one from a swallows nest under the eaves of sargents house just above my clients window he said in a flat colorless tone as if it concerned no one the jurymen looked at one another then at their foreman they sensed that something momentous was about tot be presented to them the colonel glanced their way but not at them he seemed to be regarding some point above their heads beyond them upon one of the wooden brackets supporting the eaves i found a deep gouge torn out of the soft redwood by some hard object striking it his voice rose to a slightly sharper pitch as he went on the bracket is two feet above my clients window and four feet below the lowest point of the eaves arising he walked to the window near the judges bench opened it and ran down the upper sash the window was in direct line of vision of the jury men pulling an oldfashioned colts fortyfive from his pocket he raised the pistol and fired it upward through the halfopen sash the entire courtroom was on its feet before the report had died away the judge towered menacingly above the man who had dared to disturb the tran quillity of his court in such an unheard of manner his eyes were flashing but they grew wide with amazement when a heavy transparent object shot by the window and struck the cement pavement outside with a report louder than the discharge of the pistol judge prosecutor and jury crowded about the window and looked out upon the sidewalk under the window lay the shattered remains of a huge icicle the counsel for the defense was speaking his voice was no longer flat nor colorless nor even drawling the feather which my learned col league so obligingly and correctly classi fied as a swallows feather became fro zen to the point of a giant icicle that dropped from the eaves near the swal lows nest and struck old sargent on the head killing him instantly the icicle in its downward course struck the redwood bracket hence the gouge in the wood the feather was driven three inches into sargents head by the force of the impact the strong thaw which dislodged the icicle melted it away by morning thus obliterating completely the weaponif i may term it a weapon by which mr sargent met his death i ask the court to instruct the jury for acquittal the jurymen glanced at one another and nodded i dont think itll be necessary the foreman said still as a matter of routine i suppose he smiled you win colonel
