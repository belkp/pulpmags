 weird tales enough mingling with this emotion was anothera feeling of fear and anxiety for my friend cold horror that froze my blood kept me rooted to the spot behind me de lacy had fallen to his knees i could hear him repeating the latin words of a prayer all at once i saw where the light was coming from the entire north wall ordinarily lined with books had gone in its stead was a stone wall and in the center of the wall was a lowhung gothic door carved and ornate it was standing open and beyond was a pale luminous yellow mist i could see nothing of what else was be yond the door for the yellow haze filled the entire space it was like a golden fog and its radiance lighted the library with a strange unearthly glow its luminosity glowed upon helene and wrexler like a spotlight for a moment i thought rougemont de lacy everything of the past weeks must have been a dream and that i was watching a cinema of past days all at once before my astonished eyes helene gently drew her lips away from wrex lers she slipped from his arms and extended her hands to him come i heard her say wrexler had been right her voice was like golden honey it was like the music of willow trees in early spring wrexler grasped her hands for the first time i saw his face joy transfigured it such joy as i have never seen before and never shall see again helene moved backward slowly but surely drawing him toward the little gothic door that stood open with her soft lips half parted she whispered come wrexler i cried suddenly he did not hear me as he looked into her eyes he might have been a bird charmed by a snake nothing could break through the spell that bound him they were nearer the door each second brought them closer to it now helene was on the other side the golden mist concentrated upon her until she looked like a goddess in its eery light wrexler wrexler the words tore through my throat wrexler stepped over the threshold through the golden mist i saw him clasp helene in his arms again i saw her smile triumphantly at me as she raised her lips to his there was something in her eyes that filled me with horror the mist swirled about them until i could barely discover the outlines of their figures through its gleaming haze then the door swung slowly shut i awoke to feverish activity wrexler wrexler i shouted and rushed forward to the door i grasped the iron ring that hung in its center i pulled on it with all my might when i found that it resisted all my efforts i began beating against the door itself presently i felt myself being pulled away there is no use my lord de lacys voice was saying the door is gone gone i ejaculated and even as i spoke i saw what he meant the north wall of the library was lined with books as it always had been i had been beat ing upon them impotently i looked down at my hands the knuckles were raw and bleeding just as they would have been from pounding on a heavily carved wooden door de lacy caught my meaning the door was there my lord it was the lost door the door behind which black george buried helene dharcourt it had been lost for centuries i sank into a chair weakly for now the fact that i had lost wrexler my friend was paramount i will tear down the walls until i find it that has been done my lord and it
