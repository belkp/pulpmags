the opener of the way he had said that once inside the figure his soul would direct it to open the way but nothing was happening what was wrong in panic peter bent down and exam ined the body of his father it was limp cold and lifeless sir ronald was dead unbidden peter remembered the parchments cryptic warnings those who do not believe shall die pass lord anubis though they may still he shall know and not permit of their return unto the world of men for the eidolon of anubis is strange indeed and holds a secret soul a secret soul peter terror throbbing in his temples raised the lantern aloft and looked once more into the gods face again he saw that the stony snarl ing mask of anubis held living eyes they glittered bestially knowingly evilly and peter seeing them went berserk he did notcould notthink all he knew was that his father was dead and this statue had somehow killed him and come alive so peter barton suddenly rushed for ward screaming hoarsely and began to beat upon the stone idol with futile fists his bleeding lacerated knuckles clawed at the cold legs but anubis did not stir yet his eyes still held their awful life the man cursed in sheer delirium babbling in a tortured voice as he started to climb up to that mocking face he must know what lay behind that gaze see the thing and destroy its unnatural life as he climbed he sobbed his fathers name in agony how long it took him to reach the top he never knew the last minutes were merely a red blur of nightmare frenzy when he recovered his senses he was clinging precariously to the statues neck his feet braced on the belly of the image and he was still staring into those dread ful living eyes but even as he gazed the whole face was twisting into a sudden ghastly life the lips drew back into a cavern of cackling mirth and the fangs of anubis were bared in terrible avid lust the arms of the god crushed him in a stone embrace the clawlike fingers tightened about his quivering constricted throat the gaping muzzle ravened as stone teeth sank jackallike into his neck thus he met his doombut it was a welcome doom after that final moment of revelation the natives found peters bloodless body lying crushed and crumpled at the idols feet lying before the statue of anubis like a sacrifice of olden days his father was beside him and he too was dead they did not linger there in the for bidden forgotten fastness of that ancient crypt nor attempt to enter into the tomb behind instead they reclosed the doors and returned home there they said that the old and young effendi had killed themselves and that is not surprizing there were really no other indications for them to go by the statue of anubis stood once more serene in the shadows still grimly guarding the secret vaults beyond and there was no longer any hint of life in its eyes and so there is none who knows what peter barton knew just before he died none to know that as peter went down into death he stared upward and beheld the revelation which made that death a welcome deliverance for peter learned what animated the body of the god knew what lived within it in a dreadful distorted way knew what was being forced to kill him be cause as he died he gazed at last into the living stone face of anubisthe living stone face that held his fathers tortured eyes
