the secret of kralitz possess and i learned too of the unbe lievable manner in which iod the source is worshipped beyond the outer galaxies i plumbed the blackest pits of hell and came backlaughing i was one with the rest of those dark warders and i joined them in the saturnalia of horror until the scarred man spoke to us again our time grows short he said his scarred and bearded white face like a gargoyles in the halflight we must depart soon but you are a true kralitz franz and we shall meet again and feast again and make merry for longer than you think one last pledge i gave it to him to the house of kralitz may it never fall and with an exultant shout we drained the pungent dregs of the liquor then a strange lassitude fell upon me with the others i turned my back on the cavern and the shapes that pranced and bellowed and crawled there and i went up through the carved stone portal we filed up the stairs up and up endlessly until at last we emerged through the gap ing hole in the stone flags and proceed ed a dark silent company back through those interminable corridors the sur roundings began to grow strangely famil iar and suddenly i recognized them we were in the great burial vaults below the castle where the barons kra litz were ceremoniously entombed each baron had been placed in his stone casket in his separate chamber and each cham ber lay like beads on a necklace adjacent to the next so that we proceeded from the farthermost tombs of the early barons kralitz toward the unoccupied vaults by immemorial custom each tomb lay bare an empty mausoleum until the time had come for its use when the great stone coffin with the memorial inscription carved upon it would be carried to its place it was fitting indeed for the secret of kralitz to be hidden here abruptly i realized that i was alone save for the bearded man with the dis figuring scar the others had vanished and deep in my thoughts i had not missed them my companion stretched out his blackswathed arm and halted my progress and i turned to him question ingly he said in his sonorous voice i must leave you now i must go back to my own place and he pointed to the way whence we had come i nodded for i had already recognized my companions for what they were i knew that each baron kralitz had been laid in his tomb only to arise as a mon strous thing neither dead nor alive to descend into the cavern below and take part in the evil saturnalia i realized too that with the approach of dawn they had returned to their stone coffins to lie in a deathlike trance until the setting sun should bring brief liberation my own occult studies had enabled me to recog nize these dreadful manifestations i bowed to my companion and would have proceeded on my way to the upper parts of the castle but he barred my path he shook his head slowly his scar hideous in the phosphorescent gloom i said may i not go yet he stared at me with tortured smol dering eyes that had looked into hell it self and he pointed to what lay beside me and in a flash of nightmare realiza tion i knew the secret of the curse of kra litz there came to me the knowledge that made my brain a frightful thing in which shapes of darkness would ever swirl and scream the dreadful compre hension of when each baron kralitz was initiated into the brotherhood of blood i knewi knewthat no coffin had ever been placed unoccupied in the tombs and i read upon the stone sarcophagus at my feet the inscription that made my doom known to memy own name franz twentyfirst baron kralitz
