doom of the house of duryea your aunt on that same night while i was some place between heaven and hell you also heard the padded footsteps on the stone corridor and heard the tugging at your door handle for in the morning you complained of a chill and of terrible nightmares which frightened you in your sleep i only thank god that your door was barred henry duryeas voice choked into a sob which brought the stinging tears back into his eyes he paused to wipe his face and to dig his fingers into his palm you understand arthur that for twenty years under my sworn oath at the palace of justice i could neither see you nor write to you twenty years my son while all of that time you had grown to hate me and to spit at my name not until your aunts death have you called yourself a duryea and now you come to me at my bidding and say you love me as a son should love his father perhaps it is gods forgiveness for everything now at last we shall be together and that terrible unexplainable past will be buried for ever he put his handkerchief back into his pocket and walked slowly to his son he dropped to one knee and his hands gripped arthurs arms my son i can say no more to you i have told you the truth as i alone know it i may be by all accounts some ghoulish creation of satan on earth i may be a childkiller a vampire some morbidly diseased specimen of vrykolakas things which science cannot explain perhaps the dreaded legend of the duryeas is true autiel duryea was con victed of murdering his brother in that same monstrous fashion in the year and he died in flames at the stake francois duryea in blew his head apart with a blunderbuss on the morning after his youngest son was found dead apparently from anemia and there are others of whom i cannot bear to speak that would chill your soul if you were to hear them so you see arthur there is a hellish tradition behind our family there is a heritage which no sane god would ever have allowed the future of the duryeas lies in you for you are the last of the race i pray with all of my heart that providence will permit you to live your full share of years and to leave other duryeas behind you and so if ever again i feel that presence as i did in duryea castle i am going to die as francois duryea died over a hundred years ago he stood up and his son stood up at his side if you are willing to forget arthur we shall go up to that lodge in maine there is a life weve never known awaiting us we must find that life and we must find the happiness which a curi ous fate snatched from us on those lom bard sourlands twenty years ago henry duryeas tall stature coupled with a slenderness of frame and a sleekness of muscle gave him an appearance that was unusually gaunt his son couldnt help but think of that word as he sat on the rustic porch of the lodge watching his father sunning him self at the lakes edge henry duryea had a kindliness in his face at times an almost sublime kindli ness which great prophets often possess but when his face was partly in shadows particularly about his brow there was a frightening tone which came into his features for it was a tone of farness of mysticism and conjuration somehow in
