isle of the undead to a chant which he could not hear something a chilling presence hovered about him seemed to settle upon him cloaking him with the might of the devil himself that unheard incantation con tinued and cliff felt a cold rigidity creeping through every fiber slowly freezing his limbs into columns of ice with a mighty effort of will he flung himself toward that accursed drinker of bloodand at that instant a terrific de tonation rocked the ancient building and a cloud of smoke and flame burst from the opening in the wall cliff was hurled from his feet rolled over and over and crashed against the wall by the awful concussion the cutlas and silver horn sent whirling through the air dizzily he staggered to his feet crouching defensively sounds came to him clearly now the explosion must have jarred the plugs from his ears he scanned the room saw the unclad hu mans scattered everywhere most of them lying still and unconscious he saw vilma rising slowly then he looked for the monsters in red startled he saw them rushing toward the opening in the wall to vanish in its smokefilled inter ior why did they then he knew down there somewhere were their graves graves rent and broken by the explo siongraves threatened by the flames and panic had seized the vampires fear of the death which would result with exile from their tombs unsteadily cliff crossed to vilma she saw him coming and flung herself sob bing into his arms he crushed her lithe form closeand another explosion more violent than the first sent a section of the stone floor leaping upward as though with life of its own clinging to vilma cliff managed to maintain his footing though the floor bucked and heaved a snapping booming roarand a great chasm opened in the floor a breathless instantand a segment of the stone stairs rumbling thunderously dropped out of sight into a newly formed pit with it went the blasphemous altar and its phosphorescent fire deafened stunned momentarily powerless to move cliffs mind groped for an explanation it seemed incredible that gunpowder could cause such havoc and the swaying of the floor continued the thick stone walls shook alarmingly suddenly he understood an earthquake the explosions had jarred the nonetoo stable understrata of rock into spasmodic motion that must grind everything to bits the island was doomed and earth would be better without it if only they could reach the ariel first new strength flowed through him and hugging vilma close he staggered toward the spot where he knew the door must be somehow he reached it and reeled down the broken stone steps the plain of dead trees swayed like the deck of a ship in a storm as cliff started across it a gale had arisen and swept in from the sea ripping dry branches from the skeleton growths and whirling them about like straws yet somehow cliff reached the crevice in the rock wall with his burden reached the deck of the galley crossed it and won to the safety of the ariel minutes later with diesel engines purring they crept out through the narrow channel into the open sea ten minutes later the isle of the undead lay safely behind them vilma had dressed and now they sat together in the pilot house cliff had one arm about her and one hand on the wheel and so the girl was saying while corio carried you to that terrible old boat i got loose he hadnt tied me very tightly and i slipped my hands
