isle of the undead sea had carved into hollow eyesockets and an empty nasal cavity the rock wall ended high above the water beneath it lay a gaping chasm of pitchy darkness and the galley drum silenced oars at rest slid under the ledge into the mouth of the skull just before total blackness fell cliff sprang to vilmas side and raised her in his arms if he hoped to do anything he must do it now he groped his way to the starboard bow and moved one hand along the dank timbers searching he found what he sought a wide gap at the edge of a board gently lowering vilma to the floor he gripped the slimy wood with both hands and thrust outward mightily a wide strip of decayed tim ber burst free he dropped it into the sea and attacked the next board in mo ments a wide irregular opening yawned in the galleys hull leaning out cliff looked down he could see nothing then suddenly a faint light appeared and he heard the hum of the ariels motors as she entered the cave the humming ceased instantly but the faint light persisted now he could see the blackness of wa ters a rock wall beyond he drew back and as he did so he heard movements on deck at any moment the rowers might enter hed have to risk a drop into the water with vilmathere was nothing else to do if only she were conscious he stooped and raised her holding her firmly with one arm gripping the hull with the other he climbed through the opening inhaled deeply and dropped a heartstopping plungeand cold water closed over them down downthen they shot upward reached the surface and even as cliff gulped a single gasping breath something struck his skull a blind ing stunning blow the oars with rapidly numbing arms and legs cliff kicked and flailed the water striving for land dimly he knew he no longer held vilma dimly he visioned her as were those ghastly undead then his body scraped on something hard and a black ness that was not physical blotted out con sciousness the dreadful isle redhot hammers pounding against his temples wakened cliff darrell he opened his eyes to stare into total darkness crawling with mental monsters spawned by his painstabbed brain he lay half immersed in shallow brine his head resting on a jagged stone just above the surface struggling to his hands and knees he shook his head from side to side dumbly like an animal in pain something had hit himand now he was in waterand there was no light what had happened where was vilma vilma he groaned he remembered now they had droppedand his head had struck somethingandand maybe she was floating out there even now dead eyes staring upward vilma he cried his voice pleading vilma only a mocking echo answered him there was no other sound not even the whisper of waves swishing among the rocks cliff pressed his hands fiercely against his throbbing head the pain had become a madness matched only by the agony of his own helplessness he felt his reason reeling he fought an insane desire to fling himself shrieking into that silent expanse of water to search for vilma then with a tremendous physical effort he jarred himself back to sanity he staggered to his feet groped stum blingly over the rocks away from the wa ter his hand touched a rock wall broken and pitted by the action of the sea and he crept stowly inland feeling his way
