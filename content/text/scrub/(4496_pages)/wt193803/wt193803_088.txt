the hairy ones shall dance curious and despite his temporary col lapse hes no coward i agree with that chimed in susan as for my pursuers of the previous night the judge went on they had been roaming the snowcovered streets in twos and threes heavily armed for the most part and still determined to punish me for killing their neighbor the council was too frightened or too perplexed to deal with the situation and the constable was still in bed with his brother assum ing authority when judge pursuivant made his inquiries the judge went to see the wounded man who very pluckily determined to rise and take up his duties again ill arrest the man who plugged me obryant had promised grimly and that kid brother of mine can quit playing policeman the judge applauded these sentiments and brought him hot food and whisky which further braced his spirits in the evening came the invasion by the younger obryant of the devils croft and his resultant death at the claws and teeth of what prowled there his throat was so torn open and filled with blood that he could not speak the judge concluded but he pointed back into the timber and then tried to trace something in the snow with his finger it looked like a wolfs head with pointed nose and ears he died before he finished you saw him come out i asked no id gone back to town but later i saw the body and the sketch in the snow he finished his dinner and pushed back his chair now he said heartily its up to us up to us to do what i inquired to meet that monster face to face he replied there are three of us and so far as i can ascertain but one of the enemy both susan and i started to speak but he held up his hand smiling i know without being reminded that the odds are still against us because the one enemy is fierce and blooddrinking and can change shape and character maybe it can project itself to a distancewhich makes it all the harder both for us to face it and for us to get help i know what you mean by that last i nodded gloomily if there were ten thousand friendly constables in the neigh borhood instead of a single hostile one they wouldnt believe us right agreed judge pursuivant were like the group of perplexed mor tals in dracula who had only their own wits and weapons against a monster no more forbidding than ours it is hard to show clearly how his con stant offering of parallels and rational izations comforted us only the unknown and unknowable can terrify completely we three were even cheerful over a bot tle of wine that william fetched and poured out in three glasses judge pur suivant gave us a toastmay wolves go hungryand susan and i drank it gladly dont forget whats on our side said the judge putting down his glass i mean the stedfast and courageous heart of which i preached to wills last night and which we can summon from within us any time and anywhere the werewolf dauntlessly faced loses its dread and i think we are the ones to face it now were ready for action i said that i would welcome any kind of action whatsoever and susan touched my arm as if in endorsement of the re mark judge pursuivants spectacles glit tered in approval you two will go into the devils croft he announced im going back to town once more
