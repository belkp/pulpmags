 weird tales lighting features were installed so that pictures could be shot from several differ ent angles at once and pieced together later as keene cut the film and now there entered something of the touch of genius which had made keene famous he was clever i had always realized that yet in the scenes that were next unfolded i admired not so much the technical trickswhich were familiar enough to meas the marvelously clever way in which keene had managed to in ject realism into the acting his charac ters did not actthey lived or rather they died for in the pic ture they were thrust into the under ground room to die horribly as sacrifices to the monstergod from the aztec tem ple sacrifice was supposed to bring the thing to life to cause the jewel in which its existence was bound to flare with fan tastic splendor the first sacrifice was i think the most effective the underground room in which the god was hidden was large but quite va cant save for a curtained alcove which held the idol a barred doorway led to the upper room and here keene appeared on the screen revolver in hand herding before him a manoverallclad with a stubble of black beard on his stolid face keene swung open the door motioned his captive into the great room he closed the barred door and through the grating could be seen busy at a switchboard light flared the man stood near the bars and then at keenes gesture with his weapon moved forward slowly to the far wall he stood there staring around vaguely dull apprehension in his face light threw his shadow in bold relief on the wall then another shadow leaped into ex istence beside him it was barrelshaped gigantic studded with blunt spikes and capped by a round dark blobthe lifejewel the shadow of the monster god the man saw it he turned stark horror sprang into his face and at sight of that utterly ghastly and realistic expression a chill struck through me this was almost too convincing the man could not be merely acting but if he was his acting was superb and so was keenes direction the shad ow on the wall stirred and a thrill of movement shook it it rocked and seemed to rise supported by a dozen tentacular appendages that uncoiled from beneath its base the spikeschanged they lengthened they coiled and writhed hideously wormlike it wasnt the metamorphosis of the shadow that held me motionless in my chair rather it wras the appalling ex pression of sheer horror on the mans face he stood gaping as the shadow toppled and swayed on the wall grow ing larger and larger then he fled his mouth an open square of terror the shadow paused with an odd air of inde cision and slipped slowly along the wall out of range of the camera but there were other cameras and keene had used his cuttingshears deftly the movements of the man were mir rored on the screen the glaring lights swung and flared and ever the grim shadow crawled hideously across the wall the thing that cast it was never shown just the shadow and it was a dramatically effective trick too many directors i knew could not have resisted the tempta tion to show the monster thus destroy ing the illusionfor papiermachăš and rubber no matter how cleverly con structed cannot convincingly ape reality at last the shadows mergedthe gi gantic swaying thing with its coiling ten tacles and the black shadow of the man that was caught and lifted struggling and kicking frantically the shadows mergedand the man did not reappear
