dreadful sleep me until i looked up into those great purple orbs they came down to my face and i felt a warmth of supernal peace the fear was gone thats right i said were going to use atomic power doctor bell hopes to make the whole continent temperate and open it up to settlement then you must give up the plan karalee rendered the swift reply for the ice must never be thawed death is sleeping under the ice ron dunbar the death of all the world take care lest you rouse it death i demanded what do you mean then took place the strangest and cer tainly the most terrible part of all that in credible adventure we still stood together beside that colossal purple pylon on the naked gran ite of that frozen peak red as blood the midnight sun burned low in the horizon less distance where the gray illimitable desert of ice merged with the gray and featureless sky a bitter wind howled and moaned about the towers of the pylon i was insensible of any cold but the girl karalee was already pale shiver ing she had gestured toward the steps that led down to the door in the rock let us go down into my rooms she said it is warmer there dark with longing and regret her eyes looked at marumora and back at me if you are forbidden ever to return at least marumoras piping cut her off as if answering a command the girl stepped quickly to the flying being she held out a mittened hand tiny golden fingers clasped it come the girl translated maru mora is carrying us to see the peril that you must not rouse it is they that sleep we rose again i had the briefest glimpse of karalee left standing on that frozen ledge her arm rigidly extended yet she was with us also drawn by maru moras other handdrawn out of her body as i had been we three soared swiftly through chill gray mists descended upon a rugged iceplain from which jutted great boulders of granite black naked shat tered with the frost of ages we stood at the brink of a dark crevasse karalee pointed across it her lips moved twice before she could speak and her voice came muffled breath less choked with horror there she said one of them it is the watcher i shuddered at sight of that monstrous thing it stood upright upon a cragged boulder and it did not move the body of it was black covered with great scales a swollen elongated thing shaped like an immense barrel it stood upon three black tentacular limbs whose extremities had coiled like mighty serpents to grasp the granite head it had none but the bulged up per end of the black body was broken with a great sharp triangular projection which looked like a hideous snout three scaled triangular flaps just about its swol len equatorial belt might i thought cover strange organs of sense this creature was utterly horrifying in a sense i can hardly define its horror held nothing familiar if marumora was clearly nonhuman it was certainly non terrestrial it chilled me with an element al absolute revulsion i knew that the girl was sick and cold with dread i heard her make a pleading little whistle her human imitation of the voice of marumora her strained hoarse whisper came to me urgent look swiftly ron so that we can go i do not like these things but maru mora says you must see
