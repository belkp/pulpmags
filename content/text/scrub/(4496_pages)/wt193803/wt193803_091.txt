 weird tales ing how i had met the judge for the first time so shortly after my desperate strug gle with the pointeared demon no body knows where he was when the con stables brother was attacked and mortally wounded she gazed about fearfully nobody she added breathlessly knows where he is now i was remembering a conversation with him he had spoken of books mentioning a rare a supposedly nonexistent volume what was it the wicked bible and what was it i had once heard about that work it came back to me now out of the subconscious brainchamber where ap parently one stores everything he hears or reads in idleness and from which such items creep on occasion it had been in lewis spences encyclopedia of occult ism now on the shelf in my new york apartment the wicked bible scripture for witches and wizards from which magicmongers of the dark ages drew their inspiration and their knowledge and judge pur suivant had admitted to having one what had he learned from it how had he been so glib about the science yes and the psychologyof being a werewolf if what we suspect is true i said to susan we are here at his mercy no body is going to come in here not if horses dragged them at his leisure he will fall upon us and tear us to pieces but even as i spoke i despised myself for my weak fears in her presence i picked up my club and was comforted by its weight and thickness i met that devil once i said study ing cheer and confidence into my voice this time i dont think it relished the meeting any too much next time wont be any more profitable for it she smiled at me as if in comradely encouragement then we both started and fell silent there had risen somewhere among the thickets a long low whining i put out a foot stealthily as though fearful of being caught in motion a quick kick flung more wood on the fire i blinked in the light and felt the heat standing there as a primitive man might have stood in his flameguarded camp to face the horrors of the ancient world i tried to judge by ear the direction of that whine it died and i heard perhaps in my imagination a stealthy padding then the whining began again from a new quarter and nearer i made myself step toward it my shadow leaping grotesquely among the tree trunks almost frightened me out of my wits the whine had changed into a crooning wail such as that with which dogs salute the full moon it seemed to plead to promise and it was coming closer to the clearing once before i had challenged and taunted the thing with scornful words now i could not make my lips form a single syllable probably it was just as well for i thought and watched the more something black and cautious was mov ing among the branches just beyond the shrubbery that screened it from our fire light i knew without need of a clear view what that black something was i lifted my club to the ready the sound it made had become in some fashion articulate though not human in any quality there were no words to it but it spoke to the heart the note of plea and promise had become one of com mandand not directed to me i found my own voice get out of here you devil i roared at it and threw my club even as i let go of it i wished i had not the bushes foiled my aim and the missile crashed
