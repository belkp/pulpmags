weird tales totalare reprints probably not surprizing since the reprints represent in theory and usually in practise the cream of bygone is sues i shouldnt be surprized if a demand soon arose for a rereprint section in which some of the reprints of eight and nine years ago might reappear once more you began reprinting from back numbers in when wt was only five years old now it has rounded out its fifteenth year and it might be reasoned that a story which was worth reprinting once five years after its first publication might merit another such honor ten years later overrated richard kraft of allenhurst new jersey writes to my mind the most overrated story you have ever published was quest of the starstone it was simply a cheap thriller and did not compare with paul ernsts dread summons or rex ernests the inn in the december issue edmond hamilton again writes a winner child of atlantis hamil ton is the best in the business and i enjoy his work immensely the seawitch was terrible i cant see what weird tales readers will find in it as it was slow and tiresome noth ing like that swell story of mary counsel mans in that issue the black stone statue virgil finlays drawings doctor karl k webber writes from flora illinois this is the first time i have writ ten you although i have been an avid reader of weird tales for about six years in the december issue the seawitch is tops with flames of vengeance a close sec ond and child of atlantis hot on the lat ters heels one thing must be kept in your publication and that is virgil finlays draw ing im a little bit of an artist myself and i recognize a masterful touch when i see it no one can approach his subtle mastery of pen and ink orchids to virgil a million congratulations julius hopkins writes from washington d c roads is one of the most highclass stories that wt has ever printed through out the language is elevating and not the usual pulpy kind prevalent in a great many tales written today i truly believe that any magazine would have been glad to have this story between its covers wt should be mighty proud to have been privileged to print it a million congratulations to you mr quinn for a really outstanding story norse mythology m w schauffler of larchmont new york writes the howard and quinn stories have been what i have bought the magazine for and i have been buying it for eight years one other thing which makes your magazine a pleasure is that almost always the mythology and other background data are accurate so please speak to nictzin dyalhis if you dont mind and ask him to check a little more carefully i dont know when i have liked a story better than the seawitch but the moment when his witch and his hero both agreed that ran was a god not a goddess wrecked the illusion of factuality for me to the end of the story and there were two other minor slips no viking was ever named gudrun any more than he was named eliza and for the same reasonit is a womans name neither was comnenus ever spelled with two nsdtough thats a small matter as for the vikings re frain to the rowingsong he probably knows more than i do about thati am not an authority on norse legends but i have a feeling that it isnt entirely or at least typ ically a sea refrain quinns masterpiece bernard austin dwyer writes from west shokan new york my first choice of stories in the january issue is roads by sea bury quinn this is truly quinns master piece i have never seen anything even re motely so good by him in my opinion it far overtops even the phantom farmhouse apart from the story itself which is delight ful and wonderfulthe fetching together of such ordinarily widely separated elements as christs crucifixion a blond heroic warrior from the north a harlot from the house of magdalene the eastern and western dynas ties and the middle ages the little carved sleighs the dwarf faery smiths of the moun tains and the legend of santa clausthe style itself is very beautiful i love especially the last few paragraphs with their flavor of the iron and heroic north the valhallalike feast how klaus laid aside his arms and the final piercing and beautiful paragraph but i love everythingthe story and the style from beginning to end this story will go down as one of the very best by any
