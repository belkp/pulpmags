incense of abomination on it upside down before the cross there was a silver wine goblet and a box of gilt inlay about the size and shape of a ladys powderpuff box i heard atkins catch his breath and give a sort of groan hed been brought up an episcopalian and knew about such things he turned half round to leave but i caught him by the sleeve come on you fool dont be a sissy i admonished and next moment we were all so interested that he had no thought of leaving there was a sort of congregation in the chapel every seat was occupied by someone masked and robed just as we were save three vacant places by the altar steps these we knew were kept for us but when we looked about for herbules he was nowhere to be seen so we went forward to our seats alone we could hear a hum of whispering as we walked up the aisle and we knew some of the voices were from women but who was man and who was woman was impossible to tell for each one looked just like his neighbor in his shrouding robe the whispering suddenly became in tense like the susurrus of a hive of swarming bees every neck seemed sud denly to crane every eye to look in one direction and as we turned our glances toward the right side of the cellar we saw a woman entering through a cur tained doorway she wore a long loose scarlet cape which she held together with one hand her hair was very black her eyes were large and luminously dark seeming to have a glance of overbearing sensuousness and sweet humility at once her white set face was an imponderable mask her full red lips were fixed in an uneven bitter line beneath the hem of her red cloak we saw the small feet in the golden highheeled slippers were un stockinged as she neared the altar she sank low in genuflection then wheeled about and faced us for a moment she stood there svelte graceful mysteriously beautiful with that thin white face and scarlet lips so like a mask then with a sudden kicking motion she unshod her feet opened wide her cloak and let it fall in scarlet billows on the dullblack carpet of the altar steps she was so beautiful it almost hurt the eyes to look at her as she stood there in white silhouette against the ebon back ground of the blackdraped altar with her narrow boylike hips slim thighs and full high pointed breasts she was a thing of snow and fire her body palely cool and virginal her lips like flame her eyes like embers blazing when a sudden wind stirs them to brightness the modern striptease routine was unthought of in those days and though i was sophisticated far beyond my eighteen years i had never seen a woman in the nude before the flame of her raced in my blood and crashed against my brain with almost numbing impact i felt my self go faint and sick with sudden weak ness and desire
