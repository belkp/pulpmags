 weird tales herbules was waiting for us in a perfect fever of excitement when we tiptoed up his frontporch steps on wednesday night he had a domino and mask for each of us the dominoes were fiery red with hoods that pulled up like monks cowls the masks were black and hideous they represented long thin faces with outjutting chins the lips were purple and set in horrid grins the eye brows were bright scarlet wool and at the top there was another patch of bright red worsted curled and cut to simulate a fringe of hair good lord said atkins as he tried his on i look just like the devil i thought that herbules would have a stroke when he heard atkins speak youll use that name with more respect after tonight my boy he said after that we all got in his car and drove down toward red bank we stopped about a mile outside of town and parked the car in a small patch of woods walked some distance down the road climbed a fence and cut across a field till we reached an old deserted house id seen the place as i drove past and had often wondered why it was unoccu pied for it stood up on a hill surrounded by tall trees and would have made an ideal summer home but id been told its well was dry and as there was no other source of water nobody wanted it we didnt go to the front door but tiptoed round the back where herbules struck three quick raps waited for a mo ment then knocked four more wed all put on our robes and masks while he was knocking and when the door was opened on a crack we saw the porter was robed and masked as we were nobody said a word and we walked through a basement entrance down a long and nar row hall and turned a corner where we met another door here herbules went through the same procedure and the door swung back to let us in we were in a big room twenty by forty feet i guess and we knew it was a cellar by the smellstiflingly close but clammy as a tomb at once rows of fold ing chairs like those used at bridge games or funeralswere arranged in double rows with a passage like an aisle between and at the farther end of the big room we saw an altar in all my life i dont believe id been to church ten times but we were nom inally protestants so what i saw had less effect on me than if id been a catholic or episcopalian but i knew at once the altar wasnt regulation oh it was suffi ciently impressive but it had a sort of comicno not comic grotesque rather note about it a reredos of black cloth was hung against the wall and before it stood a heavy table more than eight feet long and at least six wide covered by a black cloth edged with white it reminded me of something though i couldnt quite identify it for a moment then i knew id seen a jewish funeral once and this cloth was like the blackserge pall they used to hide the plain pine coffin at each end of the altar stood a seven branched candelabrum made of brass each with a set of tall black candles in it these were burning and gave off a pale blue glow they seemed to be perfumed too and the odor which they burned with was pleasantat first then as i sniffed a second time it seemed to me there was a faint suspicion of a stench about it something like the fetor that you smell if youre driving down the road and pass a dog or cat thats been run over and has lain a while out in the sunjust a mo mentary whiff but nauseating just the same between the candelabra right ex actly in the center of the altar but back against the wall was a yardhigh crucifix of some black wood with an ivory figure
