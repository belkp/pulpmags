the girl from samarcand what do you want me to do throw it away i dont care what you do with it only i wont stay in the house with it it gives me the creeps youve said en tirely too much in your sleep latelyfirst yellow rugs and now its a yellow girl im through clarkes brows rose in saracenic arches and then he smiled with surprizing friendliness and a touch of wonder di why didnt you tell me sooner i could understand your craving alligator pears at in the morningi might have understood that but hating a rug is really a new one on me no stupid its nothing like that i just hate the damned thing and no more to be said well lacking the infallible alibi clarke glared and assumed his fighting faceif you mean i choose between you and the rug ill call a taxi right now dont bother ill walk the door slammed clarke twisted his mustache and achieved a laugh not merry but still a laugh and then he sank back among the cushions yellow girl i thought you were fan tastic le vieux carre wondered when the next morning it was rumored that la belle livaudaise had been seen hurry ing down saint peter street without speaking to any one of the several ac quaintances she had met but when at the green shutter and the old quarter bookstore it was announced that diane was living in a loft of the pontalba building wonder ceased for dianes friend louise had been no less garrulous than she should have been so that the habitues of the french quarter were pre pared for the news and then it was said that to gain ad mittance to clarkes studio one must know the code of taps whereby someone who at times left a certain side door bear ing bottles of pernod announced his ar rival for clarke answered neither door bell nor telephone the vendor of pernod was certainly a discreet person yet even a discreet seller of absinthe could see no harm in mentioning that his patron found enormous fascination in watching the play of sunlight and the dance of moon beams on the golden buff pile of a rug that was more a sleeping breathing crea ture than any sane child of the loom finally the courier failed to gain ad mittance despite his tapping in code and this he thought worthy of dianes ear he starves himself petitesince three days now he has not admitted me all the while she lies there gleaming in the moon that awful rugmordieu it is terrible diane had stedfastly denied that which had been clamoring for recognition but when this last bit was added to what had gone before logic gave way and dianes fears asserted themselves that rug was haunted was bewitched was bedevilling clarke logic or no logic the fact was plain driven by that monstrous thought diane exhumed the little golden key ring and started up royal street deter mined to cross the barrier before it be came impassable but her determination wavered and before fitting the wellworn key into the lock she applied her ear to the keyhole listened and heard clarkes voice diane resisted the temptation to use her key and stage a scene that even in the imperturbable vieux carrăš would be sensational for at least a week then her pride conquered and she achieved a most credible smile of disdain
