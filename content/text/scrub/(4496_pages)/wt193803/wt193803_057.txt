 weird tales the black monstrosity indeed held my gaze with a fascination of utter terror it had been there motionless a long time the great black scales were silvered with frost snow was banked beyond it the ice had climbed up over the coils of its ophidian limbs the boulder was cracked i saw shat tered time had splintered the granite since those giant tentacles first grasped it only their frozen pressure held it from crumbling how many centuries surely after so long i thought it must be deadand i knew that it was not nothing dead could inspire such resist less fear i sensedor fancieda slow implacable beat like a pulse of evil measured menacing mindshattering i flinched suddenly turned away hid my eyes with a trembling hand i fought a strange and elemental sickness a new born horror that gnawed wormlike at the marrow of my bones it brought a flood of vast relief when come said karalee we go to see the others we left that stark eternal black sentinel overlooking the glaciers we soared swiftly through the leaden mists came down upon ridged and fissured ice the others said the girl are all about their ship beneath the ice driven by a fascinated compulsion to see all i could even though the horror of it should consume me i was striving in vain to peer down through the graywhite obscurity of the icewhen suddenly we were beneath it down through the darkness of the gla cier we plunged as swiftly as through the air above the ice was all around us like a bluegreen liquid and suddenly we were standing again on a long ridge of granite we were far beneath the glacier which was like a thick greenblack mist above us i could see little at first but gradually my vision sharpenedor perhaps marumora in some manner shared her own strange senses with meand i perceived the great valley beyond and below us dim in the green haze of the ice i presently distinguished a cyclopean ma chine resting on tremendous skids which lay far along the floor of the val ley it was all of darkly gleaming red black metal a colossal bulging hull sur rounded with a confusion of struts and braces masts and booms and metal arms mysterious rods and vanes towered even above the ridge where we stood it was like the bloated body of some monstrous spider crouching with folded limbs set to spring here and there about those crimson planes and arms frozen motionless in the green mist of ice i saw black and hid eous beings like the watcher scaled bod ies headless and bulging supported on triple ophidian limbs an alien horror touched me as we stood on that black ridge beneath the ice it was the stark menace of the outside the terror of worlds strange beyond con ception of powers and entities supernal monstrous utterly alien that stark won dering elemental dreadsome dim in stinctive inkling of it i think is at the basis of many primitive religionsis the most terrible emotion a human being can feel dimly through the numbness of my dread as if i dreamed within a dream i heard the piping of marumora and karalee spoke that is the ship that came from beyond and they are the tharshoon they came to conquer earth that was in another age before the ice came here this was a fair world then and my peo ple ruled it man was not born i knew that this was marumora
