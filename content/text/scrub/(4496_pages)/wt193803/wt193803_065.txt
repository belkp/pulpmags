 weird tales slowly deepened life in the antarctic is a grim enough business at best and hard ings increasingly evil nature made it at times almost insupportable but aside from all that there had been something elsesomething that bell and perhaps even jerry must have sensed more keenly than i when i say that the camp was haunted it sounds like superstitious nonsense yet almost from the day of our arrival i had a curious uneasy feeling that it was that some strange intangible presence hung about us alertly watching every move we made listening to every word we said bell and jerry i think were more con scious of it than i for i often saw them silent with cocked heads and strained intent faces listening its nothing ron jerry said once when i asked her what she listened for her tired face tried to smile im just nervous i guess worried about poor aston he has changed so grown so much worsehave you noticed and bell as we worked together about his tower often paused to peer away across the ice he laughed when i spoke about it but his white face remained very grave just a feeling he said that some thing is watching ustrying to speak to us perhaps his thin frame abruptly shivered ive a queer feeling ron he confessed that we shouldnt thaw the ice im somehow afraid his dark tor tured eyes stared away again his voice sank low yes afraidof what we might uncover the warning of that singular dream came to me again i felt an impulse to tell bell about it but checked my tongue he was troubled enough already i didnt want to increase his anxiety for still i believed it a dream i dared not regard it as anything else sometimes i found myself staring northward toward the mountains of uranus wondering if the seekers purple pylon might indeed stand on some summit there but i could never see it march had gone and most of april when the thing happened that crys tallized all my vague apprehensions and shattered the routine of our life at camp that started the dread avalanche that did not end until all the world had been overwhelmed in horror the whole camp was asleep after a long shift spent bolting together the sec tions of bells tower i started suddenly awake alarmed yet not knowing what had roused me for an instant i lay still listening the wind which had blown steadily for many days had died at first i could hear only a soft weird rustlingthe whisper of the aurora but suddenly mingled with that eery sussuration i caught another sounda sound terribly familiar and yet incred ible a thin far wailing infinitely sweet and infinitely sad it held all the heart broken loneliness of the world caught in slow eery minors so faint they mocked the ears it was the piping of the seeker of my dream the voice of marumora or had i merely dreamed again for it had ceased breathless and trembling uncertain that i had heard anything at all i donned furs and hastened up out of our icebur row into the polar night the unutter able appalling splendor of it caught me held me for a moment motionless complete calm had fallen the air curiously brilliant with frost was abso lutely still the clear sky was purple black the southern constellations pale be yond the most brilliant auroral display i ever witnessed pure silver crystal green
