the head in the window if a gang of assassins had held a mur dered man up to his window a minute or two before they could scarcely have made so complete a getaway in so short a time the shutters on the window below were closed and locked there was nothing to climb up by and except for the feeling that he had heard something in his dream the painter was sure that not a sound had reached him from outside the building the dog ran back and forth between the artist and the stairway animals have remarkable leadings and the painter thought seriously of making the round of the garden but it seemed to him as he thought it over that such a procedure would be useless at best and that at worst it would be courting trouble if bandits were about what could one timid citizen armed with an old revolver that had never been fired in its life do against them all that could be expected of him certainly was to watch from inside his house till morning he closed his win dow and ordered the dog back to his cushion just before he drew the window down he had had the impression that he heard steps run rapidly along the stone pave ment that lay just below it he raised it again and looked down no one was in sight and not a sound was to be heard he stood by the window struggling to get a grip on himself he wondered if he could be ill he knew that various de lusions come from physical causes within the one who experiences them he had tried so desperately hard to visualize the head which he needed for his picture that his effort combined with the effect of the heavy falerno wine he had drunk might easily have produced a psychic ef fect which caused him to see visions and hear sounds that had transpired only in his imagination he had almost con vinced himself that he had found the key to the enigma when his glance fell on his dog obediently crouching on his cushion but still wideeyed and excited it seemed to him exactly as if someone spoke out from right behind him but what about the dog does your psychopathic theory explain the way the dog is acting suddenly the painters mood of anxiety and puzzlement gave way to one of im patience he was tired and nervous he was disgusted with the whole annoying affair he dropped on his bed again and in a mood of something like defiance he flung off the perplexity and dropped into a heavy sleep nothing happened till morning when the bright sun shone into the window instead of the ghostly moon he was ready to laugh the whole matter off as a halftipsy dream and to class the dogs strange conduct with various other evidences of unaccountable nervousness which that animal had shown at various times he sat down at his easel and went seriously to work at his new sketch he discovered that he knew the bearded face now feature by feature and the task went smoothly it was marvelous how vividly the face and form of the heavy fellow came out under the artists eager fingers this would be his best picture he was sure of that as he was working he heard some body knock at the door downstairs he made a few rapid strokes still hastily kicked off his slippers and pulled on his shoes and went down it was doubtless the peasant woman he thought who brought him his milk every morning but who brought it at the most unaccountably irregular hours if she wasnt willing to follow a fairly even schedule there was no reason why he should discommode himself to keep her from waiting a min ute or two
