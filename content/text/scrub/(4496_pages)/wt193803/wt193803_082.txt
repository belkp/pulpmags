beyond the wall of sleep nucleus of something beyond my com prehension something infinitely beyond the comprehension of my more experi enced but less imaginative medical and scientific colleagues and yet i could extract nothing definite from the man the sum of all my in vestigation was that in a kind of semi corporeal dreamlife slater wandered or floated through resplendent and pro digious valleys meadows gardens cities and palaces of light in a region unbound ed and unknown to man that there he was no peasant or degenerate but a crea ture of importance and vivid life moving proudly and dominantly and checked only by a certain deadly enemy who seemed to be a being of visible yet ethereal structure and who did not ap pear to be of human shape since slater never referred to it as a man or as aught save a thing this thing had done slater some hideous but unnamed wrong which the maniac if maniac he were yearned to avenge from the manner in which slater al luded to their dealings i judged that he and the luminous thing had met on equal terms that in his dream existence the man was himself a luminous thing of the same race as his enemy this impression was sustained by his frequent references to flying through space and burning all that impeded his progress yet these con ceptions were formulated in rustic words wholly inadequate to convey them a cir cumstance which drove me to the con clusion that if a true dream world indeed existed oral language was not its medium for the transmission of thought could it be that the dream soul inhabiting this inferior body was desperately struggling to speak things which the simple and halting tongue of dullness could not ut ter could it be that i was face to face with intellectual emanations which would explain the mystery if i could but learn to discover and read them i did not tell the older physicians of these things for middle age is skeptical cynical and dis inclined to accept new ideas besides the head of the institution had but lately warned me in his paternal way that i was overworking that my mind needed a rest it had long been my belief that human thought consists basically of atomic or molecular motion convertible into ether waves of radiant energy like heat light and electricity this belief had early led me to contemplate the possibility of telep athy or mental communication by means of suitable apparatus and i had in my college days prepared a set of transmitting and receiving instruments somewhat simi lar to the cumbrous devices employed in wireless telegraphy at that crude pre radio period these i had tested with a fellowstudent but achieving no result had soon packed them away with other scientific odds and ends for possible fu ture use now in my intense desire to probe in to the dreamlife of joe slater i sought these instruments again and spent sev eral days in repairing them for action when they were complete once more i missed no opportunity for their trial at each outburst of slaters violence i would fit the transmitter to his forehead and the receiver to my own constantly making delicate adjustments for various hypo thetical wavelengths of intellectual en ergy i had but little notion of how the thoughtimpressions would if successfully conveyed arouse an intelligent response in my brain but i felt certain that i could detect and interpret them accordingly i continued my experiments though in forming no one of their nature it was on the twentyfirst of february that the thing occurred as i look back across the years i realize how unreal it seems and sometimes half won
