 elsa barker cowboy threw a glance over his shoulder at the moon it was halfway down now the man on the gray was far enough ahead that he could easily give walt the slip once it was dark if walt were going to catch him he would have to do it quick walt dug his spurs in a little deeper leaned low in the saddle and brought the end of his lariat down sharply over the horses rump the bay seemed to have been saving an extra little spurt of speed he stretched his neck and gave it now for another moment the distance between the horses seemed to hold then gradually it lessened the man ahead tossed a quick shot behind from under his arm walt kept on coming but now the light was beginning to dim walt estimated the distance between the two horses and judged that he was within sixgun range suddenly he yanked the bay to a sliding stop jumped from the saddle took a second for a careful aim and pulled the trigger the gray stumbled went down on one knee the rider catapulted over his neck to manage somehow to light squatting on his feet the gray horse was back on his feet the next instant walt held his next shot wait ing for the man to show behind the snort ing lunging horse instead of trying to remount the cowboy saw that the man was headed on a dead run for a cornpatch not more than a dozen steps to his right walt fired again and saw the man duck lower as he ran the cowboy swore and pulled his sight down a fraction but this time when he pulled the trigger it was only at a dim swaying motion within the black leafy shadow of a patch of headhigh mexi can corn a bullet suddenly whistled past walts ear instinctively he dodged then dived for the field himself another bullet blood branded the skin of his left arm then by stooping a little he was within the rustling black shelter himself the long green ribbons of sharpedged corn leaves cut at his face like whips as he ran but he was scarcely aware of the sting another bullet cut a cornstalk above his head and he stopped abruptly he took a long breath and listened ahead and off to the right he heard the man crashing through the corn walt fired at the sound the noise stoppedso abruptly that for a long tense moment he wondered if he had been lucky enough to score a hit he took a cartridge out of his belt and tossed it a dozen feet to the right instantly a shot answered the rustling thud it made checkmate he thought he eased back on his heels and settled down to a long wait he swore and then grinned to himself in the darkness it wouldnt be long until dawn and when it was light enough to see through the corn this business would be finishedone way or the other but presently a breeze rustled through the corn loud enough to drown out any noise of movement walt dropped to all fours and started crawling slowly between two rows then suddenly somewhere too near for comfort there rose the heartchill ing whirrr of a rattler with the instinc tive reaction of a man born and raised in rattlesnake country walt carmack made a wide high jump to one side instantly from out of the blackness ahead of him a sixgun blazed a sudden searing pain tore through the cowboys leg as the force of the bullet spun him to the ground a cornstalk somehow jarred his out of his hand as he fell in the few precious sec onds he spent feeling frantically for it he heard the man crashing off through the corn away from him when he found the gun again it was too late to shoot and he knew it he lay still for a moment silently curs ing his own bad luck and the pain in his knee then he remembered lucy mcadams crouching alone and frightened in a dark abandoned cabin with a dead man for com pany the cabin was close enough so that she would undoubtedly have heard the shots and be frantic with fear and worry he must somehow manage to get back to her he tried to get to his feet but the knee gave way with him and he fell again in voluntarily and because he thought he was alone where no one could hear he groaned with the sheer agonizing pain of it a soft voice called to him from the edge of the corn behind him walt he sat up disbelieving his ears lucy my gosh girl what are you doing here
