the man who couldnt miss syds gun even before the sevenandone halfinch barrel had cleared leather kent drew and fired it is doubtful if any of those who watched so avidly even saw the draw one instant he was lounging there on the steps with his right hand empty the next he still lounged but flame was leaping from his extended arm the bullet hit the iron barrel of harpers colt and tore it from his grasp as though it had been struck with a sledge so aston ishing was it that syd just stood there and stared and as he stared the gun on the far side of the street slipped smoothly into its holster and kent bradfords words reached him i said to get out of town harper reckon now you know i meant it syd mouth open raised his right hand and gazed at it as though he found it im possible to believe that it was empty then the red of mortification rose in his cheeks and the look of astonishment gave way to one of rage and frustration he straight ened looked long and hard at the lounging figure on the store steps then turned as though to go back into the saloon but he didnt concealed by his body his right hand dived beneath his coat and came out with the shortbarreled gun he carried in a shoulder holster he spun on one heel checked the motion fired quickly at bradford and this time kent really had to shoot the movement had caught him off his guard but so rapid was it that it also spoiled syds aim the bullet plunked into the step at bradfords side and the next instant the peacemaker was out and another streak of fire darted at syd like the tongue of a snake the man staggered with the impact of the lead recovered his balance stood swaying for three secondsback forth back forth back forth he tried to raise the der ringer but couldnt quite do it he collapsed suddenly and completely like a wet rag kent sighed and got to his feet his glance went to the corner around which ellen had vanished she was standing there watching and he knew he would carry the picture of her face to his grave then she was gone and he walked wearily as if each step was an effort across the street towards his horse ii flight fairhaired boy of twenty crossed in front of him on the run damn you bradford he cried as he passed he was el lens brother ronald kent gave no sign that he had heard but his face was bleak as he swung into the saddle ronnie had liked him once but syd harper had turned the boy against him and ronnies friendship for syd had undoubtedly influenced ellen he flashed a quick look towards the sa loon as he pivoted his horse ronnie was on his knees beside the stricken harper and was working over him kent heard him say couple of you boys give me a hand well take him over to my house as kent turned back his eyes met those of ellen she didnt say a word but in her hot glance he read scorn and disappoint ment and dislike at the moment he felt sure she hated him he groaned inwrardly and spurred his horse to a lope again he had tried to miss a vital spot but his shot had been hurried and there was ever pres ent the haunting fear that the bullet had struck an inch or so wide of where he had intended it to strike the sweat stood out on his forehead god knew he wanted no mans life he reached his fathers ranch at noon and mechanically took his place at the table john bradford knew he had ordered har per out of town but they had kept word of the quarrel from kents mother when they left the table and went outside the elder bradford said harper leave no you have to wounded him john bradford sighed his relief he had been responsible in a large measure for his sons skill and at first had taken huge pride in it but as this uncanny ability grew pride was replaced by awe and then dis may he had no wish to see his son trans formed into a killer and most certainly did not want him injured sooner or later youre goin to have to
