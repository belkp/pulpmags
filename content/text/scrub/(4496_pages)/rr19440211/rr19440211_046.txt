a day of reckoning ed his black toward the rambling bulk of the mountains in the west all morning he traveled steadily about noon he came to a canyon filled with the gurgle of a small stream here there was grass in abundance for the horses tracy dismounted stripped saddle gear from his black and hobbled him his packs he slid to the ground turning the bay loose slong fella he muttered slapping a sweaty flank maybe well meet again maybe not he had no plan save to wait for his arm to heal although his lefthand draw was swift it had not the accuracy of his rightand accuracy was the one thing he meant to command the next time he faced hal davies for days tracy loafed fretting at the delay tormented by brooding thoughts though he favored his arm it showed no signs of healing rather it seemed to grow worse morosely tracy began to wonder if hate could distil poison in a mans sys tem then derided himself for the fantastic thought the spare garments out of which he was fashioning bandages were perhaps less clean than they looked maybe the bullet had embedded a thread from his shirt deep in the wound itself at any rate despite using his entire supply of salt in hot packs the fifth day found his arm badly swollen the wound angrily inflamed he was feverish the pain had developed into a pounding that brought on queer lightheaded spells it was borne upon tracy that he would have to seek a doctor if ever he expected to make good his promise of a day of reckon ing for ruth and hal davies slowly doggedly he got his outfit on the black pulled himself aboard he soon found that a road gait jarred his head un bearably and pulled down to a slow walk even so he rode mostly with chin on chest drifting into states of semiconscious ness from which he would rouse with a start he failed to notice when his mount strayed off from the direction into which he had headed it eventually its shrill whiny aroused him from stupor with a jerk he straightened passing hot hands over blurry eyes around him was piled a rough land scape studded with greasewood and low mounds of salt sage a stock trail wound about the base of a hill overlooking a dry wash here his black stood ears pointed straight ahead even as tracy took this in the animal sounded another warning of a presence ahead on the trail the instinct of the hunted long dormant sprang to life with in tracy banishing the mental fog that had bound him dropping knotted reins about the saddle horn he drew his left gun and urged the black on half a dozen steps and he halted again facing a rider who blocked the waya big burlychested man leaning forward tensely in his saddle spane ejaculated the latter in pro found amaze a spasmodic jerk of hand lifted higher the bore of a sixgun tracy paid it no heed howdy law ton he drawled behind the renegade ranchman were two others as hard of face and waryeyed as he the first led by halter ropes two of the finest specimens of horseflesh tracy had ever seensleek cleanlimbed thorough breds that shouted of the race track he had no chance to see more for shedding surprise lawton swung his horse to the side screening his second follower from view youd best turn tail he said mean ingly head back the way you come and forget you seen us the peremptory speech did little to wards mollifying tracys black mood he said deliberately i dont turn tail for any son of a skunk get out of my way lawton seemed to stop breathing tracy saw the squinting eyes slide to his injury then down to the gun in his left hand he guessed the feverish calculations running through the outlaws mind lawton was realizing that whatever the outcome of a fight at this time he for one would never live to see it dont you like began tracy softly then halted as the nervous shifting of law
