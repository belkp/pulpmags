 weird tales four wooden stakes continued from page with the cries of miscellaneous night fowl and other nocturnal creatures as i ascended the two flights of steps the candle in my hand casting grotesque shadows on the walls and ceiling i had little liking for my job many times in the course of duty i had been called upon to display courage but it took more than mere courage to keep me going now i extinguished the candle and crept forward to remsons room the door of which was closed being careful to make no noise i knelt and looked in at the keyhole it afforded me a clear view of the bed and two of the windows in the opposite wall gradually my eyes be came accustomed to the darkness and i noticed a faint reddish glow outside one of the windows it apparently emanated from nowhere hundreds of little specks danced and whirled in the spot of light and as i watched them fascinated they seemed to take on the form of a human face the features were masculine as was also the arrangement of the hair then the mysterious glow disappeared so great had the strain been on me that i was wet from perspiration although the night was cool for a moment i was undecided whether to enter the room or to stay where i was and use the keyhole as a means of observation i concluded that to remain where i was would be the better plan so i once more placed my eye to the hole immediately my attention was drawn to something moving where the light had been at first owing to the poor light i was unable to distinguish the general outline and form of the thing then i saw it was a mans head so help me god it was the exact re production of that picture i had seen in the hall that very morning but oh the difference in expression the lips were drawn back in a snarl disclosing two sets of pearly white teeth the canines over developed and remarkably sharp the eyes an emerald green in color stared in a look of consuming hate the hair was sadly disarranged while on the beard was a large clot of what seemed to be con gealed blood i noticed thus much then the head melted from my sight and i transferred my attention to a great bat that circled round and round his huge wings beating a tattoo on the panes finally he circled around the broken pane and flew straight through the hole made by the missing glass for a few moments he was shut off from my view then he reappeared and began circling around my friend who lay sound asleep blissfully ignorant of all that was occurring nearer and nearer it drew then swooped down and fastened itself on remsons throat just over the jugular vein at this i rushed into the room and made a wild dash for the tiling that had come night after night to gorge itself on my friend but to no avail it flew out of the window and away and i turned my attention to the sleeper remson old man get up he sat up like a shot whats the matter jack has it been here never mind just now i replied just dress as hurriedly as possible we have a little work before us this eve ning he glanced questioningly toward me but followed my command without argu ment i turned and cast my eye about the room for a suitable weapon there was a stout stick lying in the corner and i made toward it jack
