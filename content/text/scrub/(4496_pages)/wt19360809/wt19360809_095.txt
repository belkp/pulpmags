 weird tales the pliant cords made no great sound as they encountered the quivering body of the captive only a sharp crackling snap but each cord left a red streak across yasalas dark flesh valeria in flicted the punishment with all the strength of her warhardened arm with all the mercilessness acquired during a life where pain and torment were daily happenings and with all the cynical in genuity which only a woman displays to ward a woman yasala suffered more physically and mentally than she would have suffered under a lash wielded by a man however strong it was the application of this feminine qtiicism which at last tamed yasala a low whimper escaped from her lips and valeria paused arm lifted and raked back a damp yellow lock well are you going to talk she demanded i can keep this up all night if necessary mercy whispered the woman i will tell valeria cut the cords from her wrists and ankles and pulled her to her feet yasala sank down on the couch half re clining on one bare hip supporting her self on her arm and writhing at the con tact of her smarting flesh with the couch she was trembling in every limb wine she begged drylipped indi cating with a quivering hand a gold ves sel on an ivory table let me drink i am weak with pain then i will tell you all valeria picked up the vessel and ya sala rose unsteadily to receive it she took it raised it toward her lipsthen dashed the contents full into the aquiio nians face valeria reeled backward shaking and clawing the stinging liquid out of her eyes through a smarting mist she saw yasala dart across the room fling back a bolt throw open the copper bound door and run down the hall the pirate was after her instantly sword out and murder in her heart but yasala had the start and she ran with the nervous agility of a woman who has just been whipped to the point of hysterical frenzy she rounded a corner in the corridor yards ahead of valeria and when the pirate turned it she saw only an empty hall and at the other end a door that gaped blackly a damp moldy scent reeked up from it and va leria shivered that must be the door that led to the catacombs yasala had taken refuge among the dead valeria advanced to the door and looked down a flight of stone steps that vanished quickly into utter blackness evidently it was a shaft that led straight to the pits below the city without open ing upon any of the lower floors she shivered slightly at the thought of the thousands of corpses lying in their stone crypts down there wrapped in their moldering cloths she had no intention of groping her way down those stone steps yasala doubtless knew every turn and twist of the subterranean tunnels she was turning back baffled and furi ous when a sobbing cry welled up from the blackness it seemed to come from a great depth but human words were faint ly distinguishable and the voice was that of a woman oh help help in sets name ahhh it trailed away and va leria thought she caught the echo of a ghostly tittering valeria felt her skin crawl what had happened to yasala down there in the thick blackness there was no doubt that it had been she who had cried out but what peril could have befallen her was a xotalanca lurking down there olmec had assured them that the catacombs be low tecuhltli were walled off from the rest too securely for their enemies to break through besides that tittering had not sounded like a human being at all
