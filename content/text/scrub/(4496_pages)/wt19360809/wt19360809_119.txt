 weird tales as i leaned forward to shake him my eyes fell on two drops of blood spattered on the coverlet i crushed back a wild desire to scream and shook remson rather roughly his head rolled to one side and the hellish perforations on his throat showed up vividly they looked fresh and raw and had increased to much greater dimensions i shook him with increased vigor and at last he opened his eyes stupidly and looked around then seeing me he said in a voice loaded with anguish resignation and despair its been here again jack i cant hold out much longer may god take my soul when i go so saying he fell back again from sheer weakness i left him and went about preparing myself some breakfast i had thought it best not to destroy his faith in me by telling him that i too had suffered at the hands of his persecutor a walk brought me some peace of mind if not a solution and when i re turned about noon to the big house rem son was up and around together we prepared a really excellent meal i was hungry and did justice to my share but after i had finished my friend continued eating until i thought he must either dis gorge or burst then after putting things to rights we strolled about the long hall looking at the oil paintings many of which were very valuable at one end of the hall i discovered a portrait of an old gentleman evidently a beau brummel in his day he wore his hair in the long flowing fashion adopted by the old school and sported a carefully trimmed mustache and vandyke beard remson noticed my interest in the paint ing and came forward i dont wonder that picture holds your interest jack it has a great fascination for me also at times i sit for hours studying the expression on that face i sometimes think he has something to tell me but of course thats all tommyrot but i beg your pardon i havent introduced the old gent yet have i this is my grand dad he was a great old boy in his day and he might be living yet but for that cursed bloodsucker perhaps it is such a creature thats doing for me what do you think i wouldnt like to venture an opinion remson but unless im badly mistaken we must dig deeper for an explanation well know tonight however you retire as usual and ill keep a close watch and well solve the riddle or die in the at tempt remson said not a word but silently extended his hand i clasped it in a firm embrace and in each others eyes we read complete understanding to change the trend of thought i questioned him on the servant problem ive tried time and again to get serv ants that would stay he replied but about the third day they would begin act ing queer and the first thing id know theyd have skipped bag and baggage that night i accompanied my friend to his room and remained until he had dis robed and was ready to retire several of the windowpanes were cracked and one was entirely missing i suggested board ing up the aperture but he declined say ing that he rather enjoyed the night air so i dropped the matter as it was still early i sat by the fire in the sittingroom and read for an hour or two i confess that there were many times when my mind wandered from the print ed page before me and chills raced up and down my spine as some new sound was borne to my ears the wind had risen and was whistling through the trees with a peculiar whining sound the creaking of the shutters tended to further the eery effect and in the distance could be heard the hooting of numerous owls mingled please turn to page
