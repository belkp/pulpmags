the medici boots john said i think ill not disturb su zanne and he went to sleep in a wide fourpostered bed in a room next to his wife eric and the old lawyer were in rooms across the hall the still summer night closed about the house of silas dickerson and when the moon lay dying against the bank of cloud puffed across a sky by the little wind that came before dawn young doctor eric delameter awoke suddenly and completely to a feeling of clammy apprehension he had not locked his door and now across the grayness of the room he saw it slowly opening a hand was closed around the edge of the doora womans hand small and white and jeweled eric sat straight and tense on the edge of his bed peering across the room a woman young and slender in a long trailing gown came toward him smiling it was suzanne with a gasp eric watched her ap proach till she stood directly before him suzanne you are asleep suzanne shall i call john he thought that perhaps he should not waken her there were things one must remember about sleepwalkers but physi cians scarcely believed them eric was puzzled too by her costume it was not a nightrobe she wore but an elaborate trailing dress upon which em broideries in silver shone faintly her short black curls were bound about three times with strands of pearly beads her slim white arms were loaded with brace lets the pointed toes of little shoes peeped beneath her gown little shoes of creamy leather an amethyst gleamed on cach shoe the sight of these amethystine tips af fected eric strangely much as though he had looked at something hideously repul sive he stood up and put out a hand to touch suzannes arm suzanne he said gently let me take you to john shall i suzanne looked up at him and her brown eyes usually so merry were deep ly slumberous not with sleep but with a look of utter abandon she shook her pearlbound head slowly smilingly no not john i want you eric mad suzanne must be mad was erics quick thought but her caress was swifter than his thought both jewel laden arms about his neck suzanne kissed him her red lips pouting warmly upon his suzanne you dont know what youre doing he grasped both her hands in his and with a haste that would have seemed ludicrous to him had he viewed the scene in a pictureplay he hurried her out of his room and across the hall eric opened her door softly and with no gentle hand shoved suzanne inside her room she seemed like a little animal in his grasp she hissed at him clawed and scratched at his hand but when he had shut the door she did not open it again and after a moment he went back to his own room his mouth set in a firm line his heart beating fast eric locked his door with a noiseless turn of the key it was almost dawn and the garden lay like a rare pastel outside his window but eric saw none of it he scarcely thought though his lips moved as if chaotic words were struggling for utterance he looked down at his hand where two long red scratches oozed a trickle of blood after he had washed his hand he lay down on his bed and covered his eyes with his arm against the picture of su zanne above all else there stood out the gleaming tips of her little shoes as he had glimpsed them through the dim light of his room when she came toward him
