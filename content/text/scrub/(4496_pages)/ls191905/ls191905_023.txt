a leaf from lifes notebook by lillian bennetthompson like a statue he stood there silent motionless while the traffic surged and roared behind him and a steady stream of pedestrians poured by in front he was very tallover six feetwith a pair of enormous shoulders and long powerful looking arms on the palms of his huge hands were great yellow callouses showing in striking contrast to the whiteness of the skin it seemed strange that one who had so evidently performed heavy manual labor should have skin so white and smooth his face with its rugged irregular features might have been carved out of stone so expressionless it was his back was braced against a lamppost and in one hand he held a slender sheaf of lead pencils his hat was pulled well down over his forehead he seemed to be looking fixedly at the ground but the eyes beneath the lowered lids were sightless and the skin about the empty socketsskin pastywhite with that waxy hospital pallorwas thickly sprinkled almost pitted with powder marks it was as if he wore a blue black mask over the upper part of his face occasionally someone in the busy hurrying throng would stop and press a coin into his hand and then he would hold out the pencils and murmur two for five but no one ever took one it was not the pencils they wanted nor did they dream that the vender would have given much had they bought his wares how could they know of the storm of shame and humiliation that raged in his soul how suspect that every penny bestowed in kindly charity inflicted a deeper hurt than had the blast at the powder mill which had robbed him of his sight charity that was it he was nothing now but a beggar a parasite subsisting upon the bounty of others he whose splendid strength had been his one pride he who was tireless whose iron muscles had rejoiced in the performance of mighty feats was as helpless as a little child oh the degradation of it and yethe must live he must have food and clothes and a roof to shelter him even now he could hardly realize that there could be no more light for him that this thick impenetrable darkness must endure forever in the hospital when they had told him that he would be blind he had still hoped against hope surely when the bandages were taken from his eyes he would be able to see it could not be possible that his sight was quite gone it would come back gradually it was only when day had followed day and week had followed week that his bewildered mind finally grasped the appalling truth blind totally blind forever hopeless despairing he had wanted to diehad tried to die but the strength that had been his pride and joy mocked him now he was too vitally alive to die he must live onand since he could not work he must beg and so he stood there while the traffic surged and roared behind him and a steady stream of pedestrians poured by in frontstood there motionless silent with a stolid impassive face and a heart full of bitter gnawing pain
