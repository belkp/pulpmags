louise rice how do you do it i asked after i had explained to him that now i knew the real inwardness of him i thought that financial geniuses had to be cold and rather unfeeling even though they were kind and honest why he asked me welli dont know do you only its a way that we get into thinking i even iahem who have had those years and years i mentioned of read ing character in handwriting and get ting surprised by what i readeven i find it hard not to expect people to be what they look like or what their work appears to make of them but when you come to think of it why should the ability to handle money successfully do away with the ability to love hard or to be enthusiastic over a sunset the business manager blushed clear up into his hair when i got that far and said he guessed hed better get to work by that time most of the office force was sauntering into the blue room with scraps of paper which they implored me to read there are a good many i remarked with a glance at the clock i tell you what you do you write this all up just as it really happened said the blond and blue editor and in clude all these come on each of you and give your specimen to the hand writing lady but they didnt do that they mixed em i had seen them slyly slipping the papers from one to the other so i dont know which is which except that everybody in the editorial rooms was there from the president to the office boy i have no means of knowing whether it is a man or woman about whom i am talking bearing in mind the fact that the personality is no in dication whatever of the real elements of character ill wager therell be a good deal of surprise and some laughter when those people read with you what ive written about them for graphology which is the name by which this science is known is really a serious and pain fully accurate affair it jabs right through that surface you that you like so much down to the real you which may be far less pleasing but is almost invariably far more interesting it is not guesswork on my part you know i do not use intuition or go into the silence or employ anything but a fairly active mind which has been trained to recognize and estimate the thousands of variations on the one hundred and fifty wellknown formations used by the oc cidental nations in writing the writer of specimen four is one with th kaiser to whom extremes of thought feeling and expression are natural contrast the loose and breezy t with that firm and selfpossessed t in number two and note that the k spreads out ex pansively observe the upward slant of the writing here is an individual with ardor and impatience and love of luxury and a quick imagination and a fair degree of sensuousness and not enough will power to control all that to know about how much and what kind of will power people possess look at their t bar always it need not be long or unusually strong but it must have a certain sweep and power or be close and compact if it is to indicate will power and the need for will power is all the greater of course the more intricate and interesting the character so whoever this is whether successful happy or otherwise he is really in need of some intensive selfcultivation but id like to meet that oneim going to make them tell me who it really is the writer of the specimen numbered five is as opposite from number four ls
