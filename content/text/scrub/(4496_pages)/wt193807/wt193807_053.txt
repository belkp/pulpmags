 weird tales the newspaper stories are true he didnt kill sanders for having padullo acquitted but because of the mud he threw at his sister during the trial well thats all in the game the only way sanders could get padullo a chinamans chance was to make the jury lose sympathy for the girl when they found out she was ten times as bad as the man that murdered her they didnt feel a grudge against him but was she probably not the costello kid says all the evidence against her character was trumped up he worshipped the girl thought she was an angel so he plugged sanders and now hell burn for it i suppose still if billy williams can prove that sanders witnesses perjured themselves to ruin the girls name no jury in the world would convict the boy but hows he going to do it sanders was no fool he wasnt the kind to leave loose ends for the grievance committee of the bar association to pick up hed played this game a hundred times before he once told me that a murderer had one foot out of his cell when it could be shown that he was no worse than his victim said that was always the first thing he tried to do theres something in what you say conceded asman take this case now dyou know what sanders would do if he was defending costello hed dig up a lot of witnesses that would convince a jury that hesanders i meandeserved killing hed show how hed coached all his witnesses in the padullo case to lie on the stand there must be somebody somewhere who could tell the truthbut only sanders knows where well said gowans with a chuckle you cant expect sanders to get his own murderer off no asman agreed thats a little too much even for sanders well lets get out of here weve got work to do asman started away before gowans left he moved surreptitiously toward sanders suddenly sanders saw no more gowans had closed his eyes then both asman and gowans were gone sanders made no effort to call after them he understood the futility of that now he was dead a realist he could no longer hope he could only lie there and think the whole content of his thinking was strangely reoriented all his life his thought had been focused exclusively on himself absolute unqualified selfish nessthat was his ethics if he inadvert ently committed an unselfish act that was cause for remorse for an aching con science that was weakness inexcusable weakness on this ethical basis he had lived all the mature years of his life but jason sanders was gone now dead no longer could he scheme cunningly for his personal advancement his little ambitions struck him as trifling utterly unimportant he found it impossible to think of jason sanders save in the third person objectively and impersonally he was merely one of many faces that crowded his memory of these faces only one stood out clearly in bold relief that was the sal low face of the boy costello and he was inclined to think kindly of costello pityingly the youth had been a fool he had committed his crime openly in the sight of many men he had killed to avenge a wrong and for that he was to die the two physicians had reasoned well despite the legal talents of billy wil liams he could not hope to untangle the maze of perjury that had successfully blasted the reputation of maria costello it was true that there existed a key wit
