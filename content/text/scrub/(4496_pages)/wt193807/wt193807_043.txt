 weird tales the kitchen and it is as dusty as the rest of the house well whatever the expla nation is you will have to tell me in the morning the will states that the heirs must spend the night here twelve hours from six to six of course the old man probably thought there would be more than one heir the heir took a package of sandwiches out of his pocket wrapped them and placed them slowly on one of the plates on one side of the table he placed his quart of whisky then he placed two candles in the candlesticks and carefully sat down in the empty chair and turned to the old lawyer you said the house had been un opened for a hundred years that is what i said you said no one had been here i was sure of it yet you see this room i do i have seen everything in it this dead man and this dead woman seem to have sat here for a hundred years since i opened the door i have asked myself a hundred questions and none of them has an answer now i will ask one more see that dead man over his longdried and dusty heart there is still the handle of a dagger he was killed with the dagger and it was never withdrawn now i will take that dagger and withdraw it the blade should be almost gone but look at it long the steel polished the point like a needle answer that did this piece of steel kill this man or has the steel been replaced by a new blade or was this dagger the one that killed i wall place it on the table the ivory handle is yellow with age but it is clean you see it is a very unusual handle an artistically carved body of a nude woman well if i keep on thinking about this i shall have to take another tablet of nitroglycerin i will leave you with the two candles burn ing and at six in the morning i will unlock the front door and bid you good morning and now goodnight i can not say pleasant dreams for i think that you will not sleep the young man opened the bottle of whisky and took four fingers full you will find me here you ancient mariner and inside me you will find the quart of whisky i should have had two quarts if there was much less than a million at stake i would go with you and let the sick and the motherless of the city have the old mans money and be damned to him but a man will do a lot for money goodbye i will answer some of your questions in the morning the old lawyer left and shut the door then the front door creaked shut on its rusty hinges the heir took another drink and wiped his wet lips with the back of his hand i will drink some he whispered to himself and then i will try to solve this mystery of course someone has been here these dead bags of skin and bones did not wax the floor and dust the table and polish these candlesticks and that dagger it seems to me that i have seen that somewhere before perhaps another drink will clear my brain minutes passed and hours at eleven he looked at his watch and started to eat the sandwiches meantime the bottle was rapidly being emptied and then came midnight he started to laugh if any thing was going to happen it would have happened by now he whispered to himself so as nothing has happened nothing will happen i will empty the bottle in one last long drink and go to sleep for the rest of the night i thought for a while but that was simply sillyto think of that i never saw that dagger before i know that i never have seen it before i
