 saladins thronerug which even in that dim light had the look of antiquity the stamp of personality possessed only by one of the old guard and it had the feel of ancient weaving i dragged it out through all its coat ing of dust and dirt the unbelievable richness of the dyes the baldheaded ness of the back and subdued luster of the face were apparent thenhorrible sighti saw that i had but a portion of a rug between half and twothirds of one the remnant of something which if complete would be priceless judging from the fragment the complete piece would be about five feet wide and twelve feet long or thereabout some barbarian had sliced it in two crosswise with a clean sweeping cut that left in this frag ment about half of the medallion which had been the central design of the com plete piece what fool would commit such a wanton infamy such an uncalledfor blas phemy and then i recalled that classic incident of early moslem history where in one of the prophets fanatic generals in apportioning the loot of a persian pal ace had dismembered a goldthreaded carpet giving each of his captains a por tion saying that it would have been un fair to let any one individual retain the entire rug and offering the equally good reason that such a pagan vanity deserved mutilation under stronger light i saw that my instinct for a rarity had indeed been true the weave was incredibly fine at least six or seven hundred knots to the square inch the pile worn to the warp was of silk and the ground inside the main border and surrounding the central medallion was of silver bullion thread woven tapestrywise about the warp threads instead of being tied and clipped so as to make a nap as is the practise when weaving with silk or wool here certes was the adornment of a palace the gift of one prince to another fortunately for my chances of buying the fragment the silver bullion ground was so tarnished and caked with dirt that its true nature would scarcely be noticed for if some collector with a bottomless wallet would see recognize and bid against my poverty id surely lose out but the chances were that even a keen observer unless he had examined the relic closely would pass it up as a mere scrap unworthy of consideration but then i had to take the auctioneer into account if in handling that frag ment displaying it to the assembled bidders he ever noticed that its ground was of silver thread id be strictly out of luck however there was little chance hed notice the pile was of silk for it was worn to the warp and since all ancient rugs either of silk or wool have a greasy slick surface his sense of touch might not enlighten him i had to buy that ancient fragment and i had to get it without the auction eers realizing what was going on just what device would minimize his chances of noticing the true nature of what was passing through his hands and then came the solution boy come here a minute one of the uniformed porters ap proached i gave him his instructions also a couple of dollar bills and the promise of as much more if the ruse worked also the promise that id hunt him up and down the earth with a sawedoff shotgun if he failed me it was now and the auction was to begin at prospective bidders were already taking seats before the auction eers rostrum the average bargain hunter has such sublime confidence in his or her ability to pick a rug or other precious article at first glance that few bother to examine the treasures before bidding
