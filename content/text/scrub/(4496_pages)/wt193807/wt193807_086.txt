 he that hath wings for a few weeks he did entirely forget that old blind yearning in his planning for things to come he was all over that now he told himself then suddenly his whole being was overturned by an amazing thing for some time the wingstumps on davids shoulders had felt sore and painful also it seemed they were much larger than they had been he took occasion to ex amine them in a mirror and was astound ed to discover that they had grown out in two very large humplike projections that curved downward on each side along his back david rand stared and stared into the mirror a strange surmise in his eyes could it be possible that he called on doctor white the next day on another pretext but before he left he asked casually doctor i was wondering is there any chance that my wings would eyer start to grow out again doctor white said thoughtfully why i suppose there is a chance of it at that a newt can regenerate a lost limb you know and numerous animals have simi lar powers of regeneration of course an ordinary man cannot regenerate a lost arm or leg like that but your body is not an ordinary one and your wings might possess some power of partial regenera tion for one time at least he added you dont need to worry about it though david if they start to grow out again just come in and ill remove them again without any trouble david rand thanked him and left but day after day thereafter he closely watched and soon saw beyond doubt that the freak of genes that had given him wings in the first place had also given him at least a partial power of regener ating them for the wings were growing out again day by day the humps on his shoulders had become very much larger though covered by his specially tailored coats the change in them was not noticed they broke through late that summer in wings real wings though small as yet folded under his clothing they were not ap parent david knew that he should go in and let the doctor amputate them before they got larger he told himself that he did not any longer want wingsruth and the coming child and their future together were all that meant anything to him now yet still he did not say anything to anyone kept the growing wings con cealed and closed beneath his clothing they were poor weak wings compared to his first ones as though stunted by the previous amputation it was unlikely that he would ever be able to fly with them he thought even if he wanted to which he didnt he told himself though that it would be easier to have them removed after they had attained their full size besides he didnt want to disturb ruth at this time by telling her that the wings had grown again so he reassured himself and so the weeks passed until by early october his second wings had grown to their full size though they were stunted and pitiful compared to his first splendid pinions on the first week in october a little son was born to ruth and david a fine stronglimbed little boy without a trace of anything unusual about him he was normal of weight and his back was straight and smooth and he would never have wings and a few nights later they were all in the little cottage admiring him isnt he beautiful asked ruth look ing up with eyes shining with pride
