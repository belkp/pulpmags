 planned by the stars dig deep into a soft stringy throat eyes glared into his own for all of the fact she was a woman the figure he clutched fought desperately carney re leased his left hand to bring it down with crushing force on the jaw of the struggling figure before he had crashed it savagely into the upturned face the woman managed to wrench a scream from between her lips cursing carney struck again he gripped the throat again with the hand he had used with hammer force and shook the woman as a terrier shakes a rat as if from a distance he heard fresh raps falling upon the doorthe voice of the messenger mrs garber mrs garber then silence carney relaxed the gripping pressure of his deathworking fingers he found he was talking but knew not what he said he had killed a woman but it was her own fault hot blood pounded within himrage and a gloating satis faction he felt that at that moment he wished she possessed the nine lives of the cat he had kicked from his path he would strangle each from her and then he realized the apron wrapped loot would never be his if he stood longer clutching the limp figure he opened his hands the body slumped to the floor the moon swing ing around entered the alley and crept into the room lighting it up like a pale arclamp carney looked down at the huddle of his victim the woman had fallen on her back her face was upturned to him wreathed with a horrible fixed grin he stared fascinated eying too greasy gray hair that seemed strangely familiar for a full watchtick he stared rigid the odor of ginthe gray hairthe gaunt face painted with the ghastly moonglare all at once knowledge flooded him mrs garber wore the face of the madame sovio who had read the stars for him that afternoon in the sixth ave nue room murder carney whispered she had the right dope something as he straightened up stopped the flow of the incoming moon light he raised his eyes and turned them to the window his gaze flashed and fell upon a helmeted head looking in over the lowered top of the translu cent window his right hand darted under his jacket and gripped his auto matic in some blind dizzy fashion he managed to drag it out but before he could pull the trigger the yellow glare of an electric torch smote him directly between the eyes a voice curt and imperious bade him throw up his hands carney blinking like an owl drenched in sunshine fell back his weapon crept up to firing position then the heavy silence was shattered by the sound of six shots so rapidly fired that they merged as one the automatic fell from carneys hand he wondered vaguely if he had been shotwhy his legs seemed to be melting away cursing again his brain reeled and scintillated with sparks he groaned and fell heavily across some thing softly yielding the clock that had ticked monoto nously whirred and struck the hour of twelve
