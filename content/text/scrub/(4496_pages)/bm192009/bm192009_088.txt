the strange case of nathaniel broome given oh blessed mary stand betune us and harm shut up you idiot i cried cant you realize that the mans been taken suddenly ill he naturally lockcd the door last night when he went to bed and lies too sick to get up and open it for us then what are we to do she moaned making ineffectual gestures in the air with her hands well have to break open the door get me a hammer or if you have an axe or something heavy ill run right away and get mrs seagles next door youmust notopenthedoor came again slowly ominously from the inner room during several momentsmoments that were agelongi stood still rooted to the floor unable to move my limbs utterly powerless to cry out at my sharp command mrs muzzard had disappeared more than eagerly i fancied in search of a battering imple ment she returned a few minutes later with an axe which she had succeeded in borrowing from her neighbor there seemed such a feeling of actu ality in the stout wooden handle of the axe that as i gripped it in my hands i felt my courage returning look out broome i shouted if youre up keep away from the door im going to break it in and with that i dealt a heavy blow upon the upper panel the voice inside became a strangled inarticulate scream behind me mrs muzzard cowered a heap of jabbering fear upon the floor seized in a sort of panic i rained blow after blow with my stout axe upon the door i remember even in my ex citement comparing the scene with a similar one as it would be staged in moving pictures how quickly upon the screen the door would have been burst open and how in actuality it was so difficult to split such resisting wood at last i managed to make an opening through which i might insert my hand and turn the key in the lock then the door swung open the window shades had been drawn closely so that the place was in dark ness i groped my way to the bed broome i cried still breathless from the unusual exertion whats the matter and i leaned over the blurred form that lay crouched in an unnatural attitude upon the bed a little light mrs muzzard i said over my shoulder as the landlady crept shuddering into the room shewalked obediently to the window the dark form seemed to writhe in agony then the shade was lifted and the late morning light poured into the room v what i saw there will remain a fear ful image in my memory until the day i die as i looked at that face upon the pil low the cold chill of horror pricked at the roots of my hair clammy drops of perspiration stood out upon my fore head i could feel the skin drawing into gooseflesh over my spine nathaniel broome fully dressed his body twisted unnaturally in the grip of some strange paralytic seizure lay hud dled upon the bed his knees drawn up until they touched his chin i called that creature by the name of my old friend but the distorted mask which i saw upon the pillow bore no re semblance to that placid face it was the face of the fiend which mediaeval sculptors have carved with gothic mon strousness in imperishable stone there was no nose only two terrible holes where the flesh had been eaten away
