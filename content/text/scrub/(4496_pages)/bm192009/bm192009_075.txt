the heart on the mantel by paul everman when i first saw it move i became sceptical as to the worth of my vision a dead mans heart cut from his body sealed in a glass jar of alcohol why should it move how could it move this heart was by far the most hor rible thing in leon campeaus collec tion of human debris as his room mate and fellow student in medicine i had tolerated the clutter of bones and skulls he had picked up also the im maculate skeleton which leered gro tesquely at me from its tall glassdoored case but to me this heart this lump of muscle and tissue seemed hardly ap propriate as a companionable ornament leon had brought it in that very morning delighted in its acquisition for it was on the heart that he was special izing he had secured it he explained with the connivance of a keeper of the morgue he had bribed this keeper he told me to allow him to remove the heart from the body of a derelict who was to be buried that morning in the potters field a clever fellow leon the heart was now where he had placed itin its jar on the mantela reddishbrown lump that seemed but a deep shadow against the vestal white ness of wall that rose behind and above with one elbow propped on my lit tered study table i watched the thing nervously had it really moved or was my imagination flighty there it moved againi was sure yes it moved an almost imperceptible flutter in its liquid preservative i stared it jerked again again the jerks were weak clumsy measured the thing was coming to life it was beating i shuddered and glanced quickly be hind me all about the room but i was alonealone except for a dead mans heart leon was away on one of his nightly amours and frangois bourlin a fellow student who was specializing in diseases of the lungs my own major had spent the earlier part of the night with me we had little of the brilliance of leon who at a glance could grasp the mean ing of an entire page and retain it who could hear more with a stethescope than we could see with our eyes whose skill with the knife had aroused admiration from the greatest surgeons of the fac ulty no we were grubs we worked for what knowledge we got but when we got it we did not boast of it as leon boasted of his accomplishments francois had left at ninethirty and it was after ten when i noticed the first movement from the heart its beats were now growing stronger i could see the alcohol ripple in tiny waves with each rhythmic beat i listenedand heard a gentle splash splash splash as regular yet not so metallic as the ticking of a watch suddenly the heart flopped convul sively and drifted with the gentlest movement to the top of the jar it was beating steadily now it circled slowly about the jar like an exhausted bird not sure of its direction its impossible i muttered to my self it cant be its my nerves my mind ive worked too hard i must be careful by a supreme effort i forced my eyes
