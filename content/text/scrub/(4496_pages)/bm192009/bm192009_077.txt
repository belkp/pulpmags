 the heart on the mantel rocked and lowered in gentle wavelets with each heartbeat i listenedintently fearfully and above the dull beating of rain and the whistle and howl of the wind i at last managed to detect a sound of splashing in the jar the sound came steadily a gentle purring splash splash splash with each heart beat with each wavelet i tried to take my eyes away but i could not i was held by the things devilish charm as i watched the beats became thuds the heart gave a clumsy jerk then floated slowly to the top of the jar for a moment it swam about uncertainly from top to bottom from one side to the other then its move ments became rapid agitated violent it dashed about frenziedly like a fright ened bird vainly trying to escape from its cage the jar rocked with the vio lent motioni heard it i saw with a jerky hand i wiped the cold sweat from my forehead my god i thought am i going mad i tried to take my eyes awayand failed i must do something with all the power of will and muscle i could summon i sent my right hand groping about the table at last my fingers found the syringeand later the magic bottle of morphine somehow i managed the injection calm came again my eyes dropped from the gruesome thing and when in a spirit of bravado i raised them again a few moments later it had stopped its beating and lay motionless at the bottom of the jar i looked at my watch it was and fully a halfhour passed before leon came home ii he came stumbling hilariously into the study room plainly drunk tiens mon henri he cried slap ping me on the shoulder it was a happy night there was wine and my fanchette and iah what happiness and he babbled on foolishly till he had led me through the entire course of his happy night while he was talking i was silent but as he began clumsily to hang up his clothes i could no longer restrain a warning comment one of these nights when you go to the cafe noir mon leon m leblanc will tire of your lovemaking to his wife you had better watch out for him he is a man who loves much and if he discovers your attentions he will be dangerous m leblanc leon laughed drunk enly as he turned to hang up his hat i do not fear monsieur leblanc he is like you mon ami he is an owl he sees nothing besides he is away now he has gone to the country for a few days he would buy a farm he would put my fanchette on a farm pecaire but while he is gone fanchette and i are happy she has hired a waitress to take her placea lean waitress with brick colored hair fanchette acts as man ager i am her assistant hah it is amusing but is it not an ideal ar rangement my silence seemed to anger him as he watched me his leer changed to a glare and finally he burst out but why do you tell me to be care ful you have corrected me again how is it your affair i will mind my own business and you shall mind yours you disgust me but he was in a better humor the next morning and when i came into the study room i found him staring rapturously into the glass jar on the mantel come mon ami he exclaimed and admire with me the consummate skill with which i removed this organ ah
