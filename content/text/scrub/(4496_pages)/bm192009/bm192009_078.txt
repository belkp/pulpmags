the heart on the mantel was it not an artistic job a wonder ful specimen mon henri just what i need for study i will be a great sur geon nest ce pas yoh should have specialized in the heart henri the old lungs that you study are of no use except for breathing like bellows such as blacksmiths use but the heart ah it is the organ magnifique it is the heart that sends out blood that is like the richest of wine it is the heart that puts the glow to my fanchettes cheeks it is the heart that gives us happiness emotion love a wonderful thing henriwonderful i failed miserably in my examinations that day but from the triumphant ex pression on leons face when i met him early in the evening i knew that he had succeeded as completely as i had failed the situation was galling to me i had worked slavishly he had trifled and loafed yet i had lost and he had won after a hasty dinner at my pension i hurried to my room as usual leon was gone partly because of a crush ing headache and wracked nerves and partly because of a desire to be entirely alone in enduring the days disap pointments i went to bed but i did not sleepi tossed and rolled i thought suffered despaired finally i got up jerked one of leons richlyhued robes about me and went into the study room it was eleven oclock the night was blacka desolation of disturbing quietude the wind and rain of the night before had gone not a whisper not a sound of any kind came to break the silence of the roomit was like a void a vacuity of the portentous stillness suddenly yet inexorably i was gripped by that same subconscious force that had come to me the night before it raised my head from my propping hands it turned me in my chair it focused my eyes on the tall glass jar that sat on the mantel surely regularly its every motion ac centuated against the pure white back ground of wall the heart was beating beating a sudden anger rose within me i am going mad i thought desper ately i would seize the jar and its dev ilish contents i would smash it hurl it from the window but to carry out my resolution i could not summon the strength of a single muscle i was help less as i watched the reddishbrown lump began to swim about the jar its beating was measured like a funeral tramp i could hear it its splashing sound thudding mightily in the deep stillness suddenly there came a tremendous splash the heart dived to the bottom floundered for a moment then again shot to the top its motion was so rapid that my eyes could scarcely fol low it it churned the liquid it dashed and darted about madly frantically it thrashed about in the alcohol like a wounded shark in the agdny of death the thing has a soul i thought and it is troubled disturbed the jar rocked almost overturned from the violent movement within the heart veered dodged banged upward then shot down yes the thing must have a soul i tried to take my eyes awayfruit less effort the thing was possessing me was my master it bade me watch and i did but as i watched i think i must have prayed i tried to reach for my syringe but my hand hung motionless at my side i was powerless a quick thought almost calmed me i will see now i told myselfi will see whether it is my nerves whether i am going mad i will fight it without the morphine i will fight it
