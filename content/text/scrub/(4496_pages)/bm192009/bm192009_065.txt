 daughter of the pigeon did not realize the danger and as long as ive been in the tropics i have run across only one devilfish ill tell you cleaves well see who can reach the high place first you taking one end of the island and i the other equalizing the distance what do you say you do not know the way to be gan the polynesian perhaps interposed cleaves but you will tell us moreover you and a couple of the crew will follow in a whaleboat and wait on the beach to bring us back the race will be to the high place and back to the whaleboat the first one reaching the high place piling several stones on the altar to let the other know hes been there that was how it began down in the tropics men do queer things the savage song of the surf on the coral reefs is a tune of lawlessness twenty minutes later cleaves and i stripped but for bathing trunks were descending the gangwaystairs while leaping fire and others of the crew lowered a whaleboat i warned you menikes leaping fire called to us sadly from the deck and i laughedfor his tales of piracy and the feel of the amorous wind on my body had aroused the sleeping boy withhi me ready asked cleaves and i nodded side by side we plunged into the green bay the water was mildly cool old wine to the muscles when i re turned to the surface i struck out toward the island which seemed a mass of darkridden rocks beneath the fiery southern cross several yards away the phosphorus leaping about him was cleaves headed for the northern end of taoha that swim whipped the blood into every fiber and sinew of the being thinking little of sharks or devilfish i crossed the ruffled bay of traitors and within an hour a bit sore of thewsi confess i touched the sand on the south ern end of the island rarely have i seen such tropical beauty as on taohacool white sands strewn with seaweed and curious shells forests of mangoes cocoanutpalms and breadfruit towering basalt rocks honeycombed with caves and seeming riven with bronze as countless cascades and waterfalls caught the tarnished ar gent of the moon following the polynesians instruc tions i walked several rods down the beach and found the nearly obliterated trail that he had described a path lead ing into a dark hollow across valleys and ridges i sprinted in the shadow of dripping rocks where the atmosphere was saturated with mois ture beneath feisplants and the crim sonflowered hututree not infrequently passing ruined paepaes meager evi dence of the gradual death of the little island after a trot of about a mile i gained the summit of a hill where red jasmine and orchids bloomed in profusion and halted breathless looking upon what i knew to be the mistladen vale where dead men walk here the stars seemed to hang lower so low that the smell of them was in the atmosphere across the earth depres sion stone ledges rose from the deep sunken valley and the moonlight struck the bare rocks transforming them from dead matter into living sheets of light the vale where dead men walk well named for a vague something made me aware of its presence in the air by an imaginary nevertheless ponder ous weight upon the lungs as if the souls of the perished searobbers surged back upon the valley as i slowly descended the ridge slowly because of a strange reluctance to hurryi had the uncanny feeling of one invading the dominion of the dead
