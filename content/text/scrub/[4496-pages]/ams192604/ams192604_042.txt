off on a comet another enigma exclaimed servadac and still no intelligible signature and no address no clearing up of the mystery i have no doubt in my own mind said the count that it is one of a series it seems to me probable that they are being sent broadcast upon the sea i wonder where the harebrained savant that writes them can be living observed servadac very likely he may have met with the fate of aesops abstracted astronomer who found himself at the bottom of a well aye but where is that well demanded the captain this was a question which the count was in capable of settling and they could only speculate afresh as to whether the author of the riddles was dwelling upon some solitary island or like them selves was navigating the waters of the new med iterranean but they could detect nothing to guide them to a definite decision after thoughtfully regarding the document for some time lieutenant procope proceeded to ob serve that he believed the paper might be con sidered as genuine and accordingly taking its statements as reliable he deduced two important conclusions first that whereas in the month of january the distance traveled by the planet hypo thetically called gallia had been recorded as leagues the distance traveled in february was only leaguesa difference of leagues in one month secondly that the distance of the planet from the sun which on the th of february had been leagues was on the st of march leaguesan increase of leagues in a fortnight thus in pro portion as gallia receded from the sun so did the rate of speed diminish by which she traveled along her orbit facts to be observed in perfect conform ity with the known laws of celestial mechanism and your inference asked the count my inference replied the lieutenant is a con firmation of my surmise that we are following an orbit decidedly elliptical although we have not yet the material to determine its eccentricity as the writer adheres to the appellation of gallia do you not think asked the count that we might call these new waters the gallian sea there can be no leason to the contrary count replied the lieutenant and as such i will insert it upon my new chart our friend said servadac seems to be more and more gratified with the condition of things not only has he adopted our motto ânil desperan dum but see how enthusiastically he has wound up with his âenchantd the conversation dropped a few hours later the man on watch announced that gourbi island was in sight chapter xviii an unexpected population the dobryna was now back again at the island her cruise had lasted from the st of january to the th of march a period of thirtyfive days for it was leap year corresponding to seventy days as accomplished by the new little world many a time during his absence hector servadac had wondered how his present vicissitudes would end and he had felt some misgivings as to whether he should ever again set foot upon the island and see his faithful orderly so that it was not without emotion that he had approached the coast of the sole remaining fragment of algerian soil but his apprehensions were groundless gourbi island was just as he had left it with nothing unusual in its aspect except that a very peculiar cloud was hover ing over it at an altitude of little more than a hun dred feet as the yacht approached the shore this cloud appeared to rise and fall as if acted upon by some invisible agency and the captain after watch ing it carefully peiceived that it was not an accumu lation of vapors at all but a dense mass of birds packed as closely together as a swarm of herrings and uttering deafening and discordant cries amidst which from time to time the noise of the report of a gun could be plainly distinguished the dobryna signalized her arrival by firing her cannon and dropped anchor in the little port of the shelif almost within a minute ben zoof was seen running gun in hand towards the shore he cleared the last ridge of rocks at a single bound and then suddenly halted for a few seconds he stood mo tionless his eyes fixed as if obeying the instruc tions of a drill sergeant on a point some fifteen yards distant his whole attitude indicating sub mission and respect but the sight of the captain who was landing was too much for his equanimity and darting forward he seized his masters hand and covered it with kisses instead however of uttering any expressions of welcome or rejoicing at the captains return ben zoof broke out into the most vehement ejaculations thieves captain beastly thieves bedouins pirates devils why ben zoof whats the matter said ser vadac soothingly they are thieves downright desperate thieves those infernal birds thats whatsthe matter it is a good thing you have come heie have i for a whole month been spending my powder and shot upon them and the more i kill them the worse they get and yet if i were to leave them alone we should not have a grain of corn upon the island it was soon evident that the orderly had only too much cause for alarm the crops had ripened rapidly during the excessive heat of january when the orbit of gallia was being traversed at its peri helion and were now exposed to the depredations of many thousands of birds and although a goodly number of stacks attested the industry of ben zoof during the time of the dobrynas voyage it was only too apparent that the portion of the harvest that remained ungathered was liable to the most imminent risk of being utterly devoured it was perhaps only natural that this clustered mass of birds as representing the whole of the feathered tribe upon the surface of gallia should resort to gourbi island of which the meadows seemed to be the only spot from which they could get sustenance at all but as this sustenance would be obtained at the expense and probably to the serious detriment of the human population it wras absolutely neces sary that every possible resistance shouldbe made to the devastation that was threatened once satisfied that servadac and his friends would cooperate with him in the raid upon the thieves
