 amazing stories how many passengers had been upon the street cars the officials of the company from the schedule could pick the numbers of the cars and their crews but who could tell of the occupants telephones rang with tearful pleadings when the first rumors of the horror leaked out every wife and mother felt the clutch of panic at her heart strings it was a moment of historical psychology out of our books we had read of this strange phase of human nature that was wont to rise like a mad screeching thing out of disaster we had never had it in utopia it was rumbling at first and out of exaggeration as the tale passed farther back to the waiting thousands it gained with the repetition grim and terrible enough in fact it ratioed up with reitera tion perhaps after all it was not psychology the average impulse of the human mind does not even up so exactly in the light of what we now know it may have been the poison that had leaked into the air the new element that was permeating the atmosphere of the city at first it was spasmodic the nearest witnesses of the disaster were the first victims a strange malady began to spot out among âłhose of the crowd who had been at the spot of contact this is to be noticed a strange affliction which from the viru lence and rapidity of action was quite puzzling to the doctors those among the physicians who would consent to statement gave it out that it was breaking down of tissue which of course it was the new ele ment that was radiating through the atmosphere of the city they did not know it then the pity of it the subtle odorless pall was silently shrouding out over the city in a short time the hospitals were full and it was necessary to call in medical aid from san francisco they had not even time for diagnosis the new plague was fatal almost at conception happily the scien tists made the discovery it was the pall at the end of three hours it was known that the death sheet was spreading out over oakland we may thank our stars that it was learned so early had the real warning come a few hours later the death list would have been appalling a new element had been discovered or if not a new element at least something which was tipping over all the laws of the atmospheric envelope a new combination that was fatal when the news and the warning went out panic fell upon the bay shore but some men stuck in the face of such terror there were those who stayed and with grimness and sacrifice hung to their posts for mankind there are some who had said that the stuff of heroes had passed away let them then consider the case of john robinson robinson was a telegraph operator until that day he was a poor unknown not a whit better than his fellows now he has a name that will run in history in the face of what he knew he remained under the blanket the last words out of oakland his last message whole city of oakland in grip of strange mad ness keep out of oaklandfollowing which came a haphazard personal commentary i can feel it coming on myself it is like what our ancestors must have felt when they were getting drunk alternating desires of fight and singinga strange sensation light and ecstatic with a spasmodic twitching over the forehead terribly thirsty will stick it out if i can get enough water never so dry in my life followed a lapse of silence then the last words i guess were done for there is some poison in the atmospheresomething it has leaked of course out of this thing at fourteenth and broad way dr manson of the american institute says it is something new that is forming a fatal com bination but he cannot understand a new element the quantity is too enormous populace has been warned out of the city all roads are packed with refugees the berkeley hills are covered as with fliesnorth east and south and on the boats to frisco the poison what ever it is is advancing in a ring from fourteenth and broadway you have got to pass it to these old boys of science they are staying with that ring already they have calculated the rate of its advance and have given warning they dont know what it is but they have figured just how fast it is moving they have saved the city i am one of the few men now inside the wave out of curiosity i have stuck i have a jug and as long as it lasts i shall stay strange feeling dry dry dry as if the juice of ones life cells was turning into dust water evaporating almost in stantly it cannot pass through glass whatever the poison it has an affinity for moisture do not understand it i have had enough that was all after that there was no more news out of oakland it is the only word that we have out of the pall itself it was short and dis connected and a bit slangy but for all that a basis from which to conjecture it is a strange and glorious thing how some men will stick to the post of danger this operator knew that it meant death but he held with duty had he been a man of scientific training his in formation might have been of incalculable value however may god bless his heroic soul what we know is thirst the word that came from the experts confirmed it some new element of force was stealing or sapping the humidity out of the atmosphere whether this was combining and entering into a poison could not be determined chemists worked frantically at the outposts of the advancing ring in four hours it had covered the city in six it had reached san leandro and was advancing on toward haywards it was a strange story and incredible from the beginning no wonder the world doubted such a thing had never happened we had accepted the the law of judging the future by the past by deduc tion we were used to sequence and to law to the laws of nature this thing did look like a miracle which was merely becauseas usually it is with miracleswe could not understand it happily we can look back now and still place our faith in nature the world doubted and was afraid was this peril to spread slowly over the whole state of cali fornia and then on to theworld doubt always precedes terror a tense world waited then came the word of reassurancefrom the scientists
