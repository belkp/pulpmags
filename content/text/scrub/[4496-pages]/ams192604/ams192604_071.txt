 amazing stories fell upon the little nightencampment in the wilds a silence that was ominous pale cold stars watched down from spaces in finitely far beyond mans trivial world next day stopping for chow on a ledge miles up stream jandron discovered another of the prints he cautiously summoned the other two men they examined the print while the womenfolk were busy by the fire a harmless thing the marking seemed only a ring about four inches in diameter a kind of cupshaped depression with a raised center a sort of glaze coated it as if the granite had been fused by heat jandron knelt a wellknit figure in bright macki naw and canvas leggings and with a shaking finger explored the smooth curve of the print in the rock his brows contracted as he studied it wed better get along out of this as quick as we can said he in an unnatural voice youve got your wife to protect thorburn and iwell ive got vivian and you have nipped marr the light of an evil jealously gleamed in his heavylidded look what you need is an alienist really jandron the professor admonished you mustnt let your imagination run away with you i suppose its imagination that keeps this print cold the geologist retorted his breath made faint swirling coils of vapor above it nothing but a pothole judged thorburn bend ing his spare angular body to examine the print the professors vitality all seemed centered in his bigbulged skull that sheltered a marvellous think ing machine now he put his lean hand to the base of his brain rubbing the back of his head as if it ached then under what seemed some power ful compulsion he ran his bony finger around the print in the rock by jove but it is cold he admitted and looks as if it had been stamped right out of the stone extraordinary dissolved out you mean corrected the geolo gist by cold the journalist laughed mockingly wait till i write this up he sneered ânoted geologist declares frigid ghost dissolves gran ite jandron ignored him he fetched a little water from the river and poured it into the print ice ejaculated the professor solid ice frozen in a second added jandron while marr frankly stared and itll never melt either i tell you ive seen some of tnese rings before and every time horrible things have happened incred ible things something burned this ring out of the stoneburned it out with the cold interstellar space something that can import cold as a perma nent quality of matter something that can kill matter and totally remove it of course thats all sheer poppycock the jour nalist tried to laugh but his brain felt numb this something this thing continued jandron is a thing that cant be killed by bullets its what caught our guides on the barrens as they ran awaypoor fools a shadow fell across the print in the rock mrs thorburn had come up was standing there she had overheard a little of what jandron had beeri saying nonsense she tried to exclaim but she waa shivering so she could hardly speak that night after a long afternoon of paddling and portaginglaboring against inhibitions like those in a nightmarethey camped on shelving rocks that slanted to the river after all said the professor when supper was done we mustnt get into a panic i know extra ordinary things are reported from the wilderness and more than one man has come out raving but we by jove with our superior brainswe arent going to let nature play us any tricks and of course added his wife her arm about vivian everything in the universe is a natural force theres really no supernatural at all admitted jandron replied but how about things outside the universe and they call you a scientist gibed marr but the professor leaned forward his brows knit hm he grunted a little silence fell you dont mean realty asked vivian that you think theres life and intelligenceoutside jandron looked at the girl her beauty haloed with ruddy gold from the firelight was a pain to him as he answered yes i do and dangerous life too i know what ive seen in the north country i know what ive seen silence again save for the crepitation of the flames the fall of an ember the murmur of the current darkness narrowed the wilderness to just that circle of flickering light ringed by the forest and the river brooded over by the pale stars of course you cant expect a scientific man to take you seriously commented the professor i know what ive seen i tell you theres some thing entirely outside mans knowledge poor fellow scoffed the journalist but even as he spoke his hand pressed his forehead there are things at work jandron affirmed with dogged persistence he lighted his pipe with a blazing twig its flame revealed his face drawn lined things things that reckon with us no more than we do with ants less perhaps the flame of the twig died night stood closer watching suppose there are the girl asked whats that got to do with these prints in the rock they answered jandran are marks left by one of those things footprints maybe that thing is near us here and now marrs laugh broke a long stillness and you he exclaimed with an a m and a b s to write after your name if you knew more retorted jandron youd know a devilish sight less its only ignorance thats cocksure but dogmatized the professor no scientist of any standing has ever admitted any outside inter ference with this planet no and for thousands of years nobody ever ad mitted that the world was round either what ive seen i know well what have you seen asked mrs thor burn shivering youll excuse me please for not going into that just now
