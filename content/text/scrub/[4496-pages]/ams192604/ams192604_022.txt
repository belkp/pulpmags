the world approaching the great climax close at hand two days more and the earth shivered into a myriad atoms would be lost in boundless space these dire forebodings however were not des tined to be realized gradually the distance between the two planets began to increase the planes of their orbits did not coincide and accordingly the dreaded catastrophe did not ensue by the th venus was sufficiently remote to preclude any fur ther fear of collision ben zoof gave a sigh of relief when the captain communicated the glad in telligence their proximity to venus had been close enough to demonstrate that beyond a doubt that planet has no moon or satellite such as cassini short mon taigne of limoges montbarron and some other astronomers have imagined to exist had there been such a satellite said servadac we might have captured it in passing but what can be the meaning he added seriously of all this displace ment of the heavenly bodies what is that great building at paris captain with a top like a cap asked ben zoof do you mean the observatory yes the observatory are there not people liv ing in the observatory who could explain all this very likely but what of that let us be philosophers and wait patiently until we can hear their explanation servadac smiled do you know what it is to be a philosopher ben zoof he asked i am a soldier sir was the servants prompt re joinder and i have learnt to know that âwhat cant be cured must be endured the captain made no reply but for a time at least he desisted from puzzling himself over mat ters which he felt he was utterly incompetent to explain but an event soon afterwards occurred which awakened his keenest interest about nine oclock on the morning of the th ben zoof walked deliberately into his masters apartment and in reply to a question as to what he wanted announced with the utmost composure that a ship was in sight a ship exclaimed servadac starting to his feet a ship ben zoof you donkey you speak as unconcernedly as though you were telling me that my dinner was ready are we not philosophers captain said the orderly but the captain was out of hearing chapter ix inquiries unsatisfied fast as his legs could carry him servadac had made his way to the top of the cl iff it was quite true that a vessel was in sight hardly more than six miles from the shore but owing to the increase in the earths convexity and the consequent limita tion of the range of vision the rigging of the top masts alone was visible above the water this was enough however to indicate that the ship was a schooneran impression that was confirmed when two hours later she came entirely in sight the dobryna exclaimed servadac keeping his eye unmoved at his telescope impossible sir rejoined ben zoof there are no signs of smoke the dobryna repeated the captain positively she is under sail but she is count timaschefs yacht he was right if the count were on board a strange fatality was bringing him to the presence of his rival but no longer now could servadac regard him in the light of an adversary circum stances had changed and all animosity was ab sorbed in the eagerness with which he hailed the prospect of obtaining some information about the recent startling and inexplicable events during the twentyseven days that she had been absent the dobryna he conjectured would have explored the mediterranean would very probably have visited spain france or italy and accordingly would con vey to gourbi island some intelligence from one or other of those countries he reckoned therefore not only upon ascertaining the extent of the late catastrophe but upon learning its cause count timascheff was no doubt magnanimously coming to the rescue of himself and his orderly the wind being adverse the dobryna did not make very rapid progress but as the weather in spite of a few clouds remained calm and the sea was quite smooth she was enabled to hold a steady coursc it seemed unaccountable that she should not use her engine as whoever was on board would be naturally impatient to reconnoiter the new island which must just have come within their view the probability that suggested itself was that the schooners fuel was exhausted servadac took it for granted that the dobryna was endeavoring to put in it occurrecho him how ever that the count on discovering an island where he had expected to find the mainland of africa would not unlikely be at a loss for a place of an chorage the yacht was evidently making her way in the direction of the former mouth of the shelif and the captain was struck with the idea that he would do well to investigate whether there was any suitable harbor towards which he might signal her zephyr and gallette were soon saddled and in twenty minutes had carried their riders to the western extremity of the island where they both dismounted and began to explore the coast they were not long in ascertaining that on the farther side of the point there was a small well sheltered creek of sufficient depth to accommodate a vessel of moderate tonnage a narrow channel formed a passage through the ridge of rocks that protected it from the open sea and which even in the roughest weather would ensure the calmness of its waters whilst examining the rocky shore the captain observed to his great surprise long and wellde fined rows of seaweed which undoubtedly betokened that there had been a very considerable ebb and flow of the watersa thing unknown in the medi terranean where there is scarcely any perceptible tide what however seemed most remarkable was the manifest evidence that ever since the highest flood which was caused in all probability by the proximity of the body of which the huge disc had been so conspicuous on the night of the st of de
