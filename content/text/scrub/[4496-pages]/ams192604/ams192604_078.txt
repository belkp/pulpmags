the man who saved the earth chapter i the beginning even the beginning from the start the whole thing has the precision of ma chine work fate and its working and the wonderful providence which watches over man and his future the whole thing unerring the incident the work the calamity and the martyr in the retrospect of dis aster we may all of us grow strong in wisdom let us go into history a hot july day a sun of scant pity and a staggering street panting thousands dragging along hatless fans and parasols the sultry ven geance of a real day of summer a day of bursting tires hot pavements and wrecked endeavor heart aches for the seashore for leafy bowers beside rip pling water a day of broken hopes and listless am bition perhaps fate chose the day because of its heat and because of its natural benefit on fecundity we have no way of knowing but we do know this the date the time the meeting the boy with the burn ing glass and the old doctor so commonplace so trivial and hidden in obscurity who would have guessed it yet it isafter the creationone of the most important dates in the worlds history this is saying a whole lot let us go into it and see what it amounts to let us trace the thing out in history weigh it up and balance it with sequence of charley huyck we know nothing up to this day it is a thing which for some reason he has always kept hidden recent investigation as to his previous life and antecedents have availed us noth ing perhaps he could have told us but as he has gone down as the worlds great martyr there is no hope of gaining from his lips what we would so like to know after all it does not matter we have the day the incident and its purport and its climax of sequence to the day of the great disaster also we have the blasted moun tains and the lake of blue water which will ever live with his memory his greatness is not of war fare nor personal ambi tion but of all mankind the wreaths that we be stow upon him have no doubtful color the man who saved the earth from such a beginning charley huyck lean and frail of body with even then the wistfulness of the idealist and the eyes of a poet charley huyck the boy crossing the hot pavement with his pack of papers the much treasured piece of glass in his pocket and the sun which only he should master burning down upon him a moment out of the ages the turning of a straw destined to outbalance all the previous accumulation of mans history the sun was hot and burning and the childhe could not have been more than tencast a glance over his shoulder it was in the way of calcula tion in the heyday of childhood he was not dragged down by the heat and weather he had the enthusi asm of his halfscore of years and the joy of the plaything we will not presume to call it the spirit of the scientist though it was perhaps the spark of latent investigation that was destined to lead so far a moment picked out of destiny a boy and a plaything uncounted millions of boys have played with glass and the sun rays who cannot remember the little roundburning dot in the palm of the hand and the subsequent exclamation charley huyck had found a new toy it was a simple thing and as old as glass fate will ever be so in her working and the doctor why should he have been wait ing if it was not destiny it was at least an ac cumulation of moment in the heavy eyeglasses the square closecut beard and his uncompromis ing factseeking expression those who knew dr robold are strong in the affirmation that he was the antithesis of all emotion he was the sternest prod uct of science unbending hardened by experiment and caustic in his condemnation of the frailness of human nature it had been his one function to topple over the castles of the foolish with his hardseeing wisdom he had spotted sophistry where we thought it not even into the castles of science he had gone like a juggernaut it is hard to have ones theories deri dedyea even for a scientistand to be called a fool dr robold knew no middle languagehe was not relished by science his memory as we have it is that of an eccen tric a man of slight compassion abrupt of man ner and with no tact in speaking genius is often so it is a strange fact that many of the greatest of men have been denied by their fellows a great man and laughter he was not accepted none of us know today what it cost dr robold he was not the man to tell us perhaps charley huyck might but his lips are sealed forever we only know chat he retired to the mountain and of the subsequent flood of benefits that rained upon mankind and we still denied him the great cynic on the mountain of the secrets of the place we know little he was not the man to accept the investigator he despised the curious he had been laughed at let be he would work alone on the great moment of the future in the light of the past we may well bend knee to the doctor and his protg charley huyck two men and destiny whstt would we be without them one shudders to think a little thing and yet one of the greatest mo ments in the worlds history it must have been fate why was it that this stern man who hated all emotion should so have unbended at this mo we read of the days when the powers of radium were yet unknown it is told us that burns were produced by incautiously carrying a tube of radium salts in the pocket and here in this story we are told of a different power opalescence due to an other clement it can destroy mountains excavate cavi ties of unmeasurable depths and kill human beings and animals in multitude the story opens with a poor little boy experimenting with a burning glass then he be comes the hero of the storyhe studies and eventually finds himself able to destroy the earth he exceeds archimedes in his power and he suddenly finds that he has unlocked a power that threatens this very de struction and the story depicts his horror at the frankenstein which he had unloosed and tells of his wild efforts to save humanity and of the loss of the cosmic discoveries of the little newsboy grown up to be a great scientist
