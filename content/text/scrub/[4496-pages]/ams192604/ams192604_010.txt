off on a comet length of service fourteen years three months and five days v service two years at school at st cyr two years at lescole dapplication two years in the th regiment of the line two years in the rd light cavalry seven years in algeria campaigns soudan and japan rank captain on the staff at mostaganem decorations chevalier of the legion of honor march th hector servadac was thirty years of age an orphan without lineage and almost without means thirsting for glory rather than for gold slightly scatterbrained but warmhearted generous and brave he was eminently fitted to be the proteg of the god of battles for the first year and a half of his existence he had been the fosterchild of the sturdy wife of a vinedresser of medoca lineal descendant of the heroes of ancient prowess in a word he was one of those individuals whom nature seems to have predestined for remarkable things and around whose cradle have hovered the fairy godmothers of adventure and good luck in appearance hector servadac was quite the type of an officer he was rather more than five feet six inches high slim and graceful with dark curling hair and mustaches wellformed hands and feet and a clear blue eye he seemed born to please without being conscious of the power he possessed it must be owned and no one was more ready to confess it than himself that his literary attain ments were by no means of a high order we dont spin tops is a favorite saying amongst artillery officers indicating that they do not shirk their duty for frivolous pursuits but it must be confessed that servadac being naturally idle was very much given to spinning tops his good abilities however and his ready intelligence had carried him success fully through the curriculum of his early career he was a good draughtsman an excellent rider having thoroughly mastered the successor to the fa mous uncle tom at the ridingschool of st cyr and in the records of his military service his name had several times been included in the order of the day the following episode may suffice in a certain degree to illustrate his character once in action he was leading a detachment of infantry through an intrenchment they came to a place where the sidework of the trench had been so riddled by shell that a portion of it had actually fallen in leaving an aperture quite unsheltered from the grapeshot that was pouring in thick and fast the men hesi tated in an instant servadac mounted the side work laid himself down in the gap and thus filling up the breach by his own body shouted march on and through a storm of shot not one of which touched the prostrate officer the troop passed in safety since leaving the military college servadac with the exception of his two campaigns in the soudan and japan had been always stationed in algeria he had now a staff appointment at mostaganem and had lately been entrusted with some topograph ical work on the coast between tenes and the shelif it was a matter of little consequence to him that the gourbi in which of necessity he was quartered was uncomfortable and illcontrived he loved the open air and the independence of his life suited him well sometimes he would wander on foot upon the sandy shore and sometimes he would enjoy a ride along the summit of the cliff altogether being in no hurry at all to bring his task to an end his occupation moreover was not so engrossing but that he could find leisure for taking a short railway journey once or twice a week so that he was ever and again putting in an appearance at the generals receptions at oran and at the fetes given by the governor at algiers it was on one of these occasions that he had first met madame de l the lady to whom he was desirous of dedicating the rondo the first four lines of which had just seen the light she was a colonels widow young and handsome very reserved not to say haughty in her manner and either indifferent or impervious to the admiration which she inspired captain servadac had not yet ventured to declare his attachment of rivals he was well aware he had not a few and amongst these not the least formid able was the russian count timasheff and although the young widow was all unconscious of the share she had in the matter it was she and she alone who was the cause of the challenge just given and accepted by her two ardent admirers during his residence in the gourbi hector serva dacs sole companion was his orderly ben zoof ben zoof was devoted body and soul to his superior officer his own personal ambition was so entirely absorbed in his masters welfare that it is certain no offer of promotioneven had it been that of aidedecamp to the governorgeneral of algiers would have induced him to quit that masters serv ice his name might seem to imply that he was a native of algeria but such was by no means the case his true name was laurent he was a native of montmartre in paris and how or why he had obtained his patronymic was one of those anomalies which the most sagacious of etymologists would find it hard to explain born on the hill of montmartre between the solferino tower and the mill of la galette ben zoof had ever possessed the most unreserved ad miration for his birthplace and to his eyes the heights and district of montmartre represented an epitome of all the wonders of the world in all his travels and these had been not a few he had never beheld scenery which could compete with that of his native home no cathedralnot even burgos itself could vie with the church at montmartre its racecourse could well hold its own against that at pentelique its reservoir would throw the mediter ranean into the shade its forests had flourished long before the invasion of the celts and its very mill produced no ordinary flour but provided ma

himself to be hewn in pieces rather than admit that it was anything less than fifteen thou sand feet in height ben zoofs most ambitious desire was to induce the captain to go with him and end his days
