off on a comet after all i am racking my brain over something that is quite in the ordinary course of nature but reason as he might the mysteries of the heavens still remained impenetrable for about an hour some luminous body its disc evidently of gi gantic dimensions shed its rays upon the upper strata of the clouds then marvelous to relate in stead of obeying the ordinary laws of celestial mechanism and descending upon the opposite hori zon it seemed to retreat farther off grew dimmer and vanished the darkness that returned to the face of the earth was not more profound than the gloom which fell upon the captains soul everything was in comprehensible the simplest mechanical rules seemed falsified the planets had defied the laws of gravitation the motions of the celestial spheres were erroneous as those of a watch with a defective mainspring and there was reason to fear that the sun would never again shed his radiance upon the earth but these last fears were groundless in three hours time without any intervening twilight the morning sun made its appearance in the west and day once more had dawned on consulting his watch servadac found that night had lasted pre cisely six hours ben zoof who was unaccustomed to so brief a period of repose was still slumbering soundly come wake up said servadac shaking him by the shoulder it is time to start time to start exclaimed ben zoof rubbing his eyes i feel as if i had only just gone to sleep you have slept all night at any rate replied the captain it has only been for six hours but you must make it enough enough it shall be sir was the submissive rejoinder and now continued servadac we will take the shortest way back to the gourbi and see what our horses think about it all they will think that they ought to be groomed said the orderly very good you may groom them and saddle them as quickly as you like i want to know what has become of the rest of algeria if we cannot get round by the south to mostaganem we must go eastwards to tenes and forthwith they started beginning to feel hungry they had no hesitation in gathering figs dates and oranges from the plan tations that formed a continuous rich and luxuriant orchard along their path the district was quite deserted and they had no reason to fear any legal penalty in an hour and a half they reached the gourbi everything was jut as they had left it and it was evident that no one had visited the place during their absence all was desolate as the shore they had quitted the preparations for the expedition were brief and simple ben zoof saddled the horses and filled his pouch with biscuits and game water he felt certain could be obtained in abundance from the numerous affluents of the shelif which although they had now become tributaries of the mediter ranean still meandered through the plain captain servadac mounted his horse zephyr and ben zoof simultaneously got astride his mare galette named after the mill of montmartre they galloped off in the direction of the shelif and were not long in discovering that the diminution in the pressure of the atmosphere had precisely the same effect upon their horses as it had had upon themselves their muscular strength seemed five times as great as hitherto their hoofs scarcely touched the ground and they seemed transformed from ordinary quad rupeds into veritable hippogriffs happily serva dac and his orderly were fearless riders they made no attempt to curb their steeds but even urged them to still greater exertions twenty minutes sufficed to carry them over the four or five miles that inter vened between the gourbi and the mouth of the shelif then slackening their speed they proceeded at a more leisurely pace to the southeast along what had once been the right bank of the river but which although it still retained its former char acteristics was now the boundary of a sea which extending farther than the limits of the horizon must have swallowed up at least a large portion of the province of oran captain servadac knew the country well he had at one time been engaged upon a trigonometrical survey of the district and conse quently had an accurate knowledge of its topo graphy his idea now was to draw up a report of his investigations to whom that report should be delivered was a problem he had yet to solve during the four hours of daylight that still re mained the travelers rode about twentyone miles from the river mouth to their vast surprise they did not meet a single human being at nightfall they again encamped in a slight bend of the shore at a point which on the pievious evening had faced the mouth of the mina one of the lefthand affluents of the shelif but now absorbed into the newly re vealed ocean ben zoof made the sleeping accommo dation as comfortable as the circumstances would allow the horses were hobbled and turned out to feed upon the rich pasture that clothed the shore and the night passed without special incident at sunrise on the following morning the nd of january or what according to the ordinary calen dar would have been the night of the st the cap tain and his orderly remounted their horses and during the sixhours day accomplished a distance of fortytwo miles the right bank of the river still continued to be the margin of the land and only in one spot had its integrity been impaired this was about twelve miles from the mina and on the site of the annex or suburb of surkelmittoo here a large portion of the bank had been swept away and the hamlet with its eight hundred in habitants had no doubt been swallowed up by the encroaching waters it seemed therefore more than probable that a similar fate had overtaken the larger towns beyond the shelif in the evening the explorers encamped as pre viously in a nook of the shore which here abruptly terminated their new domain not far from where they might have expected to find the important vil lage of memounturroy but of this too there was now no trace i had quite reckoned upon a supper and a bed at orleansville tonight said servadac as full of despondency he surveyed the waste of water quite impossible replied ben zoof except you had gone by a boat but cheer up sir cheer up we will soon devise some means for getting across to mostaganem
