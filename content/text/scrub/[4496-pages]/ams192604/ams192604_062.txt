the new accelerator his technical points to enter very keenly into my aspect of the question it was the th or th of august when he told me the distillation that would decide his failure or success for a time was going forward as we talked and it was on the th that he told me the thing was done and the new accelerator a tangible reality in the world i met him as i was going up the sand gate hill toward folkestonei think i was going to get my hair cut and he came hurrying down to meet mei suppose he was coming to ray house to tell me at once of his success i remember that his eyes were unusually bright and his face flushed and i noted the swift alacrity of his step its done he cried and gripped my hand speaking very fast its more than done come up to my house and see really really he shouted incredibly come up and see and it doestwice it does more much more it scares me come up and see the stuff taste it try it its the most amazing stuff on earth he gripped my arm and walking at such a pace that he forced me into a trot went shouting with me up the hill a whole powerbus of people turned and stared at us in unison after the manner of people in powerbuses it was one of those hot clear days that folkestone sees so much of every color incredibly bright and every outline hard there was a breeze of course but not so much breeze as sufficed under these con ditions to keep me cool and dry i panted for mercy im not walking fast am i cried gibberne and slackened his pace to a quick march youve been taking some of this stuff i puffed no he said at the utmost a drop of water that stood in a beaker from which i had washed out the last traces of the stuff i took some last night you know but that is ancient history now and it goes twice i said nearing his door way in a grateful perspiration it goes a thousand times many thousand times cried gibberne with a dramatic gesture flinging open his early english carved oak gate phew said i and followed him to the door i dont know how many times it goes he said with his latchkey in his hand and you it throws all sorts of light on nervous physiology it kicks the theory of vision into a perfectly new shape heaven knows how many thousand times well try all that after the thing is to try the stuff now try the stuff i said as we went along the passage rather said gibberne turning on me in his study there it is in that little green phial there unless you happen to be afraid i am a careful man by nature and only theoreti cally adventurous i was afraid but on the other hand there is pride well i haggled you say youve tried it ive tried it he said and i dont look hurt by it do i i dont even look livery and i feel i sat down give me the potion i said if the worst comes to the worst it will save having my hair cut and that i think is one of the most hateful duties of a civilized man how do you take the mixture with water said gibberne whacking down a carafe he stood up in front of his desk and regarded me in his easy chair his manner was suddenly af fected by a touch of the harley street specialist its rum stuff you know he said i made a gesture with my hand i must warn you in the first place as soon as youve got it down to shut your eyes and open them very cautiously in a minute or sos time one still sees the sense of vision is a question of length of vibration consequently of frequency of impacts but theres a kind of shock to the retina a nasty giddy confusion just at the time if the eyes are open keep em shut shut i said good and the next thing is keep still dont begin to whack about you may fetch something a nasty rap if you do remember you will be going several thousand times faster than you ever did before heart lungs muscles braineverythingand you will hit hard without knowing it you wont know it you know youll feel just as you do now only everything in the world will seem to be going ever so many thousand times slower than it ever went before thats what makes it so deuced queer lor i said and you mean youll see said he and took up a little measure he glanced at the material on his desk glasses he said water all here mustnt take too much for the first attempt the little phial glucked out its precious contents dont forget what told you he said turning the contents of the measure in the manner of an italian waiter measuring whisky sit with the eyes tightly shut and in absolute stillness for two minutes he said then you will hear me speak he added an inch or so of water to the little dose in each glass bytheby he said dont put your glass down keep it in your hand and rest your hand on your knee yesso and now he raised his glass the new accelerator i said the new accelerator he answered and we touched glasses and drank and instantly i closed my eyes you know that blank nonexistence into which one drops when one has taken gas for an in definite interval it was like that then i heard gibberne telling me to wake up and i stirred and opened my eyes there he stood as he had been standing glass still in hand it was empty that was all the difference well said i nothing out of the way nothing a slight feeling of exhilaration per haps nothing more sounds things are still i said by jove yes they are still except the sort of faint pat patter like rain falling on different things what is it analyzed sounds i think he said but i am not sure he glanced at
