 amazing stories point the way out of the serious difficulty but still all in vain one day he suddenly came upon ben zoof and asked him whether he had no plan to propose the orderly shook his head but after a few moments pondering said ah master if only we were at montmartre we would get shelter in the charming stonequarries idiot replied the captain angrily if we were at montmartre you dont suppose that we should need to live in stonequarries but the means of preservation which human in genuity had failed to secure were at hand from the felicitous provision of nature herself it was on the th of march that the captain and lieutenant procope started off once more to investigate the northwest corner of the island on their way their conversation naturally was engrossed by the subject of the dire necessities which only too manifestly were awaiting them a discussion more than usu ally animated arose between them for the two men were not altogether of the same mind as to the measures that ought to be adopted in order to open the fairest chance of avoiding a fatal climax to their exposure the captain persisted that an en tirely new abode must be sought while the lieu tenant was equally bent upon devising a method of some sort by which their present quarters might be rendered sufficiently warm all at once in the very heat of his argument procope paused he passed his hand across his eyes as if to dispel a mist and stood with a fixed gaze centered on a point towards the south what is that he said with a kind of hesitation no i am not mistaken he added it is a light on the horizon a light exclaimed servadac show me where look there answered the lieutenant and he kept pointing steadily in its direction until ser vadac also distinctly saw the bright speck in the distance it increased in clearness in the gathering shades of evening can it be a ship asked the captain if so it must be in flames otherwise we should not be able to see it so far off replied procope it does not move said servadac and unless i am greatly deceived i can hear a kind of rever beration in the air for some seconds the two men stood straining eyes and ears in rapt attention suddenly an idea struck servadacs mind the volcano he cried may it not be the volcano that we saw whilst we were on board the dobryna the lieutenant agreed that it was very probable heaven be praised ejaculated the captain and he went on in the tones of a keen excitement na ture has provided us with our winter quarters the stream of burning lava that is flowing there is the gift of a bounteous providence it will provide us all the warmth we need no time to lose to morrow my dear procope tomorrow we will ex plore it all no doubt the life the heat we want is reserved for us in the heart and bowels of our own gallia whilst the captain was indulging in his expres sions of enthusiasm procope was endeavoring to collect his thoughts distinctly he remembered the long promontory which had barred the dobrynas progress while coasting the southern confines of the sea and which had obliged her to ascend north wards as far as the former latitude of oran he remembered also that at the extremity of the pro montory there was a rocky headland crowned with smoke and now he was convinced that he was right in identifying the position and in believing that the smoke had given place to an eruption of flame when servadac gave him a chance of speaking he said the more i consider it captain the more i am satisfied that your conjecture is correct be yond a doubt what we see is the volcano and to morrow we will not fail to visit it on returning to the gourbi they communicated their discovery to count timascheff only deeming any further publication of it to be premature the count at once placed his yacht at their disposal and expressed his intention of accompanyingthem the yacht i think said procope had better remain where she is the weather is beautifully calm and the steamlaunch will answer our purpose better at any rate it will convey us much closer to shore than the schooner the count replied that the lieutenant was by all means to use his own discretion and they all retired for the night like many other modern pleasureyachts the dobryna in addition to her fouroar was fitted with a fastgoing little steamlaunch its screw being pro pelled on the oriolle system by mean of a boiler small but very effective early next morning this handy little craft was sufficiently freighted with coal of which there was still about ten tons on board the dobryna and manned by nobody except the captain the count and the lieutenant left the harbor of the shelif much to the bewilderment of ben zoof who had not yet been admitted into the secret the orderly however consoled himself with the reflection that he had been temporarily invested with the full powers of governor general an office of which he was not a little proud the eighteen miles between the island and the headland were made in something less than three hours the volcanic eruption was manifestly very considerable the entire summit of the promontory being enveloped in flames to produce so large a combustion either the oxygen of gallias atmosphere had been brought into contact with the explosive gases contained beneath her soil or perhaps still more probable the volcano like those in the moon was fed by an internal supply of oxygen of her own it took more than half an hour to settle on a suitable landingplace at length a small semi circular creek was discovered among the rocks which appeared advantageous because if circum stances should so require it would form a safe an chorage for both the dobryna and the hansa the launch securely moored the passengers landed on the side of the promontory opposite to that on which a torrent of flaming lava was de scending to the sea with much satisfaction they experienced as they approached the mountain a sensible difference in the temperature and their spirits could not do otherwise than rise at the pros pect of having their hopes confirmed that a deliv erance from the threatened calamity had so oppor tunely been found on they went up the steep acclivity scrambling over its rugged projections scaling the irregularities of its gigantic strata bounding from point to point with the agility of chamois but never alighting on anything except
