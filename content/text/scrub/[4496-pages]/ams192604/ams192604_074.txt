the thing fromoutside made his head ache vivian laid it to the wind and the gleam of the swift water while marr claimed it was the heat jandron wondered at all this inasmuch as he plainly saw that the river had almost stopped flowing and the day had become still and overcast they dragged their canoes upon a rotting stage of firpoles and explored the lumbercamp a mourn ful place set back in an old slash now partly over grown with scrub poplar maple and birch the log buildings covered with tarpaper partly torn from the pole roofs were of the usual north coun try type obviously the place had not been used for years even the landingstage where once logs had been rolled into the stream had sagged to decay i dont quite get the idea of this marr ex claimed where did the logs go to downstream of course but that would take em to hudson bay and theres no market for spruce timber or pulp wood at hudson bay he pointed down the cur rent youre entirely mistaken put in the professor any fool could see this river runs the other way a log thrown in here would go down toward the st lawrence but then asked the girl why cant we drift back to civilization the professor retorted just what we have been doing all along ex traordinary that i have to explain the obvious he walked away in a huff i dont know but hes right at that half ad mitted the journalist ive been thinking almost the same thing myself the past day or twothat is ever since the sun shifted what do you mean shifted from jandron you havent noticed it but theres been no sun at all for at least two days hanged if ill waste time arguing with a luna tic marr growled he vouchsafed no explanation of what he meant by the suns having shifted but wandered off grumbling what are we going to do the girl appealed to jandron the sight of her solemn frightened eyes of her palmoutward hands and at last her very feminine fear constricted jandrons heart were going through you and i he answered simply weve got to save them from themselves you and i have their hands met again and for a moment held despite the dead calm a firtip at the edge of the clearing suddenly flicked aside shrivelled as if frozen but neither of them saw it the fugitives badly spent established themselves in the barroom or sleepingshack of the camp they wanted to feel a roof over them again if only a broken one the traces of men comforted them a couple of broken peavies a pair of snowshoes with the thongs all gnawed off a cracked bit of mirror a yellowed almanac dated jandron called the professors attention to this almanac but the professor thrust it aside what do i want of a canadian censusreport he demanded and fell to counting the bunks over and over again his big bulge of his forehead that housed the massive brain of him was oozing sweat marr cursed what he claimed was sunshine through the holes in the roof though jandron could see none claimed the sunshine made his head ache but its not a bad place he added we can make a blaze in that fireplace and be comfy i dont like that window though what window asked jandron where marr laughed and ignored him jandron turned to vivian who had sunk down on the deaconseat and was staring at the stove is there a window here he demanded dont ask me she whispered ii dont know with a very thriving fear in his heart jandron peered at her a moment he fell to muttering im wallace jandron wallace jandron ware street cambridge massachusetts im quite sane and im going to stay so im going to save her i know perfectly well what im doing and im sane quite quite sane after a time of confused and purposeless wrang ling they got a fire going and made coffee this and cube bouillon with hardtack helped consider ably the camp helped too a house even a poor and broken one is a wonderful barrier against a thing fromoutside presently darkness folded down the men smoked thankful that tobacco still held out vivian lay in a bunk that jandron had piled with spruce boughs for her and seemed to sleep the professor fretted like a child over the blisters his paddle had made upon his hands marr laughed now and then though what he might be laughing at was not ap parent suddenly he broke out after all what should it want of us our brains of course the professor answered sharply that lets jandron out the journalist mocked but added the professor i cant imagine a thing callously destroying human beings and yet he stopped short with surging memories of his dead wife what was it jandron asked that destroyed all those people in valladolid spain that time so many of em died in a few minutes after having been touched by an invisible something that left a slight red mark on each the newspapers were full of it piffle yawned marr i tell you insisted jandron there are forms of life as superior to us as we are to ants we cant see em no ant ever saw a man and did any ant ever form the least conception of a man these things have left thousands of traces all over the world if i had my referencebooks tell that to the marines charles fort the greatest authority in the world on unexplained phenomena persisted jandron gives innumerable cases of happenings that science cant explain in his âbook of the damned he claims this earth was once a nomans land where all kinds of things explored and colonized and fought for possession and he says that now every bodys warned off except the owners i happen to remember a few sentences of his âin the past inhabitants of a host of worlds have dropped here hopped here wafted here sailed flown motored walked here have come singly have come in enor mous numbers have visited for hunting trading mining they have been unable to stay here have made colonies here have been lost here
