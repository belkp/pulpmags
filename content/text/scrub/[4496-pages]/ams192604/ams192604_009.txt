 amazing stories steeds flecked with foam dashed through the mas cara gate which was one of five entrances opened in the embattled wall that encircled the town at that date mostaganem contained about fifteen thousand inhabitants three thousand of whom were french besides being one of the principal district towns of the province of oran it was also a military station mostaganem rejoiced in a well sheltered harbor which enabled it to utilize all the rich products of the mina and the lower shelif it was the existence of so good a harbor amidst the exposed cliffs of this coast that had induced the owner of the dobryna to winter in these parts and for two months the russian standard had been seen floating from her yard whilst on her masthead was hoisted the pennant of the french yacht club with the distinctive letters m c w t the initials of count timascheff having entered the town captain servadac made his way towards matmore the military quarter and was not long in finding two friends on whom he might relya major of the nd fusileers and a captain of the th artillery the two officers list ened gravely enough to servadacs request that they would act as his seconds in an affair of honor but could not resist a smile on hearing that the dispute between him and the count had originated in a mu sical discussion surely they suggested the matter might be easily arranged a few slight concessions on either side and all might be amicably adjusted but no representations on their part were of any avail hector servadac was inflexible no concession is possible he replied resolutely rossini has been deeply injured and i cannot suf fer the injury to be unavenged wagner is a fool i shall keep my word i am quite firm be it so then replied one of the officers and after all you know a swordcut need not be a very serious affair certainly not rejoined servadac and espe cially in my case when i have not the slightest intention of being wounded at all incredulous as they naturally were as to the assigned cause of the quarrel servadacs friends had no alternative but to accept his explanation and without further parley they started for the staff office where at two oclock precisely they were to meet the seconds of count timascheff two hours later they had returned all the prelimin aries had been arranged the count who like many russians abroad was an aidedecamp of the czar had of course proposed swords as the most appro priate weapons and the duel was to take place on the following morning the first of january at nine oclock upon the cliff at a spot about a mile and a half from the mouth of the shelif with the as surance that they would not fail to keep their appointment with military punctuality the two offi cers cordially wrung their friends hand and retired to the zulma cafe for a game at piquet captain servadac at once retraced his steps and left the town for the last fortnight servadac had not been occupying his proper lodgings in the military quar ters having been appointed to make a local levy he had been living in a gourbi or native hut on the mostaganem coast between four and five miles from the shelif his orderly was his sole com panion and by any other man than the captain the enforced exile would have been esteemed little short of a severe penance on his way to the gourbi his mental occupation was a very laborious effort to put together what he was pleased to call a rondo upon a model of versi fication all but obsolete this rondo it is unneces sary to coneal was to be an ode addressed to a young widow by whom he had been captivated and whom he was anxious to marry and the tenor of his muse was intended to prove that when once a man has found an object in all respects worthy of his af fections he should love her in all simplicity whether the aphorism was universally true was not very material to the gallant captain whose sole ambition at present was to construct a roundelay of which this should be the prevailing sentiment he indulged the fancy that he might succeed in produc ing a composition which would have a fine effect here in algeria where poetry in that form was all but unknown i know well enough he said repeatedly to him self what i want to say i want to tell her that i love her sincerely and wish to marry her but confound it the words wont rhyme plague on it does nothing rhyme with simplicity ah i have it now lovers should whoeer they be love in all simplicity but what next how am i to go on i say ben zoof he called aloud to his orderly who was trot ting silently close in his rear did you ever compose any poetry no captain answered the man promptly i have never made any verses but i have seen them made fast enough at a booth during the fete of montmartre can you remember them remember them to be sure i can this is the way they began come in come in youll not repent the entrance money you have spent the wondrous mirror in this place reveals your future sweethearts face bosh cried servadac in disgust your verses are detestable trash as good as any others captain squeaked through a reed pipe hold your tongue man said servadac per emptorily i have made another couplet lovers should whoeer they be love in all simplicity lover loving honestly offer i myself to thee beyond this however the captains poetical genius was impotent to carry him his further ef forts were unavailing and when at six oclock he reached the gourbi the four lines still remained the limit of his composition chapter ii captain servadac and his orderly at the time of which i write there might be seen in the registers of the minister of war the following entry servadac hector born at st trelody in the district of lesparre department of the gironde july th property francs in rentes
