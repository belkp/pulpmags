the facts in the case of m valdemar of course i shall not pretend to con sider it any matter for wonder that the extraordinary case of m valdemar has excited discussion it would have been a miracle had it notespecially under the circumstances through the desire of all parties concerned to keep the affair from the public at least for the present or until we had farther oppor tunities for investigationthrough our endeavors to effect thisa garbled or exaggerated account made its way into society and became the source of many unpleasant misrepresentations and very naturally of a great deal of disbelief it is now rendered necessary that i give the facts as far as i comprehend them myself they are succinctly these my attention for the last three years had been repeatedly drawn to the subject of mesmerism and about nine months ago it occurred to me quite sud denly that in the series of experiments made hither to there had been a very remarkable and most un accountable omission no person had as yet been mesmerized in articulo mortis it remained to be seen first whether in such condition there existed in the patient any susceptibility to the magnetic in fluence secondly whether if any existed it was impaired or increased by the condition thirdly to what extent or for how long a period the encroach ments of death might be arrested by the process there were other points to be ascertained but these most excited my curiositythe last in especial from the immensely important character of its con sequences in looking around me for some subject by whose means i might test these particulars i was brought to think of my friend m ernest valdemar the wellknown compiler of the bibliotheca forensica and author under the nom de plume of issachar marz of the polish versions of wallenstein and gargantua m valdemar who has resided prin cipally at harlem n y since the year is or was particularly no ticeable for the extreme spareness of his person his lower limbs much re sembling those of john randolph and also for the whiteness of his whiskers in violent con trast to the blackness of his hairthe latter in consequence being very generally mistaken for a wig his temperament was markedly nervous and rendered him a good subject for mesmeric experi ment on two or three occasions i had put him to sleep with little difficulty but was disappointed in other results which his peculiar constitution had naturally led me to anticipate his will was at no period positively or thoroughly under my con trol and in regard to clairvoyance i could ac complish with him nothing to be relied upon i always attributed my failure at these points to the disordered state of his health for some months previous to my becoming acquainted with him his physicians had declared him in a con firmed phthisis it was his custom indeed to speak calmly of his approaching dissolution as of a matter neither to be avoided nor regretted when the ideas to which i have alluded first oc curred to me it was of course very natural that i should think of m valdemar i knew the steady philosophy of the man too well to apprehend any scruples from him and he had no relatives in america who would be likely to interfere i spoke to him frankly upon the subject and to my sur prise his interest seemed vividly excited i say to my surprise for although he had always yielded his person freely to my experiments he had never be fore given me any tokens of sympathy with what i did his disease was of that character which would admit of exact calculation in respect to the epoch of its termination in death and it was finally arranged between us that he would send for me about twentyfour hours before the period an nounced by his physicians as that of his decease it is now rather more than seven months since i received from valdemar himself the subjoined note my dear p you may as well come now dand f are agreed that i cannot hold out beyond tomorrow midnight and i think they have hit the time very nearly valdemar i received this note within half an hour after it was written and in fifteen minutes more i was in the dying mans chamber i had not seen him for ten days and was appalled by the fearful alteration which the brief interval had wrought in him his face wore a leaden hue the eyes were utterly lustre less and the emaciation was so extreme that the skin had been broken through by the cheekbones his expectoration was excessive the pulse was barely perceptible he retained nevertheless in a very remarkable manner both his mental power and a certain degree of physical strength he spoke with distinctness took some palliative medicines without aidand when i entered the room was oc cupied in penciling memo randa in a pocketbook he was propped up in the bed by pillows doctors d and f were in at tendance after pressing valde mars hand i took these gentlemen aside and ob tained from them a min ute account of the pa tients condition the left lung had been for eighteen months in a semi osseous or cartilaginous state and was of course entirely useless for all purposes of vitality the right in its upper portion was also partially if not thoroughly ossified while the lower region was merely a mass of purulent tubercles running one into another several extensive perforations existed and at one point permanent adhesion to the ribs had taken place these appearances in the right lobe were of comparatively recent date the ossifica tion had proceeded with very unusual rapidity no sign of it had been discovered a month before and the adhesion had only been observed during the three previous days independently of the phthisis the patient was suspected of aneurism of the aorta mesmerism in this gruesome story by edgar allan poe has again been used as a vehicle for telling us his views about the higher philosophy and the future world mesmerism in another of poes stories mesmeric revelations is made an agreeable setting for some of his philosophy which he is willing to tell about without forcing it upon us in the too prev alent modern system but here we find the same author in a somewhat different character it is again mesmer ism which he employs it is again a bit of philosophy to be told us but the story leads tip gradually and most skillfully to a denouement the most horrifying and terrible in all modern story telling this very short story in its horror is unique
