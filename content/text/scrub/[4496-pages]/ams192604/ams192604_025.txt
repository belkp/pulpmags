 amazing stories have a good chance of running into the orbit of mercury and finish up by a collision with the sun added the count there is no fear of that sir the earth has undoubtedly entered upon a new orbit but she is not incurring any probable risk of being precipi tated into the sun can you satisfy us of that asked the count i can sir i can give you a proof which i think you will own is conclusive if as you suppose the earth is being drawn on so as to be precipitated against the sun the great center of attraction of our system it could only be because the centrifugal and centripetal forces that cause the planets to rotate in their several orbits had been entirely sus pended in that case indeed the earth would rush onwards towards the sun and in sixtyfour days and a half the catastrophe you dread would inevit ably happen and what demonstration do you offer asked servadac eagerly that it will not happen simply this captain that since the earth en tered her new orbit half the sixtyfour days has already elapsed and yet it is only just recently that she has crossed the orbit of venus hardly onethird of the distance to be traversed to reach the sun the lieutenant paused to allow time for reflec tion and added moreover i have every reason to believe that we are not so near the sun as we have been the temperature has been gradually diminishing the heat upon gourbi island is not greater now than we might ordinarily expect to find in algeria at the same time we have the problem still unsolved that the mediterranean has evidently been transported to the equatorial zone both the count and the captain expressed them selves reassured by his representations and ob served that they must now do all in their power to discover what had become of the vast continent of africa of which they were hitherto failing so completely to find a vestige twentyfour hours after leaving the island the dobryna had passed over the sites where tenes cherchil koleah and sidiferuch once had been but of these towns not one appeared within range of the telescope ocean reigned supreme lieu tenant procope was absolutely certain that he had not mistaken his direction the compass showed that the wind had never shifted from the west and this with the rate of speed as estimated by the log com bined to assure him that at this date the nd of february the schooner was in lat 째 n and long 째 e the very spot which ought to have been occupied by the algerian capital but algiers like all the other coasttowns had apparently been absorbed into the bowels of the earth captain servadac with clenched teeth and knit ted brow stood sternly almost fiercely regarding the boundless waste of water his pulse beat fast as he recalled the friends and comrades with whom he had spent the last few years in that vanished city all the images of his past life floated upon his memory his thoughts sped away to his native france only to return again to wonder whether the depths of ocean would reveal any traces of the algerian metropolis is it not impossible he murmured aloud that any city should disappear so completely would not the loftiest eminences of the city at least be visible surely some portion of the casbah must still rise above the waves the imperial fort too was built upon an elevation of feet it is in credible that it should be so totally submerged un less some vestiges of these are found i shall begin to suspect that the whole of africa has been swal lowed in some vast abyss another circumstance was most remarkable not a material object of any kind was to be noticed float ing on the surface of the water not one branch of a tree had been seen drifting by nor one spar be longing to one of the numerous vessels that a month previously had been moored in the magnificent bay which stretched twelve miles across from cape matafuz to point pexade perhaps the depths might disclose what the surface failed to reveal and count timascheff anxious that servadac should have every facility afforded him for solving his doubts called for the soundingline forthwith the lead was greased and lowered to the surprise of all and especially of lieutenant procope the line indicated a bottom at a nearly uniform depth of from four to five fathoms and although the sound ing was persevered with continuously for more than two hours over a considerable area the differences of level were insignificant not corresponding in any degree to what would be expected over the site of a city that had been terraced like the seats of an amphitheater astounding as it seemed what alter native was left but to suppose that the algerian capital hadbeen completely leveled by the flood the seabottom was composed of neither rock mud sand nor shells the soundinglead brought up nothing but a kind of metallic dust which glit tered with a strange iridescence and the nature of which it was impossible to determine as it wa totally unlike what had ever been known to be raised from the bed of the mediterranean you must see lieutenant i should think that we are not so near the coast of algeria as you im agined the lieutenant shook his head after pondering awhile he said if we were farther away i should expect to find a depth of two or three hundred fathoms instead of five fathoms five fathoms i confess i am puzzled for the next thirtysix hours until the th of february the sea was examined and explored with the most unflagging perseverance its depth re mained invariable still four or at most five fathoms and although its bottom was assiduously dredged it was only to prove it barren of marine production of any type the yacht made its way to lat 째 north by refer ence to the charts it was tolerably certain that she was cruising over the site of the sahel the ridge that had separated the rich plain of the mitidja from the sea and of which the highest peak mount bourjerah had reached an altitude of feet but even this peak which might have been expected to emerge like an islet above the surface of the sea was nowhere to be traced nothing was to be done but to put about and return in disappointment to wards the north thus the dobryna regainedthe waters of the mediterranean without discovering a trace of the missing province of algeria
