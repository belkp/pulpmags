 amazing stories poor fish to believe that mocked the jour nalist while the professor blinked and rubbed his bulging forehead i do believe it insisted jandron the world is covered with relics of dead civilizations that have mysteriously vanished leaving nothing but their temples and monuments rubbish how about easter island how about all the gigantic works there and in a thousand other places peru yucatan and so onwhich certainly no primitive race ever built thats thousands of years ago said marr and im sleepy for heavens sake can it oh all right but how explain things then what the devil could one of those things want of our brains suddenly put in the professor after all what well what do we want of lower forms of life sometimes food again some product or other or just information maybe it is just experiment ing with us the way we poke an anthill theres always this to remember that the human brain tissue is the most highlyorganized form of matter in this world yes admitted the professor but what t might want braintissue for food for experi mental purposes for lubricanthow do i know jandron fancied he was still explaining things but all at once he found himself waking up in one of the bunks he felt terribly cold stiff sore a sift of snow lay here and there on the camp floor where it had fallen through holes in the roof vivian he croaked hoarsely thorburn marr nobody answered there was nobody to answer jandron crawled with immense pain out of his bunk and blinked round with bleary eyes all of a sud den he saw the professor and gulped the professor was lying stiff and straight in another bunk on his back his waxen face made a mask of horror the open staring eyes with pupils immensely dilated sent jandron shuddering back a livid ring marked the forehead that now sagged inward as if empty vivian croaked jandron staggering away from the body he fumbled to the bunk where the girl had lain the bunk was quite deserted on the stove in which lay halfcharred wood wood smothered out as if by some noxious gas still stood the coffeepot the liquid in it was frozen solid of vivian and the journalist no trace re mained along one of the sagging beams that supported the roof jandrons horrorblasted gaze perceived a straight line of frosted prints ringshaped bitten deep vivian vivian no answer shaking sick gray halfblind with a horror not of this world jandron peered slowly around the dufflebag and supplies were gone nothing was left but that coffeepot and the revolver at jandrons hip jandron turned then astare his skull feeling empty as a burst drum he crept lamely to the door and outout into the snow snow it came slanting down from a gray sky it steadily filtered the trees showed no leaf birches poplars rockmaples all stood naked only the conifers drooped sicklygreen in a little shal low across the river snow lay white on thin ice ice snow rapt with terror jandron stared why then he must have been unconscious three or four weeks but how suddenly all along the upper branches of trees that edged the clearing puffs of snow flicked down the geologist shuffled after two halfobliterated sets of footprints that wavered toward the landing his body was leaden he wheezed as he reached the river the light dim as it was hurt his eyes he blinked in a confusion that could just perceive one canoe was gone he pressed a hand to his head where an iron band seemed screwed up tight tighter vivian marr halloooo not even an echo silence clamped the world silence and a cold that gnawed everything had gone a sinister gray after a certain timethough time now possessed neither reality nor durationjandron dragged him self back to the camp and stumbled in heedless of the staring corpse he crumpled down by the stove and tried to think but his brain had been emptied of power everything blent to a gray blur snow kept slithering in through the roof well why dont you come and get me thing suddenly snarled jandron here i am damn you come and get me voices suddenly he heard voices yes some body was outside there singularly aggrieved ho got up and limped to the door he squinted out intcf the gray saw two figures down by the landing with numb indifference he recognized the girl and marr why should they bother me again he nebu lously wondered cant they go away and leave me alone he felt peevish irritation then a modicum of reason returning he sensed that they were arguing vivian beside a canoe freshly dragged from thin ice was pointing marr was gesticulating all at once marr snarled turned from her plodded with bent back toward the camp but listen she called her roughknit sweater all powdered with snow thats the way she gestured downstream im not going either way marr retorted fra going to stay right here he came on bareheaded snow grayed his stubble of beard but on his head it melted as it fell as if some fever there had raised the brainstuff to improbable temperatures im going to stay right here all summer his heavy lids sagged puffy and evil his lips showed a glint of teeth let me alone vivian lagged after him kicking up the ashlike snow with indifference jandron watched them trivial human creatures suddenly marr saw him in the doorway and stopped short he drew his gun he aimed at jandron you get out he mouthed why in cant you stay dead put that gun down you idiot jandron managed to retort the girl stopped and seemed trying to understand we can get away yet if we all stick together are you going to get out and leave me alone
