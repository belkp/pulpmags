the man who saved the earth shadow that marked the plain to the northward to the west the mountains looming black to the star line a beautiful night sweetened with the breath of desert and tuned to its slumber across the lawn he watched the professor descending the pathway under the acacias an automobile was coming up the driveway as it drove up under the arcs he noticed its powerful lines and its driver one of those splendid pleasure cars that have returned to favor during the last decade the soft purr of its motor the great heavy tires and its coating of dust there is a lure about a great car coming in from the desert the car stopped charley noted doubtless some one for williams if it were he would go into the observatory alone in the strict sense of the word huyck was not an astronomer he had not made it his profes sion but for all that he knew things about the stars that the more exact professors had not dreamed of charley was a dreamer he had a code all his own and a manner of reasoning be tween him and the stars lay a secret he had not divulged it or if he had it was in such an open way that it was laughed at it was not cold enough in calculation or even if so was too far from their deduction huyck had imagina tion his universe was alive and potent it had in telligence matter could not live without it man was its manifestation just come to consciousness the universe teemed with intelligence charley looked at the stars he crossed the office passed through the recep tionroom and thence to the stairs that led to the observatory in the time that would lapse before the coming of his friend he would have ample time for observation somehow he felt that there was time for discovery he had come down to arizona to employ the lens of his friend the astronomer the instrument that he had erected on his own mountain in colorado had not given him the full satisfaction that he expected here in arizona in the dry clear air which had hitherto given such splendid results he hoped to find what he was after but little did he expect to discover the terrible thing he did it is one of the strangest parts of the story that he should be here at the very moment when fate and the worlds safety would have had him for years he and dr robold had been at work on their visionary projects they were both dream ers while others had scoffed they had silently been at their great work on kinetics the boy and the burning glass had grown under the tutelage of dr robold the time was about at hand when he could outrival the saying of arch imedes though the world knew it not charley huyck had arrived at the point where he could literally burn up the earth but he was not sinister though he had the power he had of course not the slightest intention he was a dreamer and it was part of his dream that man break his thraldom to the earth and reach out into the universe it was a great conception and were it not for the terrible event which took his life we have no doubt but that he would have succeeded it was tenthirty when he mounted the steps and seated himself he glanced at his watch he had a good ten minutes he had computed before just the time for the observation for months he had waited for just this moment he had not hoped to be alone and now that he was in solitary possession he counted himself fortunate only the stars and charley huyck knew the secret and not even he dreamed what it would amount to from his pocket he drew a number of papers most of them covered with notations some with drawings and a good sized map in colors this he spread before him and with his pencil began to draw right across its face a net of lines and cross lines a number of figures and a rapid com putation he nodded and then he made the obser vation it would have been interesting to study the face of charley huyck during the next few moments at first he was merely receptive his face placid but with the studious intentness of one who has come to the moment and as he began to find what he was afteran eagerness of satisfaction then a queer blankness the slight movement of his body stopped and the tapping of his feet ceased entirely jpor a full five minutes an absolute intentness during that time he was out among the stars be holding what not even he had dreamed of it was more than a secret and what it was only charley huyck of all the millions of men could have recog nized yet it was more than even he had expected when he at last drew away his face was chalklike great drops of sweat stood on his forehead and the terrible truth in his eyes made him look ten years older my god for a moment indecision and strange impotence the truth he had beheld numbed action from his lips the mumbled words this world my world our great and splendid mankind a sentence that was despair and a benediction then mechanically he turned back to confirm his observation this time knowing what he would see he was not so horrified his mind was cleared by the plain fact of what he was beholding when at last he drew away his face was settled he was a man who thought quicklythank the stars for thatand once he thought quick to spring to action there was a peril poising over the earth if it were to be voided there was not a second to lose in weighing up the possibilities he had been dreaming all his life he had never thought that the climax was to be the very opposite of what he hoped for in his under mind he prayed for dr robolddead and gone forever were he only here to help him he seized a piece of paper over its white face he ran a mass of computations he worked like lightning his fingers plying and his mind keyed to the pinpoint of genius not one thing did he overlook in his calculation if the earth had a chance he would find it there are always possibilities he was working out the odds of the greatest race since creation while the whole world slept while the uncounted millions lay down in fond security charley huyck there in the lonely room on the desert drew out their figured odds to the point of infinity just one chance in a million
