off on a comet because there is a small satellite in attendance and the captain drew his servants attention to a bright speck apparently about the size of one of jupiters satellites seen through a moderate tele scope that was clearly visible just within the focus of his glass here then was a fresh mystery the orbit of this planet was assuredly interior to the orbit of the earth because it accompanied the sun in its apparent motion yet it was neither mercury nor venus because neither one nor the other of these has any satellite at all the captain stamped and stamped again with mingled vexation agitation and bewilderment confound it he cried if this is neither venus nor mercury it must be the moon but if it is the moon whence in the name of all the gods has she picked up another moon for herself the captain was in dire perplexity chapter viii venus in perilous proximity the light of the returning sun soon extinguished the glory of the stars and rendered it necessary for the captain to postpone his observations he had sought in vain for further trace of the huge disc that had so excited his wonder on the first and it seemed most probable that in its irregular orbit it had been carried beyond the range of vision the weather was still superb the wind after veering to the west had sunk to a perfect calm pursuing its inverted course the sun rose and set with undeviating regularity and the days and nights were still divided into periods of precisely six hours eacha sure proof that the sun remained close to the new equator which manifestly passed through gourbi island meanwhile the temperature was steadily increas ing the captain kept his thermometers close at hand where he could repeatedly consult it and on the th he found that it registered ì§¸ centigrade in the shade no attempt had been made to rebuild the gourbi but the captain and ben zoof managed to make up quarters sufficiently comfortable in the principal apartment of the adjoining structure where the stone walls that at first afforded a refuge from the torrents of rain now formed an equally accept able shelter from the burning sun the heat was becoming insufferable surpassing the heat of sen egal and other equatorial regions not a cloud ever tempered the intensity of the solar rays and unless some modification ensued it seemed inevitable that all vegetation should become scorched and burnt off from the face of the island in spite however of the profuse perspirations from which he suffered ben zoof constant to his principles expressed no surprise at the unwonted heat no remonstrances from his master could induce him to abandon his watch from the cliff to withstand the vertical beams of that noontide sun would seem to require a skull of brass and a brain of adamant but yet hour after hour he would remain conscientiously scanning the surface of the mediterranean which calm and deserted lay out stretched before him on one occasion servadac in reference to his orderlys indomitable persever ance happened to remark that he thought he must have been born in the heart of equatorial africa to which ben zoof replied with the utmost dignity that he was born at montmartre which was all the same the worthy fellow was unwilling to own that even in the matter of heat the tropics could in any way surpass his own muchloved home this unprecedented temperature very soon began to take effect upon the products of the soil the sap rose rapidly in the trees so that in the course of a few days buds leaves flowers and fruit had come to full maturity it was the same with the cereals wheat and maize sprouted and ripened as if by magic and for a while a rank and luxuriant pasturage clothed the meadows summer and autumn seemed blended into one if captain ser vadac had been more deeply versed in astronomy he would perhaps have been able to bring to bear his knowledge that if the axis of the earth as every thing seemed to indicate now formed a right angle with the plane of the ecliptic her various seasons like those of the planet jupiter would become limi ted to certain zones in which they would remain invariable but even if he had understood the rationale of the change the convulsion that had brought it about would have been as much a mys tery as ever the precocity of vegetation caused some embar rassment the time for the corn and fruit harvest had fallen simultaneously with that of the hay mak ing and as the extreme heat precluded any pro longed exertions it was evident the population of the island would find it difficult to provide the necessary amount of labor not that the prospect gave them much concern the provisions of the gourbi were still far from exhausted and now that the roughness of the weather had so happily sub sided they had every encouragement to hope that a ship of some sort would soon appear not only was that part of the mediterranean systematically frequented by the government steamers that watched the coast but vessels of all nations were constantly cruising off the shore in spite however of all their sanguine specula tions no ship appeared ben zoof admitted the necessity of extemporizing a kind of parasol for himself otherwise he must literally have been roasted to death upon the exposed summit of the cliff meanwhile servadac was doing his utmostit must be acknowledged with indifferent success to recall the lessons of his schooldays he would plunge into the wildest speculations in his endeavors to unravel the difficulties of the new situation and struggled into a kind of conviction that if there had been a change of manner in the earths rotation on her axis there would be a corresponding change in her revolution round the sun which would involve the consequence of the length of the year being either diminished or increased independently of the increased and increasing heat there was another very conclusive demonstra tion that the earth had thus suddenly approached nearer to the sun the diameter of the solar disc was now exactly twice what it ordinarily looks to the naked eye in fact it was precisely such as it would appear to an observer on the surface of the planet venus the most obvious inference would therefore be that the earths distance from the sun had been diminished from to
