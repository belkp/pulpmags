off on a comet had traversed a couple of miles on level ground gallia had its drawbacks but it had some com pensating advantages telescopes in hand the explorers from the sum mit scanned the surrounding view their anticipa tions had already realized what they saw just as they expected on the north east and west lay the gallian sea smoothed and motionless as a sheet of glass the cold having as it were congealed the atmosphere so that there was not a breath of wind towards the south there seemed no limit to the land and the volcano formed the apex of a triangle of which the base was beyond the reach of vision viewed even from this height whence distance would do much to soften the general asperity the surface nevertheless seemed to be bristling with its myriads of hexagonal lamellse and to present diffi culties which to an ordinary pedestrian would be insurmountable oh for some wings or else a balloon cried servadac as he gazed around him and then look ing down to the rock upon which they were stand ing he added we seem to have been transplanted to a soil strange enough in its chemical character to bewilder the savants of a museum and do you observe captain asked the count how the convexity of our little world curtails our view see how circumscribed is the horizon servadac replied that he had noticed the same circumstance from the top of the cliffs of gourbi island yes said the count it becomes more and more obvious that ours is a very tiny world and that gourbi island is the sole productive spot upon its surface we have had a short summer and who knows whether we are not entering upon a winter that may last for years perhaps for cen turies but we must not mind count said servadac smiling we have agreed you know that come what may we are to be philosophers ay true my friend rejoined the count we must be philosophers and something more we must be grateful to the good protector who has hitherto befriended us and we must trust his mercy to the end for a few moments they both stood in silence and contemplated land and sea then having given a last glance over the dreary panorama they pre pared to wend their way down the mountain be fore they commenced their descent however they resolved to make a closer examination of the crater they were particularly struck by what seemed to them almost the mysterious calmness with which the eruption was effected there was none of the wild disorder and deafening tumult that usually accompany the discharge of volcanic matter but the heated lava rising with a uniform gentleness quietly overran the limits of the crater like the flow of water from the bosom of a peaceful lake instead of a boiler exposed to the action of an angry fire the crater rather resembled a brimming basin of which the contents were noiselessly escaping nor were there any igneous stones or redhot cin ders mingled with the smoke that crowned the sum mit a circumstance that quite accorded wjth the absence of the pumicestones obsidians and other minerals of volcanic origin with which the base of a burning mountain is generally strewn captain servadac was of opinion that this pecu liarity augured favorably for the continuance of the eruption extreme violence in physical as well as in moral nature is never of long duration the most terrible storms like the most violent fits of passion are not lasting but here the calm flow of the liquid fire appeared to be supplied from a source that was inexhaustible in the same way as the waters of niagara gliding on steadily to their final plunge would defy all effort to arrest their course before the evening of this day closed in a most important change was effected in the condition of the gallian sea by the intervention of human agency notwithstanding the increasing cold the sea unruffled as it was by a breath of wind still retained its liquid state it is an established fact that water under this condition of absolute still ness will remain uncongealed at a temperature several degrees below zero whilst experiment at the same time shows that a very slight shock will often be sufficient to convert it into solid ice it had occurred to servadac that if some com munication could be opened with gourbi island there would be a fine scope for hunting expeditions having this ultimate object in view he assembled his little colony upon a projecting rock at the ex tremity of the promontory and having called nina and pablo out to him in front he said now nina do you think you could throw something into the sea i think i could replied the child but i am sure that pablo would throw it a great deal further than i can never mind you shall try first putting a fragment of ice into ninas hand he addressed himself to pablo look out pablo you shall see what a nice little fairy nina is throw nina throw as hard as you can nina balanced the pie of ice two or three times in her hand and threw it forward with all her strength a sudden thrill seemed to vibrate across the mo tionless waters to the distant horizon and the gal lian sea had become a solid sheet of ice chapter xxiii a carrierpigeon when three hours after sunset on the rd of march the gallian moon rose upon the western horizon it was observed that she had entered upon her last quarter she had taken only four days to pass from syzygy to quadrature and it was conse quently evident that she would be visible for little more than a week at a time and that her lunation would be accomplished within sixteen days the lunar months like the solar days had been dimin ished by onehalf three days later the moon was in conjunction with the sun and was consequently lost to view ben zoof as the first observer of the satellite was extremely interested in its movements and wondered whether it would ever reappear on the th under an atmosphere perfectly clear and dry the thermometer fell to ì§¸ c below zero of the present distance of gallia from the sun and the number of leagues she had traversed since the receipt of the last mysterious document there were
