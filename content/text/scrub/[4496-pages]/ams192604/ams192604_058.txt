off on a comet space at their command would be quite inadequate the lieutenant urged that he was the most experi enced seaman and as such was best qualified to take command of the sledge and the management of the sails and as it was not to be expected that servadac would resign his intention of going in person to relieve his fellowcountryman procope submitted his own wishes to the count the count was himself very anxious to have his share in the philanthropic enterprise and demurred considerably to the pro posals he yielded however after a time to serva dacs representations that in the event of the expedi tion proving disastrous the little colony would need his services alike as governor and protector and overcoming his reluctance to be left out of the peril ous adventure was prevailed upon to remain behind for the general good of the community at ninas hive at sunrise on the following morning the th of april captain servadac and the lieutenant took their places in the yawl the thermometer was more than ì§¸ below zero and it was with deep emotion that their companions beheld them thus em barking upon the vast white plain ben zoofs heart was too full for words count timascheff could not forbear pressing his two brave friends to his bosom the spaniards and the russian sailors crowded round for a farewell shake of the hand and little nina her great eyes flooded with tears held up her face for a parting kiss the sad scene was not permitted to last long the sail was quickly hoisted and the sledge just as if it had expanded a huge white wing was in a little while carried far away beyond the horizon light and unimpeded the yawl scudded on with incredible speed two sails a mainsail and a jib were arranged to catch the wind to the greatest advantage and the travelers estimated that their progress would be little under the rate of twelve leagues an hour the motion of their novel vehicle was singularly gentle the oscillation being less than that of an ordinary railwaycarriage while the diminished force of gravity contributed to the swift ness except that the clouds of icedust raised by the metal runners were an evidence that they had not actually left the level surface of the ice the captain andlieutenant might again and again have imagined that they were being conveyed through the air in a balloon lieutenant procope with his head all muffled up for fear of frostbite took an occasional peep through an aperture that had been intentionally left in the roof and by the help of a compass main tained a proper and straight course for formentera nothing could be more dejected than the aspect of that frozen sea not a single living creature relieved the solitude both the travelers procope from a scientific point of view servadac from an aesthetic were alike impressed by the solemnity of the scene and when the lengthened shadow of the sail cast upon the ice by the oblique rays of the setting sun had disappeared and day had given place to night the two men drawn together as by an involuntary impulse mutually held each others hands in silence there had been a new moon on the previous eve ning but in the absence of moonlight the constella tions shone with remarkable brilliancy the new polestar close upon the horizon was resplendent and even had lieutenant procope been destitute of a compass he would have had no difficulty in holding his course by the guidance of that alone however great was the distance that separated gallia from the sun it was after all manifestly insignificant in comparison with the remoteness of the nearest of the fixed stars observing that servadac was completely ab sorbed in his own thoughts lieutenant procope had leisure to contemplate some of the present perplex ing problems and to ponder over the true astronom ical position the last of the three mysterious docu ments had represented that gallia in conformity with keplers second law had traveled along her orbit during the month of march twenty millions of leagues less than she had done in the previous month yet in the same time her distance from the sun had nevertheless been increased by thirtytwo millions of leagues she was now therefore in the center of the zone of telescopic planets that revolve between the orbits of mars and jupiter and had captured for herself a satellite which according to the document was nerina one of the asteroids most recently identified if thus then it was within the power of the unknown writer to estimate with such apparent certainty gallias exact position was it not likely that his mathematical calculations would enable him to arrive at some definite conclusion as to the date at which she would begin again to ap proach the sun nay was it not to be expected that he had already estimated with sufficient approxima tion to truth what was to be the true length of the gallian year so intently had they each separately been fol lowing their own train of thought that daylight re appeared almost before the travelers were aware of it on consulting their instruments they found that they must have traveled close upon a hundred leagues since they started and they resolved to slacken their speed the sails were accordingly taken in a little and in spite of the intensity of the cold the explorers ventured out of their shelter in order that they might reconnoiter the plain which was apparently as boundless as ever it was com pletely desert not so much as a single point of rock relieved the bare uniformity of its surface are we not considerably to the west of formen tera asked servadac after examining the chart most likely replied procope i have taken the same course as i should have done at sea and i have kept some distance to windward of the island we can bear straight down upon it whenever we like bear down then now and as quickly as you can the yawl was at once put with her head to the northeast and captain servadac in defiance of the icy blast remained standing at the bow his gaze fixed on the horizon all at once his eye brightened look look he exclaimed pointing to a faint outline that broke the monotony of the circle that divided the plain from the sky in an instant the lieutenant had seized his tele scope i see what you mean said he it is a pylon that has been used for some geodesic survey the next moment the sail was filled and the yawl was bearing down upon the object with inconceiv able swiftness both captain servadac and the lieu tenant too excited to utter a word mile after mile
