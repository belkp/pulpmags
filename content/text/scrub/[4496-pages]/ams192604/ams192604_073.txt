 amazing stories men and the girl flung every ounce of their energy into the paddles their panting breath mingled with the sound of swirling eddies a mistblurred sun brooded over the northern wilds unheeded hosts of blackflies sang highpitched keenings all about the fugitives on either hand the forest waited watched only after two hours of sweating toil had brought exhaustion did they stop in the shelter of a cove where black waters circled foamflecked there they found the professors wifeshe was dead nothing remained to do but bury her at first thorburn would not hear of it like a madman he insisted that through all hazards he would fetch the body out but noimpossible so after a ter rible time he yielded in spite of her grief vivian was admirable she undeistood what must be done it was her voice that said the prayers her hand thatlacking flowerslaid the fir boughs on the cairn the pro fessor was dazed past doing anything saying any thing toward midafternoon the party landed again many miles upriver necessity foxced them to eat fire would not burn every time they lighted it it smouldered and went out with a heavy greasy smoke the fugitives ate cold food and drank water then shoved off in two canoes and once more fled in the third canoe hauled to the edge of the forest lay all the rockspecimens data and curios scientific instrumexxts the party kept only marrs diaxy a compass supplies firearms and medicine kit we can find the things weve leftsometime said jandron noting the place well sometime after it has gone and bring the body out added thoxbuxn tears for the first time wet his eyes vivian said nothing marr tried to light his pipe he seemed to forget that nothing not even tobacco would burn now vivian and jandron occupied one canoe the other carried the professor and marr thus the power of the two canoes was about the same they kept well together upstream the fugitives paddled and portaged with a dumb desperate energy toward evening they struck into what they believed to be the mamattawan a mile up this as the blurred sun faded beyond a wilder ness of ominous silence they camped here they made determined efforts to kindle fixe not even alcohol from the drugkit would start it cold they mumbled a little food cold they huddled into their sleepingbags there to lie with darkness leaden on their fear after a long time up over a world void of all sound save the riverflow slid an amber moon notched by the ragged tops of the conifers even the wail of a timberwolf would have come as wel come relief but no wolf howled silence and night enfolded them and evexy whexe they felt that it was watching foolishly enough as a man will do foolish things in a crisis jandron laid his revolver outside his sleepingbag in easy reach his thoughtblurred by a strange drawing headachewas if it touches vivian ill shoot he realized the complete absurdity of trying to shoot a visitant from interstellar space from the fourth dimension maybe but jandrons ideas seemed tangled nothing would come right he lay there absorbed in a kind of waking night mare now and then rising on an elbow he hearkened all in vain nothing so much as stixred his thought drifted to better days when all had been health sanity optimism when nothing except jealousy of marr as concerned vivian had troubled him days when the sizzle of the fryingpan over friendly coals had made friendly wilderness music when the wind and the northern star the whirr of the reel the whispering vortex of the paddle in clear water had all been things of joy yes and when a certain happy moment had through some word or look of the girl seemed to piromise his hearts desire but now damn it ill save her anyhow he swore with savage intensity knowing all the while that what was to be would be unmitigably do ants by any waving of antennae stay the downcrushing foot of man next morning and the next no sign of the thing appeared hope revived that possibly it might have flitted away elsewhere back perhaps to outer space many were the miles the urging paddles spurned behind the fugitives calculated that a week more would bring them to the railroad fire burned again hot food and drink helped wonder fully but where were the fish most extraordinary all at once said the pro fessor at noonday camp he had become quite rational again do you realize jandron weve seen no traces of life in some time the geologist nodded only too clearly he had noted just that but he had been keeping still about it thats so too chimed in marr enjoying the smoke that some incomprehensible turn of events was letting him have not a muskrat or beaver not even a squirrel or bird not so much as a gnat or blackfly the pro fessor added jandron suddenly realized that he would have welcomed even those that afternoon marr fell into a suddenly vile temper he mumbled curses against the guides the current the portages everything the pro fessor seemed more cheerful vivian complained of an oppressive headache jandron gave her the last of the aspirin tablets and as he gave them took her hand in his ill see you through anyhow said he i dont count now nobody counts only you she gave him a long silent look he saw the sudden glint of tears in her eyes telt the pressure of her hand and knew they two had never been so near each other as in that moment under the shadow of the unknown next dayor it may have been two days later for none of them could be quite sure about the passage of timethey came to a deserted lumber camp even more than two days might have passed because now their bacon was all gone and only coffee tobacco beefcubes and pilotbread re mained the lack of fish and game ixad cut alarm ingly into the dufllebag that daywhatever day it may have beenall four of them suffered terribly from
