 amazing stories believe there was likely to be a market for any of his commodities a fine haul lieutenant said the captain yes indeed said the lieutenant but what if the owner refuses to part with it no fear no fear replied the captain as soon as ever the old rascal finds that there are no more arabs or algerians for him to fleece he will be ready enough to transact a little business with us we will pay him by bills of acceptance on some of his old friends in the old world but why should he want any payment inquired the lieutenant under the circumstances he must know that you have a right to make a requisition of his goods no no quickly rejoined servadac we will not do that just because the fellow is a german we shall not be justified in treating him in german fashion we will transact our business in a busi ness like way only let him once realize that he is on a new globe with no prospect of getting back to the old one and he will be ready enough to come to terms with us perhaps you are right replied the lieutenant i hope you are but anyhow it will not do to leave the tartan here not only would she be in danger in the event of a storm but it is very ques tionable whether she could resist the pressure of the ice if the water were to freeze quite true procope and accordingly i give you the commission to see that your crew bring her round to the shelif as soon as may be tomorrow morning it shall be done answered the lieutenant promptly upon returning to the shore it was arranged that the whole of the little colony should forthwith assemble at the gourbi the spaniards were sum moned and isaac although he could only with re luctance take his wistful gaze from his tartan obeyed the governors orders to follow an hour later and the entire population of twentytwo had met in the chamber adjoining the gourbi young pablo made his first acquaintance with little nina and the child seemed highly de lighted to find a companion so nearly of her own age leaving the children to entertain each other cap tain servadac began his address before entering upon further explanation he said that he counted upon the cordial cooperation of them all for the common welfare negrete interrupted him by declaring that no promises or pledges could be given until he and his countrymen knew how soon they could be sent back to spain to spain do you say asked servadac to spain

hundred reals are they to be allowed silence mordecai you fool shouted ben zoof who was accustomed to call the jew by any hebrew name that came uppermost to his memory silence servadac was disposed to appease the old mans anxiety by promising to see that justice was ulti mately done but in a fever of frantic excitement he went on to implore that he might have the loan of a few sailors to carry his ship to algiers i will pay you honestly i will pay you well he cried but his ingrained propensity for making a good bargain prompted him to add provided you do not overcharge me ben zoof was about again to interpose some angry exclamation but servadac checked him and continued in spanish listen to me my friends something very strange has happened a moat wonderful event has cut us off from spain from france from italy from every country of europe in fact we have left the old world entirely of the whole earth nothing remains except this island on which you are now taking refuge the old globe is far far away our present abode is but an insig nificant fragment that is left i dare not tell you that there is any chance of your ever again seeing your country or your homes he paused the
