off on a comet that i was a swallow flying over the montmartre but i never experienced anything of this kind be fore it must be peculiar to the coast of algeria servadac was stupefied he felt instinctively that he was not dreaming and yet was powerless to solve the mystery he was not however the man to puzzle himself for long over any insoluble problem come what may he presently exclaimed we will make up our minds for the future to be surprised at nothing right captain replied ben zoof and first of all let us settle our little score with count tima scheff beyond the ditch lay a small piece of meadow land about an acre in extent a soft and delicious herb age carpeted the soil whilst trees formed a charm ing framework to the whole no spot could have been chosen more suitable for the meeting between the two adversaries servadac cast a hasty glance round no one was in sight we are the first on the field he said not so sure of that sir said ben zoof what do you mean asked servadac looking at his watch which he had set as nearly as possible by the sun before leaving the gourbi it is not nine olock yet look up there sir i am much mistaken if that is not the sun and as ben zoof spoke he pointed directly overhead to where a faint white disc was dimly visible through the haze of clouds nonsense exclaimed servadac how can the sun be in the zenith in the month of january in lat ì§¸ n cant say sir i only know the sun is there and at the rate he has been traveling i would lay my cap to a dish of couscous that in less than three hours he will have set hector servadac mute and motionless stood with folded arms presently he roused himself and be gan to look about again what means all this he murmured laws of gravity disturbed points of the compass reversed the length of day re duced one half surely this will indefinitely post pone my meeting with the count something has happened ben zoof and i cannot both be mad the orderly meantime surveyed his master with the greatest equanimity no phenomenon however extraordinary would have drawn from him a single exclamation of surprise do you see anyone ben zoof asked the captain at last no one sir the count has evidently been and gone but supposing that to be the case persisted the captain my seconds would have waited and not seeing me would have come on towards the gourbi i can only conclude that they have been unable to get here and as for count timascheff without finishing his sentence captain servadac thinking it just probable that the count as on the previous evening might come by water walked to the ridge of rock that overhung the shore in order to ascertain if the dobryna were anywhere in sight but the sea was deserted and for the first time the captain noticed that although the wind was calm the waters were unusually agitated and seethed and foamed as though they were boiling it was very certain that the yacht would have found a difficulty in holding her own in such a swell an other thing that now struck servadac was the extra ordinary contraction of the horizon under ordi nary circumstances his elevated position would have allowed him a radius of vision at least five and twenty miles in length but the terrestrial sphere seemed in the course of the last few hours to have become considerably reduced in volume and he could now see for a distance of only six miles in every direction meantime withthe agility of a monkey ben zoof had clambered to the top of a eucalyptus and from his lofty perch was surveying the country to the south as well as towards both tenes and mos taganem on descending he informed the cap tain that the plain was deserted we will make our way to the river and get over into mostaganem said the captain the shelif was not more than a mile and a half from the meadow but no time was to be lost if the two men were to reach the town before night fall though still hidden by heavy clouds the sun was evidently declining fast and what was equally inexplicable it was not following the oblique curve that in these latitudes and at this time of year might be expected but was sinking perpendicularly down to the horizon as he went along captain servadac pondered deeply perchance some unheardof phenomenon had modified the rotary motion of the globe or perhaps the algerian coast had been transported beyond the equator into the southern hemisphere yet the earth with the exception of the alteration in its convexity in this part of africa at least seemed to have undergone no change of any very great importance as far as the eye could reach the shore was as it had ever been a succession of cliffs beach and arid rocks tinged with a red ferruginous hue to the southif south in this inverted order of things it might still be called the face of the country also appeared unaltered and some leagues away the peaks of the merdeyah mountains still retained their accustomed outline presently a rift in the clouds gave passage to an oblique ray of light that clearly proved that the sun was setting in the east well i am curious to know what they think of all this at mostaganem said the captain i won der too what the minister of war will say when he receives a telegram informing him that his afri can colony has become not morally but physically disorganized that the cardinal points are at vari ance with ordinary rules and that the sun in the month of january is shining down vertically upon our heads ben zoof whose ideas of discipline were ex tremely rigid at once suggested that the colony should be put under the surveillance of the police that the cardinal points should be placed under re straint and that the sun should be shot for breach of discipline meantime they were both advancing with the utmost speed the decompression of the atmo sphere made the specific gravity of their bodies extraordinarily light and they ran like hares and leaped like chamois leaving the devious windings of the footpath they went as a crow would fly across the country hedges trees and streams were cleared at a bound and under these conditions ben zoof felt that he could have overstepped mont martre at a single stride the earth seemed as
