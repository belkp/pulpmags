the facts in the case of m valdemar the arrival of dr f who came a little before sunrise and expressed unbounded astonishment at finding the patient still alive after feeling the pulse and applying a mirror to the lips he re quested me to speak to the sleepwaker again i did so saying m valdemar do you still sleep as before some minutes elapsed ere a reply was made and during the interval the dying man seemed to be collecting his energies to speak at my fourth repetition of the question he said very faintly almost inaudibly yes still asleepdying it was now the opinion or rather the wish of the physicians that m valdemar should be suffered to remain undisturbed in his present apparently tranquil condition until death should supervene and this it was generally agreed must now take place within a few minutes i concluded however to speak to him once more and merely repeated my previous question while i spoke there came a marked change over the countenance of the sleepwaker the eyes rolled themselves slowly open the pupils disappearing up wardly the skin generally assumed a cadaverous hue resembling not so much parchment as white paper and the circular hectic spots which hitherto had been strongly defined in the centre of each cheek went out at once i use this expression be cause the suddenness of their departure put me in mind of nothing so much as the extinguishment of a candle by a puff of the breath the upper lip at the same time writhed itself away from the teeth which it had previously covered completely while the lower jaw fell with an audible jerk leav ing the mouth widely extended and disclosing in full view the swollen and blackened tongue i pre sume that no member of the party then present had been unaccustomed to deathbed horrors but so hideous beyond conception was the appearance of m valdemar at this moment that there was a gen eral shrinking back from the region of the bed i now feel that i have reached a point of this narrative at which every reader will be startled into positive disbelief it is my business however simply to proceed there was no longer the faintest sign of vitality in m valdemar and concluding him to be dead we were consigning him to the charge of the nurses when a strong vibratory motion was observable in the tongue this continued for perhaps a minute at the expiration of this period there issued from the distended and motionless jaws a voicesuch as it would be madness in me to attempt describing there are indeed two or three epithets which might be considered as applicable to it in part i might say for example that the sound was harsh and broken and hollow but the hideous whole is indescribable for the simple reason that no similar sounds have ever jarred upon the ear of humanity there were two particulars nevertheless which i thought then and still think might fairly be stated as characteristic of the intonationas well adapted to convey some idea of its unearthly peculiarity in the first place the voice seemed to reach our earsat least minefrom a vast distance or from some deep cavern within the earth in the second place it impressed me i fear indeed that it will be impossible to make myself comprehended as gelatinous or glutinous matters impress the sense of touch i have spoke both of sound and of voice i mean to say that the sound was one of distinct of even wonderfully thrillingly distinctsyllabifica tion m valdemar spokeobviously in reply to the question i had propounded to him a few minutes before i had asked him it will be remembered if he still slept he now said yesnoi have been sleepingand now nowi am dead no person present even affected to deny or at tempted to repress the unutterable shuddering horror which these few words thus uttered were so well calculated to convey mr ll the stu dent swooned the nurses immediately left the chamber and could not be induced to return my own impressions i would not pretend to render in telligible to the reader for nearly an hour we busied ourselves silentlywithout the utterance of a wordin endeavors to revive mr ll when he came to himself we addressed ourselves again to an investigation of m valdemars condition it remained in all respects as i have at last described it with the exception that the mirror no longer afforded evidence of respiration an at tempt to draw blood from the arm failed i should mention too that this limb was no farther subject to my will i endeavored in vain to make it follow the direction of my hand the only real indication indeed of the mesmeric influence was now found in the vibratory movement of the tongue whenever i addressed m valdemar a question he seemed to be making an effort to reply but had no longer suffi cient volition to queries put to him by any other person than myself he seemed utterly insensible although i endeavored to place each member of the company in mesmeric rapport with him i believe that i have now related all that is necessary to an understanding of the sleepwakers state at this epoch other nurses were procured and at ten oclock i left the house in company with the two physicians and mr ll in the afternoon we all called again to see the patient his condition remained precisely the same we had now some discussion as to the propriety and feasibility of awakening him but we had little difficulty in agreeing that no good purpose would be served by so doing it was evident that so far death or what is usually termed death had been arrested by the mesmeric process it seemed clear to us all that to awaken m valdemar would be merely to insure his instant or at least his speedy dissolution from this period until the close of last week an interval of nearly seven monthswe continued to make daily calls at m valdemars house accom panied now and then by medical and other friends all this time the sleepwaker remained exactly as i have at last described him the nurses atten tions were continual it was on friday last that we finally resolved to make the experiment of awakening or attempting to awaken him and it is the perhaps unfortunate result of this latter experiment which has given rise to so much discussion in private circlesto so much of what i cannot help thinking unwarranted popular feeling for the purpose of relieving m valdemar from
