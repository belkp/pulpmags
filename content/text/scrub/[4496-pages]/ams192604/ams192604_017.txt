 amazing stories if as i hope rejoined the captain we are on a peninsula we are more likely to get to tenes there we shall hear the news far more likely to carry the news ourselves answered ben zoof as he threw himself down for his nights rest six hours later only waiting for sunrise captain servadac set himself in movement again to renew his investigations at this spot the shore that hitherto had been running in a southeasterly direc tion turned abruptly to the north being no longer formed by the natural bank of the shelif but con sisting of an absolutely new coastline no land was in sight nothing could be seen of orleans ville which ought to have been about six miles to the southwest and ben zoof who had mounted the highest point of view attainable could distinguish sea and nothing but sea to the farthest horizon quitting their encampment and riding on the bewildered explorers kept close to the new shore this since it had ceased to be formed by the origi nal river bank had considerably altered its aspect frequent landslips occurred and in many places deep chasms rifted the ground great gaps furrowed the fields and trees half uprooted overhung the water remarkable by the fantastic distortions of their gnarled trunks looking as though they had been chopped by a hatchet the sinuosities of the coast line alternately gully and headland had the effect of making a devious progress for the travelers and at sunset although they had accomplished more than twenty miles they had only just arrived at the foot of the mer deyah mountains which before the cataclysm had formed the extremity of the chain of the little atlas the ridge however had been violently rup tured and now rose nerpendicularly from the water on the following morning seivadac and ben zoof traversed one of the mountain gorges and next in order to make a more thorough acquaintance with the limits and condition of the section of algerian territory of which they seemed to be left as the sole occupants they dismounted and proceeded on foot to the summit of one of the highest peaks from this elevation they ascertained that from the base of the merdeyah to the mediterranean a distance of about eighteen miles a new coast line had come into existence no land was visible in any direction no isthmus existed to form a connecting link with the territory of tenes which had entirely dis appeared the result was that captain servadac was driven to the irresistible conclusion that the tract of land which he had been surveying was not as he had at first imagined a peninsula it was actually an island strictly generally speaking this island was quad rilateral but the sides were so irregular that it was much more nearly a triangle the comparison of the sides exhibiting these proportions the section of the right bank of the shelif seventytwo miles the southern boundary from the shelif to the chain of the little atlas twentyone miles from the little atlas to the mediterranean eighteen miles and sixty miles of the shore of the mediterranean itself making in all an entire circumference of about miles what does it all mean exclaimed the captain every hour growing more and more bewildered the will of providence and we must submit replied ben zoof calm and undisturbed with this reflection the two men silently descended the mountain and remounted their horses before eve ning they had reached the mediterranean on their road they failed to discern a vestige of the little town of montenotte like tenes of which not so much as a ruined cottage was visible on the horizon it seemed to be annihilated on the following day the th of january the two men made a forced march along the coast of the mediterranean which they found less altered than the captain had at first supposed but four villages had entirely disappeared and the head lands unable to resist the shock of the convulsion had been detached from the mainland the circuit of the island had been now completed and the explorers after a period of sixty hours found themselves once more beside the ruins of their gourbi five days or what according to the established order of things would have been two days and a half had been occupied in tracing the boundaries of their new domain and they had as certained beyond a doubt that they were the sole human inhabitants left upon the island well sir here you are governor general of algeria exclaimed ben zoof as they reached the gourbi with not a soul to govern gloomily rejoined the captain how so do you not reckon me pshaw ben zoof what are you what am i why i am the population the captain deigned no reply but muttering some expressions of regret for the fruitless trouble he had taken about his rondo betook himself to rest chapter vii ben zoof watches in vain in a few minutes the governor general and his population were asleep the gourbi being in ruins they were obliged to put up with the best accommo dation they could find in the adjacent erection it must be owned that the captains slumbers were by no means sound he was agitated by the conscious ness that he had hitherto been unable to account for his strange experiences by any reasonable theory though far from being advanced in the knowledge of natural philosophy he had been in structed to a certain degree in its elementary principles and by an effort of memory he man aged to recall some general laws which he had al most forgotten he could understand that an al tered inclination of the earths axis with regard to the ecliptic would introduce a change of position in the cardinal points and bring about a displace ment of the sea but the hypothesis entirely failed to account either for the shortening of the days or for the diminution in the pressure of the atmos phere he felt that his judgment was utterly baffled his only remaining hope was that the chain of marvels was not yet complete and that some thing farther might throw some light upon the mystery ben zoofs first care on the following morning was to provide a good breakfast to use his own phrase he was as hungry as the whole population of three million algerians of whom he was the
