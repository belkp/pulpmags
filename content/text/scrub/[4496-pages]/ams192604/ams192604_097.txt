 amazing stories but on this point the osseous symptoms rendered an exact diagnosis impossible it was the opinion of both physicians that m valdemar would die about midnight on the morrow sunday it was then seven oclock on saturday evening on quitting the invalids bedside to hold con versation with myself doctors d and f had bidden him a final farewell it had not been their intention to return but at my request they agreed to look in upon the patient about ten the next night when they had gone i spoke freely with m valdemar on the subject of his approaching dis solution as well as more particularly of the ex periment proposed he still professed himself quite willing and even anxious to have it made and urged me to commence it at once a male and a female nurse were in attendance but i did not feel myself altogether at liberty to engage in a task of this character with no more reliable witnesses than these people in case of sudden accident might prove i therefore postponed operations until about eight the next night when the arrival of a medical student with whom i had some acquaintance mr theodore l relieved me from further em barrassment it had been my design originally to wait for the physicians but i was induced to pro ceed first by the urgent entreaties of m valde mar and secondly by my conviction that i had not a moment to lose as he was evidently sinking fast mr ll was so kind as to accede to my desire that he would take notes of all that occurred and it is from his memoranda that what i now have to relate is for the most part either condensed or copied verbatim it wanted about five minutes of eight when tak ing the patients hand i begged him to state as distinctly as he could to mr l whether he m valdemar was entirely willing that i should make the experiment of mesmerizing him in his then condition he replied feebly yet quite audibly yes i wish to be mesmerizedadding immediately afterward i fear you have deferred it too long while he spoke thus i commenced the passes which i had already found most effectual in sub duing him he was evidently influenced with the first lateral stroke of my hand across his forehead but although i exerted all my powers no further perceptible effect was induced until some minutes after ten oclock when doctors d and f called according to appointment i explained to them in a few words what i designed and as they opposed no objection saying that the patient was already in the death agony i proceeded without hesitationexchanging however the lateral passes for downward ones and directing my gaze entirely into the right eye of the sufferer by this time his pulse was imperceptible and his breathing was stertorous and at intervals of half a minute this condition was nearly unaltered for a quarter of an hour at the expiration of this period how ever a natural although a very deep sigh escaped the bosom of the dying man and the stertorous breathing ceasedthat is to say its stertorousness was no longer apparent the intervals were un diminished the patients extremities were of an icy coldness at five minutes before eleven i perceived un equivocal signs of the mesmeric influence the glassy roll of the eye was changed for that ex pression of uneasy inward examination which is never seen except in cases of sleepwaking and which it is quite impossible to mistake with a few rapid lateral passes i made the lids quiver as in incipient sleep and with a few more i closed them altogether i was not satisfied however with this but continued the manipulations vigorously and with the fullest exertion of the will until i had completely stiffened the limbs of the slumberer after placing them in a seemingly easy position the legs were at full length the arms were nearly so and reposed on the bed at a moderate distance from the loins the head was very slightly elevated when i had accomplished this it was fully mid night and i requested the gentlemen present to examine m valdemars condition after a few ex periments they admitted him to be in an unusually perfect state of mesmeric trance the curiosity of both the physicians was greatly excited dr d resolved at once to remain with the patient all night while dr f took leave with a promise to return at daybreak mr ll and the nurses remained we left m valdemar entirely undisturbed until about three oclock in the morning when i ap proached him and found him in precisely the same condition as when dr fwent awaythat is to say he lay in the same position the pulse was im perceptible the breathing was gentle scarcely noticeable unless through the application of a mirror to the lips the eyes were closed naturally and the limbs were as rigid and as cold as marble still the general appearance was certainly not that of death as i approached m valdemar i made a kind of half effort to influence his right arm into pursuit of my own as i passed the latter gently to and fro above his person in such experiments with this patient i had never perfectly succeeded before and assuredly i had little thought of succeeding now but to my astonishmnt his arm very readily although feebly followed every direction i assigned it with mine i determined to hazard a few words of conversation m valdemar i said are you asleep he made no answer but i perceived a tremor about the lips and was thus induced to repeat the ques tion again and again at its third repetition his whole frame was agitated by a very slight shiver ing the eyelids unclosed themselves so far as to display a white line of a ball the lips moved slug gishly and from between them in a barely audible whisper issued the words yesasleep now do not wake melet me die so i here felt the limbs and found them as rigid as ever the right arm as before obeyed the direction of my hand i questioned the sleepwaker again do you still feel pain in the breast m valde mar the answer now was immediate but even less audible than before no paini am dying i did not think it advisable to disturb him further just then and nothing more was said or done until
