 amazing stories he knew but knowing as he did he was over come by the horror such a thing turned loose upon the earth he had lost many hours he had but a few hours remaining the thought gave him sud den energy he seized winters by the arm to the first town bob to the first townan aerodome there was speed in that motor for all its decades winters turned about and shot out in a lateral course parallel to the great chasm but for all his speed he could not keep back his question in the name of heaven charley what did it what is it came the answer and it drove the lust of all speed through winters bob said charley it is the end of the world if we dont make it but a few hours left we must have an airplane i must make the moun tain it was enough for wild bob he settled down it was only an old runabout but he could get speed out of a wheelbarrow he had never driven a race like this just once did he speak the words were characteristic a worlds record charley and were going to win just watch us and they did there was no time lost in the change the mere fact of huycks name his appearance and the man ner of his arrival was enough for the last hours messages had been pouring in at every post in the rocky mountains for charley huyck after the failure of all others many thousands had thought of him even the government unappreciative before had awakened to a belated and almost frantic eagerness orders were out that everything no matter what was to be at his disposal he had been regarded as visionary but in the face of what had occurred visions were now the most practical things for mankind besides professor williams had sent out to the world the strange portent of huycks note for years there had been mystery on that mountain could it be unfortunately we cannot give it the description we would like to give few men outside of the reg ular employees have ever been to the mountain of robold from the very first owing perhaps to the great forces stored and the danger of carelessness strangers and visitors had been barred then too the secrecy of dr roboldand the respect of his successor but we do know that the burning glass had grown into the mountain bob winters and the aviator are the only ones to tell us the employees one and all chose to re main the cataclysm that followed destroyed the work of huyck and roboldbut not until it had served the greatest deed that ever came out of the minds of men and had it not been for huycks in sistence we would not have even the account that we are giving it was he who insisted nay begged that his com panions return while there was yet a chance full well he knew out of the universe out of space he had coaxed the forces that would burn up the earth the great ball of luminous opalescence and the diminishing ocean there was but one answer through the imagi native genius of robold and huyck fate had work ed up to the moment the lad and the burning glass had grown to archimedes what happened the plane neared the mountain of robold the great bald summit and the four enormous globes of crystal at least we so assume we have winters word and that of the aviator that they were of the appearance of glass perhaps they were not but we can assume it for description so enormous that were they set upon a plain they would have overtopped the highest building ever constructed though on the height of the mountain and in its contrast they were not much more than golf balls it was not their size but their effect that was startling they were alive at least that is what we have from winters living luminous burning twisting within with a thousand blending iridescent beautiful colors not like electricity but something infinitely more powerful great mysterious mag nets that huyck had charged out of chaos glowing with the softest light the whole mountain bright ened as in a dream and the town of robold at its base lit up with a beauty that was past beholding it was new to winters the great buildings and the enormous machinery engines of strangest pat tern driven by forces that the rest of the world had not thought of not a sound the whole works a complicated mass covering a hundred acres driv ing with a silence that was magic not a whir nor friction like a living composite body pulsing and breathing the strange and mysterious force that had been evolved from huycks theory of kinetics the four great steel conduits running from the globes down the side of the mountain in the center at a point midway between the globes a massive steel needle hung on a pivot and pointed directly at the sun winters and the aviator noted it and wondered from the lower end of the needle was pouring a luminous stream of paleblue opalescence a stream much like a liquid and of an unholyradiance but it was not a liquid nor fire nor anything seen by man before it was force we have no better description than the apt phrase of winters charley huyck was milking the sun as it dropped from the end of the four living streams to the four globes that took it into storage the four great wonderful living globes the four batteries the very sight of their imprisoned beauty and power was magnetic the genius of huyck and robold nobody but the wildest dreamers would have conceived it the life of the sun and captive to man at his will and volition and in the next few minutes we were to lose it all but in losing it we were to save our selves it was fate and nothing else there was but one thing more upon the moun tainthe observatory and another needle appar ently idle but with a point much like a gigantic phonograph needle it rose square out of the ob servatory and to winters it gave an impression of a strange gun or some implement for sighting that was all coming with the speed that they were making the airmen had no time for further investigation but even this is comprehensive minus the force if we only knew more about that or even its theory we might perhaps reconstruct the
