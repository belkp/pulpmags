frozen it was determined therefore for the colony to embark on the following day and take up their residence in ninas hive a final consultation was held about the hansa lieutenant procope pronounced his decided convic tion that it would be impossible for the tartan to resist the pressure of the ice in the harbor of the shelif and that there would be far more safety in the proximity of the volcano

anchor before the great lateen sail of the tartan was unfurled and the shopship as ben zoof delighted to call it was also on her way to the southward long and loud were the lamentations of the jew he kept exclaiming that he had given no orders that he was being moved against his will that he had asked for no assistance and needed none but it required no very keen discrimination to observe that all

invited was spread in the central hall the stores of the dob ryna contained some excellent wine some of which was broached to do honor to the occasion the health of the governor general was drunk as
