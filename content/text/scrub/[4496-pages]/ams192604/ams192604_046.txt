off on a comet brandy and other stores sufficient for about two months secondly the valuable cargo of the hansa which sooner or later the owner whether he would or not must be compelled to surrender for the com mon benefit and lastly the produce of the island animal and vegetable which with proper economy might be made to last for a considerable period in the course of the conversation count tima scheff took an opportunity of saying that as cap tain servadac had already been presented to the spaniards as governor of the island he thought it advisable that he should really assume that position every body of men he observed must have a head and you as a frenchman should i think take the command of this fragment of a french colony my men i can answer for it are quite pre pared to recognize you as their superior officer most unhesitatingly replied servadac i ac cept the post with all its responsibilities we un derstand each other so well that i fell sure we shall try and work together for the common good and even if it be our fate never again to behold our fellow creatures i have no misgivings but that we shall be able to cope with whatever difficulties may be before us as he spoke he held out his hand the count took it at the same time making a slight bow it was the first time since their meeting that the two men had shaken hands on the other hand not a single word about their former rivalry had ever escaped their lips perhaps that was all forgotten now the silence of a few moments was broken by ser vadac saying do you not think we ought to explain our situation to the spaniards no no your excellency burst in ben zoof emphatically the fellows are chickenhearted enough already only tell them what has happened and in sheer despondency they will not do another stroke of work besides said lieutenant procope who took very much the same view as the orderly they are so miserably ignorant they would be sure to mis understand you understand or misunderstand replied serva dac i do not think it matters they would not care they are all fatalists only give them a guitar and their castanets and they will soon forget all care and anxiety for my own part i must adhere to my belief that it will be advisable to tell them everything have you any opinion to offer count my own opinion captain coincides entirely with yours i have followed the plan of explaining all i could to my men on board the dobryna and no inconvenience has arisen well then so let it be said the captain adding it is not likely that these spaniards are so ignorant as not to have noticed the change in length of the days neither can they be unaware of the physical changes that have transpired they shall certainly be told that we are being carried away into un known regions of space and that this island is nearly all that remains of the old world ha ha laughed ben zoof aloud it will be fine sport to watch the old jews face when he is made to comprehend that he is flying away millions and millions of leagues from all his debtors isaac hakkabut was about fifty yards behind and was consequently unable to overhear the conversa tion he went shambling along half whimpering and not infrequently invoking the god of israel but every now and then a cunning light gleamed from his eyes and his lips became compressed with a grim significance none of the recent phenomena had escaped his notice and more than once he had attempted to entice ben zoof into conversation upon the subject but the orderly made no secret of hi antipathy to him and generally replied to his advances either by satire or by banter he told him that he had every thing to gain under the new system of nights and days for instead of living the jews ordinary life of a century he would reach to the age of two cen turies and he congratulated him upon the circum stance of things having become so light because it would prevent him feeling the burden of his years at another time he would declare that to an old usurer like him it could not matter in the least what had become of the moon as he could not pos sibly have advanced any money upon her and when isaac undaunted by his jeers persevered in besetting him with questions he tried to silence him by saying only wait till the governor general comes he is a shrewd fellow and will tell you all about it but will he protect my property poor isaac would ask tremulously to be sure he will he would confiscate it all rather than that you should be robbed of it with this jobs comfort the jew had been obliged to content himself as best he could and to await the promised arrival of the governor when servadac and his companions reached the shore they found that the hansa had anchored in an exposed bay protected but barely by a few pro jecting rocks and in such a position that a gale ris ing from the west would inevitably drive her on to the land whereshe must be dashed in pieces it would be the height of folly to leave her in her present moorings without loss of time she must be brought round to the mouth of the shelif in immediate proximity to the russian yacht the consciousness that his tartan was the subject of discussion made the jew give way to such vehe ment ejaculations of anxiety that servadac turned round and peremptorily ordered him to desist from his clamor leaving the old man under the sur veillance of the count and ben zoof the captain and the lieutenant stepped into a small boat and were soon alongside the floating emporium a very short inspection sufficed to make them aware that both the tartan and her cargo were in a perfect state of preservation in the hold were sugarloaves by hundreds chests of tea bags of coffee hogsheads of tobacco pipes of wine casks of brandy barrels of dried herrings bales of cotton clothing of every kind shoes of all sizes caps of various shape tools household utensils china and earthenware reams of paper bottles of ink boxes of lucifer matches blocks of salt bags of pepper and spices a stock of huge dutch cheeses and a col lection of almanacs and miscellaneous literature at a rough guess the value could not be much under âł sterling a new cargo had been taken in only a few days before the catastrophe and it had been isaac hakkabuts intention to cruise from ceuta to tripoli calling wherever he had reason to
