 amazing stories work he is one of those men who find a help and stimulus in talking and so i have been able to fol low the conception of the new accelerator right up from a very early stage of course the greater por tion of his experimental work is not done in folke stone but in gower street in the fine new labora tory next to the hospital that he has been the first to use as everyone knows or at least as all intelligent people know the special field in which gibberne has gained so great and deserved a reputation among physiologists includes the action of drugs upon the nervous system on the subjects of soporifics sedatives and anaesthetics he is i am told un equalled he is also a chemist of considerable emin ence and i suppose in the subtle and complex jungle of riddles that shadows the ganglion cell and the axis fibre there are little cleared places of his mak ing little glades of illumination which until he sees fit to publish his results are still inaccessible to every other living man and in the last few years he has been particularly assiduous upon the question of nervous stimulants and already before the dis covery of the new accelerator had attained great success with them medical science has to thank him for at least three distinct and absolutely safe invigorators of unrivalled value to practising men in cases of exhaustion the preparation known as gibbernes b syrup has i suppose saved more lives already than any lifeboat on the coast but none of these little things begin to satisfy me yet he told me nearly a year ago either they increase the central energy without affecting the nerves or they simply increase the available energy by lowering the nervous conductivity and all of them are unequal and local in their operation one wakes up the heart and viscera and leaves the brain stupefied one gets at the brain champagne fashion and does nothing good for the solar plexus and what i want and what if its an earthly possibility i mean to haveis a stimulant that stimulates all round that wakes you up for a time from the crown of your head to the tip of your great toe and makes you go twoor even three to everybody elses one eh thats the thing im after it would tire a man i said not a doubt of it and youd eat double or trebleand all that but just think what the thing would mean imagine yourself with a little phial like thishe held up a little bottle of green glass and marked his points with itand that in this precious phial is the power to think twice ps fast move twice as quickly do twice as much work in a given time as you could otherwise do but is such a thing possible i believe so if it isnt ive wasted ray time for a year these various preparations of the hypo phosphites for example seem to show that some thing of the sort even if it was only one and a half times as fast it would do it would do i said if you were a statesman in a corner for example time rushing up against you something urgent to be done eh he could dose his private secretary i said and gaindouble time and think if you for example wanted to finish a book usually i said i wish id never begun em or a doctor driven to death wants to sit down and think out a case or a barristeror a man cramming for an examination worth a guinea a drop said i and moreto men like that and in a duel again said gibberne where it all depends on your quickness in pulling the trigger or in fencing i echoed you see said gibberne if i get it as an all round thing it will really do you no harm at all except perhaps to an infinitesimal degree it brings you nearer old age you will just have lived twice to other peoples once i suppose i meditated in a duelit would be fair thats a question for the seconds said gib berne i harked back further and you really think such a thing is possible i said as possible said gibberne and glanced at something that went throbbing by the window as a motorbus as a matter of fact he paused and smiled at me deeply and tapped slowly on the edge of his desk with the green phial i think i know the stuff already ive got something coming the nervous smile upon his face betrayed the gravity of his revelation he rarely talked of his actual experimental work unless things were very near the end and it may be it may bei shouldnt be surprisedit may even do the thing at a greater rate than twice it will be rather a big thing i hazarded it will be i think rather a big thing but i dont think he quite knew what a big thing it was to be for all that i remember we had several talks about the stuff after that the new accelerator he called it and his tone about it grew more confident on each occasion sometimes he talked nervously of unex pected physiological results its use might have and then he would get a little unhappy at others he was frankly mercenary and we debated long and anxiously how the preparation might be turned to commercial account its a good thing said gib berne a tremendous thing i know im giving the world something and i think it only reasonable we should expect the world to pay the dignity of science is all very well but i think somehow i must have the monopoly of the stuff for say ten years i dont see why all the fun in life should go to the dealers in ham it seemed to me that gibberne was really pre paring no less than the absolute acceleration of life suppose a man repeatedly dosed with such a preparation he would live an active and record life indeed but he would be an adult at eleven middle aged at twentyfive and by thirty well on the road to senile decay it seemed to me that so far gibberne was going to do for anyone who took his drug exactly what nature has done for the jews an orientals who are men in their teens and aged by fifty and quicker in thought and act than we are all the time the marvel of drugs has always been great to my mind you can madden a man calm a man make him incredibly strong and alert or a helpless log quicken this passion and allay that all by means of drugs and here was a new miracle to be added to this strange armory of phials the doctors use but gibberne was far too eager upon
