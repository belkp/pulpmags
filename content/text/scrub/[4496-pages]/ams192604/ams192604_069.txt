 amazing stories and it was water yes pure water and i was floating in it years suddenly i shot up out of the water and fell back strength returned to me and warmth and love of life it was water something i knew some thing familiar a friend and so i swam swam on and on until my feet touched bottom and i was leaping forth out of the water on to the sand iv there is no need to drag the tale out i awoke finally from an exhausted sleep and found myself in a world that was strange yet familiar it might have been a lonely part of the earth except for an atmosphere of strangeness that told me subcon sciously it was another world there was a sun but it was far distant no larger than my moon and vast clouds of steam hung over the jungles be yond the sand obscuring them in a shimmering fog obscuring the sun so that it danced and glim mered hazily through the curtain and a perpetual twilight thus reigned i tried to tell myself i was in some strange man ner home but i knew i was not at last break ing beneath the weight of homesickness and regret i surrendered to a fit of weeping that shamed my manhood even as i wept then a mood of terrible unreasoning anger against fate enveloped me and i stormed here and there about the beach and so all through the night i alternately wept and raged and when the dawn came i sank again in peaceful slumber when i awoke i was calm obviously in stop ping i told myself i had been left in a cloud of atoms that proved to be part of another group of matter another earth or atom as you will the particular atoms i was in were part of the ocean the only thing to do was to return i was asham ed of my madness now for i had the means of re turn in the third button the bottom button i saw no reason for delay i splashed back into the water and swam hastily out to the point where it seemed i had risen i pushed the lowest button slowly i felt myself grow smaller and smaller the sense of suffocation returned only to pass away as the pinpoints shot about me again but away this time the whole nightmare was repeated now re versed for everything seemed to be opening up be fore me i thrilled with joy as i thought of my re turn to my home and the professor again all the world was friend to me now in my thoughts a friend i could not bear to lose and then all my hopes were dashed how i thought could i strike my own earth again for even if i had come to the right spot in the water to a certainty how could i be sure i would pass be tween just the right cloud of molecules and what would lead me to the very electron i had left and after the nucleus why should i not enter the wrong nebula and even if i should hit the right nebula how should i find my own star my own earth it was hopeless impossible and yet so consti tuted is human nature that i could hope neverthe less my god impossible as it is i did it i am cer tain that it was my own nebula i entered and i was in the center where the sun should be it sounds fantastic it is fantastic the luck of a lifetime an infinity for me or so it should have been but i looked where the sun ought to be found in the cen tral cluster i halted early and watched long with a sinking heart but the sunwas gone i lay motionless in the depths of space and i watched idly the stars that roamed here and there black despair was in my heart but it was a despair so terrible that i could not comprehend its awful ness it was beyond human emotion and i was dazed perhaps even a little mad the stars were tiny pinpoints of light and they shot back and forth and all around like purposeless nothings and ever would they collide and a great er pinpoint would be born or a thousand pieces of fragments would result or the two might start off on new tracks only to collide again seconds it took them to cover what i knew to be billions of trillions of lightyears and gradually the truth dawned upon me the awful truth these stars were suns even as mine had been and they grew and died and were reborn it seemed now in a second all in a second yet fair races bloomed and died and worlds lived and died races of intelligent beings strove only to die all in a second but it was not a second to them my immense size was to blame on my part for time is relative and depends upon size the smaller a creature the shorter its life and yet to itself the fly that lives but a day has passed a life time of years so it was here because i had grown large centuries had become but moments to me and the faster the larger i grew the swifter the years the millions of years had rolled away i re membered how i had seen the streaks that meant the planets going about the sun so fast had they revolved that i could not see the circuit that meant but a second to me and yet each incredibly swift revolution had been a year a year on earth a second to me and so on an immensely greater scale had it been as i grew the few minutes that meant to me the suns movement through the ether of what seemed a yard had been centuries to the earth before i had lived ten minutes of my strange existence professor martyn had vainly hoped away a lifetime and died in bitter despair men had come and died races had flourished and fallen per haps all mankind had died away from a world strip ped of air and water in ten minutes of my life and so i sit here now pining hopelessly for my mother earth this strange planet of a strange star is all beyond my ken the men are strange and their customs curious their language is beyond my every effort to comprehend yet mine they know like a book i find myself a savage a creature to be treated with pity and contempt in a world too advanced even for his comprehension nothing here means anything to me i live here on sufferance as an ignorant african might have lived in an incomprehensible to him london a strange creature to play with and to be played with by children a clown a savage and yearn as i will for my earth i know i may never know it again for it was gone forgotten nonexistent a trillion centuries ago the end of part one
