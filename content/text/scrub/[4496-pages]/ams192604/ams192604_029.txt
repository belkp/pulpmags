 amazing stories the features would occasionally change sometimes for two or three miles assuming the form of a simple arris sharply defined as though cut by a chisel when suddenly the prismatic lamellae soaring in rugged confusion would again recur but all along there was the same absence of beach or tract of sand to mark its base neither were there any of those shoals of rock that are ordinarily found in shallow water at rare intervals there were some narrow fissures but not a creek available for a ship to enter to replenish its supply of water and the wide roadsteads were unprotected and exposed to wellnigh every point of the compass but after sailing two hundred and forty miles the progress of the dobryna was suddenly arrested lieutenant procope who had sedulously inserted the outline of the newly revealed shore upon the maps announced that it had ceased to run east and west and had taken a turn due north thus forming a barrier to their continuing their previous direc tion it was of course impossible to conjecture how far this barrier extended it coincided pretty nearly with the fourteenth meridian of east long itude and if it reached as probably it did beyond sicily to italy it was certain that the vast basin of the mediterranean which had washed the shores alike of europe asia and africa must have been reduced to about half its original area it was resolved to proceed upon the same plan as heretofore following the boundary of the land at a safe distance accordingly the head of the dob ryna was pointed north making straight as it was presumed for the south of europe a hundred miles or somewhat over in that direction and it was to be anticipated she would come in sight of malta if only that ancient island the heritage in succession of phoenicians carthaginians sicilians romans vandals greeks arabians and the knights of rhodes should still be undestroyed but malta too was gone and when upon the th the soundingline was dropped upon its site it was only with the same result so oftentimes ob tained before the devastation is not limited to africa ob served the count assuredly not assented the lieutenant adding and i confess i am almost in despair whether we shall ever ascertain its limits to what quarter of europe if europe still exists do you propose that i should now direct your course to sicily italy france ejaculated servadac eagerlyanywhere where we can learn the truth of what has befallen us how if we are the sole survivors said the count gravely hector servadac was silent his own secret pre sentiment so thoroughly coincided with the doubts expressed by the count that he refrained from say ing another word the coast without deviation still tended towards the north no alternative therefore remained than to take a westerly course and to attempt to reach the northern shores of the mediterranean on the th day the dobryna essayed to start upon her altered way but it seemed as if the elements had conspired to obstruct her progress a furious tempest arose the wind beat dead in the direction of the coast and the danger incurred by a vessel of a tonnage so light was necessarily very great lieutenant procope was extremely uneasy he took in all sail struck his topmasts and resolved to rely entirely on his engine but the peril seemed only to increase enormous waves caught the schooner and carried her up to their crests whence again she was plunged deep into the abysses that they left the screw failed to keep its hold upon the water but continually revolved with useless speed in the vacant air and thus although the steam was forced on to the extremest limit con sistent with safety the vessel held her way with the utmost difficulty and recoiled before the hurri cane still not a single resort for refuge did the in hospitable shore present again and again the lieutenant asked himself what would become of him and his comrades even if they should survive the peril of shipwreck and gain a footing upon the cliff what resources could they expect to find upon that scene of desolation what hope could they enter tain that any portion of the old continent still ex isted beyond that dreary barrier it was a trying time but throughout it all the crew behaved with the greatest courage and com posure confident in the skill of their commander and in the stability of their ship they performed their duties with steadiness and unquestioning obedience but neither skill nor courage nor obedience could avail all was in vain despite the strain put upon her engine the schooner bare of canvas for not even the smallest staysail could have withstood the violence of the storm was drifting with ter rific speed towards the menacing precipices which were only a few short miles to leeward fully alive to the hopelessness of their situation the crew were all on deck all over with us sir said procope to the count i have done everything that man could do but our case is desperate nothing short of a miracle can save us now within an hour we must go to pieces upon yonder rocks let us then commend ourselves to the provi dence of him to whom nothing is impossible re plied the count in a calm clear voice that could be distinctly heard by all and as he spoke he rever ently uncovered an example in which he was fol lowed by all the rest the destruction of the vessel seeming thus in evitable lieutenant procope took the best measures he could to insure a few days supply of food for any who might escape ashore he ordered several cases of provisions and kegs of water to be brought on deck and saw that they were securely lashed to some empty barrels to make them float after the ship had gone down less and less grew the distance from the shore but no creek no inlet could be discerned in the towering wall of cliff which seemed about to topple over and involve them in annihilation except a change of wind or as procope observed a superna tural rifting of the rock nothing could bring de liverance now but the wind did not veer and in a few minutes more the schooner was hardly three cables distance from the fatal land all were aware that their last moment had arrived serva dac and the count grasped each others hands for a long farewell and tossed by the tremendous waves the schooner was on the very point of being hurled
