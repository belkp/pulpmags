off on a comet the burning curtain that covered the aperture of the central hall was very remarkable so far from there being any likelihood of the fire being extin guished by the vehemence of the current of air the hurricane seemed rather to act as a ventilator which fanned the flame into greater activity and the utmost care was necessary to avoid being burnt by the fragments of lava that were drifted into the interior of the grotto more than once the curtain itself was rifted entirely asunder but only to close up again immediately after allowing a momentary draught of cold air to penetrate the hall in a way that was refreshing and rather ad vantageous than otherwise on the th of april after an absence of about four days the new satellite to ben zoofs great satisfaction made its reappearance in a crescent form a circumstance that seemed to justify the anticipation that henceforward it would continue to make a periodic revolution every fortnight the crust of ice and snow was far too stout for the beaks of the strongest birds to penetrate and accordingly large swarms had left the island and following the human population had taken refuge on the volcanic promontory not that there the barren shore had anything in the way of nourish ment to offer them but their instinct impelled them to haunt now the very habitations which formerly they would have shunned scraps of food

of the residents as they sat at table and soon became such an intolerable nuisance that it formed one of the daily diversions to hunt them down but although they were vigorously attacked by stones and sticks and even occasionally by shot it was with some difficulty that their number could be sensibly reduced by a systematic course of warfare the bulk of the birds were all expelled with the exception of about a hundred which began to build in the crev ices of the rocks these were left in quiet posses sion of their quarters as not only was it deemed advisable to perpetuate the various

pointed to a bird which she was cares sing tenderly in her bosom a pigeon exclaimed ben zoof who had reached the scene of the commotion a carrierpigeon and by all the saints of montmartre there is a

fellowcountryman in peril of starvation drove him wellnigh to distraction and it was in vain that search was made everywhere near the scene of conflict in hopes of finding the missing scrap that might bear a signature or address suddenly little nina who had again taken pos session of the pigeon and was hugging it to her breast said look here ben zoof and as she spoke she pointed to the left wing of
