off on a comet representative and he must have enough to eat the catastrophe which had overwhelmed the coun try had left a dozen eggs uninjured and upon these with a good dish of his famous couscous he hoped that he and his master might have a sufficiently substantial meal the stove was ready for use the copper skillet was as bright as hands could make it and the beads of condensed steam upon the sur face of a large stone alcarraza gave evidence that it was supplied with water ben zoof at once lighted a fire singing all the time according to his wont a snatch of an old military refrain ever on the lookout for fresh phenomena cap tain servadac watched the preparations with a curi ous eye it struck him that perhaps the air in its strangely modified condition would fail to supply sufficient oxygen and that the stove in consequence might not fulfill its function but no the fire was lighted just as usual and fanned into vigor by ben zoof applying his mouth in lieu of bellows and a bright flame started up from the midst of the twigs and coal the skillet was duly set upon the stove and ben zoof was prepared to wait awhile for the water to boil taking up the eggs he was surprised to notice that they hardly weighed more than they would if they had been mere shells but he was still more surprised when he saw that before the water had been two minutes over the fiie it was at full boil by jingo he exclaimed a precious hot fire servadac reflected it cannot be that the fire is hotter he said the peculiarity must be in the water and taking down a centigrade thermometer which hung upon the wall he plunged it into the skillet instead of 째 the instrument registered only 째 take my advice ben zoof he said leave your eggs in the saucepan a good quarter of an hour boil them hard that will never do objected the orderly you will not find them hard my good fellow trust me we shall be able to dip our sippets into the yolks easily enough the captain was quite right in his conjecture that this new phenomenon was caused by a diminution in the pressure of the atmosphere water boiling at a temperature of 째 was itself an evidence that the ocean of air above the earths surface had been reduced by onethird of its quantity the identical phenomenon would have occurred at the summit of a mountain feet high and had servadac been in possession of a barometer he would have immediately discovered the fact that only now for the first time as the result of experi ment revealed itself to hima fact moreover which accounted for the effect upon the blood vessels which both he and ben zoof had experienced as well as for the attenuation of their voices and their accelerated breathing and yet he agreed with himself if our encampment has been pro jected to so great an elevation how is it that the sea remains at its proper level once again hector servadac though capable of tracing consequences felt himself totally at a loss to comprehend their cause hence his agitation and bewilderment after their prolonged immersion in the boiling water the eggs were found to be only just suffi ciently cooked the couscous was very much in the same condition and ben zoof came to the conclu sion that in future he must be careful to commence his culinary operations an hour earlier he was rejoiced at last to help his master who in spite of his perplexed preoccupation seemed to have a very fair appetite for breakfast well captain said ben zoof presently such being his ordinary way of opening conversation well ben zoof was the captains invariable response to his servants formula what are we to do now sir we can only for the present wait patiently where we are we are encamped upon an island and therefore we can only be rescued by sea but do you suppose that any of our friends are still alive asked ben zoof oh i think we must indulge the hope that this catastrophe has not extended far we must trust that it has limited its mischief to some small por tion of the algerian coast and that our friends are all alive and well no doubt the governor general will be anxious to investigate the full extent of the damage and will send a vessel from algiers to explore it is not likely that we shall be forgotten what you have to do then ben zoof is to keep a sharp lookout and to be ready in case a vessel should appear to make signals at once but if no vessel should appear sighed the orderly then we must build a boat and go in search of those who do not come in search of us very good but what sort of a sailor are you everyone can be a sailor when he must said servadac calmly ben zoof said no more for several succeeding days he scanned the horizon unintermittently with his telescope his watching was in vain no ship appeared upon the desert sea by the name of a kabyle he broke out impatiently his excellency is grossly neglige it although the days and nights had become reduced from twentyfour hours to twelve captain serva dac would not accept the new condition of things but resolved to adhere to the computations of the old calendar notwithstanding therefore that the sun had risen and set twelve times since the com mencement of the new year he persisted in calling the following day the th of january his watch enabled him to keep an accurate account of the passing hours in the course of his life ben zoof had read a few books after pondering one day he said it seems to me captain that you have turned into robinson crusoe and that i am your man friday i hope i have not become a negro no replied the captain your complexion isnt the fairest in the world but you are not black yet well i had much sooner be a white friday than a black one rejoined ben zoof still no ship appeared and captain servadac after the example of all previous crusoes began to consider it advisable to investigate the resources of his domain the new territory of which he had become the monarch he named gourbi island it had a superficial area of about nine hundred square miles bullocks cows goats and sheep existed in considerable numbers and as there seemed already to be an abundance of game it was hardly likely
