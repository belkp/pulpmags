the man who saved the earth the spot fourteenth and broadway oakland california fortunately the thousands of employees in the stores about had not yet come out for their lunch eons the lapse that it takes to put a hat on or to pat a ribbon saved a thousand lives one shudders to think of what would have happened had the spot been crowded even so it was too impossible and too terrible to be true such things could not hap pen at high noon two streetcars crossing four teenth on broadwaytwo cars with thesame joggle and bump and the same aspect of any of a hundred thousand at a traffic corner the wonder isthere were so few people a telegraph car outgoing and a broadway car coming in the traffic police man at his post had just given his signal two automobiles were passing and a single pedestrian so it is said was working his way diagonally across the corner of this we are not certain it was a moment that impinged on miracle even as we recount it knowing as we do the explana tion we sense the impossibility of the event a phenomenon that holds out and in spite of our find ings lingers into the miraculous to be and not to be one moment life and action an ordinary scene of existent monotony and the next moment noth ing the spot the intersection of the street the passing streetcars the two automobiles pedestrian the policemannonexistent when events are in stantaneous reports are apt to be misleading this is what we find some of those who beheld it report a flash of bluish white light others that it was of a greenish or even a violet hue and others no doubt of strong er vision that it was not only of a predominant color but that it was shot and sparkled with a myriad specks of flame and burning it gave no warning and it made no sound not even a whir like a hot breath out of the void whatever the forces that had focused they were destruction there was no fourteenth and broad way the two automobiles the two streetcars the pedestrian the policeman had been whiffed away as if they had never existed in place of the inter section of the thoroughfares was a yawning gulf that looked down into the center of the earth to a depth of nausea it was instantaneous it was without sound no warning a tremendous force of unlimited poten tiality had been loosed to kinetic violence it was the suddenness and the silence that belied credence we were accustomed to associate all disaster with confusion calamity has an affinity with pandemo nium all things of terror climax into sound in this case there was no sound hence the wonder a hole or bore forty feet in diameter without a particle of warning and without a bit of confu sion the spectators one and all aver that at first they took it for nothing more than the effect of startled eyesight almost subtle it was not until after a full minutes reflection that they became aware that a miracle had been wrought before their faces then the crowd rushed up and with awe and now awakened terror gazed down into that ter rible pit we say terrible because in this case it is an exact adjective the strangest hole that man ever looked into it was so deep that at first it appeared to have no bottom not even the strongest eyesight could penetrate the smoldering blackness that shrouded the depths descending it took a stout heart and courage to stand and hold ones head on the brink for even a minute it was straight and precipitous a perfect circle in shape with sides as smooth as the effect of ma chine work the pavement and stone curb had been cut as if by a razor of the two street cars two automobiles and their occupants there was nothing the whole thing so silent and complete not even the spectators could really believe it it was a hard thing to believe the newspapers themselves when the news came clamoring accept ed it with reluctance it was too much like a hoax not until the most trusted reporters had gone and had wired in their reports would they even con sider it then the whole world sat up and took notice a miracle like oaklands press we all of us doubted that hole we had attained almost every thing that was worth the knowing we were the masters of the earth and its secrets and we were proud of our wisdom naturally we refused such reports all out of reason it must be a hoax but the wires were persistent came corrobora tion a reliable newsgathering organization soon was coming through with elaborate and detailed accounts of just what was happening we had the news from the highest and most reputable author ity and still we doubted it was the story itself that brought the doubting its touch on miracle it was too easy to pick on the reporter there might be a hole and all that but this thing of no explana tion a bomb perhaps no noise some new explosive no such thing well how did we know it was better than a miracle then came the scientists as soon as could be men of great minds had been hustled to the scene the world had long been accustomed to accept with out quibble the dictum of these great specialists of fact with their train of accomplishments be hind them we would hardly be consistent were we to doubt them we know the scientist and his habits he is the one man who will believe nothing until it is proved it is his profession and for that we pay him he can catch the smallest bug that ever crawled out of an atom and give it a name so long that a polish wrestler if he had to bear it would break under the burden it is his very knack of getting in under that has given us our civilization you dont baffle a scientist in our utopia it cant be done which is one of the very reasons why we began to believe in the miracle in a few moments a crowd of many thousands had gathered about the spot the throng grew so dense that there was peril of some of them being crowded into the pit at the center it took all the spare policemen of the city to beat them back far enough to string ropes from the corners for blocks the streets were packed with wondering thousands street traffic was impossible it was necessary to divert the cars to a roundabout route to keep the arteries open to the suburbs wild rumors spread over the city no one knew
