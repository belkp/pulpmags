off on a comet lodged the russians retaining their berths upon the yacht while the jew was permitted to pass his nights upon the hansa this arrangement how ever could be only temporary the time could not be far distant when ships sides and ordinary walls would fail to give an adequate protection from the severity of the cold that must be expected the stock of fuel was too limited to keep up a permanent supply of heat in their present quarters and conse quently they must be driven to seek some other refuge the internal temperature of which would at least be bearable the plan that seemed to commend itself most to their consideration was that they should dig out for themselves some subterraneous pits similar to silos such as are used as receptacles for grain they presumed that when the surface of gallia should be covered by a thick layer of ice which is a bad conductor of heat a sufficient amount of warmth for animal vitality might still be retained in excavations of this kind after a long consulta tion they failed to devise any better expedient and were forced to resign themselves to this species of troglodyte existence in one respect they congratulated themselves that they should be better off than many of the whalers in the polar seas for as it is impossible to get below the surface of a frozen ocean these adventurers have to seek refuge in huts of wood and snow erected on their ships which at best can give but slight protection from extreme cold but here with a solid subsoil the gallians might hope to dig down a hundred feet or so and secure for themselves a shelter that would enable them to brave the hardest severity of climate the order then was at once given the work was commenced a stock of shovels mattocks and pick axes was brought from the gourbi and with ben zoof as overseer both spanish majos and russian sailors set to work with a will it was not long however before a discovery more unexpected than agreeable suddenly arrested their labors the spot chosen for the excavation was a little to the right of the gourbi on a slight eleva tion of the soil for the first day everything went on prosperously enough but at a depth of eight feet below the surface the navvies came in contact with a hard surface upon which all their tools failed to make the slightest impression servadac and the count were at once apprised of the fact and had little difficulty in recognizing the substance that had revealed itself as the very same which composed the shores as well as the subsoil of the gallian sea it evidently formed the universal substructure of the new asteroid means for hollowing it failed them utterly harder and more resisting than granite it could not be blasted by ordinary powder dyna mite alone could suffice to rend it the disappointment was very great unless some means of protection were speedily devised death seemed to be staring them in the face were the figures in the mysterious documents correct if so gallia must now be a hundred millions of leagues from the sun nearly three times the distance of the earth at the remotest section of her orbit the intensity of the solar light and heat too was very seriously diminishing although gourbi island be ing on the equator of an orb which had its axis always perpendicular to the plane in which it re volved enjoyed a position that gave it a permanent summer but no advantage of this kind could com pensate for the remoteness of the sun the tem perature fell steadily already to the discomfiture of the little italian girl nurtured in sunshine ice was beginning to form in the crevices of the rocks and manifestly the time was impending when the sea itself would freeze some shelter must be found before the tempera ture should fall to 째 below zero otherwise death was inevitable hitherto for the last few days the thermometer had been registering an average of about 째 below zero and it had become matter of experience that the stove although replenished with all the wood that was available was altogether in adequate to effect any sensible mitigation of the severity of the cold nor could any amount of fuel be enough it was certain that ere long the very mercury and spirit in the thermometers would be congealed some other resort must assuredly be soon found or they must perish that was clear the idea of betaking themselves to the dobryna and hansa could not for a moment be seriously en tertained not only did the structure of the vessels make them utterly insufficient to give substantial sheltex but they were totally unfitted to be trusted as to their stability when exposed to the enormous pressure of the accummulated ice neither sexvadac nor the count nor lieutenant procope were men to be easily dislxeartened but it could not be concealed that they felt themselves in circumstances by which they were equally harassed and perplexed the sole expedient that their united counsel could suggest was to obtain a xefuge below ground and that was denied them by the strange and impenetrable substratum of the soil yet hour by hour the suns disc was lessening in its dimen sions and although at midday some faint radiance and glow were to be distinguished during the night the painfulness of the cold was becoming almost intolerable mounted upon zephyr and galette the captain and the count scoured the island in search of some available retreat scarcely a yard of ground was left unexplored the horses clearing every obstacle as if they were like pegasus furnished with wings but all in vain soundings wexe made again and again but invariably with the same result the rock hard as adamant never failed to reveal itself within a few feet of the surface of the ground the excavation of any silo being thus manifestly hopeless there seemed nothing to be done except to try and render the buildings alongside the gourbi impervious to frost to contribute to the supply of fuel orders were given to collect every scrap of wood dry or green that the island produced and this involved the necessity of felling the numerous trees that were scattered over the plain but toil as they might at the accumulation of firewood cap tain servadac and his companions could not resist the conviction that the consumption of a very short period would exhaust the total stock and what would happen then studious if possible to conceal his real misgiv ings and anxious that the rest of the party should be affected as little as might be by his own un easiness servadac would wander alone about the island racking his brain for an idea that
