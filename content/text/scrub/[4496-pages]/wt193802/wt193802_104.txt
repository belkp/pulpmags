from beyond can see that and many other invisible things now listen to me the waves from that thing are waking a thousand sleeping senses in us senses which we inherit from eons of evolution from the state of de tached electrons to the state of organic humanity i have seen truth and i in tend to show it to you do you wonder how it will seem i will tell you here tillinghast seated himself direct ly opposite me blowing out his candle and staring hideously into my eyes your existing senseorgansears first i thinkwill pick up many of the im pressions for they are closely connected with the dormant organs then there will be others you have heard of the pineal gland i laugh at the shallow en docrinologist fellowdupe and fellow parvenu of the freudian that gland is the great sense organ of organsi have found out it is like sight in the end and transmits visual pictures to the brain if you are normal that is the way you ought to get most of it i mean get most of the evidence from beyond i looked about the immense attic room with the sloping south wall dimly lit by rays which the everyday eye cannot see the far corners were all shadows and the whole place took on a hazy unreality which obscured its nature and invited the imagination to symbolism and phantasm during the interval that tillinghast was silent i fancied myself in some vast and incredible temple of longdead gods some vague edifice of innumerable black stone columns reaching up from a floor of damp slabs to a cloudy height beyond the range of my vision the picture was very vivid for a while but gradually gave way to a more horrible conception that of utter absolute soli tude in infinite sightless soundless space there seemed to be a void and nothing more and i felt a childish fear which prompted me to draw from my hip pocket the revolver i always carried after dark since the night i was held up in east providence then from the farther most regions of remoteness the sound softly glided into existence it was in finitely faint subtly vibrant and unmis takably musical but held a quality of sur passing wildness which made its impact feel like a delicate torture of my whole body i felt sensations like those one feels when accidentally scratching ground glass simultaneously there developed something like a cold draft which ap parently swept past me from the direction of the distant sound as i waited breath lessly i perceived that both sound and wind were increasing the effect being to give me an odd notion of myself as tied to a pair of rails in the path of a gigantic approaching locomotive i began to speak to tillinghast and as i did so all the unusual impressions ab ruptly vanished i saw only the man the glowing machine and the dim apartment tillinghast was grinning repulsively at the revolver which i had almost uncon sciously drawn but from his expression i was sure he had seen and heard as much as i if not a great deal more i whis pered what i had experienced and he bade me remain as quiet and receptive as possible dont move he cautioned for in these rays we are able to be seen as well as to see i told you the servants left but i didnt tell you how it was that thick witted housekeeperwho turned on the lights downstairs after i had warned her not to and the wires picked up sympa thetic vibrations it must have been frightfuli could hear the screams up here in spite of all i was seeing and hear ing from another direction and later it was rather awful to find those empty heaps
