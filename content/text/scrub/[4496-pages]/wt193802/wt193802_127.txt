 weird tales impressive illustrations j vernon shea jr writes from pitts burgh the most impressive thing about the december issue is the virgil finiay illus trations the one for the black stone statue is one of his best an especially shuddery thing and i applaud his new series of illus trations from famous poems which answers my request for illustrations outside the mag azine proper of the stories i liked best mary elizabeth counselmans the black stone statue although it left open a number of questions how did the thing eat if every thing it touched midaslike turned to stone how did it mate i was very glad to see donald wandrei appear once more with his genuinely eery uneasy lie the drowned and hope he will be represented soon again the recent experiments in extrasensory percep tion conducted at duke university lent espe cial interest to claude farrăres odd little story edmond hamilton departed for once from his formula and child of atlantis is one of his best stories incredible professor t o mabbott writes from new york city decembera grand issue the seawitch best polatis notable and the keen eyes of kara kăšdi a real masterpiece seabury quinn is a master of technique but the flames was not up to his standard as i found the natural part of the story too hard to believe my passion in a weird tale is credibility when one is reading it there are things that are purely supernatural and must be taken as such there are other things that are physically possible but unlikely to happen and there is a third kind of impossi bility where dimension enters in the last two are dangerous as they arouse an unbe lieving mood and so put one out of the ac ceptance of the frankly supernatural so i wished the curtain had only been put back yearly in the black pharaoh because a foot a day for some thousand years is too many miles to walk in an evening the priest could have called the last night of the year or the day for moving been fixed by the stars but the black pharaoh is a fine tale child of atlantis and the black stone statue however are completely worked out nothing incredi ble in the wrong way the same is true of laocoon one word of defense for the in credulous attitude of doctor trowbridge it is a convention for the narrator to be a per son to whom things must be explained as they have to be told to the reader in a series it tires the old reader but a writer has to keep his work intelligible to the reader who begins in the middle of a series suters end ing to the abyss also seemed to me justified for even if it did not involve really super natural things it did take us into the world of the halfconscious and delirious mind which is the first step into the weird as telepathy is the second though neither is magic or ghostly trudy gertrude hemken writes from chicago wow wotta nude by finlay honestly she looks almost real ceptin her nose ends almost too sharply coming along with fin lay im sure it will be interesting to see his fullpage picturesparticularly poes raven and the skeleton in armor which poem ranks among my favorites may i suggest one of my other favoriteswhich i have mentioned in a previous letter goethes erlking or is he too vague a character the seawitch is as strange and romantic as the authors name never have i read a tale so pleasingsomehow this heldra helstrom calls to mind that lovely tale of fouquăš and its heroine undine water peoplenorse legendsits all so fascinating and seems so true just as a dream seems true to the dreamer its a story to be remembered a long long time and i will keep it in my minds library along with sagas myths leg ends and folklore this is the top story in the december issue and ranks above the others from many issues back robert bloch really has something there with his black pharaohs prophecycan it be that any one man can foresee what is to come for thou sands upon thousands of years its a ques tion for meditation the black stone statue had a medusa tinge to it although so very different i rather liked it second best yarn was quinns flames of vengeance somehow the author seemed to deviate from the stilted pattern into which he was fall ingand i am glad of it this differed from narsry ghosts and sperritsthis was hindoo magicabout which there is such a mystery and which seems to remain unex plained through the ages well mr hamil ton although i dont like robots and superior intelligences if such word there be child of atlantis proved interesting
