 weird tales retreat if i would since an unknown force plainly urges me on i have discovered one more obstacle since the locked cellar vault must be traversed the key to that place must be found the lock is far too strong for forcing that the key is somewhere here abouts cannot be doubted but the time before the sabbat is very short i must search diligently and thoroughly it will take courage to unlock that iron door for what prisoned horrors may not lurk within later i have been shunning the cellar for the past day or two but late this afternoon i again descended to those forbidding precincts at first all was silent but within five minutes the menacing padding and mut tering began once more beyond the iron door this time it was louder and more terrifying than on any previous occasion and i likewise recognized the slithering that bespoke some monstrous seabeast now swifter and nervously intensified as if the thing were striving to force its way through the portal to where i stood as the pacing grew louder more restless and more sinister there began to pound through it those hellish and unidentifi able reverberations which i had heard on my second visit to the cellarthose muf fled reverberations which seemed to echo from far horizons like distant thunder now however their volume was magni fied an hundredfold and their timbre freighted with new and terrifying impli cations i can compare the sound to noth ing more aptly than to the roar of some dread monster of the vanished saurian age when primal horrors roamed the earth and valusias serpentmen laid the foundationstones of evil magic to such a roarbut swelled to deafening heights readied by no known organic throat was this shocking sound akin dare i unlock the door and face the onslaught of what lies beyond april the key to the vault is found i came upon it this noon in the little locked room buried beneath rubbish in a drawer of the ancient desk as if some belated effort to conceal it had been made it was wrapped in a crumbling newspaper dated october but there was an inner wrapping of dried skinevidently the hide of some unknown reptilewhich bore a low latin message in the same crabbed writing as that of the notebooks i found as i had thought the lock and key were vastly older than the vault old claes van der heyl had had them ready for something he or his descendants meant to doand how much older than he they were i could not estimate de ciphering the latin message i trembled in a fresh access of clutching terror and nameless awe the secrets of the monstrous primal ones ran the crabbed text whose cryp tic words relate the hidden things that were before man the things no one of earth should learn lest peace be for ever forfeited shall by me never suffer revela tion to yianho that lost and forbid den city of countless eons whose place may not be told i have been in the veri table flesh of this body as none other among the living has been therein have i found and thence have i borne away that knowledge which i would gladly lose though i may not i have learnt to bridge a gap that should not be bridged and must call out of the earth that which should not be waked nor called and what is sent to follow me will not sleep till i or those after me have found and done what is to be found and done
