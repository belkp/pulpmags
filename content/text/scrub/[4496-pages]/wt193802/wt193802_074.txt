the strangling hands with an expression in which relief and fear struggled almost comically for su premacy either hes a damned good actor tony or else he drank too much last night but henderson fumbling with the combination to the safe did not hear me presently he closed the safes door and turned around with a small jewelry box which he handed me opened the stone itself was a misty blue green something like the powdered opaqueness of costume jewelry about half an inch in diam eter and not quite a perfect circle it was as insignificant an object as one could find it seems innocent enough i said judicially returning the box it looked more promising when i saw it on the statue without answering henderson led me into a small study that opened off from his bedroom shutting the door behind him sit down there he pointed to a chair by the center table he took the stone from its cotton bed and laid it on the empty table at my elbow now watch it he turned off the center light from the switch by the door i waited in the blackness of the curtained room for per haps thirty seconds then quite suddenly a little blur of light appeared where tony had laid the stone it was only a misty blur at first a fuzzy mistiness that seemed to waver in its own halflight the colors blue and green came out as i watched but instead of defining the stone they served rather to increase its indefi niteness the light itself was larger than the stone but was a part of it as though the darkness drew from the stone an in ner glow no wonder those childlike jungle creatures had taken it for the eye of their god of death interested mac he asked then picking up the stone and replacing it in the cottonlined box strange rather isnt it for a minute there in the dark i had felt that same awed wonder but now i shook it off as absurd no as a mater of fact it isnt strange any geologist could explain that light for you yes but no geologist could explain the hands a glass of whisky may have been the answer to those is that a hint mac no thanks and youre not to drink any either well dispel this ghost the ory tonight i drank nothing last night he said really indeed he left the room for a minute and came back with an armful of magazines and newspapers try some of these theyll interest you more than i will without denying that likelihood i opened a weekly and was soon feigning deep absorption in an article on salmon fishing but my thoughts were for ever straying to the figure opposite me his pipe in his hand he had not once put it to his lips but sat with it clenched be tween his fingers until the white knuckles stood out his underlip drawn between his teeth seemed strangely red against the grayness of his face i kept quiet as long as i could then laid down the article as though i had finished and enjoyed it you ought to take up salmon fishing tony its as interesting and much more profitable than ghoststalking he turned with a start as though just wakened from a sound sleep salmon what mac do you remember how milroys little dog howled when that
