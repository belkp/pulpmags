 weird tales hours that machine near the table will generate waves acting on unrecognized senseorgans that exist in us as atrophied or rudimentary vestiges those waves will open up to us many vistas unknown to man and several unknown to anything we consider organic life we shall see that at which dogs howl in the dark and that at which cats prick up their ears after midnight we shall see these things and other things which no breathing creature has yet seen we shall overleap time space and dimensions and without bodily motion peer to the bottom of creation when tillinghast said these things i remonstrated for i knew him well enough to be frightened rather than amused but he was a fanatic and drove me from the house now he was no less a fanatic but his desire to speak had con quered his resentment and he had writ ten me imperatively in a hand i could scarcely recognize as i entered the abode of the friend so suddenly meta morphosed to a shivering gargoyle i be came infected with the terror which seemed stalking in all the shadows the words and beliefs expressed ten weeks before seemed bodied forth in the dark ness beyond the small circle of candle light and i sickened at the hollow al tered voice of my host i wished the servants were about and did not like it when he said they had all left three days previously it seemed strange that old gregory at least should desert his mas ter without telling as tried a friend as i it was he who had given me all the in formation i had of tillinghast after i was repulsed in rage yet i soon subordinated all my fears to my growing curiosity and fascination just what crawford tillinghast now wished of me i could only guess but that he had some stupendous secret or discovery to impart i could not doubt before i had protested at his unnatural pryings into the unthinkable now that he had evidently succeeded to some de gree i almost shared his spirit terrible though the cost of victory appeared up through the dark emptiness of the house i followed the bobbing candle in the hand of this shaking parody on man the electricity seemed to be turned off and when i asked my guide he said it was for a definite reason it would be too much i would not dare he continued to mutter i especially noted his new habit of mutter ing for it was not like him to talk to himself we entered the laboratory in the attic and i observed that detestable electrical machine glowing with a sickly sinister violet luminosity it was connected with a powerful chemical battery but seemed to be receiving no current for i recalled that in its experimental stage it had sput tered and purred when in action in re ply to my question tillinghast mumbled that this permanent glow was not elec trical in any sense that i could under stand he now seated me near the machine so that it was on my right and turned a switch somewhere below the crowning duster of glass bulbs the usual sputter ing began turned to a whine and ter minated in a drone so soft as to suggest a return to silence meanwhile the lumi nosity increased waned again then as sumed a pale outrăš color or blend of colors which i could neither place nor describe tillinghast had been watching me and noted my puzzled expression do you know what that is he whis pered that is ultraviolet he chuckled oddly at my surprize you thought ultra violet was invisible and so it isbut you
