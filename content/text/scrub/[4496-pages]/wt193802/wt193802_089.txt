 weird tales myself think of shakespeares philosophy anent the candle and the good deed in a naughty world then philosophy and shakespeare flew from my mind for i saw beneath the bushes the feet ofof what stood behind them they were two in number those feet but not even at first glimpse did i think they were human i had an impression of round pedestals and calfless shanks dark and hairy they moved as i looked moved cautiously closer as if their owner was equally anxious to see me i dropped the match into the stream and sprang up and back no pursuer from the town would have feet like that my heart began to pound as it had never pounded during my race for life i clutched at the low limb of a tree hoping to tear it loose for a possible weapon of defense the wood was rotten and almost crumpled in my grasp whos there i challenged but most unsteadily and without much menace in my voice for answer the bushes rustled yet again and something blacker than they showed itself among them i cannot be ashamed to say that i re treated again farther this time let him who has had a like experience decide whether to blame me feeling my way among the trees i put several stout stems between me and that lurker by the water side they would not fence it off but might baffle it for a moment mean while i heard the water splash it was wading cautiously throughit was going to follow me i found myself standing in a sort of lane and did not bother until later to wonder how a lane could exist in that grove where no man ever walked it was a welcome avenue of flight to me and i went along it at a swift crouching run the footing as everywhere was damp and mossy and i made very little noise not so my unchancy companion of the brook for i heard a heavy body crashing among twigs and branches to one side i began to ask myself as i hurried what the beast could befor i was sure that it was a beast a dog from some farm house that did not know or understand the law against entering the devils croft that i had seen only two feet did not preclude two more i now assured myself and i would have welcomed a big friendly dog yet i did not know that this one was friendly and could not bid myself to stop and see the lane wound suddenly to the right and then into a clearing here too the branches overhead kept out the snow and the light but things were visible ever so slightly i stood as if in a room earthfloored trunkwalled leafthatched and i paused for a breath it was more damply warm than ever with that breath came some strange new serenity of spirit even an amused self mockery what had i seen and heard indeed i had come into the grove after a terrific hour or so of danger and exer tion and my mind had at once busied itself in building grotesque dangers where no dangers could be have another smoke i said to myself and get hold of your imagination already that pursuit noise you fancied has gone alone in the clearing and the dark i smiled as though to mock myself back into selfconfidence even this little patch of summer night into which i had blundered from the heart of the blizzardeven it had some good and probably simple explanation i fished out a cigarette and struck a light at that moment i was facing the bosky tunnel from which i had emerged into the open space my matchlight struck two sparks in that tunnel two sparks that were pushing stealthily toward me eyes of fire cigarette and match fell from my
