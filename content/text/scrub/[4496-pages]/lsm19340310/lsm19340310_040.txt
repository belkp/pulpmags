going primitive dared not drink too much and the icy water went down only a few sips at a time after that they walked around to keep warm they dared not use any more of their pitifully small supply of wood for fear they might be there another night or might get fish which would need to be cooked martin walked to the edge of the flow and called into the mist again and again but there was no answer so finally he gave it up he went back to the shack then and finished the rest of the liquor in the bottle when dell entered the shack a while later he was drunk and again tried to kiss her she eluded him easily and went outside tommy had rigged lines through four holes in the ice but he was having no luck the flow had long since left the shallow water of the reef and there were few smelt in the deeper places besides that his sinkers werent heavy enough to cut down the angle of his lines the fog held and they heard or saw no one tommy remained cheerful in spite of everything he and dell walked around to keep warm but they only partially succeeded the fog pressed in upon them making everything weird and unreal the dampness of it accentuated the cold and chilled them to the very bone ugh tommy said disgustedly its like walking around in a dish of oatmeal you can pretty near feel it ill bet our folks are plenty worried right now especially yours mine never know what fool thing ill be doing next several times they heard air planes but they were on the direct new yorkmontreal route so that such a circumstance would not have been strange whether there were searchers out or not lse martin had produced another bottle from his pocket which tommy stole during the afternoon and threw away dell did not begin to mind the cold or the hunger very much till nightfall then it was very bad they sat huddled up in the shanty and in spite of tommys studied attempts at cheerfulness the time dragged and there were long periods of silence the grim reality of the situation had taken hold of them all dell had never been so cold be fore in her life it was a cumulative cold it hadnt seemed bad at first but there was no relief from it and there was no food to make body heat she was miserable from the gnawing hunger which gave her no rest and the cold found her weakened unable to combat it martins attitude did not help when he talked he told them over and over that no help would come that they would die out there he cried in drunken maudlin despair dell knew that if there had been no tommy to counteract that un healthy attitude she would have gone mad as it was she wanted to cry or to laugh recklessly some times she could hardly keep herself from doing one or the other if only either the hunger or the cold would let up for just one minute she kept dwelling morbidly on that if it would only let up for just one minute she thought she could go back to it cheerfully but it never did the hunger grew worse and the cold more intense with the darkness for several seconds she was aware that tommy was watching her in tently suddenly he rose and took her hand come on he said were going to run youre close to hysterics
