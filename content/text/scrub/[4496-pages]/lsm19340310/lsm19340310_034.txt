going primitive vacation was always one of these extra waitresses the work in the morning was con tinuous beginning with the early risers who were going out onto the lake to the fish shanties late breakfasts overlapped early lunch eons so that not till the middle of the afternoon did the girls get time off the servants entered the inn through a door in the lattice work under the vast high veranda and passed on through another door into the basement at three oclock dell stood just inside the lattice door putting on her gloves and buttoning her coat against the bitter cold outside when she heard voices from the pathway she could see martin with two of his friends and she did not go out at once because she was afraid that she would not be able to greet him without embarrassment she realized instinctively that from out side in the bright sunshine he would not be able to penetrate the murk behind the latticework though she could see him perfectly she did not mean to listen but she could hardly help herself i was out last night with that swelllooking blond who waits on my table she heard martin say and what a girl stunned she stood there strain ing to hear every word i suppose you tried the old line on her the one my wife says you tried on her im not going to kiss you because i care too much about what you think of me martin grinned goodhumoredly well he replied youve got to admit that its different from most lines and that it usually works even if it didnt on your darling oh ill admit it works the other man said grudgingly you could make most any of em believe you were telling the truth well are you going to marry the girl dont be silly mac when i marry anybody it wont be a girl i can kiss the first time i go out with her youre like all the great lovers the other man grew sarcastic youve had it so easy youre scared of your competitors you ve only they drifted on out of earshot leaving dell standing rigid her face white her eyes cold and staring dell did not cry she was so angry at first that she could not think clearly when the anger died down a little and she was able for a minute to stop hating martin her ideas gradually changed he was still just as good a prize as he had been before common sense told her that she had had her chance to win him and she had flubbed it he had been testing her out and she had kissed him against her better judgment because she had supposed it was what she must do to please him now the point to be decided by cold analytical reasoning was whether or not she still wanted him she decided that she did and now she had the upper hand be cause she knew how she stood with him and he didnt know that she knew in the three remaining days of his stay at the inn she might be able to do a great deal if she tried hard enough if she didnt win him she would at least have had a good time the next morning dell met tommy he had lines pails wood cooking utensils and food loaded on a sled im going to take my shanty out over the reef and fish for a couple of days he told her better skate
