reckless bride came along oh don how did you ever happen to find me i stared up at him breathlessly he laughed grimly i was hunt ing you darling ive been doing little else the last three weeks i was in torture not knowing what oliver had done with you but i couldnt find the least trace of you ive been back to the inn at least twenty times but the manager swore he hadnt seen either of you since you left that night the last few days ive had to be in washington getting final instructions before sail ing and i just got back this morn ing i stopped at home long enough to learn if there had been any word from you then idrove up here again i was determined to find you before i sailed i went to the inn once again but i got the same an swer as before i knew betty longs camp was closed but i wasnt leaving any stone unturned to find you i was on my way there when i saw you run across the road i couldnt believe it was you but i had to make sure im sorry if i scared you half to death dear he strained me convulsively against him pressing his lips tenderly over my face i thought you were the police i murmured shuddering he gave a start his mouth tight ening say thats right theres no telling how soon theyll be after you but this time they re not go ing to find you there was a ring of triumph in his deep voice as he picked me up in his arms and strode through the bushes and up the bank his big roadster was standing in the road and the familiar sight of it was a quick thrill nothing could overtake us now my blood sang in my veins as he lifted me in then quickly leaped in beside me with a quick twist of his strong brown hands on the wheel he whirled the car around and sent it speeding down the pike the way he had come with a sigh of content i lay back in the deep seat limp half be wildered with the wonderful reality of his nearness after the terrific anx iety of trying to reach him yet in side i was still tense with apprehen sion that lay like a cold shadow on my heart suppose i would only be the means of bringing him trouble that would ruin his career oh don where can you hide me so oliver wont find me i asked breathlessly against the stiff breeze of our rushing thats something ill have to fig ure out by the time we reach new york he said thoughtfully but dont you worry about that dear you just leave everything to your husband with a confident little laugh he cuddled me close against him with one warm arm so that i couldnt see anything but the wall of his big shoulders and the profile of his face above the wheel a thrill of hot uprushing joy swept everything else from my mind it was just as it had been the night of our elopement only now every thing every moment was more precious for the weeks of separation that had gone between the com plete wonder of our love would only be the more poignant the more overwhelmingly sweet for the anguish of our waiting dusk had deepened into night be fore we finally reached new york as we drove through the brightly lighted streets my heart was beating a wild tattoo of mounting excite ment yet each time we had to stop for traffic i went weak with ter ror every pedestrian that glanced at us in casual interest every face
