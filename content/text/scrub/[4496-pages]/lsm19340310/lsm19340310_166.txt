the friend in need about their crudeness and inability to appreciate the finer qualities in a girl be proud of your high ideals and dont try to conceal them whether some of the boys you meet believe in them or not the socalled friendships or popu larity with boys who expect every girl to slide down to any level they suggest arent worth a thought one of these days the right man will come along and then you will be ever so glad that you have kept your ideals and didnt change your ideas about how boys and girls should be have dear mrs brown i am twenty years old and my fiance is twentythree we have been engaged a little over one year and it has been the most miserable year of my whole life because walters jealousy has made me terribly unhappy i have been absolutely true to him and i love him dearly but honestly mrs brown he is killing my love he doesnt trust me out of his sight and if i as much as leave the house for a minute when he isnt with me its just plain war he can think up more things that i might have done than i could ever have time to do he expects me to come straight home from work and stay in unless he takes me out i cant even speak to some of my old friends if i happen to meet them on the street if we go to a show and i see some one i know and smile in greeting hes angry for the rest of the evening and sulks like a baby but he can give every pretty girl the most searching look and i mustnt mind ive tried to talk and argue about his jealousy but it has no weight with him at all its getting so i cant stand it and i would break the engagement tomorrow even though i know i would never be happy without him or love another as dearly but i know that he would be heart broken too we have stopped going to parties and to some of my girl friends homes because of his insane jealousy why cant he see that he is simply killing my affection for him mitzie i dont want to sound pessimistic but more often than not its a most difficult job trying to cure a man of his jealousy and you have all my sympathy mitzie when a man is as jealous as your fiance it shows that he is afraid some other man may come along and that you may fall in love with him psychologists have explained that jealousy is a feeling of inferiority which arises from the idea that the sufferer is not as good as the next person and that he is being looked down on this of course is silly and childish i suggest that the very first time you find your friend in good humor you try to talk this over with him tell him in a friendly but frank and definite way that you do love him but if he insists on continuing to express such groundless jealous spasms and accusations he is bound to kill your affection and respect try to make him understand that unless he treats you with the trust and respect due you you cant pos sibly go on loving him if you two succeed in reaching an understand ing im sure youll both be much happier he should try to realize that even if you are engaged to him you cant expect to stop being hu man and avoid all your friends thats unnatural and certainly un reasonable to keep happy and in terested we should have friendly contacts with others and if the worst comes to worst which i hope it doesnt and he still refuses to see your viewpoint then maybe it would be better to call it quits until he finds his way to better understanding dear mrs brown my family life was never a happy one there was always a fight going on in the family and i could never go out without getting bawled out when i returned bringing friends home was out of the question the house was always messed up and things were never in order if i
