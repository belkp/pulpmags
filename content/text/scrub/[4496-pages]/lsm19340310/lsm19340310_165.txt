 street amp smiths love story magazine i hope you will try to do all you can and i wish you joy and happiness irene thank you so much for your let ter irene and i hope that perplexed will not miss it im sure it will help her to buck up and feel less hopeless sometimes it seems very hard to make plans for the future when there are so many obstacles but we never know what we can do until we try good luck irene dear mrs brown i am a girl eight een years old smoke and drink a little but outside of these two habits i am a respectable girl the boys who date me never attempt any tricks last winter i met al he is thirty years old is a successful business man and is welltodo financially he tells me he loves me and wants me to marry him but im very undecided early this past summer i met charlie and since then i have been dating both boys the last time i went out with char lie he also asked me to marry him he is twentythree years old and has a fairly good business of his own but i cant seem to make up my mind mrs brown which boy to accept al and i often quarrel though we make up easily enough charlie and i get along fine and seldom disagree im in love with both and feel i could be happy with either one however one thing that bothers me is that when i want to go some place al always complains that hes tired and this usually starts a quarrel some of my friends have told me that before al went with me he used to come to their parties and stay until all hours of the morning but when hes with me hes always tired and wants to go home early wont you please help me decide which one to accept i feel al is a little too selfish divided love als excuse does seem to have the earmarks of a selfish attitude a man cant be tired all the time but before you go on worrying about either man has it occurred to you that when a girl feels she can be happy with one or the other of her suitors she is not in love with either a girl can be fond of two boys but when it comes to marriage it would not be possible for her to have ex actly the same feeling toward both young men if you were really in love child your heart would do your choosing for you and there would be no guessing as to which man is the right one i doubt if youre in love at all and you shouldnt feel that you must accept one or the other as long as you remain undecided chances are that you are only inter ested in them in a friendly fashion and i suggest that you continue on that basis with them and have other boy friends too a girl never loses out by waiting until she is sure its love on both sides dear mrs brown can a girl be too decent this has been my problem for some time i want to explain my situa tion and hope you can help me i am a girl of eighteen i have a lovely home and the nicest parents any girl could wish for but it seems that i am not able to get a boy friend like other girls every one tells me i am very good looking and i am considered one of the bestdressed girls in town i havent any physical defects and im not a bit con ceited or snooty i dont smoke or drink and i simply refuse to neck or pet no matter who the boy is i never let him kiss me the first time he takes me out and most of the boys seldom come back the second time i guess im just a flat tire if you were me would you let down the ideals you had mrs brown it seems that only then can a girl have some boy friends for the boys wont date a girl if shes straight and refuses to be mauled over ive almost given up hope that i will ever meet a boy who will appreciate a re spectable girl and admire me for myself am i too goodygoody i belong to several clubs and have trav eled a little more than most girls but everywhere i go the boys are all the same still hoping stop worrying about whether a girl can be too respectable i think its the boys who ought to worry
