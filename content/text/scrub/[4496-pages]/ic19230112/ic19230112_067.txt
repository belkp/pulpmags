 the love that kills but i went on with my feverish fan tasiesworking myself into a frenzy i know now that i should have been a nurse instead of a girl young and so lacking in understanding the woman a physician should marry is a nurse for she is the only one who can fully realize his work who can help him in it instead of hindering for she understands but i i could notthough in my saner moments i tried to reason with myself believe that his visits and the neces sary time spent in his office with women patients could be impersonal it seemed to me only an avenue of temp tation bringing all sorts of suggestion and evil when he would hire a nurse from a neighboring city i would watch to catch a glimpse of her secretly happy if she were unattractive but my misery was fed to untoward proportions if she were at all goodlooking and always i suffered more than i can tell my husbands practice was very heavy sometimes he scarcely took time to eat and i never knew when he would be with me and so i hated his work when he came home from a twelve or fifteenmile trip on some case to which he had been called in the night i was waiting for him to upbraid him ac cuse him endlessly heap suspicions upon him sometimes for hours i would make him sit and listen to me even though i knew that he was almost breaking down under the strain of his work and tortured nerves i would keep on and on through all my words he would say nothing only listen miserably or try wearily to pacify me to explain he was kind and patient always but i would not listenuntil ex hausted myself and satisfied i would stop and let him go to sleep all this sounds as though i were without mercy or human kindness but that is not so i was considerate a devoted friend to everyone outside my home in it i was another person and i became that against my will i did not want to nag to hurt but i could not stop i had to go onal though i suffered too more perhaps than he no one who did as i did can help suffering when she sees that she is plunging toward the abyss that will bury her own happiness that she must stop before she is carried over the precipice during all those scenes i knew that i was unjust that my husband was in nocent of any wrong but the jealousy that consumed me seemed like a fever that had to take its course go on until something in me stopped eased satis fied after two years of this i saw my husband happy again a child was coming to us and he was glad he had always wanted children but i saw in his new tenderness towardme only another indignity his love was not really for mebut for the child that was to be i reproachcd him for that pushed him away in hysterical frenzy when he tried to comfort me and when i saw that i could not make him as unhappy as i wished i was furious when the baby came our scenes be gan again it seemed now that the baby whom i loved had come between us if my husband came into the room and glanced first toward the child i would accuse him of caring more for it than he did for me
