thrills thirty years ago spicuous positionkate kenton all dressed up to meet her city beau my heart beat as though it would burst through the boned blouse as i saw him walk across the gangplank there were the golden burnsides the handsome profile i had admired so ardently in chapel he seemed slim and superior to the surrounding rustics how aristocratic he was i gloated on every detail of his fashionable grace small black hat graystriped suit with its tight coat and trousers gold watch fob yellow chamois vest how i managed the introduction i dont know i was blushing furiously that is one trick this generation seems to have lostor perhaps the blush can not penetrate rouge alfred took dixies reins that wily horse realizing that the driving was in a strangers hands and one unskilled in the ways of equines took the oppor tunity to amble lazily along plucking at stray wisps of clover beside the road i was too much in awe of alfred to offer any suggestions about whipping dixie up so we moved along at a snails pace i knew that father and sam who had tactfully taken the longer road would reach home an hour before us alfred seemed perfectly at ease he smiled upon me complacently and talked a great dealall about himself he was going to be general manager of a wholesale woolen house in st louis he had belonged to five clubs at fair field i worshiped and smiled my best al luring smile i called it sparkingmy sideway glances and little smiles to day they call it vamping it had results then as now dixie meandering up the hill paused restfully in the shade of a tree alfreds arm slid about my waist and his golden burn sides tickled my cheek as he bent to ward me one kiss he whispered mark the difference between my daughter and me i was fright ened a kiss was a tremendously im portant thing to methe seal of an en gagement never to be lightly squand ered besides men didnt admire girls who gave kisses easily so much as i worshiped alfred i protested nervously you mustnt do that im not that kind of girl not thatwhat in the name of jehoshaphat did you write to me and ask me down here for then he inquired candidly i was horrified and yet i had to ad mit that alfred was justified in his opin ion since i had been so bold another fearit would be terrible to quarrel with my vaunted city beau even before we reached home i thought we could be friends i murmured ill be bumswizzled said alfred you fixed up that letter just to get ac quainted and now youre as cool as an old hen in a snowstorm i did not know what to say to that apparently he took heart from my si lence for this time he tightened his embrace and tried to snatch the kiss i slapped him sharply and then re coiled in terror at my deed he would be angry and leave and i would be dis graced i was unhappily conscious that we were in plain view of a nearby farm house i waited for alfred to descend from that buggy and start walking back to ward town i anticipated the jokes i would have to endure from my brothers instead he laughed a short ugly laugh that said plainly ill get even
