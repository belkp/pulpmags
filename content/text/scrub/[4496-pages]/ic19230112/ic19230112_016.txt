big and brave as a herring a girl stowaways daring on the high seas a feighter on a long voyage is no place for a woman said the ships captain to his tearful bridetobe at parting but she disguised as a boy stowaway followedand learned the truth of those words i was to be married on the fifteenth of june that year and there never was a girl who looked forward to her wedding day with happier anticipa tion than i gordon perry was a seafaring man and at the age of twentyfive already captain of a three hundred ton brig the mary culver he was enjoying several weeks shore leave while the mary culver was put up for repairs so quite naturally we had selected this as the time for our wedding i was all aflutter over the prepara tions imagine then my dismay when on the seventh gordon was summoned to take immediate charge of another ship bound for havana and due to sail at dawn the next day rather than be married in haste i postponed the wedding but i was dreadfully disappointed it was so bitterly hard to be separated from gordon just then all at once it came to me that if i were to accompany him on the trip there need be no parting but he said decidedly that this was not to be thought ofa freighter on a long voyage was no place for a woman but being young and wilful and fearlessvery much in love too i did not give proper heed to his words i didnt go to sleep at all that night instead i lay across my bed chin propped upon both hands trying to form some plan by which i might out wit gordon and sail to havana with him in spite of his qualms finally an idea came to me which made my cheeks burn with excitement when everyone else in the house was asleep i stole softly up to the attic and there bv the light of a lamp searched until i found the garments which suited my purpose back in my room once more i slipped them on from shoes to jacket i would easily have passed for my own brother but abovethere were the heavy braids of hair wound about my head in a fever of haste i hacked at the long locks until only a shaggy thatch like a boys remained a few streaks of lampblack upon cheek and chin and i felt my disguise complete long before dawn i crept out of the house and in the guise of a ragged boy was picking my way toward the london docks
