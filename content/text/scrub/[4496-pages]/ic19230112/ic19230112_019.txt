 big and brave as a herring loony as a fool poor little devil spoke one out of the group a pale thin chested young fellow with a deep scar across his cheek the big man put me down with a brief shake come on now speak out have you got business with the capn i have and before i could so much as draw breath again i was being bundled un ceremoniously up the companion with the whole pack at my heels on deck all was activity a thickset man with a shock of untidy hair was thundering orders to some hands aft of the galley my big protector spoke up capn heres a young mischief maker as wants words with you and its loony in the head he is capn put in another the man who was addressed glared at them and the group fell back si lently then he turned to me but be fore he could speak i had lifted my chin defiantly i asked for gordon perry and no one else i said and who might he be the captain of this ship i blazed and heard a murmur behind me loony or no youll keep a civil tongue in your head you young son of a sealawyer im the master of this ship and you may lay to that a terrible fear leaped to my brain was it possible that this was not gor dons ship i could hardly find my voice isnt this the edella bound for havana i asked weaklyand felt all my courage oozing out from my finger tips as i read the answer in the mans face bound for havana right enough but this heres the edelise and its capn seeley youre answerable to and dont you forget that i didnt faint but i came near to it and i can see now how i owed even the precarious safety that followed to that deathly weakness which fell upon me for without it i would have blurted out my story in the first moment of amazement and i shudder to think of what would have lain in store for me instead when things cleared up again i found myself alone sitting flat on the deck leaning against the bul warks the men were gone about their duties and captain seeley was nowhere in sight a hammock was swung for me in the focsle that night half sick with loneliness and dismay i crept into it and by the dim wavering light of the slushlamp looked about the place on either side of me rose bunks one above the other not all of them were occupied but i made out on the upper at my right the form of the whitefaced youth with the scarred cheek whom i had noticed be fore and below him the man called cloaker for hours it seemed i lay there listening to the wash of the sea against the ships side the creaking of the sails the tramp of the watch above and all the sounds of a vessel at night that came so strangely to my ear thenthough they were to become familiar enough later on finally i did close my eyes and fall to dozing fitfully from one of these naps i was wak ened to alert consciousness by a sound it was so slight that had i been a little more instead of a little less than half
