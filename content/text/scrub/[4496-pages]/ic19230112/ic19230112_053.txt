 the price of a flophouse bunk i finally secured a position in a whole sale house in the old section of the city the concern was composed of old fashioned business men who had in herited the place from father to son they employed a large number of peo ple and did a worldwide exporting trade there was little system but common honesty seemed to prevail throughout the establishment the senior member of the firm a man nearly seventy took a liking to me and promoted me rapidly from my modest boarding house i moved to a small hotel on the west side and enjoyed the luxury of a room with bath first as an interested spectator i mingled in the night life of the city then i met people and gradually had my regular haunts and the circle of those who in my mind were enjoying life to its utmost with this came the desire for clothes and style my savings dwindled as i ordered expensive outfits and equip the dull gray of the flop ceiling slowly melts lack of funds for the first few years kept me within a limit of decency as to doing much around town but i still dreamed and went about observing and growing in determination some day to break into the giddy whirl of the night life in less than five years i was made cashier and handled vast sums of money each day the old man was getting feeble now but still came down to the office daily my salary was sixty dollars a week and i had saved considerable money ment it fed my vanity to have the girls compliment my looks and suggest a new style to me with these new friends came others and thus invitations to homes i saw the value of having church affiliations and went to the most exclusive places of worship in the city there i met more folks and received more invitations i knew to hold these friends i must return their entertainment so i moved to the majestic hotel and engaged the services of a valet to look after my things
