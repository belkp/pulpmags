the highest law i was too far gone for that and he saw how much i loved him for he put his arms around me and began to tell me he cared too he asked me to marry him and i consented knowing he was a thief i figured i would get him to reform and everything would he all right in a little while i see now how big a fool i was but i guess i was hypnotized anyway i quit my job at the store and pete took i used to get blue and pretty heart sick when i was by myself and one night when he was gone until the next morning and i didnt know whether the cops had got him for another crime i took a big drink from the bottle of whisky he always kept in the cupboard it made me sleep without the hor rible nightmares id been having it wasnt long before i was drinking it pretty often to keep from worrying they played poker while i sewed half dead for sleep me to the place where he was living on tenth avenue it wasnt so grand but it sure did look wonderful to me the landlady a big goodnatured irish woman hearing i was a bride put a vase of artificial flowers on the marble topped table and some lace tidies on the horsehair rocker and there was an old lace bedspread on the bed that made me think of mother and cry a little though i didnt let pete see me he was awfully good to me at first and i think he really loved me but i could not get anything out of him for all my coaxing him to go straight and thinking about the kind of life i was leading i didnt go to church any more for i was living with a thief not only that but pete began nagging the life out of me to help him whenever he made a haul that was how far off i was from making him want to reform if i hadnt felt i was living wrong getting my daily bread from a thief i spose i wouldnt a drunk i loved pete so much i couldnt leave him though id think about doing it and try to make up my mind to we had a lot of quarrels in those
