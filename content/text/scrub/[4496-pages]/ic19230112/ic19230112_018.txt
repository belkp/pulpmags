big and brave as a herring but for a pile of old papers and a rusty lantern it was empty and i scrambled into it crouching down upon my knees to this day i can sense the musty odor of tar and old wood just as it came to me that morning so many years ago as i lay in the ships locker i had hardly more than settled my self when i heard a great hullabaloo of shouting and laughter both from the deck and from the wharf then the grat ing of the gangplank the creaking of the hawsers and the vessel quivered be neath me we were off my plan had been to make my pres ence known only after we were well under way and this as a matter of fact was what happened but not at all in the way i intended after the sleepless night just passed it needed only the darkness of the locker and the scantiness of air which filtered through a crack in the lid to send me off to sleep almost at once i dont know how long i lay there the next thing i was conscious of was a chorus of raucous voices then a hand upon the lockers lid in another minute i was hauled out blinking and bewildered upon the floor a rougherlooking group of men than those surrounding me i never saw in my life though it may be they were not different from the common run of seamen of that day one of them grasped me by the shoul der and held me up in the streak of sunlight for the rest to view what with the lampblack with which i had be smirched my face and the added mask of dust and cobwebs from the locker i must have presented a sorry enough appearance by the lord cried the seaman who held me if it aint a stowaway bout as big and brave as a herring he be guffawed another i wrenched myself free and faced the group take me to captain perry at once i commanded but no one moved and who might he be me hearty jeered a man who wore a black patch crookedly across one eye he spoke with a peculiar drawl and his name i afterward learned was ben cloaker hes the captain of this ship i cried hotly as youll learn to your sor row if you attempt to annoy me at that the whole crowd burst into a hoarse shout of laughter and someone with rough jocularity thumped me on the back with such a blow that i stag gered and caught at the nearest bunk for support then all at once i be came both angry and frightened and as the taunting faces drew in about me i struck out wildly with both fists the next thing i knew something heavya sea bool i afterward learned came hurtling through the air i dodged it a hand shot out and caught me under the chin with a force that turned me dizzy then a strong arm lifted me clear off my feet and held me kicking and struggling out of harms way lay off there you dirty swabs roared a voice do you want to kill the lad they fell back a little some mutter ing some guffawing at the picture of a slight wriggling figure held aloft in the big mans grasp put me down i screamed im going to find captain perry this in stant
