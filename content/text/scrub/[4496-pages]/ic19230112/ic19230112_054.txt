the price of a flophouse bunk all this soon consumed my savings and fully intending to repay it from the next salary check i borrowed one hundred dollars from the cash drawer it was never missed as i had full charge of the money and did not have to give any account of details the old man or his son asked me each day how we stood in the bank how collections were and then forgot about it i did not figure i was stealing this money i even made out a charge slip row another hundred there was such a pile of bills in the drawer the five twenties did not seem to diminish it so i really felt it would not hurt much to use it awhile at intervals especially when alone at night the dread possibility of de tection would nearly overcome me and then some jaunty feeling would prevail that i was not stealing i felt sure some thing would turn up so i could pay it back i was fool enough to imagine the old and i am in my apartment and henry is carrying away my clothes of the amount but put it in my pocket instead of the drawer in my own mind i was strictly honest just tem porarily in need of funds to maintain my social position the next week i borrowed another hundred because i had been invited to attend a weekend party in the country and needed a lot of outing clothes it was at this party i met arlene drexel later i entertained her and a big crowd at the theater and had to bor man especially would be pleased to know he was my benefactor and rejoice in my social career more than glad to lend me the money if he knew of it the son i did not figure on as he was in the buying department and had very little to say around the office i was so convinced the old man would be proud of me when i finally did tell him i drewr a mental picture of him clasping my hand and with tears in his eyes begging me to consider the loan as canceled forever this is the fool way i excused my stealing
