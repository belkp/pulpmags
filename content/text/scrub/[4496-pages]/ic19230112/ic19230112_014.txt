the highest law her into their room locking the door between it was all done so quickly she hardly knew what was happening to her but pete took a bottle of whisky out of his pocket and with her struggling and trying to break away he forced a lot of it down her throat she heard voices down the hall but their owners didnt come near dizzy more than half drunk with the stuff shed been compelled to drink she had to put on her coat and hat and then the men half dragged half carried her out of the room making her walk down the corridor with petes hand over her mouth but before she reached the stairs she fainted and didnt know anything more until she woke up in the cot there beside me and now no one would believe her story or even listen to her for that matter i did a lot of thinking after she stopped speaking i knew what had happened just as though pete himself had told me all about it he and that rat skinny had gone to canfields room to rob him and canfield must have caught them before they got away with the swag thered been a fight and pete had abducted the little bride because shed seen the murder and he wanted her outa the way until he and sknny could beat it he knew shed be safe for at least ten days in the psychopathic ward of the hopsital so hed called her his wife and had her shut up for a crazy woman with that poor kid lying there sob bing right by me i most hated pete for what hed done yet he was my man i loved him i didnt know what to do and everything she said made every one around her but me think she was insane at last i told her not to say a word to anyone else and that when i got out which i knew i would in a day or so when my man learned where i wasid go to her harry and have him come and get her that quieted her some though she said one thing more that made me shiver if they find the dead man in our room and harry there what will they do to harry he can prove hes innocent i said trying to comfort her and they cant do a thing to an innocent man she went to sleep at last but i lay there awake and heard the clock strike twelve then one and two and three and four no nearer to a decision what to do than when she first told me the story there was a gray light coming in through the barred windows before i went to sleep and it didnt seem as if id dozed ten minutes when i felt the nurse shaking me and telling me to drink the slush she called coffee it was in a tin cup and there was sugar left around the rim of it where it hadnt been washed off but she made me swallow it just the same and eat the hunk of bread she brought with it i finally managed it and washed my face in the water she fetched in the tin basin but the yellow soap sticking in the bottom of the pan hurt my eyes and made my face burn after that the nurse almost pulled me out of bed and told me i was wanted in the ante room i knew i was going to leave then so i told mrs wallace not to worry that
