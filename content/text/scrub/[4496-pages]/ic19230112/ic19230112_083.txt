 my road to the stars imprint of fingers and his voice was stern but i recalled seeing hogan and gunning fight and i had no wish to expose ted just convalescent to the chiefs broad fists no someone got in by mistake i whispered someone who never be longed here and i told myself that was true hogan belonged in soap not in pictures i began to cry softly later ted told me that he had sud denly realized it was very sweet to hold me in his arms like this my face against his shoulder my hair streaming over his breast to feel that i clung to him that i needed him that i turned to him for protection he had thought before only of the debt he owed for devotion to him now he was only conscious that i pam was the woman motif who had set fire to the smoldering embers and again lighted the creative flame in his soul dear little pam he murmured will you bear with me a little while till i prove myself worthy it wont take very long i knew then that a miracle had oc curred and my daydream come true ted was turning to me for the love every man must have from the woman who is destined from the beginning to be his mate that all happened sometime ago today i am a star and my greatest successes are written by my husband the end posed by helene chadwick and richard dix in a scene from the sin flooda goldwyn picture
