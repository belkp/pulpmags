my road to the stars i tried to tell myself that i wouldnt care how much he hated me so long as he was himself again sunday came between that day and the one on which the doctors took him from me i never left him for twenty four hours i sat by his bed long after he had fallen asleep and i tried to im agine the emptiness in my life after he was gone he was to be under treatment and ob servation for a couple of weeks before to go under the surgeons knife the actors who worked with me the direc tors who supervised me and even the chief who was upstairs part of every day were dim and shadowy personages who could not absorb my thoughts there were all sorts of rumors flying about the studio and they reached me in little gusts mostly through sallie and roger gordon who had once worked with mundi and retained a bit ter memory of her temper i learned visions of ted waiting for the surgeons knife the operation it was decided that i should not see him during that time and they pacified ted by telling him that he would be restored to gloria a man on the way to perfect health gunning was not satisfied with some of the scenes taken under foleys direc tion and i was kept at the studio work ing until i was ready to drop with fatigue i moved about those days as if i were in a dream nothing was very real to me no one mattered but a man lying on a narrow hospital bed and waiting gloria had quarreled with hoganit was said she finally demanded a wed ding ring in some way she blamed me said i had put a jinx on her and that she wouldnt rest until i was dis missed from the company sallie brought me this bit of informa tion but added your position is sure as long as you handle the old ruffian carefully hell swallow all the flattery you can pour out and you can always open your eyes and look innocent and aggrieved if he tries to presume you see its gone around the studio
