the love that kills five years went by and then i went away with my little girl for a visit to california and there in the flower loveliness of the country i wrestled with myself i came back softened my soul crying out for forgiveness i begged it from my husband how happy he was his love that had never died leaped up again with almost pathetic intensity it seemed as though he had been starved for all those years but now was filled our real honeymoon began and we were utterly content happier together than we had ever been before then one day someone asked me if i knew that during my absence in the west my husband had been seen in a neighboring city with a woman i questioned him fury rising in my heart and with deep abasement he confessed she was a nurse he had met once in a hospital he cared nothing for her but she had said she loved him our life had seemed hopeless to gether and when i went away he had been desolate by chance he had met this woman again and the thing had come about he begged forgiveness my whole body seemed to change to ice as i listened i turned away from him as i would from a terrible monster from something unclean it didnt matter that i had been to blame that i had cast him away from me that i had made our life together wretched when i went to california i said that i was going away forever but now i was outraged filled with righteous in dignation at his sin tears and upbraidings followed again this time with renewed fury for now i had a real basis for my anger and i never let him forget it and so i made him pay for that one lapse with his life with almost a fiendish delight i made him suffernight after night month after month but no one knew it outside of our home i was very care ful i was a devoted wife apparently no one dreamed that the life of this popular physician was not entirely happyuntil at last someone noticed that he was not himself his hand was shaky he was unable to continue a surgical operation he broke down and was taken to a hospital in a neighboring city when he came home shaken and white i nursed him frightened re solving that hereafter i would forget the past and be again as i was after my return from california but it was too late my husband was taking morphine he had been taking it for months it had been the cause of his breakdown and at last the truth came out at first i found he had begun months before taking only a little to quiet his nerves to enable him to go on with his work it is easy for a physician to get mor phine and he had not dreamed of course that it would get a hold upon him i questioned him he admitted that it was true he was taking the drug i commanded him to stop de nounced him pleaded with him ter rified and then the truth came to me in blinding horror that it was too late it had got too great a hold on him he could not stop he must go on we now lived on what he had made in the past for his practice ceased and he could not attend to it did not try to he did not seem to care but shut himself up taking the drug in great quantities day after day content to sit no jan
