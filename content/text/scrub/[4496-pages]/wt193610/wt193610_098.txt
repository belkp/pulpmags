red nails making me bloom again with youth and writh life everlasting slowly like a serpent arching toward its victim she bent down through the writhing smoke closer and closer over the now motionless woman who stared up into her glowing dark eyeseyes that grew larger and deeper blazing like black moons in the swirling smoke the kneeling people gripped their hands and held their breath tense for the bloody climax and the only sound was conans fierce panting as he strove to tear his leg from the trap all eyes were glued on the altar and the white figure there the crash of a thunderbolt could hardly have broken the spell yet it was only a low cry that shattered the fixity of the scene and brought all whirling abouta low cry yet one to make the hair stand up stiffly on the scalp they looked and they saw framed in the door to the left of the dais stood a nightmare figure it was a man with a tangle of white hair and a matted white beard that fell over his breast rags only partly covered his gaunt frame revealing halfnaked limbs strangely unnatural in appearance the skin was not like that of a normal human there was a suggestion of scaliness about it as if the owner had dwelt long under conditions almost antithetical to those conditions under which human life or dinarily thrives and there was nothing at all human about the eyes that blazed from the tangle of white hair they were great gleaming disks that stared un winkingly luminous whitish and with out a hint of normal emotion or sanity the mouth gaped but no coherent words issuedonly a highpitched tittering tolkemec whispered tascela livid while the others crouched in speechless horror no myth then no ghost set you have dwelt for twelve years in darkness twelve years among the bones of the dead what grisly food did you find what mad travesty of life did you live in the stark blackness of that eternal night i see now why xamec and zlanath and tachic did not return from the catacombsand never will re turn but why have you waited so long to strike were you seeking something in the pits some secret weapon you knew was hidden there and have you found it at last that hideous tittering was tolkemecs only reply as he bounded into the room with a long leap that carried him over the secret trap before the doorby chance or by some faint recollection of the ways of xuchotl he was not mad as a man is mad he had dwelt apart from humanity so long that he was no longer human only an unbroken thread of memory embodied in hate and the urge for vengeance had connected him with the humanity from which he had been cut off and held him lurking near the people he hated only that thin string had kept him from racing and prancing off for ever into the black cor ridors and realms of the subterranean world he had discovered long ago you sought something hidden whis pered tascela cringing back and you have found it you remember the feud after all these years of blackness you remember for in the lean hand of tolkemec now waved a curious jadehued wand on the end of which glowed a knob of crimson shaped like a pomegranate she sprang aside as he thrust it out like a spear and a beam of crimson fire lanced from the pomegranate it missed tascela but the woman holding valerias ankles was in the way it smote between her shoulders there was a sharp crackling sound and the ray of fire flashed from her bosom and struck the black altar with a snap
