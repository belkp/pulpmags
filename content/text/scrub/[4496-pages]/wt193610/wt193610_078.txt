the tree of life now in the grip of that mad hypnotic song in the instant before unbearable terror enfolded him his eyes opened to full sight and he saw that tree was only thags outline sketched threedimensionally upon the twilight its dreadfully curving branches had been no more than thags barest contours yet even they had made his very soul sick with intuitive revulsion but now seeing the true horror his mind was too numb to do more than register its presence thag hovering monstrously between earth and heaven billowing and surging up there in the translucent twi light tethered to the ground by the trees bending stem and reaching raven ously after the hypnotized fodder that his calling brought helpless into his clutches one by one he snatched them up one by one absorbed them into the great unseeable horror of his being that then was the reason why they van ished so instantaneously sucked into the concealing folds of a thing too dreadful for normal eyes to see the priestess was pacing forward above her the branches arched and leaned caught in a timeless paralysis of horror smith stared upward into the enormous bulk of thag while the music hummed intolerably in his shrinking brainthag the monstrous thing from darkness called up by illar in those longforgotten times when mars was a green planet foolishly his brain wandered among the ramifications of what had happened so long ago that time itself had forgotten refusing to recognize the fate that was upon him self he knew a tingle of respect for the agesdead wizard who had dared com mand a being like this to his services this vast blind hovering thing ravenous for human flesh indistinguishable even now save in those terrible outlines that sent panic leaping through him with every motion of the trees fearful symmetry all this flashed through his dazed mind in the one blinding instant of understanding then the priestess luminous whiteness swam up before his hypnotized stare her hands were upon him gently guiding his mechanical foot steps very gently leading him forward intointo the writhing branches struck down ward straight for his face and in one flashing leap the moments infinite horror galvanized him out of his paral ysis why he could not have said it is not given to many men to know the ultimate essentials of all horror concen trated into one fundamental unit to most men it would have had that same paralyzing effect up to the very instant of destruction but in smith there must have been a bedrock of subtle violence an unyielding inflexible vehemence upon which the structure of his whole life was reared few men have it and when that ultimate intensity of terror struck the basic flint of him reaching down through mind and soul into the deepest depths of his being it struck a spark from that in flexible barbarian buried at the roots of him which had force enough to shock him out of his stupor in the instant of release his hand swept like an unloosed spring of its own volition straight for the butt of his powergun he was dragging it free as the trees branches snatched him from its priestess hands the firecolored blossoms burnt his flesh as they closed round him the hot branches gripping like the touch of ravenous fingers the whole tree was hot and throbbing with a dreadful travesty of fleshly life as it whipped him aloft into the hovering bulk of incarnate horror above
