 weird tales scientific worldit is evident that under certain conditions the soul or mind does separate itself from the body in the case of a mesmerized person the body lies in a cataleptic condition but the spirit has left it perhaps you reply that the soul is there but in a dormant con dition i answer that this is not so other wise how can one account for the condi tion of clairvoyance which has fallen into disrepute through the knavery of certain scoundrels but which can easily be shown to be an undoubted fact i have been able myself with a sensitive subject to obtain an accurate description of what was going on in another room or another house how can such knowledge be accounted for on any hypothesis save that the soul of the subject has left the body and is wander ing through space for a moment it is recalled by the voice of the operator and says what it has seen and then wings its way once more through the air since the spirit is by its very nature invisible we cannot see these comings and goings but we see their effect in the body of the subject now rigid and inert now struggling to narrate impressions which could never have come to it by natural means there is only one way which i can see by which the fact can be demon strated although we in the flesh are unable to see these spirits yet our own spirits could we separate them from the body would be conscious of the presence of others it is my intention therefore shortly to mesmerize one of my pupils i shall then mesmerize myself in a manner which has become easy to me after that if my theory holds good my spirit will have no difficulty in meeting and com muning with the spirit of my pupil both being separated from the body i hope to be able to communicate the result of this interesting experiment in an early number of the keinplatz wochenliche medicalschrift when the good professor finally ful filled his promise and published an ac count of what occurred the narrative was so extraordinary that it was received with general incredulity the tone of some of the papers was so offensive in their comments upon the matter that the angry savant declared that he would never open his mouth again or refer to the subject in any waya promise which he has faithfully kept this narrative has been compiled however from the most authentic sources and the events cited in it may be relied upon as sub stantially correct it happened then that shortly after the time when professor von baum garten conceived the idea of the above mentioned experiment he was walking thoughtfully homeward after a long day in the laboratory when he met a crowd of roystering students who had just streamed out from a beerhouse at the head of them half intoxicated and very noisy was young fritz von hartmann the professor would have passed them but his pupil ran across and intercepted him heh my worthy master he said taking the old man by the sleeve and leading him down the road with him there is something that i have to say to you and it is easier for me to say it now when the good beer is humming in my head than at another time what is it then fritz the physi ologist asked looking at him in mild surprize i hear mein herr that you are about to do some wondrous experiment in which you hope to take a mans soul out of his body and then to put it back again is it not so it is true fritz w t
