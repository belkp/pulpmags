 weird tales the hornnote died and he could feel more than hear the fumbling bass of the dirge from the depths below him he ran the rest of the distance along the passageway and mounted the steps two at a stride he looked into the tor ture hall as on the previous night corio stood far back close to the wall in which cliff crouched the arms of the master were raised high raised cliff knew though he could not hear it in a blasphemous incantation and then he saw something that sent a crimson lance of fury crashing through his brain vilma stripped like the rest stood with the other victims at the foot of the long steps her body gleamed pinkly in contrast to the pallid drabness of the halfdead automatons and she held her head proudly erect but from where he stood cliff could see the side of her face and it bore a look of terror he could see corios face too and he was looking at the girl baffled fury glaring from his eyesas though she were there against his will cliffs first impulse was to fling him self out there with his cutlas and hack a way to freedom for vilma and himself but cold reason checked this folly such a course could end only in death motion less he watched the scene before him his brain frantically seeking a plan with even a ghost of a chance of succeeding the gunpowder there was enough of the stuff below to blast this entire castle into the hell where it belonged hastily he retraced his steps to the tunnel in which he had found the kegs plucking the torch from its niche in the wall as he passed it he held it high above his head as he examined the contents of the broken keg unmistakably gunpowder thrusting the cutlas beneath his belt he clutched a handful of the black dust then crouching close to the floor he drew an irregular thread through the passageway toward the stairs once he returned for more powder but in a few minutes the job was done at the foot of the steps where the trail ended he touched his torch to the black line and watched a hissing spark snake its white smoked way back toward the powder kegs an instant he watched it then sprang up the stairs hed have to move fast with a hideous howl he darted into the hall his cutlas above his head corio spun aboutand it was his last living act a single sweep of the great blade sheared his head from his neck sent it rolling grotesquely along the floor for three heartbeats the body stood with a foun tain of blood spurting from severed arteries then it crashed coolly cliff leaned over the twitching cadaver ignoring the bedlam on the stairs the horde sweeping down toward him hurling aside the waiting humans he pried open clutching fingers seized a twisted silver instrument and raised it to his lips the mass of undead were almost upon him the murky light glinting on menacing blades when cliff blew the first note the note of sleep he tried again hastily and it was the right one at the doleful soothing sound the un dead halted in their tracks haltedand melted into nothingness before his eyes but now those other five in their robes of bloody redthey were charging and even though they were unarmed cliff felt a stab of fear they possessed powers beyond the human powers a mortal could not combat he braced him self and waited at the bottom of the steps they stopped ranging in a wide halfcircle the central monsterthe masterflung up his arms in a strangely terrifying ges ture and cliff saw his carmine lips move
