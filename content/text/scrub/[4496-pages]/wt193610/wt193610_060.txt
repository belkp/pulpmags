doom of the house of duryea place then perhaps a distended sigh and again footsteps arthur crouched at the open door of his room his head was cocked for those noises from below in his hands was a doublebarrel shotgun of violent gage thud thud thud then a pause the clinking of a glass and the gurgling of liquid the sigh the tread of his feet over the floor hes thirsty arthur thought thirsty outside the storm had grown into fury lightning zigzagged between the mountains filling the valley with weird phosphorescence thunder like drums rolled incessantly within the lodge the heat of the fire place piled the atmosphere thick with stagnation all the doors and windows were locked shut the oillamps glowed weaklya pale anemic light henry duryea walked to the foot of the stairs and stood looking up arthur sensed his movements and ducked back into his room the gun gripped in his shaking fingers then henry duryeas footstep sounded on the first stair arthur slumped to one knee he buckled a fist against his teeth as a prayer tumbled through them duryea climbed a second step and another and still one more on the fourth stair he stopped arthur his voice ait into the silence like the crack of a whip arthur will you come down here yes dad bedraggled his body hanging like cloth young duryea took five steps to the landing we cant be zanies cried henry duryea my soul is sick with dread tomorrow were going back to new york im going to get the first boat to open sea please come down here he turned about and descended the stairs to his room arthur choked back the words which had lumped in his mouth half dazed he followed in the bedroom he saw his father stretched faceup along the bed he saw a pile of rope at his fathers feet tie me to the bedposts arthur came the command tie both my hands and both my feet arthur stood gaping do as i tell you dad what hor dont be a fool you read that book you know what relation you are to me id always hoped it was cecilia but now i know its you i should have known it on that night twenty years ago when you complained of a headache and night mares quickly my head rocks with pain tie me speechless his own pain piercing him with agony arthur fell to that grisly task both hands he tiedand both feet tied them so firmly to the iron posts that his father could not lift him self an inch off the bed then he blew out the lamps and without a further glance at that pro metheus he reascended the stairs to his room and slammed and locked his door behind him he looked once at the breech of his gun and set it against a chair by his bed he flung off his robe and slippers and within five minutes he was senseless in slumber he slept late and when he awak ened his muscles were as stiff as boards and the lingering visions of a nightmare clung before his eyes he pushed his way out of bed stood dazedly on the floor
