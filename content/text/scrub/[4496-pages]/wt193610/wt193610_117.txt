 weird tales bodies lie still and inert after a time nature will resume her sway our spirits will return into our respective bodies and all will be as before with your kind permission we shall now proceed to at tempt the experiment the applause was renewed at this speech and the audience settled down in expectant silence with a few rapid passes the professor mesmerized the young man who sank back in his chair pale and rigid he then took a bright globe of glass from his pocket and by concentrating his gaze upon it and mak ing a strong mental effort he succeeded in throwing himself into the same condi tion it was a strange and impressive sight to see the old man and the young sitting together in the same cataleptic state whither then had their souls fled that was the question which pre sented itself to each and every one of the spectators five minutes passed and then ten and then fifteen and then fifteen more while the professor and his pupil sat stiff and stark upon the platform during that time not a sound was heard from the assembled savants but every eye was bent upon the two pale faces in search of the first signs of returning consciousness nearly an hour had elapsed before the patient watchers were rewarded a faint flush came back to the cheeks of pro fessor von baumgarten the soul was coming bade once more to its earthly tenement suddenly he stretched out his long thin arms as one awaking from sleep and rubbing his eyes stood up from his chair and gazed about him as though he hardly realized where he was tausend teufel he exclaimed rap ping our a tremendous south german oath to the great astonishment of his audience and to the disgust of the swe denborgian where the henker am i then and what in thunder has occurred oh yes i remember now one of these nonsensical mesmeric experiments there is no result this time for i remember nothing at all since i became unconscious so you have had all your long journeys for nothing my learned friends and a very good joke too at which the regius professor of physiology burst into a roar of laughter and slapped his thigh in a highly indecorous fashion the audience were so enraged at this unseemly behavior on the part of their host that there might have been a con siderable disturbance had it not been for the judicious interference of young fritz von hartmann who had now recovered from his lethargy stepping to the front of the platform the young man apolo gized for the conduct of his companion i am sorry to say he said that he is a harumscarum sort of fellow al though he appeared so grave at the com mencement of this experiment he is still suffering from mesmeric reaction and is hardly accountable for his words as to the experiment itself i do not consider it to be a failure it is very possible that our spirits may have been communing in space during this hour but unfortu nately our gross bodily memory is distinct from our spirit and we cannot recall what has occurred my energies shall now be devoted to devising some means by which spirits may be able to recollect what occurs to them in their free state and i trust that when i have worked this out i may have the pleasure of meeting you all once again in this hall and demonstrating to you the result this address coming from so young a student caused considerable astonishment among the audience and some were in clined to be offended thinking that he assumed rather too much importance the majority however looked upon him as a young man of great promise and many comparisons were made as they left
