 weird tales it was a doleful sound a cry like the cry death itself might possess yet oddlyand horriblyit was soothing promising the peace of endless sleep and touched by its power the columns of undead stiffened thinned to wraiths flowed as water flows down the stone steps vanished the deadalivethose five vampires in crimson cowlslooked upward uneasily the shadows under the roof were gray ing with the light of dawn cliff could sense their thought before sunrise they must be in their tombs under the castle to sleep until another night with one accord they strode down the stairs past corio who had prostrated himself and entered a black opening in the wall with their departure the altar fire dimmed to a sullen ember corio arose he was alone in the chamber save for that dead broken body lying in a twisted heap at the foot of the stairs and those other halfalive wretches stretched out before the altar now cliff told himself was the time for him to get in there at corio now was the time to rescue his friendsbut he continued to crouch unmoving again corio blew on his silver horn and a faint cry leaped from vilmas tensed lips the luring note that had drawn her cliff thought hazily then he thought of nothing save the sound the sound that promised him all he could desire earth and its dominion his for the takingif he answered that call then even the sound eluded his senses and he heard only the promise he must answer must claim what was right fully his but those halfdead creaturessight of their stirring steadied his staggering sanity here and there heads lifted and bloodless husks of bodies tried to rise in the pallid light they seemed like corpses freed from newly opened graves some could only reach their knees others rose to uncertain limbs and all moved down the stairway toward corio answer ing his summons followed as he made his slow way toward the opening in the wall still blowing the single notethe note that promised earth and all it held cliff glanced toward vilmaand she was not there he looked down saw her far below dropping from crack to crevice with amazing speed and daring hasten ing towardcorio the thought jarred any lingering taint of allurement from cliffs mind he must stop her he swung around ignor ing the cramped stiffness of his legs and started down the steep wall down down recklessly with corios hornnote only a faintly heard sound fading behind him now he saw vilma reach the rocks below and dash around the corner of the castle and he cursed redoubling his speed downdownand suddenly the ancient rock crumbled underfoot for an instant he hung from straining fingertips then dropped a smashing impacta stone that slid beneath himand his head crashed against the castle wall through a fiery mist of pain he pictured vilma in the grasp of corio the mist thickened grew blackengulfed him in corios hands cliff awoke with the sun glaring down on his face he opened his eyes and stabbing lances of light pierced his eyeballs momentarily blinded he pressed his hands across his face and struggled erect there was a sick feeling in his stomach and the back of his head throbbed incessantly he touched the aching area and winced a lump like an egg thrust out his scalp
