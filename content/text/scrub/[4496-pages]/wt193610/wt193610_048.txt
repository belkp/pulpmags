the lost door and told him my fears wrexler was spending more and more time in the rose garden i hardly saw him and he would not discuss anything with me even at the stately elegantly served meals he barely spoke he always seemed to be listening waiting de lacy shared my fears but he sug gested nothing to help he has been marked my lord he said gravely we can only pray but even in prayers there is no refuge for helene is beyond such things surely i began to remonstrate the power of evil is as strong as the power of good or at least there is little between them helene herself is bound fast by hate of black george curses live i knew thatwitness the lasting quality of the curses and spells of the egyptian priests but helene was not evil i said as much de lacy shook his head she is cut off from her lover she does not feel kindly toward men remember she promised vengeance century after cen tury that day in the great hall that night in the silence of my cham ber i called her name helene helene i flung my agonized summons into the night but there was no answer i went over in my mind the tales de lacy had told me of the havoc she had caused how one man had cast himself down from the highest turret crying her name how another had been found dead in the rose garden horror frozen on his face there were still others who had looked upon her and death or madness came as the result the more i thought of these tales of terror the more i feared for wrexler at last i could stand no more i thrust my arms into the rich velvet robe that had taken the place of my bath gown and went to wrexlers room the guards stood back to let me pass i did not mean to wake him but some inner foreboding made me feel i must know that he was safe as i drew aside the curtains of his bed i could not entirely stifle the cry that came to my lips for the bed was empty but upon the pillow lay a small white rose it was the kind they use in funeral wreaths in france my heart almost stopped beating the rose gardenor perhaps the library a more normal thought struck me wrexler might have wanted to read i rushed into the hall to find de lacy waiting for me summoned by the guards he held a silver candlestick in which a tall white candle burned the library i gasped that was nearest we should try it first de lacy knew my meaning he had instantly grasped the situation and his face was white and tense together we descended the curving stairway together we reached the li brary then motioning de lacy behind me i swung open the door the room was brightly illuminated although not one of the candles had been lit in the middle of it stood wrexler with helene in his arms their lips were closelocked it was a picture that an artist would have delighted to paint the stiff crim son skirts of helene dharcourts gown stood wide on either side and wrexlers blue doublet and hose against them was in bold relief his long oversleeves edged with fur hung gracefully i could not speak this mating of man with ghost was almost more than my poor mortal brain could bear yet with every atom of my being i wished that i could have been in wrexlers place i remembered the one chaste kiss i had had from her and i almost fainted at the thought of possessing those lips for my own as wrexler was doing strangely
