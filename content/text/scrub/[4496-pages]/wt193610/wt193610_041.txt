 weird tales we have some twenty or thirty suites my lord wrexler said he would prefer to be close at hand and together we followed de lacy up the marble stairway into a new world wrexler was at ease immediately in his doublet and hose the rich em broidered garments seemed to suit him as modem clothes never did he looked handsomer than ever he also told me that the costume of the medici was becoming to me and truly when i caught a glimpse of myself mirrored in the pond for the ch창teau did not possess a large mirrori was not ill pleased with the result but by the end of the week i still felt strange in my new attire whereas wrexler from the beginning wore his as if to the manor born but i anticipate that first night we donned two of the outfits which the valet whom de lacy introduced to me had put out our own clothes disappeared and much to my annoyance with them my cigarettes we ate dinner in state upon a raised dais at one end of a great hall at either side below us were long nar row tables filled with people dressed also in keeping with the period they made a wonderful picture and comprised i supposed my court or retinue de lacy presented me to them with a flourish and they all filed by and kissed my hand then went to their places when wrexler and i were seated they too sat down when i began to talk they filled the hall with gay chat tering from a minstrel gallery at the other end of the room came soft strains of music de lacy stood behind me pouring my wine one thing i noticed was that in the whole roomand there must have been two hundred people at leastthere were no older men or women in fact de lacy was the oldest of the lot the others ranged from about sixteen to thirty how did my father get all these people together i asked de lacy most of them my lord were born at rougemont still others were adopted and brought here almost as soon as they were born none of us has ever been outside rougemont gates de lacy was quite matteroffact as he made his statement wrexler was searching the hall with his eyes as he listened to my steward and you i looked at de lacy i too my lord know nothing of your outside world nor do i want to why should i who am happy here my family live down at the farm but his highness your father became interested in me he brought me into the ch창teau had me educated and looked after me himself eventually he made me steward of rougemont it is a great honor he conferred upon me and i shall do my best to help you my lord of a sudden i saw what my fathers lifework had been to rear a court to people rougemont my father had been twentyfive at my mothers death he had died at fiftyeight he had had thirty three years to make his dream come true where are the parents of the ones who were born at rougemont at their own places or the farms my lord rougemont has over a thousand acres and several manors upon it where people whom his highness your father advanced over others live they all serve their ruler in some way in return for what is given them only the people of the lodge are in touch with the outside which we have been taught to look upon with scorn here we have everything and to be taken to the ch창teau itself is the ambition of everyone on the estate
