her great moment it was so hard i thought id never see you again after you knew but no more words were neces sary for she was in his arms lips pressed against his in a wild sweet kiss that was a throbbing song of ecstasy after a time jack said softly sylvia was only a crush darling but you are love my one and only ive loved you from the first night we went out together ill always adore you my darlingforever and ever the chauffeur had turned the car into the park and in the sheltering darkness of the treelined road their lips met and clung in a tender pas sionate kiss that fused their hearts together for all time you you were born for summer days and flowercup perfume and all the green of april and all the gold of june you were meant for dancing every sunlit meadow through where thrushes spin their melodies beneath a tent of blue and i was born to follow you to grant your smallest need to keep your garden flowerfilled and free from stone and weed to walk in joy beside you and to tell you all the day that my love is deep as heaven is and cannot go away that ever here beside you my heart is waiting lest you tire of the dancing and come home to me and rest bert cooksley la
