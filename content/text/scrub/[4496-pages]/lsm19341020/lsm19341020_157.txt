 street amp smiths love story magazine dear mrs brown im a girl of twentythree and for the past four years i have been going with a young man four years my senior i am considered good looking dress well and hold a good position im not engaged to this boy and never have been but during the first three years we went together i saw him almost every night of course we quarreled now and then and parted several times but we always made up my family have continually nagged at me to give him up because he drinks and behaves terribly when drunk about two years ago he started to slap me when he was in this condition the next day hed beg me to forgive him saying he was sorry but the same thing has happened many times a year ago a man around thirty years of age came to work in our office he asked me to go out with him but i re fused one day however i had a quarrel with my boy friend and he beat me up after that i made up my mind to go out with others so the next time this new man asked me for a date i accepted he seemed so considerate and wonder ful after what i went through with the other boy that i started to go out with him quite often i know youll think me terrible when i say that this man was mar ried and i knew it the first time i went out with him was because i was so dis couraged about the other boy but grad ually we began going out three and four times a week then some one told his wife and she left him i continued to date him after a year of that i finally realized how wrong it was for me to go out with him so i gave him up i made up with my first boy friend but when he found out about the married man he accused me of pretty nearly everything he struck me and told all our friends i was cheap enough to run after a married man finally this man made up with his wife but he kept telling me that he wasnt happy and that he loved me i was still going with my first boy friend in spite of his abuse but we parted a few weeks ago because i just couldnt stand it any longer he follows me around however stops me whenever he can tries to talk to me and if i wont he slaps me hes always throw ing it up to me that i was a married mans sweetheart but this married man never made any advances to me i sent him away because i realized that it was wrong he even wanted to get a divorce and marry me but i managed to convince him that we could never be happy if we made his wife un happy he still loves me and i love him though ill never let him know i told him i loved the first boy though thats a lie because i sometimes hate him more than it seems possible for one human being to hate another last week the three of us met at a party and when my first boy friend met the mar ried man he struck me since then he comes around to my place of business and tells me that i deserved the beating be cause he says i invited this married man to the party so i could see him but i didnt i couldnt help it if some one else brought him along i didnt even know he was coming in the four years i have been going with this boy he ran around with married and divorced women and denied all the stories i heard until i saw him myself he was to blame for my actions and now he wants me to make up i know if i marry him i will have a terrible life i know youll tell me to forget him and i would like to do that but he just wont stay away he tells me that if i ran around with a married man once ill do it again and hes there to see that i dont three days ago this other man phoned and asked me to see him but i refused he told my friends that if he couldnt have me he hoped id never marry the other fellow because he has caused me so much trouble i am desperate unhappy arline no girl is obliged to marry a man who is as despicable as your first boy friend arline for goodness sake shake yourself awake and re member that this is if he wont keep away from you tell your family about it and if they havent sufficient influence to make him stay away from you the mighty hand of the law will im sure bear some weight with him you neednt be quite spineless simply be cause like a bad boy he says i wont when a girl is thinking of mar riage she should try to choose a man of character and dignity
