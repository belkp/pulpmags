forgotten bride you heard poke were doing what he says were waiting here until he lets us out if we wait all night how long dawn stood there sobbing pounding she couldnt have told seconds probably to her it seemed an eternity but as her eyes grew accustomed to the soft darkness and saw there the comforting security of everyday thingschairs tables booklined wallsher panic left her and some thing almost like curiosity took its place this was her roomhilda brians room the rugs she walked on the books she read might as well be comfortable phil said and found an easy chair he even lit a cigarette and in the glare of the match dawn saw his face pale and tense but brighteyed with excitement across from her on the far side of the softlycarpeted room a nook of deep set windows gave out on a terraced garden they were open for dawn saw dimly the stirring curtains and felt the cool night wind on her hot cheeks making her way toward them dawn leaned against the wide sill the moon hung its golden lantern from a stardotted sky a cricket chirped on the window ledge almost beneath her hand yellow chrysanthemums in a huge blue bowl sent their spicy fragrance through the room she pushed them aside and leaned her hand still resting against the heavy vase to stare out beyond the tree line where the highway ran a white ribbon in the darkness cars were honking on the other side of the rooms thick walls came shouts and cries and muffled laughter but in the little shrubenclosed yard below her eyes the beauty and the stillness caught at dawns breath like a sob in the magic of the lowriding moon the lawn had become a shimmering golden sea with a tiny vinecovered porch awning gay jutting out into it like a ship a ship in full sail dawn thought and she pictured herself on it with jack sailing out into that golden sea away from all this trouble and sorrow and shame she was still staring at it blinking back the lonely heartsick tears that filled her eyes when she saw the white flutter of a womans dress a woman who while dawn watched her walked slowly down the steps and out into the moonsprayed night that she was hilda brian dawn knew would have known it she thought had the night been black as pitch because of the creep ing chills that shook her there was a man with her too from where dawn leaned she could see his tall darkclothed form and the white blur that was his face and she thought with a scornful twisted lip how cheap she is meeting her lovers here at her home under her husbands very eyes lying to him telling him she had a headache and then sneaking out to meet a man if jack could see her now she thought if jack could only see her a walk of mossy flags skirted the yard and passing under the window where dawn leaned led to an out side gate watching dawn saw them leave the shadow of the porch and start down its narrow length toward her and suddenly her heart choked her and the blood pounded against her temples for the mans face wasnt a blur any more it was a darkeyed thincheeked familiar face jacks face and dawn was lsa
