 amazing stories yes yes interrupted mr snodgrass just sit perfectly still he said turning off the electric fan keep out of all draughts and please try not to cough ill telephone the fire department and the police as a precaution not necessary said the inventor the pres sure will sink to forty pounds in ten minutes it was a harrowing ten minutes for the president of the ajax manufacturing company when one has reached the mature age of sixty years and has a large family even to grandchildren the staking of ones life against the mere sneeze or cough of an utter stranger is an unnerving thing and the shock and suspense of it all is more than apt to leave the faculties in a numb and dazed condition at any rate when mr fosdick left the office a few minutes after the ordeal he had in his pocket mr snodgrass check of one thousand dollars for the building of the first seidlitzmobile one month later a team drew a queer look ing vehicle in front of the ajax manufacturing company and were unhitched i brought it over here from the shop by mule power explained mr fosdick as i wanted you to take the very first ride in the seidlitzmobile under its own steamor gas rather mr snodgrass looked the machine over dubiously it looks like a fire extinguisher he ventured thats the very principle that it works on said the inventor you see this reservoir and he pointed to a large burnished brass cylinder under the hood is the mixing chamberthe stomach of the machine as it were into it the powders are dropped and the carbonic acid gas actuates the two cylinder engine geared to the back axle this link motion controls the cutoff and the reverse and the throttle here permits you to give the engine any head of gas but climb in he added and well be off mr snodgrass with some reluctance stepped into the machine and seated himself mr fosdick fol lowed him and then fishing out of his pocket a seid litz powder he unscrewed a brass cap from a tube that protruded from the floor of the machine dropped the powder through tooted the horn re leased the brakes and they were off it was a down hill road and for two milesin fact for the entiie length of the hill the seidlitzmobile behaved splendidly mr snodgrass became enthusiastic its the most silent machine i ever rode in he ejaculated its as quiet as an electric and just think put in mr fosdick the ma chine can be retailed at two hundred dollars it will make us millions all there is to it is a ten dollar engine a brass cylinder four wheels and a seidlitz powder the horse is bound to become as extinct as the dodo every family in the land will possess one it will be a convenience to the rich a blessing to the poor a they had reached the bottom of the hill and the machine stopped whats the matter demanded mr snodgrass his vision of riches suddenly fading away mr fosdick got out and looked the machine over wisely i think the engine has slipped an ec centric he remarked after a few moments of pro found study why man youve no pressure exclaimed the passenger look at the gauge it was true the gauge registered not a single pound mr fosdick fumbled in his pockets but could not find another powder i guess that last powder must have been a weak one he said but see there is a drug storeand every drug store carries seidlitz powders as long as you keep near the drug stores you need never run out of power mr snodgrass spirits rose we can turn that remark into profit he said we will copyright it the very first thing we will do will he to spend one million dollars in advertising this sentence through out the entire world the seidlitzmobilethe ma chine that can get its power at any drug store together the two men walked into the drug shop a seidlitz powder if you please said mr fos dick laying ten cents upon the soda counter the apothecary dived back into the mysterious region behind the prescription case and hibernated an hour later he emerged and pleasantly inquired what was wanted a seidlitz powder please reiterated mr fos dick pointing to the dime the druggist rubbed his hands unctuously im sorry that were out of seidlitz powders he said but we have something just as good we have nothing but seidlitz roared mr snodgrass giving way to one of his sudden outbursts the druggist smiled blandly how old is the patient he asked its a machine cried mr snodgrass ah indeed remarked the druggist looking at mr snodgrass queerly and may i ask what is the matter with it it wont go bellowed mr snodgrass yes yes agreed the druggist it wont go and he backed behind the counter and reached for the telephone ill have a nice man in a pretty blue suit with bright brass buttons here in just a few minutes and he will make your head stop ach ing he promised them soothingly you think we are crazy accused mr snodgrass oh not at all reassured the clerk you are just merely overheated mr fosdick intervened the machine is an auto mobile run by carbonic acid gas he explained and thats why we wanted the seidlitz powder a sigh of relief escaped the druggist why didnt you say sq at first he said i havent had such a scare in years mr fosdick explained the principle of the ma chine mr snodgrass bought a handful of cigars and gave the druggist one who immediately put it back in stock and abstracted a dime out of the cash register and good feeling was restored as i understand it said the druggist your machine generates gas in the same manner as a fire extinguisher or a sodawater charger precisely agreed mr fosdick in that case said the druggist you should use bicarbonate of soda and sulphuric acid mr fosdick with the invariable reluctance of all inventors to adopt the suggestions of outsiders demurred it spoils the name of the machine he said and the name is worth a million in itself
