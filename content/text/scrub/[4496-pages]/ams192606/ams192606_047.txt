 amazing stories so inextinguishably and i would weep and clutch my forehead and clench my fists crying god how can i live without her yet there would be a little strange fancy in my head at the same moment saying who is this alice you know no such person and truly i would wonder whether she had ever existed so slowly the old emotions were shed away from me and i began to joy in a corresponding growth of my mental perceptions i began to toy idly with mathematical formulae i had forgotten years ago in the same fashion that a poet toys with a word and its shades of meaning i would look at every thing with new seeing eyes new perception and i would understand things i had never understood before because formerly my emotions had always occupied me more than my thoughts and so the weeks went by until one day i was well what after all is the use of this chronicle surely there will never be men to read it i have heard them say that the snow will never go i will be buried it will be buried with me and it will be the end of us both yet somehow it eases my weary soul a little to write need i say that i lived thereafter many thou sands of thousands of years until this day i can not detail that life it is a long round of new fan tastic impressions coming dreamlike one after another melting into each other in looking back as in looking back upon dreams i seem to recall only a few isolated periods clearly and it seems that my imagination must have filled in the swift movement between episodes i think now of neces sity in terms of centuries and milleniums rather than days and months the snow blows ter ribly about my little fire and i know it will soon gather courage to quench us both years passed at first with a sort of clear wonder i watched things that took place everywhere in the world i studied the other students were much amazed to see me a man of thirty odd com ing back to college but judas dennel youve already got your phd what more do you want so they would all ask me and i would reply i want an md and an frcs i didnt tell them that i wanted degrees in law too and in biology and chemistry in architecture and engi neering in psychology and philosophy even so i believe they thought me mad but poor fools i would think they can hardly realize that i have all of eternity before me for study i went to school for many decades i would pass from university to university leisurely gathering all the fruits of every subject i took up revelling in study as no student revelled ever before there was no need of hurry in my life no fear of death too soon there was a magnificence of vigour in my body and a magnificence of vision and clarity in my brain i felt myself a superman i had only to go on storing up wisdom until the day should come when all knowledge of the world was mine and then i could command the world i had no need for hurry o vast life how i gloried in my eter nity and how little good it has ever done me by the irony of god for several centuries changing my name and passing from place to place i continued my studies i had no consciousness of monotony for to the in tellect monotony cannot exist it was one of those emotions i had left behind one day however in the year a great discovery was made by a man called zarentzov it had to do with the curvature of space quite changing the conceptions that we had all followed since einstein i had long ago mastered the last detail of einsteins theory as had in time the rest of the world i threw my self immediately into the study of this new epoch making conception to my amazement it all seemed to me curiously dim and elusive i could not quite grasp what zarentzov was trying to formulate why i cried the thing is a monstrous fraud i went to the professor of physics in the univer sity i then attended and i told him it was a fraud a huge book of mere nonsense he looked at me rather pityingly i am afraid modevski he said addressing me by the name i was at the time using i am afraid you do not understand it that is all when your mind has broadened you will you should apply yourself more carefully to your physics but that angered me for i had mastered my physics before he was ever born i challenged him to ex plain the theory and he did he put it obvious ly in the clearest language he could yet i under stood nothing i stared at him dumbly until he shook his head impatiently saying that it was use less that if i could not grasp it i would simply have to keep on studying i was stunned i wandered away in a daze for do you see what had happened during all those years i had studied ceaselessly and my mind had been clear and quick as the day i first had left the hospital but all that time i had been able only to remain what i wasan extraordinarily intelli gent man of the twentieth century and the rest of the race had been progressing it had been swiftly gathering knowledge and power and ability all that time faster and faster while i had been only remaining still and now here was zarentzov and the teachers of the universities and probably a hundred intelligent men who had all outstripped me i was being left behind and that is what happened i need not dilate further upon it by the end of that century i had been left behind by all the students of the world and i never did understand zarentzov other men came with other theories and these theories were accepted by the world but i could not understand them my intellectual life was at an end i had nothing more to understand i knew everything i was capable of knowing and thenceforth i could only play wearily with the old ideas many things happened in the world a time came when the east and west two mighty unified hemis pheres rose up in arms the civil war of a planet i recall only chaotic visions of fire and thunder and hell it was all incomprehensible to me like a bizarre dream things happened people rushed about but i never knew what they were doing ij lurked during all that time in a tiny shuddering hole under the city of yokohama and by a miracle i survived and the east won but it seems tci
