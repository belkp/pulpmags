 amazing stories who can shoot i think what indians there are will be much too frightened to try to ambush any of us but wed better be on the safe side theyll keep together and fish at nearly the same spot with our hunters patroling the woods behind them taking potshots at game if they see any the fishermen should make more or less of a success i think the indians werent extensive fishers that i ever heard of and the river ought fairly to swarm with fish he closed his notebook how many weapons can we count on alto gether arthur asked van deventer in the bank about a dozen riotguns and half a dozen repeating rifles elsewhere i dont know forty or fifty men said they had revolvers though well give revolvers to the men who go with the fishermen the indians havent heard firearms and will run at the report even if they dare attack our men we can send out the gunarmed men as hunters some one suggested and send gardeners with them to look for vegetables and such things well have to take a sort of census really arthur suggested finding what every one can do and getting him to do it i never planned anything like this before van deventer remarked and i never thought i should but this is much more fun than running a bank arthur smiled lets go and have our meeting he said cheer fully but the meeting was a gloomy and despairing affair nearly every one had watched the sun set upon a strange wild landscape hardly an indivi dual among the whole two thousand of them had ever been out of sight of a house before in his or her life to look out at a vast untouched wilder ness where hitherto they had seen the most highly civilized city on the globe would have been startling and depressing enough in itself but to know that they were alone in a whole continent of savages and that there was not indeed in all the world a single community of people they could greet as brothers was terrifying few of them thought so far but there was actu allyif arthurs estimate of several thousand years drop back through time was correctthere was actually no other group of englishspeaking people in the world the english language was yet to be invented even rome the synonym for antiquity of culture might still be an obscure vil lage inhabited by a band of tatterdemalions under the leadership of an upstart romulus soft in body as these people were citybred and unaccustomed to face other than the most conven tionalized emergencies of life they were terrified hardly one of them had even gone without a meal in all his life to have the prospect of having to earn their food not by the manipulation of figures in a book or by expert juggling of profits and prices but by literal wrestling of that food from its source in the earth or stream was a really terrifying thing for them in addition every one of them was bound to the life of modern times by a hundred ties many of theni had families a thousand years away all had interests engrossing interests in modern new york one young man felt an anxiety that was really ludicrous because he had promised to take his sweet heart to the theater that night and if he did not come she would be very angry another was to have been married in a week some of the people were like van deventer and arthur so situated that they could view the episode as an adventure or like estelle who had no immediate fear because all her family was provided for without her help and lived far from new york so they would not learn of the catastrophe for some time many however felt instant and pressing fear for the families whose expenses ran always so close to their incomes that the disappearance of the breadwinner for a week would mean actual want or debt there are very many such families in new york the people therefore that gathered hopelessly at the call of van deventers watchmen were dazed and spiritless their excitement after arthurs first attempt to explain the situation to them had evaporated they were no longer keyed up to a high pitch by the startling thing that had happened to them nevertheless although only half comprehending what had actually occurred they began to realize what that occurrence meant no matter where they might go over the whole face of the globe they would always be aliens and strangers if they had been carried away to some unknown shore some wilderness far from their own land they might have thought of building ships to return to their homes they had seen new york vanish before their eyes however they had seen their civilization dis appear while they watched they were in a barbarous world there was not for example a single safety match on the whole earth except those in the runaway skyscraper a foodriot in the building arthur and van deventer in turn with the others of the cooler heads thundered at the apathetic people trying to waken them to the necessity for work they showered promises of in evitable return to modern times they pledged their honor to the belief that a way would ultimately be found by which they would all yet find themselves safely back home again the people however had seen new york disinte grate and arthurs explanation sounded like somo wild dream of an imaginative novelist not one person in all the gathering could actually realize that his home might yet be waiting for him though at the same time he felt a pathetic anxiety for the welfare of its inmates every one was in a turmoil of contradictory be liefs on the one hand they knew that all of new york could not be actually destroyed and replaced by a splendid forest in the space of a few hours so theaccident or catastrophe must have occurred to those in the tower and on the other hand they had seen all of new york vanish by bits and fragments to be replaced by a smaller and dingier town had beheld that replaced in turn and at last had landed in the midst of this forest every one too began to feel an unusual and un comfortable sensation of hunger it was a mild discomfort as yet but few of them had experienced it before without an immediate prospect of assuag ing the craving and the knowledge that there was
