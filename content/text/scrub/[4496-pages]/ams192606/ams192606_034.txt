a trip to the center of the earth opinion on this point strongly to my uncle he merely shook his head are we advancing towards some mighty waterfall which shall cast us into the abyss probably this mode of descending into the abyss may be agreeable to the professor because it would be something like a vertical descent he is so eager to make i entertain a very different view whatever be the truth it is certain that not many leagues distant there must be some very extraor dinary phenomenon for as we advance the roar becomes more mighty and stupendous is it in the water or in the air i cast hasty glances aloft at the suspended vapors and i seek to penetrate their mighty depths but the vault above is tranquil the clouds which are now elevated to the very summit appear utterly still and motionless and completely lost in the irradia tion of electric light it is necessary therefore to seek for the cause of this phenomenon elsewhere i examine the horizon now perfectly calm pure and free from all haze its aspect still remains un changed but if this awful noise proceeds from a cataractif so to speak this vast interior ocean is precipitated into a lower basinif these tremend ous roars are produced by the noise of falling waters the current would increase in activity and its increasing swiftness would give me some idea of the extent of the peril with which we are men aced i consult the current it simply does not exist there is no such thing an empty bottle cast into the water lies to leeward without motion about four oclock hans rises clambers up the mast and reaches the truck itself from this ele vated position his looks are cast around they take in a vast circumference of the ocean at last his eyes remain fixed his face expresses no astonish ment but his eyes slightly dilate he has seen something at last cried my uncle i think so i replied hans came down stood beside us and pointed with his right hand to the south der nere he said there replied my uncle and seizing his tele scope he looked at it with great attention for about a minute which to me appeared an age i knew not what to think or expect yes yes he cried in a tone of considerable sur prise there it is what i asked a tremendous spurt of water rising out of the waves some other marine monster i cried already alarmed perhaps then let us steer more to the westward for we know what we have to expect from antediluvian animals was my eager reply go ahead said my uncle i turned towards hans hans was at the tiller steering with his usual undisturbed calm never theless if from the distance which separated us from this creature a distance which must be esti mated at no less than a dozen leagues and this spurting of water proceeded from the pranks of some antediluvian animal his dimensions must be preternatural to fly is therefore the course to be suggested by ordinary prudence but we have not come into that part of the world to be prudent such is my uncles determination we accordingly continue to advance the nearer we come the loftier is the spouting water what monster can fill himself with such huge volumes of water and then unceasingly spout them out in such lofty jets at eight oclock in the evening reckoning as above ground where there is day and night we are not more than two leagues from the mighty beast its long black enormous mountainous body lies on the top of the water like an island but then sailors have been said to have gone ashore on sleeping whales mistaking them for land is it illusion or is it fear its length cannot be less than a thou sand fathoms what then is this cetaceous mon ster of which no cuvier ever thought it is quite motionless and presents the appearance of sleep the sea seems unable to lift him upwards it is rather the waves which break on his huge and gigantic frame the waterspout rising to a height of five hundred feet breaks in spray with a dull sullen roar we advance like senseless lunatics towards this mighty mass i honestly confess that i was abjectly afraid i declared that i would go no further i threatened in my terror to cut the sheet of the sail i attacked the professor with considerable acrimony calling him foolhardy mad i know not what he made no answer suddenly the imperturbable hans once more pointed his finger to the menacing object holme an island cried my uncle an island i replied shrugging my shoulders at this poor attempt at deception of course it is cried my uncle bursting into a loud and joyous laugh but the water spout geyser said hans yes of coursea geyser replied my uncle still laughing a geyser like those common in iceland jets like this are the great wonders of the country at first i would not allow that i had been so grossly deceived what could be more ridiculous than to have taken an island for a marine monster but kick as one may one must yield to evidence and i was finally convinced of my error it was nothing after all but natural phenomenon as we approached nearer and nearer the dimen sions of the liquid sheaf of water became truly grand and stupendous the island had at a dis tance presented the appearance of an enormous whale whose head rose high above the waters the geyser a word which signifies fury rose majesti cally from its summit dull detonations are heard every now and then and the enormous jet taken as it were with sudden fury shakes its plume of vapor and bounds into the first layer of the clouds it is alone neither spurts of vapor nor hot springs surround it and the whole volcanic power of that region is concentrated in one sublime column the rays of electric light mix with this dazzling sheaf every drop as it falls assuming the prismatic colors of the rainbow let us go on shore said the professor after some minutes of silence it was necessary however to take great precaution in order to avoid the
