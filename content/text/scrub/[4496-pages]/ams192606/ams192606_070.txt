the runaway skyscraper has kept me from it up to now but im enjoying myself hugely estelle looked at the group of dispirited men well simply have to do something she said with a shaky smile i feel just as they do this morning i hated the thought of having to go back to my boardinghouse tonight but right now i feel as if the odor of cabbage in the hallway would seem like heaven arthur led the way to the flattopped desk in the middle of the room lets settle a few of the more important mat ters he said in a businesslike tone none of us has any authority to act for the rest of the people in the tower but so many of us are in a state of blue funk that those who are here must have charge for a while anybody any suggestions housing answered van deventer promptly i suggest that we draft a gang of men to haul all the upholstered settees and rugs that are to be found to one floor for the women to sleep on mm yes thats a good idea anybody a better plan no one spoke they all still looked much too homesick to take any great interest in anything but they began to listen more or less halfheartedly ive been thinking about coal said arthur theres undoubtedly a supply in the basement but i wonder if it wouldnt be well to cut the lights off most of the floors only lighting up the ones were using that might be a good idea later estelle said quietly but light is cheering somehow and every one feels so blue that i wouldnt do it tonight to morrow theyll begin to get up their resolution again and you can ask them to do things if were going to starve to death one of the other men said gloomily we might as well have plenty of light to do it by we arent going to starve to death retorted arthur sharply just before i came down i saw a great cloud of birds greater than i had ever seen before when we get at those birds when echoed the gloomy one they were pigeons estelle explained they shouldnt be hard to snare or trap i usually have my dinner before now the gloomy one protested and im told i wont get any thing tonight the other men began to straighten their shoul ders the peevishness of one of their j number seemed to bring out their latent courage well weve got to stand it for the present one of them said almost philosophically what im most anxious about is getting back have we any chance arthur nodded emphatically i think so i have a sort of idea as to the cause of our sinking into the fourth dimension and when that is verified a corrective can be looked for and applied how long will that take cant say arthur replied frankly i dont know what tools what materials or what workmen we have and whats rather more to the point i dont even know what work will have to be done the pressing problem is food oh bother the food some one protested impa tiently i dont care about myself i can go hun gry tonight i want to get back to my family thats all that really matters a chorus of voices echoed wed better not bother about anything else unless we find we cant get back concentrate on getting back one man stated more explicitly look here said arthur incisively youve a family and so have a great many of the others in he tower but your family and everybody elses family has got to wait as an inside limit we can hope to begin to work on the problem of getting back when were sure theres nothing else going to happen i tell you quite honestly that i think i know what is the direct cause of this catastrophe and ill tell you even more honestly that i think im the only man among us who can put this tower back where it started from and ill tell you most honestly of all that any attempt to meddle at this present time with the forces that let us down here will result in a catastrophe considerably greater than the one that happened today well if youre sure some one began reluct antly i am so sure that im going to keep to myself the knowledge of what will start those forces to work again arthur said quietly i dont want any impatient meddling if we start them too soon god only knows what will happen organizing the food supply van deventer was eyeing arthur chamberlain keenly it isnt a question of your wanting pay in exchange for your services in putting us back is it he asked coolly arthur turned and faced him his face began to flush slowly van deventer put up one hand i beg your pardon i see we arent settling the things we came here for estelle interrupted she had noted the threat of friction and hastened to put in a diversion arthur relaxed i think that as a beginning he suggested wed better get sleeping arrangements completed we can get everybody together somewhere i dare say and then secure volunteers for the work right van deventer was anxious to make amends for his blunder of a moment before shall i send the bank watchmen to go on each floor in turn and ask everybody to come downstairs you might start them arthur said it will take a long time for every one to assemble van deventer spoke into the telephone on his desk in a moment he hung up the receiver theyre on their way he said arthur was frowning to himself and scribbling in a notebook of course he announced abstractedly the pressing problem is food weve quite a number of fishermen and a few hunters weve got to have a lot of food at once and everything considered i think wed better count on the fishermen at sun rise wed better have some people begin to dig bait and wake our anglers theyd better make their tackle tonight dont you think there was a general nod well announce that then the fishermen will go to the river under guard of the men we have
