a trip to the center of the earth and to the fish preceded the appearance of the race of manimifers the generation of reptiles then reigned supreme upon the earth these hideous monsters ruled everything in the seas of the sec ondary period which formed the strata of which the jura mountains are composed what a gigantic structure was theirs what vast and prodigious strength they possessed the existing saurians which include all such reptiles as lizards crocodiles and alligators even the largest and most formidable of their class are but feeble imitations of their mighty sires the animals of ages long ago if there were giants in the days of old there were also gigantic animals i shuddered as i evolved from my mind the idea and recollection of these awful monsters no eye of man had seen them in the flesh they took their walks abroad upon the face of the earth thousands of ages before man came into existence and their fpssil bones discovered in the limestone have al lowed us to reconstruct them anatomically and thus to get some faint idea of their colossal forma tion i recollect once seeing in the great museum of hamburg the skeleton of one of these wonderful saurians it measured no less than thirty feet from the nose to the tail am i then an inhabitant of the earth of the present day destined to find myself face to face with a representative of this ante diluvian family i can scarcely believe it possible can hardly believe it true and yet these marks of powerful teeth upon the bar of iron can there be a doubt from their shape that the bite is the bite of a crocodile my eyes stare wildly and with terror upon the subterranean sea every moment i expect one of these monsters to rise from its vast cavernous depths i fancy that the worthy professor in some measure shares my notions if not my fears for after an attentive examination of the crowbar he cast his eyes rapidly over the mighty and mysterious ocean what could possess him to leave the land i thought as if the depth of this water was of any importance to us no doubt he has disturbed some terrible monster in his watery home and perhaps we may pay dearly for our temerity anxious to be prepared for the worst i examined our weapons and saw that they were in a fit condition for use my uncle looked on at me and nodded his head ap provingly he too had noticed what we had to fear already the uplifting of the waters on the sur face indicates that something is in motion below the danger approaches it comes nearer and near er it behooves us to be on the watch tuesday august evening came at last the hour when the desire for sleep caused our eye lids to be heavy night there is not properly speak ing in this place any more than there is in sum mer in the arctic regions hans however is im movable at the rudder when he snatches a mo ment of rest i really cannot say i took advantage of his vigilance to take some little repose two hours after i was awakened from a heavy sleep by an awful shock the raft appeared to have struck upon a sunken rock it was lifted right out of the water by some wondrous and mysterious power and then started off twenty fathoms distant eh what is it cried my uncle starting up are we shipwrecked or what hans raised his hand and pointed to where about two hundred yards off a huge black mass was mov ing up and down i looked with awe my worst fears were realized it is a colossal monster i cried clasping my hands yes cried the agitated professor there yonder is a huge sea lizard of terrible size and shape and farther on behold a prodigious crocodile look at his hideous jaws and that row of monstrous teeth ha he has gone a whale a whale shouted the professor i can see his enormous fins see see how he blows air and water two liquid columns rose to a vast height above the level of the sea into which they fell with a ter rific crash waking up the echoes of that awful place we stood stillsurprised stupefied terror stricken at the sight of what seemed a group of fearful marine monsters more hideous in the real ity than in my dream they were of supernatural dimensions the very smallest of the whole party could with ease have crushed our raft and ourselves with a single bite hans seizing the tiller which had flown out of his hand puts it hard aweather in order to escape from such dangerous vicinity butno sooner does he do so than he finds he is flying from scylla to charybdis to leeward is a turtle about forty feet wide and a serpent quite as long with an enormous and hideous head peering from out the waters look which way we will it is impossible for us to fly the fearful reptiles advanced upon us they turned and twisted about the raft with awful ra pidity they formed around our devoted vessel a series of concentric circles i took up my rifle in desperation but what effect can a rifleball pro duce upon the armor scales with which the bodies of these horrid monsters are covered we remain still and dumb from utter horror they advance upon us nearer and nearer our fate appears certain fearful and terrible on one side the mighty crocodile on the other the great sea serpent the rest of the fearful crowd of marine prodigies have plunged beneath the briny waves and disappeared i was about to risk all and fire to try the effect of a shot hans the guide however interfered by a sign to check me the two hideous and ravenous monsters passed within fifty fathoms of the raft and then made a rush at one anothertheir fury and rage preventing them from seeing us the combat commenced we distinctly made out every action of the two hideous monsters to my excited imagination the other animals appeared about to take part in the fierce and deadly struggle the monster the whale the lizard and the turtle i distinctly saw them every moment i pointed them out to the icelander but he only shook his head tva he said whattwo only does he say surely he is mis taken i cried in a tone of wonder he is quite right replied my uncle coolly and philosophically examining the terrible duel with his
