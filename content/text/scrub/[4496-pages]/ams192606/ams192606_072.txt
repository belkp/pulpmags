the runaway skyscraper no food to be had somehow increased the desire for it they were really in a pitiful state van deventer spoke encouragingly and then asked for volunteers for immediate work there was hardly any response every one seemed sunk in despondency arthur then began to talk straight from the shoulder and succeeded in rousing them a little but every one was still rather too frightened to realize that work could help at all in desperation the dozen or so men who had gath ered in van deventers office went about among the gathering and simply selected men at random ordering them to follow and begin work this began to awaken the crowd but they wakened to fear rather than resolution they were citybred and unaccustomd to face the unusual or the alarming arthur noted the new restlessness but attributed it to growing uneasiness rather than selfish panic he was rather pleased that they were outgrowing their apathy when the meeting had come to an end he felt satisfied that by morning the latent resolu tion among the people would have crystallized and they would be ready to work earnestly and intelli gently on whatever tasks they were directed to undertake he returned to the ground floor of the building feeling much more hopeful than before two thou sand people all earnestly working for one end are hard to down even when faced with such a task as confronted the inhabitants of the runaway sky scraper even if they were never able to return to modern times they would still be able to form a community that might do much to hasten the devel opment of civilization in other parts of the world his hope received a rude shock when he reached the great hallway on the lower floor there was a fruit and confectionery stand here and as arthur arrived at the spot he saw a surging mass of men about it the keeper of the stand looked fright ened but was selling off his stock as fast as he could make change arthur forced his way to the counter here he said sharply to the keeper of the stand stop selling this stuff its got to be held until we can dole it out where its needed ii cant help myself the keeper said theyre takin it anyway get back there arthur cried to the crowd do you call this decent trying to get more than your share of this stuff youll get your portion to morrow it is going to be divided up go to hell some one panted you cn starve if you want to but im goin to look out fr myself the men were not really starving but had been put into a panic by the plain speeches of arthur and his helpers and were seizing what edibles they could lay hands upon in preparation for the hunger they had been warned to expect arthur pushed against the mob trying to thrust them away from the counter but his very effort intensified their panic there was a quick surge and a crash the glass front of the showcase broke in in a flash of rage arthur struck out viciously the crowd paid not the slightest attention to him however every man was too panicstricken and too intent on getting some of this food before it was all gone to bother with him arthur was simply crushed back by the bodies of the forty or fifty men in a moment he found him self alone amid the wreckage of the stand with the keeper wringing his hands over the remnants of his goods van deventer ran down the stairs whats the matter he demanded as he saw arthur nursing a bleeding hand cut on the broken glass of the showcase bolsheviki answered arthur with a grim smile we woke up some of the crowd too suc cessfully they got panicstricken and started to buy out this stuff here i tried to stop them and you see what happened wed better look to the restaurant though i doubt if theyll try anything else just now he followed van deventer up to the restaurant floor there were picked men before the door but just as arthur and the bank president appeared two or three whitefaced men went up to the guards and started lowvoiced conversations arthur reached the spot in time to forestall bribery arthur collared one man vandeventer another and in a moment the two were sent reeling down the hallway some fools have got panicstricken van de venter explained to the men before the doors in a casual voice though he was breathing heavily from the unaccustomed exertion theyve smashed up the fruitstand on the ground floor and stolen the contents its nothing but blue funk only if any of them start to gather around here hit them first and talk it over afterward youll do that we will the men said heartily shall we use our guns asked another hopefully van deventer grinned no he replied we havent any excuse for that yet but you might shoot at the ceiling if they get excited theyre just frightened he took arthurs arm and the two walked toward the stairway again chamberlain he said happily tell me why ive never had as much fun as this before arthur smiled a bit wearily im glad youre enjoying yourself he said im not im going outside and walk around i want to see if any cracks have appeared in the earth anywhere its dark and ill borrow a lantern down in the fireroom but i want to find out if there are any more developments in the condition of the building theorizing on the strange occurence despite his preoccupation with his errand which was to find if there were other signs of the continued activity of the strange forces that had lowered the tower through the fourth dimension into the dim and unrecorded years of aboriginal america arthur could not es cape the fascination of the sight that met his eyes a bright moon shone overhead and silvered the white sides of the tower while the brightlylighted windows of the offices within glittered like jewels set into the shining shaft from his position on the ground he looked into the dimness of the forest on all side black ob scurity had gathered beneath the dark masses of moonlit foliage the tiny birchbark tepees of the now deserted indian village glowed palely above
