the star to high country were lit and crowded all night long and in all the seas about the civilized lands ships with throbbing engines and ships with bellying sails crowded with men and living creatures were standing out to ocean and the north for already the warning of the master mathematician had been telegraphed over the world and translated into a hundred tongues the new planet and neptune locked in a fiery embrace were whirling headlong ever faster and faster toward the sun already every second this blazing mass flew a hundred miles and every second its terrific velocity increased as it flew its course it must pass a hundred million of miles wide of the earth and scarcely affect it but near its destined path as yet only slightly perturbed spun the mighty planet jupiter and his moons sweeping splendid around the sun every moment now the attraction between the fiery star and the greatest of the planets grew stronger and the result of that attraction inevitably jupiter would be deflected from its orbit to a new elliptical path and the burning star swung by his attraction wide of its sunward rush would describe a curved path and perhaps collide with and certainly pass close to our earth earthquakes volcanic out breaks cyclones sea waves floods and a steady rise in temperature to i know not what limitso pro phesied the master mathematician and overhead to carry out his words lonely and cold and livid blazed the star of the coming doom to many who stared at it that night until their eyes ached it seemed that it was visibly approach ing and that night too the weather changed and the frost that had gripped all central europe and france and england softened towards a thaw but you must not imagine because i have spoken of people praying through the night and people go ing aboard ships and people fleeing towards moun tainous country that the whole world was already in a terror because of the star as a matter of fact use and wont still ruled the world and save for the talk of idle moments and the splendor of the night nine human beings out of ten were still busy at their common occupations in all the cities the shops save one here and there opened and closed at their proper hours the doctor and the undertaker plied their trades and workers gathered in the factories soldiers drilled scholars studied lovers sought one another thieves lurked and fled politicians planned their schemes the presses of the newspapers roared through the nights and many a priest of this church and that would not open his holy building to further what he considered a foolish panic the newspapers insisted on the lesson of the year for then too people had anticipated the end the star was no starmere gasa comet and were it a star it could not possibly strike the earth there was no precedent for such a thing common sense was sturdy everywhere scornful jesting a little inclined to persecute the obdurate fearful that night at by greenwich time the star would be at its nearest to jupiter then the world would see the turn things would take the master mathema ticians grim warnings were treated by many as so much mere elaborate selfadvertisement common sense at last a little heated by argument signified its unalterable convictions by going to bed so too barbarism and savagery already tired of the novel ty went about their nightly business and save for a howling dog here and there the beastworld left the star unheeded and yet when at last the watchers in the euro pean states saw the star rise an hour later it is true but no larger than ithad been the night be fore there were still plenty awake to laugh at the master mathematicianto take the danger as if it had passed but hereafter the laughter ceased the star grew it grew with a terrible steadiness hour after hour a little larger each hour a little nearer the midnight zenith and brighter and brighter until it had turned night into day had it come straight to the earth instead of in a curved path had it lost no velocity to jupiter it must have leapt the intervening gulf in a day but as it was it took five days altogether to come by our planet the next night it had become a third the size of the moon before it set to english eyes and the thaw was assured it rose over america nearly the size of the moon but blinding white to look at and hot and a breath of hot wind blew now with its rising and gathering strength and in virginia and brazil and down the st lawrence valley it shone intermittently through a driving reek of thunder clouds flickering violet lightning and hail unprecedented in manitoba were a thaw and devastating floods and upon all the mountains of the earth the snow and ice began to melt that night and all the rivers coming out of high country flowed thick and turbid and soonin their upper reacheswith swirling trees and the bodies of beasts and men they rose steadily stead ily in the ghostly brilliance and came trickling over their banks at last behind the flying population of their valleys and along the coast of argentina and up the south atlantic tides were higher than they had ever been in the memory of man and the storms drove the waters in many cases scores of miles inland drowning whole cities and so great grew the heat during the night that the rising of the sun was like the coming of a shadow the earthquakes began and grew until all down america from the arctic circle to cape horn hillsides were sliding fissures were opening and houses and walls crumbling to destruction china was lit glowing white but over japan and java and all the islands of eastern asia the great star was a ball of dull red fire because of the steam and smoke and ashes the volcanoes were spouting forth to salute its coming above were the lava hot gases and ash and below the seething floods and the whole earth swayed and rumbled with the earth quake shocks soon the immemorial snows of tibet and the himalayas were melting and pouring down by ten million deepening converging channels upon the plains of burma and hindustan the tangled summits of the indian jungles were aflame in a thousand places and below the hurrying waters around the stems were dark objects that struggled feebly and reflected the blood red tongues of fire and in ungovernable confusion a multitude of men and women fled down the broad riverways to that one last hope of menthe open sea larger grew the star and larger hotter and brighter with a terrible swiftness now the tropi cal ocean had lost its phosphorescence and the
