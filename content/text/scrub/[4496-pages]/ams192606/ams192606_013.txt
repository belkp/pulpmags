 amazing stories have not found the water of which we are in search i swear to you i will give up my mighty enterprise and return to the earths surface despite my irritation and despair i knew how much it cost my uncle to make this proposition and to hold such conciliatory language under the cir cumstances what could i do but yield well i cried let it be as you wish and may heaven reward your superhuman energy but as our hours are numbered unless we discover water let us lose no time but go ahead chapter xix the western gallerya new route our descent was now resumed by means of the second gallery hans took up his post in front as usual we had not gone more than a hundred yards when the professor carefully examined the walls this is the primitive forma tionwe are on the right roadonwards is our hope when the whole earth got cool in the first hours of the worlds morning the diminution of the vol ume of the earth produced a state of dislocation in its upper crust followed by ruptures crevasses and fissures the passage was a fissure of this kind through which ages ago had flowed the eruptive granite the thousand windings and turnings formed an inextricable labyrinth through the an cient soil as we descended successions of layers composing the primitive soil appeared with the ut most fidelity of detail no mineralogists had ever found themselves placed in such a marvelous position to study nature in all her real and naked beauty the sounding rod a mere machine could not bring to the surface of the earth the objects of value for the study of its internal structure which we were about to see with our own eyes to touch with our own hands remem ber that i am writing this after the journey across the streak of the rocks colored by beauti ful green tints wound metallic threads of copper of manganese with traces of platinum and gold i could not help gazing at these riches buried in the entrails of mother earth of which no man would have the enjoyment to the end of time these treas uresmighty and inexhaustible were buried in the morning of the earths history at such awful depths that no crowbar or pickax will ever drag them from their tomb the light of our ruhmkorfs coil in creased tenfold by the myriad of prismatic masses of rock sent their jets of fire in every direction and i could fancy myself traveling through a huge hol low diamond the rays of which produced myriads of extraordinary effects towards six oclock this fes tival of light began sensibly and visibly to decrease and soon almost ceased the sides of the gallery as sumed a crystallized tint with a somber hue white mica began to commingle more freely with feldspar and quartz to form what may be called the true rock the stone which is hard above all that supports without being crushed the four stories of the earths soil we were walled in by an immense prison of granite it was now eight oclock and still there was no sign of water the sufferings i endured were hor rible my uncle now kept at the head of our little column nothing could induce him to stop i mean while had but one real thought my ear was keenly on the watch to catch the sound of a spring but no pleasant sound of falling water fell upon my listen ing ear at last the time came when my limbs refused to longer carry me i contended heroically against the terrible tortures i endured because i did not wish to compel my uncle to halt to him i knew this would be the last fatal stroke suddenly i felt a deadly faintness come over me my eyes could no longer see my knees shook i gave one despairing cryand fell help help i am dying my uncle turned and slowly retraced his steps he looked at me with folded arms and then allowed one sentence to escape in hollow accents from his lipsall is over the last thing i saw was a face fearfully dis torted with pain and sorrow and then my eyes closed when i again opened them i saw my companions lying near me motionless wrapped in their travel ing rugs were they alseep or dead for myself sleep was wholly out of the question my fainting fit over i was wakeful as the lark i suffered too much for sleep to visit my eyelidsthe more that i thought myself sick unto deathdying the last words spoken by my uncle seemed to be buzzing in my earsall is over it was probable that he was right in the state of prostration to which i was re duced it was madness to think of ever again seeing the light of day above were miles upon miles of the earths crust as i thought of it i could fancy the whole weight resting on my shoulders i was crushed annihilated and i exhausted myself in vain attempts to turn in my granite bed hours upon hours passed away a profound and terrible silence reigned around usa silence of the tomb nothing could make itself heard through these gigantic walls of granite the very thought was stupendous presently despite my apathy despite the kind of deadly calm into which i was cast something aroused me it was a slight but peculiar noise while i was watching intently i observed that the tunnel was becoming dark then gazing through the dim light that remained i thought i saw the ice lander taking his departure lamp in hand why had he acted thus did hans the guide mean to abandon us my uncle lay fast asleepor dead i tried to cry out and arouse him my voice feebly issuing from my parched and fevered lips found no echo in that fearful place my throat was dry my tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth the ob scurity had by this time become intense and at last even the faint sound of the guides footsteps was lost in the blank distance my soul seemed filled with anguish and death appeared welcome only let it come quickly hans is leaving us i cried hanshans if you are a man come back these words were spoken to myself they could not be heard aloud moreover a moments reflection reassured me hans departure could not be a flight instead of ascending the gallery he was going deeper down into the gulf had he had any bad design his way would have been upwards
