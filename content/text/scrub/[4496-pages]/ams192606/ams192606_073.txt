 amazing stories the stars looked calmly down at the accusing finger of the tower pointing upward as if in reproach at their indifference to the savagery that reigned ever the whole earth like a fairy tower of jewels the building rose alone among a wilderness of trees and streams it towered in a strange beauty moonlit to silver lighted from within to a mass of brilliant gems it stood serenely still arthur carrying his futile lantern about its base felt his own insignificance as never before he won dered what the indians must think he knew there must be hundreds of eyes fixed upon the strange sightfixed in awestricken terror or superstitious reverence upon this unearthly visitor to their hunt ing grounds a tiny figure dwarfed by the building whose base he skirted arthur moved slowly about the vast pile the earth seemed not to have been affected by the vast weight of the tower arthur knew however that long concrete piles reached far down to bedrock it was these piles that had sunk into the fourth dimension carrying the building with them arthur had followed the plans with great interest when the metropolitan was constructed it was an engineering feat and in the engineering periodicals whose study was a part of arthurs business great space had been given to the building and the methods of its construction while examining the earth carefully he went over his theory of the cause for the catastrophe the whole structure must have sunk at the same time or it too would have disintegrated as the other buildings had appeared to disintegrate mentally arthur likened the submergence of the tower in the oceans of time to an elevator sinking past the different floors of an office building all about the building the other skyscrapers of new york had seemed to vanish in an elevator the floors one passes seem to rise upward carrying out the analogy to its logical end arthur reasoned that the building itself had no more cause to disintegrate as the buildings it passed seemed to disintegrate than the elevator in the office building would have cause to rise because its surroundings seemed to rise within the building he knew there were strange stirrings of emotions queer currents of panic were running about throwing the people to an fro as leaves are thrown about by a current of wind yet underneath all those undercurrents of fear was a rapidly growing resolution strengthened by an in creasing knowledge of the need to work men were busy even then shifting all possible comfortable furniture to a single story for the women in the building to occupy the men would sleep on the floor for the present beds of boughs could be improvised on the morrow at sunrise on the following morning many men would go to the streams to fish guarded by other men all would be frightened no doubt but there would be a grim resolution underneath the fear other men would wander about to hunt there was little likelihood of indians approaching for some days at least but when they did come arthur meant to avoid hostilities by all possible means the indians would be fearful of their strange visitors and it should not be difficult to convince them that friendliness was safest even if they displayed unfriendly desires the pressing problem was food there were two thousand people in the building softbodied and citybred they were unaccustomed to hardship and could not endure what more primitive people would hardly have noticed they must be fed but first they must be taught to feed themselves the fishermen would help but arthur could only hope that they would prove equal to the occasion he did not know what to expect from them from the hunters he expected but little the indians were wary hunters and game would be shy if not scarce the great cloud of birds he had seen at sunset was a hopeful sign arthur vaguely remembered stories of great flocks of woodpigeons which had been exterminated as the buffalo was exterminated as he considered the remembrance became more clear they had flown in huge flocks which nearly darkened the sky as late as the forties of the nineteenth century they had been an important article of food and had glutted the market at certain seasons of the year estelle had said the birds he had seen at sunset were pigeons perhaps this was one of the great flocks if it were really so the food problem would be much lessened provided a way could be found to secure them the ammunition in the tower was very limited and a shell could not be found for every bird that was needed nor even for every three or four great traps must be devised or birdlime might possibly be produced arthur made a mental note to ask estelle if she knew anything of birdlime a vague humming roar altering in pitch came to his ears he listened for some time before he identified it as the sound of the wind playing upon the irregular surfaces of the tower in the city the sound was drowned by the multitude of other noises but here arthur could hear itplainly he listened a moment and became surprised at the number of night noises he could hear in new york he had closed his ears to incidental sounds from sheer selfprotection somewhere he heard the ripple of a little spring as the idea of a spring came into his mind he remembered estelles description of the deeptoned roar she had heard he put his hand on the cold stone of the building there was still a vibrant quivering of the rock it was weaker than before but was still noticeable he drew back from the rock and looked up into the sky it seemed to blaze with stars far more stars than arthur had ever seen in the city and more than he had dreamed existed as he looked however a cloud seemed to film a portion of the heavens the stars still showed through it but they twinkled in a peculiar fashion that arthur could not understand he watched in growing perplexity the cloud moved very swiftly thin as it seemed to be it should have been silvery from the moonlight but the sky was noticeably darker where it moved it advanced toward the tower and seemed to obscure the upper portion a confused motion became visible among its parts wisps of it whirled away from the brilliantly lighted tower and then re turned swiftly toward it
