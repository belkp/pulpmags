 amazing stories chapter xxvi a rapid recovery when i returned to the consciousness of ex istence i found myself surrounded by a kind of semiobscurity lying on thick and soft coverlids my uncle was watchinghis eyes fixed intently on my countenance a grave expression on his face a tear in his eye at the first sigh which struggled from my bosom he took hold of my hand when he saw my eyes open and fix themselves upon his he uttered a loud cry of joy he lives he lives yes my good uncle i whispered my dear boy continued the grim professor clasping me to his heart you are saved i was deeply and unaffectedly touched by the tone in which these words were uttered and even more by the kindly care which accompanied them the professor was one of those men who must be severely tried in order to induce any display of af fection or gentle emotion at this moment our friend hans the guide joined us he saw my hand in that of my uncle and i venture to say that taci turn as he was his eyes beamed with lively satis faction god dag he said good day hans good day i replied in as hearty a tone as i could assume and now uncle that we are together tell me where we are i have lost all idea of our position as of everything else tomorrow harry tomorrow he replied to day you are far too weak your head is surrounded with bandages and poultices that must not be touched sleep my boy sleep and tomorrow you will know all that you require but i cried let me know what oclock it is what day it is it is now eleven oclock at night and this is once more sunday it is now the ninth of the month of august and i distinctly prohibit you from ask ing any more questions until the tenth of the same i was if the truth were told very weak indeed and my eyes soon closed involuntarily i did require a good nights rest and i went off reflecting at the last moment that my perilous adventure in the in terior of the earth in total darkness had lasted four days on the morning of the next day at my awaken ing i began to look around me my sleepingplace made of all our traveling bedding was in a charm ing grotto adorned with magnificent stalagmites glittering in all the colors of the rainbow the floor of soft and silvery sand a dim obscurity pre vailed no torch no lamp was lighted and yet cer tain unexplained beams of light penetrated from without and made their way through the opening of the beautiful grotto moreover i heard a vague and indefinite murmur like the ebb and flow of waves upon a strand and sometimes i verily believed i could hear the sighing of the wind i began to believe that instead of be ing awake i must be dreaming surely my brain had not been affected by my fall and all that oc curred during the last twentyfour hours was not the frenzied visions of madness and yet after some reflection a trial of my faculties i came to the conclusion that i could not be mistaken surely eyes and ears could not both deceive me it is a ray of the blessed daylight i said to my self which has penetrated through some mighty fissure in the rocks but what is the meaning of this murmur of waves this unmistakable moaning of the salt sea billows i can hear plainly enough the whistling of the wind but can i be altogether mis taken if my uncle during my illness has but car ried me back to the surface of the earth has he on my account given up his wondrous expedition or in some strange manner has it come to an end i was puzzling my brain over these and other questions when the professor joined me good day harry he cried in a joyous tone i fancy you are quite well i am very much better i replied actually sit ting up in my bed i knew that would be the result as you slept both soundly and tranquilly hans and i have each taken turn to watch and every hour we have seen visible signs of amelioration you must be right uncle was my reply for i feel as if i could do justice to any meal you could put before me i am really hungry you shall eat my boy you shall eat the fever has left you our excellent friend hans has rubbed your wounds and bruises with i know not what ointment of which the icelanders alone possess the secret and they have healed your bruises in the most marvelous manner ah hes a wise fellow is master hans while he was speaking my uncle was placing be fore me some articles of food which following his earnest injunctions i readily devoured as soon as the first rage of hunger was appeased i over whelmed him with questions to which he now no longer hesitated to give answers i then learned for the first time that my providential fall had brought me to the bottom of an almost perpendic ular gallery as i came down amidst a perfect shower of stones the last of which falling on mo would have crushed me to death they came to the conclusion that i had carried with me an entire dislocated rock riding as it were on this terrible chariot i was cast headlong into my uncles arms and into them i fell insensible and covered with blood it is indeed a miracle was the professors final remark that you were not killed a thousand times over but let us take care never to separate for surely we should risk never meeting again let us take care never again to separate these words fell with a sort of chill upon my heart the journey then was not over i looked at my uncle with surprise and astonishment my uncle after an instants examination of my countenance saidwhat is the matter harry i want to ask you a very serious question you say that i am all right in health certainly you are and all my limbs are sound and capable of new exertions i asked most undoubtedly but what about my head was my next anxious question well your head except that you have one or two contusions is exactly where it ought to beon your shoulder said my uncle
