 amazing stories about a hundred and fifty high the earth had evi dently been forced apart by some violent subter ranean commotion the mass giving way to a pro digious upheaving of nature had split in two leav ing the vast gap into which we inhabitants of the earth had penetrated for the first time the whole singular history of the coal period was written on those dark and gloomy walls a geolo gist would have been able easily to follow the differ ent phases of its formation the seams of coal were separated by strata of sandstone and by a compact clay which appeared to be crushed down by the weight from above while we still continued our journey i forgot the length of the road by giving myself up wholly to these geological considerations the temperature continued to be very much the same as while we were traveling amid the lava and the schists on the other hand my sense of smell was much affected by a very powerful odor i immediately knew that the gallery was filled to overflowing with that dan gerous gas the miners call firedamp the explosion of which has caused such fearful and terrible acci dents making a hundred widows and hundreds of orphans in a single hour happily we could illuminate our progress by means of the ruhmkorf apparatus if we had been so rash and imprudent as to explore this gallery torch in hand a terrible explosion would have put an end to our travels simply because no travelers would be left our excursion through this wondrous coal mine in the very bowels of the earth lasted until evening my uncle was scarcely able to conceal his impatience and dissatisfaction at the road continuing still to advance in a horizontal direction the darkness dense and opaque a few yards in advance and in the rear rendered it impossible to make out what was the length of the gallery for myself i began to believe that it was simply interminable and would go on in the same manner for months suddenly however at six oclock we stood in front of a wall to the right to the left above be low nowhere was there any passage we had reach ed a spot where the rocks said in unmistakable ac centsno thoroughfare i stood stupefied the guide simply folded his arms my uncle was silent well well so much the better cried my uncle at last i now know what we are about we are decidedly not upon the road followed by saknussem all we have to do is to go back let us take one nights good rest and before three days are over i promise you we shall have regained the point where the galleries divided yes we may if our strength lasts as long i cried in a lamentable voice and why not tomorrow among us three there will not be a drop of water it is just gone and your courage with it said my uncle speak ing in a severe tone what could i say i turned round on my side and from sheer exhaustion fell into a heavy but troubled sleep dreams of water and i awoke unrefreshed i would have bartered a diamond mine for a glass of pure spring water chapter xviii the wrong road next day our departure took place at a very early hour there was no time for the least delay according to my account we had five days hard work to get back to the place where the galleries divided i can never tell all the sufferings we endured upon our return my uncle bore them like a man who has been in the wrongthat is with concen trated and suppressed anger hans with all the resignation of his pacific character and ii con fess that i did nothing but complain and despair i had no heart for this bad fortune but there was one consolation defeat at the outset would probably upset the whole journey as i had expected from the first our supply of water gave out completely on our first days march our provision of liquids was reduced to our supply of schiedam but this horriblenay i will say itthis infernal liquor burnt the throat and i could not even bear the sight of it i found the temperature to be stifling i was paralyzed with fatigue more than once i was about to fall insensible to the ground the whole party then halted and the worthy icelander and my excellent uncle did their best to console and comfort me i could however plainly see that my uncle was con tending painfully against the extreme fatigues of our journey and the awful torture generated by the absence of water then a time came when i ceased to recollect anythingwhen all was one awful hideous fantastic dream at last on tuesday the eighth of the month of july after crawling on our hands and knees for many hours more dead than alive we reached the point of junction between the galleries i lay like a log an inert mass of human flesh on the arid lava soil it was then ten in the morning hans and my uncle leaning against the wall tried to nibble away at some pieces of biscuit while deep groans and sighs escaped from my scorched and swollen lips then i fell off into a kind of deep lethargy presently i felt my uncle approach and lift me up tenderly in his arms poor boy i heard him say in a tone of deep commiseration i was profoundly touched by these words being by no means accustomed to signs of womanly weak ness in the professor i caught his trembling hands in mine and gave them a gentle pressure he allowed me to do so without resistance look ing at me kindly all the time his eyes were wet with tears i then saw him take the gourd which he wore at his side to my surprise or rather to my stupefaction he placed it to my lips drink my boy he said was it possible my ears had not deceived me was my uncle mad i looked at him with i am sure quite an idiotic expression i would not understand him i too much feared the counter action of disappointment drink he said again had i heard aright before i could ask myself the question a second time a mouthful of water cooled my parched lips and throatone mouthful but i do believe it brought me back to life i
