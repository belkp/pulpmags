 amazing stories if all these investigations of mine were conducted without the knowledge of walsingham gribbs you must admit i did only what was right in keeping them secret from him for since he had never met my daughter he might have considered the efforts of a perfect stranger to peer into his life as being uncalled for my wife did what she could to com fort anne but anne sadly replied that she could never marry a man that staggered and reeled day in and day out thus day by day she became more sad and i became so upset that i actually sold a narrowbrimmed derby hat to a man with wide outstanding ears of course this could not go on no highgrade hat business could support it and i was standing in my shop door looking gloomily out when i chanced to see walsingham gribbs stagger by i had seen him many times but now for the first time i noticed what i should have noticed beforethat he invar iably wore a high hat or topper as our cus tomers like to call them i observed that the shape was awful and that the hat badly needed the iron and then my mind recurred to the old problem of the vacant space in the top of top hats but i found i could not con centrate whenever i tried to think of top hats i thought of walsingham gribbs in one of them stag gering and reeling up the street and gradually the thought came that it would be an excellent idea should i be able so to use the space in the top of walsinghams hat that he would no longer stagger and reel and then the thought of the gyroscope hat came to me i admit that at first i put the idea aside as futile but it came back again and again and at length it seemed to force me into enthusiasm i dropped everything and went to work on the gyrohat the gyroscope is as everyone knows a top and i might have called the hat i invented a top hat except that any tall cylindrical silk or beaver hat is called a top hat so i was forced to adopt the name of gyrohat a gyroscope is not an ordinary top it is like a heavy fly wheel revolving on an axle and if it is spun the speed of the revolutions maintains the axle in the perpendicular a huge gyroscope is used to steady the channel steamers which would other wise stagger and reel a gyroscope has been adopted to the monorail cars and so long as the gyroscope gyrates the monorail car cannot stagger or reel if a proper gyroscope was fastened on the end of a knitting needle and gyrated at full speed that knitting needle could be stood on end and it would not fall over therefore if a gyroscope was placed in the top of a top hat and the top hat firmly fastened to the head of a man and the gyroscope set going that man would remain perpendicular in spite of any thing he could not stagger he could not reel he could walk a line as straight as a crack when i had completed this gyrohat i showed it to my wife and briefly explained what it was and what i meant to do with it the small but wonder fully powerful motor and the gyroscope itself were all concealed inside the hat and i explained to my wife that walsingham gribbs need but fasten the hat firmly on his head and he would never stagger again at first my wife seemed doubtful but as i continued she became more and more enthusiastic the only thing she disliked was the method of fastening the hat to the head for as it was quite necessary that the hat be very firmly fixed to the head i had sewed ear tabs to the hat and these i tied firmly under my chin my wife said she feared it would require some time to persuade the public to take to silk hats with ear tabs and that the sight of a man in a silk hat with ear tabs would be a sign that he was a staggerer she wanted an other method of holding the hat on the head vacuum suction i said for i am quick to catch an idea a man has to be in the hat business but i added where would you get the vacuum a man cannot be expected to carry a can of vacuum or whatever he would need to carry a vacuum in around with him especially the kind of man that would need the gyrohat my dear said ray wife after a minute of thought during which we both studied the gyro hat i have it let the hat make its own vacuum if the hat is lined with airtight aluminum and has a rubber sweatband and an expulsion valve the gyroscope motor could pump the air out it self it could create its own vacuum of course it could i exclaimed i could rig it up so that putting the hat on the head would start the gyroscope and the gyroscope would pump a vacuum all any staggerer would need to do would be to put on his hat and the hat would do the rest it would stay on his head and it would keep him evenly on his keel of course i would not use a nautical term like keel in my hat shop but at home i allow myself some liberties of that sort i set to work at once to perfect the gyrohat on the plan suggested by my wife and in a few days i was able to say it was a success by this i mean it was a success insofar as the eye could judge by looking at the hat and all that was needed was a practical trial as the hat had been invented for walsingham gribbs more than for any other man i proposed to my wife that walsinghamwe had spoken of him so often that we now mentioned him as walsingham should be the man to try it out but my wife is better posted in social matters than i and she said it would not do at all to attempt such a thing in the first place none of us knew walsingham and in all other places it would be insulting to suggest such a thing to him and might ruin annes chances i then assured my wife that i did not mean to allow any ordinary intoxicated man to ex periment with the only gyrohat i possessed and possibly wreck and ruin it we had too much at stake for that so after considerable discussion my wife and i decided upon what was after all the only rational coursei should try out the gyro hat myself i admit here that i am not much of a drinker although not so by principle i am by action a tee totaller i consider that the highest good of a hat shop demands it as a matter of fact i had never up to this time tasted intoxicating liquor but it was evident to my wife and me that the time had ar rived when the hat business demanded this sacri fice on my part evidently if a gyrohat is meant to keep a staggerer and reeler steady on his keel
