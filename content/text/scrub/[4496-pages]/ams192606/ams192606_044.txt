the coming of the ice it is strange to be alone and so cold to be the last man on earth the snow drives silently about me ceaselessly drearily and i am iso lated in this tiny white indistinguish able corner of a blurred world surely the loneliest creature in the universe how many thousands of years is it since i last knew the true companion ship for a long time i have been lonely but there were people creatures of flesh and blood now they are gone now i have not even the stars to keep me company for they are all lost in an infinity of snow and twilight above as the earth is lost in its grey infinity here below if only i could know how long it has been since first i âťvvas imprisoned upon the earth it cannot matter now and yet some vague dissatisfaction some faint instinct asks over and over in my throbbing ears what year what year it was in the year that the great thing be gan in my life there was then a very great man who performed operations upon his fellows to com pose their vitalswe called such men surgeons john granden wore the title sir before his name dn indication of nobility by birth according to the prevailing standards in england but surgery was only a hobby of sir johns if i must be precise for while he had achieved an enormous reputation as a surgeon he always felt that his real work lay in the experimental end of his profession he was in a way a dreamer but a dreamer who could make his dreams come true i was a very close friend of sir johns in fact we shared the same apartments in london i have never forgotten that day when he first mentioned to me his momentous discovery i had just come in from a long sleighride in the country with alice and i was seated drowsily in the windowseat writ ing idly in my mind a des cription of the wind and the snow and the grey twi light of the evening it is strange is it not that my tale should begin and end with the snow and the twilight sir john opened sudden ly a door at one end of the room and came hurrying across to another door he looked at me grinning rather like a triumphant maniac its coming he cried without pausing ive almost got it i smiled at him he looked very ludicrous at that moment what have you got i asked good lord man the secretthe secret and then he was gone again the door closing upon his victorious cry the secret i was of course amused but i was also very much interested i knew sir john well enough to realize that however amazing his appearance might be there would be nothing absurd about his secretwhatever it was but it was useless to speculate i could only hope for enlightenment at dinner so i immersed myself in one of the sur this powerful and tragic story by the author of the man from the atom tells of a man who acquired ter restrial immortalitytells of a world many centuries hencea time when everything is changed this one man remains as a relic of the th century he is alone with strangely developed human beings the product of ages of evolution climatic changes are taking place the world begins to grow cold new york is almost in the arctic region and italy is covered with snow all the year around in spite of their enormous intellectual devel opment all human beings must perish our hero alone can withstand the intense cold he wanted eternal life and he got iteternal life purely intellectual what does he do with all his years and how does lie enjoy them read this powerful story geons volumes from his fine library of imagina tion and waited i think the book was one of mr h g wells pro bably the sleeper awakes or some other of his brilliant fantasies and predictions for i was in a mood conducive to belief in almost anything when later we sat down together across the table i only wish i could give some idea of the atmosphere that permeated our apartments the reality it lent to whatever was vast and amazing and strange you could then whoever you are understand a little the ease with which i accepted sir johns new dis covery he began to explain it to me at once as though he could keep it to himself no longer did you think i had gone mad dennell he asked i quite wonder that i havent why i have been studying for many yearsfor most of my life on this problem and suddenly i have solved it or rather i am afraid i have solved another one much greater tell me about it i suggested but for gods sake dont be technical he smiled right he said then he paused dennell its magnificent it will change the whole social order of the world it will change everything that is in the world his eyes held mine suddenly with the fatality of an hypnotists dennell it is the secret of eternal life he said good lord sir john i cried half inclined to laugh i mean it he said you know i have spent most of my life studying the processes of birth trying to find out precisely what went on in the whole history of conception you have found out no that is just what amuses me i have dis covered something else without knowing yet what causes either process i dont want to be tech nical and i know very little of what actually takes place myself but i can try to give you some idea of it it is thousands per haps millions of years since sir john explained to me what little i under stood at the time i may have forgotten since yet i try to reproduce what i can of his theory in my study of the pro cesses of birth he began i discovered the rudi ments of an action which takes place in the bodies of both men and women there are certain proper ties in the foods we eat that remain in the body for the reproduction of life two distinct essences so to speak of which one is retained by the woman another by the man it is the union of these two properties that of course creates the child now i made a slight mistake one day in experi menting with a guineapig and i rearranged cer tain organs which i need not describe so that i thought i had completely messed up the poor crea tures abdomen it lived however and i laid it aside
