seidlitzmobile but the druggist had caught the contagion of his own idea diving back again behind the prescrip tion case he emerged with a bottle of acid and a large sack of bicarbonate come on he said enthusiastically well give it a good dose before mr fosdick could remonstrate further the druggist had emptied a peck of the alkali into the mixing chamber and stood ready with the bottle of acid get in the machine and get all ready to pull out he said cheerfully for when i pour in the sulphuric acid the pressure will generate very quickly mr snodgrass looked at mr fosdick and mr fosdick looked at mr snodgrass hurry said the druggist there was a compelling ring in the apothecarys voice and slowly and with the greatest of reluctance the men climbed into the machine i hope nothing happens groaned mr snod grass mr fosdick made no reply although his face was pale there was a set to his jaw that expressed a determination to stay with his machine to the end no sooner were they seated than the druggist eagerly poured in five gallons of acid and then quickly screwed down the cap there was a sudden click of the pressure gauge and the hand flew around to the extreme limit my god ejaculated mr snodgrass the in dex shows the limit of the gaugesix hundred pounds at what point is your safety set there is no safety valve confessed mr fos dick weakly i didnt think it would be necessary the pressure is fine exclaimed the druggist as his eye caught the gauge and agitating the reservoir always increases the action of the acid and catching hold of the wheel he gave the machine a vigorous shaking back and forth stop that screamed mr fosdick do you want to blow us up the druggist suddenly stopped and scratched his chin i forgot something he said cheerfully it is this the acid will eat out your brass reser voir in a few minutes and will probably blow you iinto the next county here yelled mr snodgrass let me out and he made a desperate effort to climb out of the ma chine but the frightened mr fosdick knew there was but one thing to do and that was to reduce the pressure of the reservoir by exhausting the gas through the engine with a sudden movement he threw the throttle wide open and then with the roar of a mogul engine the seidlitzmobile took down the dusty road at better than a hundredmilean hour clip never has there been such a ride chronicled in the annals of automobiling as the maiden effort of the seidlitzmobile it made the ninetythree miles between jonesboro and smiths corner in twenty seven minutes and in seven of the nine towns it passed through it was reported as a comet the other two wired the weather bureau of the visita j tion of that most unusual phenomenon of nature a dry cloudburst as the machine tore its way across the state spouting carbonic acid gas from its exhaust pipes it asphyxiated thirtyseven dogs that endeavored to pursue it and killed all vegetation on both sides of the road for a distance of two hundred yards goose creek which paralleled the road for forty miles ran pure sodawater for two weeks afterwards and it cost mr snodgrass seven thou sand dollars to have the oxygen replaced in forty three townships which he did only after suit had been filed how far the machine would have traveled is diffi cult to determine although old prof snooks mr fosdicks implacable enemy calculated that the seidlitzmobile would have gone three and a fraction times around the earth before becoming winded but as a matter of history it did not go this dis tance it made one hundred and eleven miles before the druggists prediction came true at smithers junction the reservoir exploded it changed the course of wild cat run the concussion was felt in nine states and the seismograph at the university of tokio reported an earthquake somewhere in the aleutian islands mr snodgrass and mr fosdick finally came to earth on a haystack in an adjoining township after having made an ascent of two hours and fifteen minutes missing luncheon en route the aero club of france which sent a special representative to the spot calculated their flight at something over two million kilometers and presented both men with a pilots license and an honorary membership in the club which it must be told they both refused say ing that their flight was unpremeditated and that they could not honorably accept the licenses when mr snodgrass alighted upon the haystack he found that mr fosdick had preceded him by some minutes there was a dazed dreamy look upon mr fosdicks face that somewhat alarmed his companion whats the matter fosdick he inquired shak ing him are you unconscious no replied the genius coming out of his mus ing with an appreciable effort i have just thought of a new invention well you can leave me out retorted mr snod grass sourly the end
