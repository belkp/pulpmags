 amazing stories an entire fossil of the human race actually belong ing to the quarternary period the human skull was perfectly recognizable had a soil of very peculiar nature like that of the ceme tery of st michel at bordeaux preserved it during countless ages this was the question i asked my self but which i was wholly unable to answer this head with stretched and parchmenty skin with the teeth whole the hair abundant was before our eyes as in life i stood mute almost paralyzed with wonder and awe before this dread apparition of another age my uncle who on almost every occasion was a great talker remained for a time completely dumfounded he was too full of emotion for speech to be possible after a while however we raised up the body to which the skull belonged we stood it on end it seemed to our excited imaginations to look at us with its terrible hollow eyes after some minutes of silence the man was van quished by the professor human instincts suc cumbed to scientific pride and exultation profes sor hardwigg carried away by his enthusiasm for got all the circumstances of our journey the extra ordinary position in which we were plaeed the im mense cavern which stretched far away over our heads there can be no doubt that he thought him self at the institution addressing his attentive pu pils for he put on his most doctorial style waved his hand and began gentlemen i have the honor on this auspicious occasion to present to you a man of the quarternary period of our globe many learned men have de nied his very existence while other able persons perhaps of even higher authority have affirmed their belief in the reality of his life if the st thomases of paleontology were present they would reverentially touch him with their fingers and be lieve in his existence thus acknowledging their ob stinate heresy i know that science should be care ful in relation to all discoveries of this nature i am not without having heard of the many barnums and other quacks who have made a trade of such like pretended discoveries i have of course heard of the discovery of the kneebones of ajax of the pre tended finding of the body of orestes by the spar tiates and of the body of asterius ten spans long fifteen feetof which we read in pausanias i have read everything in relation to the skele ton of trapani discovered in the fourteenth cen tury which many persons chose to regard as that of polypheums and the history of the giant dug up during the sixteenth century in the environs of palmyra you are as well aware as i am gentle men of the existence of the celebrated analysis made near lucerne in of the great bones which the celebrated doctor felix plater declared belonged to a giant about nineteen feet high i have devoured all the treatises of cassanion and all those memoirs pamphlets speeches and replies pub lished in reference to the skeleton of teutobochus king of the cimbri the invader of gaul dug out of a gravel pit in dauphiny in in the eighteenth century i should have denied with peter campet the existence of the preadamites of scheuchzer i have had in my hands the writing called gigans here my uncle was afflicted by the natural infirm ity which prevented him from pronouncing difficult words in public it was not exactly stuttering but a strange sort of constitutional hesitation the writ ing named gigans he repeated he however could get no further giganteo impossible the unfortunate word would not come out there would have been great laughter at the institution had the mistake happened there gigantosteology at last exclaimed professor hardwigg between two savage growls yes gentlemen i am well acquainted with all these matters and know also that cuvier and blumenbach fully recognized in these bones the undeniable remains of mammoths of the quaternary period but after what we now see to allow a doubt is to insult scientific inquiry there is the body you can see it you can touch it it is not a skeleton it is a complete and uninjured body pre served with an anthropological object i did not attempt to controvert this singular and astounding assertion if i could but wash this corpse in a solution of sulphuric acid continued my uncle i would un dertake to remove all the earthly particles and these resplendent shells which are incrusted all over this body but i am without this precious dissolving medium nevertheless such as it is this body will tell its own history here the professor held up the fossil body and exhibited it with rare dexterity no professional showman could have shown more activity as on examination you will see my uncle con tinued it is only about six feet in length which is a long way from the pretended giants of early days as to the particular race to which it belonged it is incontestably caucasian it is of the white race that is of our own the skull of this fossil being is a perfect ovoid without any remarkable or promi nent development of the cheek bones and without any projection of the jaw but i will advance still farther on the road of inquiry and deduction and i dare venture to say that this human sample or specimen belongs to the japhetic family which spread over the world from india to the uttermost limits of western europe there is no occasion gentlemen to smile at my remarks of course nobody smiled but the excellent pro fessor was so accustomed to beaming countenances at his lectures that he believed he saw all his au dience laughing during the delivery of his learned dissertation yes he continued with renewed animation this is a fossil man a contemporary of the mas todons with the bones of which this whole amphi theatre is covered but if i am called on to explain how he came to this place how these various strata by which he is covered have fallen into this vast cavity i can undertake to give you no explanation but there is the man surrounded by the works of his hands his hatchets and his carved flints which belong to the stone period and the only rational supposition is that like myself he visited the cen ter of the earth as a traveling tourist a pioneer of science at all events there can be no doubt of his great age and of his being one of the oldest race of human beings the professor with these words ceased his ora tion and i burst forth into loud and unanimous applause besides after all my uncle was right
