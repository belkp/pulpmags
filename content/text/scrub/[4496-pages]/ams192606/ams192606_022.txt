a trip to the center of the earth would be over my whispering gallery would be de stroyed i again therefore crawled towards the wall and said as clearly and distinctly as i could uncle hardwigg i then awaited a reply sound does not possess the property of traveling with such extreme rapidity besides the density of the air at that depth from light and motion was very far from adding to the rapidity of circulation several seconds elapsed which to my excited imag ination appeared ages and these words reached my eager ears and moved my wildly beating heart harry my boy is that you a short delay between question and answer yesyes where are you lost and your lamp out but the guiding stream is lost keep your courage harry we will do our best one moment my uncle i cried i have no longer strength to answer your questions but for heavens sakedo youcontinueto speakto me absolute silence i felt would be annihilation keep up your courage said my uncle as you are so weak do not speak we have been searching for you in all directions both by going upwards and downwards in the gallery my dear boy i had be gun to give up all hopeand you can never know what bitter tears of sorrow and regret i have shed at last supposing you to be still on the road beside the hansbach we again descended firing off guns as signals now however that we have found you and that our voices reach each other it may be a long time before we actually meet we are convers ing by means of some extraordinary acoustic ar rangement of the labyrinth but do not despair my dear boy it is something gained even to hear each other while he was speaking my brain was at work re flecting a certain undefined hope vague and shape less as yet made by heart beat wildly in the first place it was absolutely necessary for me to know one thing i once more therefore leaned my head against the wall which i almost touched with my lips and again spoke uncle my boy was his ready answer it is of the utmost consequence that we should know how far we are asunder that is not difficult you have your chronometer at hand i asked certainly well take it into your hand pronounce my name noting exactly the second at which you speak i will reply as soon as i hear your words and you will then note exactly the moment at which my reply reaches you very good and the time between my question and your answer will be double the time occupied by my voice in reaching you that is exactly what i mean uncle was my eager reply are you ready yes well make ready i am about to pronounce your name said the professor i applied my ear close to the sides of the cavern ous gallery and as soon as the word harry reached my ear i turned round and placing my lips to the wall repeated the sound forty seconds said my uncle there has elapsed forty seconds between the two words the sound therefore takes twenty seconds to ascend now allowing a thousand and twenty feet for every secondwe have twenty thousand and four hundred feeta league and a half and oneeighth these words fell on my soul like a kind of death knell a league and ahalf i muttered in a low and despairing voice it shall be got over my boy cried my uncle in a cheery tone depend on us but do you know whether to ascend or descend i asked faintly enough you have to descend and i will tell you why we have reached a vast open space a kind of bare cross road from which galleries diverge in every direc tion that in which you are now lying must neces sarily bring you to this point for it appears that all these mighty fissures these fractures of the globes interior radiate from the vast cavern which we at this moment occupy rouse yourself then have courage and continue your route walk if you can if not drag yourself alongslide if nothing else is possible the slope must be rather rapidand you will find strong arms to receive you at the end of your journey make a start like a good fellow these words served to rouse some kind of cour age in my sinking frame farewell for the present good uncle i am about to take my departure as soon as i start our voices will cease to commingle farewell then until we meet again adieu harryuntil we say welcome such were the last words which reached my anxious ears before i commenced my weary and almost hopeless journey this wonderful and surprising conversation which took place through the vast mass of the earths labyrinth these words exchanged the speak ers being about five miles apartended with hope ful and pleasant expressions i breathed one more prayer to heaven i sent up words of thanksgiving believing in my inmost heart that he had led me to the only place where the voices of my friends could reach my ears i accordingly rose to my feet but i soon found that i could not walk that i must drag myself along the slope as i expected was very rapid but i allowed myself to slip down soon the rapidity of the descent began to assume frightful proportions and menaced a fearful fall i clutched at the sides i grasped at projections of rocks i threw myself backwards all in vain my weakness was so great i could do nothing to save myself suddenly earth failed me i was first launched in to a dark and gloomy void i then struck against the projecting asperities of a vertical gallery a perfect well my head bounded against a pointed rock and i lost all knowledge of existence as far as i was concerned death had claimed me for his own
