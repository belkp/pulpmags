 amazing stories why did your watch explodeand the clock running forward in time unwinds a clock doesnt it asked arthur it follows of course that when you move it backward in time it winds up when you move it too far back you wind it so tightly that the spring just breaks to pieces he paused a moment his fingers on his pulse yes it takes about fifteen seconds for all the four seasons to pass that means were going back ward in time about four years a minute if we go on at this rate in another hour well be back in the time of the northmen and will be able to tell if they did discover america after all funny we dont hear any noises estelle ob served she had caught some of arthurs calmness it passes so quickly that though our ears hear it we dont separate the sounds if youll notice you do hear a sort of humming its very highpitched though estelle listened but could hear nothing no matter said arthur its probably a little higher than your ears will catch lots of people cant hear a bat squeak i never could said estelle out in the coun try where i come from other people could hear them but i couldnt they stood a while in silence watching when are we going to stop asked estelle un easily it seems as if were going to keep on indefinitely i guess well stop all right arthur reassured her its obvious that whatever it was it only af fected our own building or wed see some other one with us it looks like a fault or a flaw in the rock the building rests on and that can only give so far estelle was silent for a moment oh i cant be sane she burst out semihyster ically this cant be happening you arent crazy said arthur sharply youre sane as i am just something queer is happening buck up say your multiplication tables say any thing you know say something sensible and youll know youre all right but dont get frightened now therell be plenty to get frightened about later the grimness in his tone alarmed estelle what are you afraid of she asked quickly time enough to worry when it happens arthur retorted briefly youyou arent afraid well go back before the beginning of the world are you asked estelle in sudden access of fright arthur shook his head tell me said estelle more quietly getting a grip on herself i wont mind but please tell me arthur glanced at her her face was pale but there was more resolution in it than he had expected to find ill tell you then he said reluctantly were going back a little faster than we were and the flaw seems to be a deeper one than i thought at the roughest kind of an estimate were all of a thousand years before the discovery of america now and i think nearer three or four and were gaining speed all the time so though i am as sure as i can be of anything that well stop this cavein eventually i dont know where its like a crevasse in the earth opened by an earthquake which may be only a few feet deep or it may be hundreds of yards or even a mile or two we started off smoothly were going at a terrific rate what will happen when we stop estelle caught her breath what she asked quietly i dont know said arthur in an irritated tone to cover his apprehension how could i know estelle turned from him to the window again look she said pointing the flickering had begun again while they stared hope springing up once more in their hearts it became more pronounced soon they could dis tinctly see the difference between day and night they were slowing up the white snow on the ground remained there for an appreciable time autumn lasted quite a while they could catch the flashes of the sun as it made its revolutions now instead of its seeming likd a ribbon of fire at last day lasted all of fifteen or twenty minutes it grew longer and longer then half an hour then an hour the sun wavered in midheaven and was still far

made a dash for the elevators fortunately one was standing still the door open on their floor the elevatorboy had deserted his post and was looking with all the rest at the strange landscape that surrounded them no sooner had the pair reached the car however than the boy came hurrying along the corridor three or four other people following him also at a run without a word the boy rushed inside the others crowded after him and the car shot down ward all of the newcomers panting from their sprint theirs was the first car to reach the bottom they rushed out and to the western door here where they had been accustomed to see madison square spread out before them a clearing of perhaps half an acre in extent showed itself where their eyes instinctively looked for the dark bronze fountain near which soapbox orators afore time held sway they saw a tent a wigwam of hides and bark gaily painted and before the wigwam were two or three brownskinned indians utterly petrified with astonishment
