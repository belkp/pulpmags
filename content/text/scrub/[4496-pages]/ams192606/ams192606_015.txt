 amazing stories my uncle nor i could have undertaken our impa tience was so great that if we had once begun with pickax and crowbar the rock would soon have split into a hundred fragments the guide on the con trary calm ready moderate wore away the hard rock by little steady blows of his instrument mak ing no attempt at a larger hole than about six inches as i stood i heard or thought i heard the roar of the torrent momentarily increasing in loud ness and at times i almost felt the pleasant sensa tion of water upon my parched lips at the end of what appeared an age hans had made a hole which enabled his crowbar to enter two feet into the solid rock he had been at work ex actly an hour it appeared a dozen i was getting wild with impatience my uncle began to think of using more violent measures i had the greatest difficulty in checking him he had indeed just got hold of his crowbar when a loud and welcome hiss was heard then a stream or rather a jet of water burst through the wall and came out with such force as to hit the opposite side hans the guide who was half upset by the shock was scarcely able to keep down a cry of pain and grief i understood his meaning when plung ing my hands into the sparkling jet i myself gave a wild and frantic cry the water was scalding hot boiling i cried in bitter disappointment well never mind said my uncle it will soon get cool the tunnel began to be filled by clouds of vapor while a small stream ran away into the interior of the earth in a short time we had some sufficiently cool to drink we swallowed it in huge mouthfuls oh what exalted delightwhat rich and incom parable luxury what was this water whence did it come to us what was that the simple fact was it was water and though still with a tinge of warmth about it it brought back to the heat that life which but for it must surely have faded away i drank greedily almost without tasting it fâť when i had almost quenched by ravenous thirst i made a discovery why it is ferruginous water most excellent stomachic replied my uncle and highly mineralized here is a journey worth twenty to spa its very good i replied i should think so water found six miles under ground there is a peculiarly inky flavor about it which is by no means disagreeable hans may con gratulate himself on having made a rare discovery what do you say nephew according to the usual custom of travelers to name the stream after him good said i and the name of hansbach was at once agreed upon hans was not a bit more proud after hearing our determination than he was before after having taken a very small modicum of the welcome refresh ment he had seated himself in a corner with his usual imperturable gravity now said i it is not worth while letting this water run to waste what is the use replied my uncle the source from which this river rises is inexhaustible never mind i continued let us fill our goat skin and gourds and then try to stop the opening up my plan after some hesitation was followed or attempted hans picked up all the broken pieces of granite he had knocked out and using some tow he happened to have about him tried to shut up the fissure he had made in the wall all he did was tc scald his hands the pressure was too great and ali our attempts were utter failures it is evident i remarked that the upper sur face of these springs is situated at a very great height aboveas we may fairly infer from the great pressure of the jet that is by no means doubtful replied my uncle if this column of water is about thirtyiwo thous and feet high the pressure per square inch must be something enormous but a new idea has just struck me and what is that why be at so much trouble to close this aper ture because i hesitated and stammered having no real reason when our water bottles are empty we are not at all sure that we shall be able to fill them ob served my uncle i think that is very probable well then let this water run it will of course naturally follow in our track and will serve to guide and refresh us i think the idea a good one i cried in reply and with this rivulet as a companion there is no further reason why we should not succeed in our marvellous project ah my boy said the professor laughing after all you are coming round more than that i am now confident of ultimate success forward one moment nephew mine let us begin by taking some hours of repose i had utterly forgotten that it was night the chronometer however informed me of the fact soon we were sufficiently restored and refreshed and had all fallen into a profound sleep chapter xxi under the ocean by the next day we had nearly forgotten our past sufferings the first sensation i ex perienced was surprise at not being thirsty and i actually asked myself the reason the run ning stream which flowed in rippling wavelets at my feet was the satisfactory reply we breakfasted with a good appetite and then drank our fill of the excellent water i felt myself quite a new man ready to go anywhere my uncle chose to lead i began to think why should not a man as seriously convinced as my uncle succeed with so excellent a guide as worthy hans and so devoted a nephew as myself these were the bril liant ideas which invaded my brain had the prop osition now been made to go back to the summit of mount sneffels i should have declined the offer in a most indignant manner but unfortunately there was no question of going up we were about to descend farther into the interior of the earth let us be moving i cried awakening the echoes of the old world we resumed our march on thursday at eight oclock in the morning the great granite tunnel went round by sinuous and winding ways present
