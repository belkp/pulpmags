 amazing stories telescope and speaking as if he were in a lecture room how can that be yes it is so the first of these hideous monsters has the snout of a porpoise the head of a lizard the teeth of a crocodile and it is this that has de ceived us it is the most fearful of all antediluvian reptiles the worldrenowned ichthyosaurus or great fish lizard and the other the other is a monstrous serpent concealed under the hard vaulted shell of the turtle the ter rible enemy of its fearful rival the plesiosaurus or sea crocodile hans was quite right the two monsters only disturbed the surface of the sea at last have mortal eyes gazed upon two reptiles of the great primitive ocean i saw the flaming red eyes of the ichthyosaurus each as big or bigger than a mans head nature in its infinite wisdom had gifted this wondrous marine animal with an optical apparatus of extreme power capable of resisting the pressure of heavy layers of water which rolled over him in the depth of the ocean where he usually fed it has by some authors truly been called the whale of the saurian race for it is as big and quick in its motions as our king of the seas this one measured not less than a hundred feet in length and i could form some idea of his girth when i saw him lift his prodigious tail out of the waters his jaw is of awful size and strength and according to the bestinformed naturalists it does not contain less than a hundred and eightytwo teeth the other was the mighty plesiosaurus a serpent with a cylindrical trunk a short stumpy tail and fins like a bank of oars in a roman galley its whole body was covered by a carapace or shell and its neck as flexible as that of a swan rose more than thirty feet above the waves a tower of ani mated flesh these animals attacked one another with incon ceivable fury such a combat was never seen be fore by mortal eyes and to us who did see it it ap peared more like the phantasmagoric creation of a dream than anything else they raised mountains of water which dashed in spray over the raft al ready tossed to and fro by the waves twenty times we seemed on the point of being upset and hurled headlong into the waves hideous hisses appeared to shake the gloomy granite roof of that mighty cavernhisses which carried terror to our hearts the awful combatants held each other in a tight embrace i could not make out one from the other still the combat could not last for ever and woe unto us whichsoever became the victor one hour two hours three hours passed away without any decisive result the struggle continued with the same stark tenacity but without apparent result the deadly opponents now approached now drew away from the raft once or twice we fancied they were about to leave us altogether but instead of that they came nearer and nearer we crouched on the raft ready to fire at them at a moments notice poor as the prospect of hurting or terrifying them was still we were determined not to perish without a struggle suddenly the ichthyosaurus and the plesiosaurus disappeared beneath the waves leaving behind them a maelstrom in the midst of the sea we were very nearly drawn down by the indraught of the water several minutes elapsed before anything was again seen was this wonderful combat to end in the depths of the ocean was the last act of this terrible drama to take place without specta tors it was impossible for us to say suddenly at no great distance from us an enorm ous mass rose out of the watersthe head of the great plesiosaurus the terrible monster was wounded unto death i could see nothing of his enormous body ah that could be distinguished was his serpentlike neck which he twisted and curled in all the agonies of death now he struck the waters with it as if it had been a gigantic whip and then again wriggled like a worm cut in two the water was spurted up to a great distance in all directions a great portion of it swept over our raft and nearly blinded us but soon the end of the beast approached nearer and neaxer his movements slackened visibly his contortions almost ceased and at last the body of the mighty snake lay an inert dead mass on the surface of the now calm and placid waters as for the ichthyosaurus has he gone down to his mighty cavern under the sea to rest or will he reappear to destroy us this question remained unanswered meanwhile we had breathing time chapter xxxi the sea monster ednesday august fortunately the wind which at the present blows with great violence allowed us to escape from the scene of the unparalleled and extraordinary struggle hans with his usual impertuibable calm remained at the helm my uncle who for a short time had been withdrawn from his absorbing reverie by the novel incidents of this seafight fell back appar ently into a brown study all this time however his eyes were fixed impatiently on the widespread ocean our voyage now became monotonous and uniform dull as it has become i have no desire to have it broken by any repetition of the perils and adven tures of yesterday thursday august the wind is now n n e and blows very irregularly it has changed to fitful gusts the temperature is exceedingly high we are now progressing at the average rate of about ten miles and a half per hour about twelve oclock a distant sound as of thunder fell upon our ears i make a note of the fact without even venturing a suggestion as to its cause it was one continuous roar as of a sea falling over mighty rocks far off in the distance said the professor dog matically there is some rock or some island against which the sea lashed to fury by the wind is break ing violently hans without saying a word clambered to the top of the mast but could make out nothing the ocean was level in every direction as far as the eye could reach three hours passed without any sign to indicate what might be before us the sound began to as sume that of a mighty cataract i expressed my
