 amazing stories ling steam rose in ghostly wreaths from the black waves that plunged incessantly speckled with storm tossed ships and then came a wonder it seemed to those who in europe watched for the rising of the star that the world must have ceased its rotation in a thousand open spaces of down and upland the people who had fled thither from the floods and the falling houses and sliding slopes of hill watched for that rising in vain hour followed hour through a terrible sus pense and the star rose not once again men set their eyes upon the old constellations they had coun ted lost to them forever in england it was hot and clear overhead though the ground quivered perpetu ally but in the tropics sirius and capella and alde baran showed through a veil of steam and when at last the great star rose near ten hours late the sun rose close upon it and in the center of its white heart was a disk of black over asia the star had begun to fall behind the movement of the sky and then suddenly as it hung over india its light had been veiled all the plain of india from the mouth of the indus to the mouths of the ganges was a shallow waste of shining water that night out of which rose temples and palaces mounds and hills black with people every minaret was a clustering mass of people who fell one by one into the turbid waters as heat and terror overcame them the whole land seemed awailing and sud denly there swept a shadow across that furnace of despair and a breath of cold wind and a gathering of clouds out of the cooling air men looking up nearly blinded at the star and sav that black disk creeping across the light it was the moon coming between the star and the earth and even as men cried to god at this respite out of the east with a strange inexplicable swiftness sprang the sun and then star sun and moon rushed together across the heavens so it was that presently to the european watch ers star and sun rose close upon each other drove headlong for a space and then slower and at last came to rest star and sun merged into one glare of flame at the zenith of the sky the moon no longer eclipsed the star but was lost to sight in the brilli ance of the sky and though those who were still alive regarded it for the most part with that dull stupidity that hunger fatigue heat and despair engender there were still men who could perceive the meaning of these signs star and earth had been at their nearest had swung about one another and the star had passed already it was receding swifter and swifter in the last stage of its head long journey downward into the sun and then the clouds gathered blotting out the vision of the sky the thunder and lightning wove a garment around the world all over the earth was such a downpour of rain as men had never seen before and where the volcanoes flared red against the cloud canopy there descended torrents of mud everywhere the waters were pouring off the land leaving mud stilted ruins and the earth littered like a stormworn beach with all that had floated and the dead bodies of the men and brutes its children for days the water streamed off the land sweep ing away soil and trees and houses in the way and piling huge dikes and scooping out titanic gullies over the countryside those were the days of dark ness that followed the star and the heat all through them and for many weeks and months the earthquakes continued but the star had passed and men hungerdriven and gathering courage only slowly might creep back to their ruined cities buried granaries and sodden fields such few ships as had escaped the storms of that time came stunned and shattered and sound ing their way cautiously through the new marks and shoals of once familiar ports and as the storms subsided men perceived that everywhere the days were hotter than of yore and the sun larger and the moon shrunk to a third of its former size took now fourscore days between its new and new but of the new brotherhood that grew presently among men of the saving of laws and books and machines of the strange change that had come over iceland and greenland the shores of baffins bay so that the sailors coming there presently found them green and gracious and could scarce believe their eyes this story does not tell nor of the movement of mankind now that the earth was hotter north ward and southward towards the poles of the earth it concerns itself only with the coming and the passing of the star the martian astronomersfor there are astrono mers on mars although they are different beings from menwere naturally profoundly interested by these things they saw them from their own standpoint of course considering the mass and temperature of the missile that was flung through our solar system into the sun one wrote it is astonishing what little damage the earth which it missed so narrowly has sustained all the familiar continental markings and the masses of the seas remain intact and indeed the only difference seems to be a shrinkage of the white discoloration sup posed to be frozen water round either pole which only shows how small the vastest of human catastrophies may seem at a distance of a
