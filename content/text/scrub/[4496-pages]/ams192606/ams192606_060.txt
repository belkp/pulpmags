whispering ether friction been transformed into or has produced a physical manifestation his voice sank to a whisper it is this fact that makes my great invention possible the friction set up produces faint currents of electricity it is natures own generator the currents are faint weak but they are there and they vary in in tensity in proportion as the rushing blood stream surges and ebbs thus they have imprinted on them all the characteristics of the thought that gives rise to them they vary in the individual some minds can generate a current one hundredyes one thou sandtimes greater than others but all minds generate to some extent and these electrical impulses are thrown out into space in wave trains exactly as the radio tele graph throws them out this accounts for the phenomena of mental telepathy if conditions are just right the receiving mind in perfect tune with the transmitting mind and sensitive enough to interpret the received impulses you have accom plished telepathy all that remained for me to do was to measure the intensity and characteristics of the generated current its frequencyand it is high and he paused and fixt me with that fishy stare i didnt know just what to say so i took a brody and what doc slip it to me quick and the length of the emitted wave he comes back at me triumphantly it might be one mil lionth of a meter or it might be one million meters or it might be any length between those extremes or beyond them for that matter i succeeded in making these measurements he laughed or rather he laughed and snarled all at once im telling you straight fellow your hair stands on end when proctor laughs like that i fancy some of your radio experts would gape if they were permitted to see my wave meter i be lieve it would cause some excitement in the labora tories of lodge or marconi iproctori measured these waves which of course means that i found a detector for them our friend deforest thinks that he has a monopoly on ultrasensitive detectors proctors detector is to the audion what a stop watch is to a wheel barrow and the frequency it is beyond the limits of audibility as that term is understood i wound phones that will render the received signals audible and the task was done most of that stuff had gone over but like a light ning flash the big idea burst thru my shrapnel proof cranium i fairly stuttered as i got his drift ill bet my eyes popped as i gaped at that machine good god i spluttered do you mean that that thing can hear you think proctor smiled the nearest to a human smile that i ever saw on his mug you have glimmerings of intelligence he said in a gratified way i mean just that and then he went off his handle again and i mean he roared that you are to go back to the scum that sent you and tell them that it is useless for them to plot against me for i can hear their very thoughts as they think them i can read their miserable souls thats how i knew you were com ing here tonight thats how i knew that your lethal weapon contained no charge and he seized me and shook me until my heels nearly broke my neck and thats how i know you swine that even now you dont know whether to believe me or not he released me and tore the telephone things from off his ears here he bellowed clamping them over my ears here listen and be con vinced he wheeled to the table and whirled knobs and dials a continuous humming and buzzing sounded in the phones and then it happened listen to me close i know they labeled proctor squirrel food for telling them less than this but this was jidy of get that suddenly something like a voiceno not like a voice eitherlike a voice inside my own head if you can get me said masterfully with a strong ger man accent serbia mil because she dare not sub mit france must because she will see my hand behind it england must as a last desperate effort to save herself but my armies will grind them like grain in the mill and then proctor tore the phones from me i was like a stuffed doll and i never raised a mitt he grabbed me and it was just like being caught in the jaws of a vise you have heard he thundered now go the last thing i remember was that he heaved me toward the door i remember spinning toward it and thats all the next thing i remember is waking up in that hospital ward it was july of when proctor chucked me and it was late august when i found myself in that hospital as near as i can learn i missed the door hit the wall and a bottle of that chero stuff got knocked off a shelf they dug proctor and i out of the ruins and we were both pretty well messed up proctor raved about his ruined mind machine and it got him a pass to the squirrel cage if you read the papers at the time youll remem ber proctor wanted me to back him up but i wouldnt talk least said easiest remedied now you got all i know about it i spilled it once to gentleman joe a highbrowed crook who soaked up all they pass you at harvard when he was young joe said maybe proctor fooled me with a camoflaged phonograph maybe he did i might think so myself if it had happened in september instead of july get me the end
