 amazing stories what i cried rising in astonishment did you say the tide uncle certainly i did you do not mean to say i replied in a tone of respectful doubt that the influence of the sun and moon is felt here below and pray why not are not all bodies influ enced by the law of universal attraction why should this vast underground sea be exempt from the general law the rule of the universe be sides there is nothing like that which is proved and demonstrated despite the great atmospheric pressure down here you will notice that this in land sea rises and falls with as much regularity as the atlantic itself as my uncle spoke we reached the sandy shore and saw and heard the waves breaking monoton ously on the beach they were evidently rising this is truly the flood i cried looking at the water at my feet yes my excellent nephew replied my uncle rubbing his hands with the gusto of a philosopher and you see by these several streaks of foam that the tide rises at least ten or twelve feet it is indeed marvelous by no means he responded on the contrary it is quite natural it may appear so in your eyes my dear uncle was my reply but the whole group of phenomena of the place appear to me to partake of the mar velous it is almost impossible to believe that which i see who in his wildest dreams could have imagined that beneath the crust of our earth there cotld exist a real ocean with ebbing and flowing tides with its changes of winds and even its storms i for one should have laughed the suggestion to scorn but harry my boy why not inquired my uncle with a pitying smile is there any physical reason in opposition to it not if we give up the great theory of the cen tral heat of the earth that point once granted i certainly can see no reason for doubting the existence of seas and other wonders even coun tries in the interior of the globe that is sobut of course these varied coun tries are uninhabited well i grant that it is more likely than not still i do not see why this sea should not have given shelter to some species of unknown fish hitherto we have not discovered any and the probabilities are rather against our ever doing so observed the professor i was losing my skepticism in the presence of these wonders well i am determined to solve the question it is my intention to try my luck with my fishing line and hook certainly make the experiment said my uncle pleased with my enthusiasm while we are about it it will certainly be only proper to discover all the secrets of this extraordinary region but after all where are we now i asked all this time i have quite forgotten to ask you a question which doubtless your philosophical in struments have long since answered well replied the professor examining the situation from only one point of view we are now distant three hundred and fifty leagues from ice land so much was my exclamation i have gone over the matter several times and am sure not to havo made a mistake of five hun dred yards replied my uncle positively and as to the directionare we still going to the southeast yes with a western declination of nineteen degrees fortytwo minutes just as it is above as for the inclination i have discovered a very curious fact what may that be uncle your information interests me why that the needle instead of dipping towards the pole as it does on earth in the northern hemis phere has an upward tendency this proves i cried that the great point of magnetic attraction lies somewhere between the surface of the earth and the spot we have suc ceeded in reaching exactly my observant nephew exclaimed my uncle elated and delighted and it is quite prob able that if we succeed in getting toward the polar regionssomewhere near the seventythird degree of latitude where sir james ross discovered the magnetic pole we shall behold the needle point directly upward we have therefore discovered that this great center of attraction is not situated at a very great depth well said i rather surprised this discovery will astonish experimental philosophers it was never suspected science great mighty and in the end uner ring replied my uncle dogmatically science has fallen into many errorserrors which have been fortunate and useful rather than otherwise for they have been the steppingstones to truth after some further discussion i turned to an other matter have you any idea of the depth we have reached we are now continued the professor ex actly thirtyfive leaguesabove a hundred miles down into the interior of the earth so said i after measuring the distance on the map we are now beneath the scottish highlands and have over our heads the lofty grampian hills you are quite right said the professor laugh ing it sounds very alarming the weight being heavybut the vault which supports this vast mass of earth and rock is solid and safethe mighty architect of the universe has constructed it of solid materials man even in his highest flights of vivid and poetic imagination never thought of such things what are the finest arches of our bridges what the vaulted roofs of our cathedrals to that mighty dome above us and beneath which floats an ocean with its storms and calms and tides i admire it all as much as you can uncle and have no fear that our granite sky will fall upon our heads but now that we have discussed mat ters of science and discovery what are your future intentions are you not thinking of getting back to the surface of our beautiful earth this was said more as a feeler than with any hope of suc cess go back nephew cried my uncle in a tone of
