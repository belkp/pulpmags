 amazing stories im an engineer he finished what nature can do we can imitate nature let us into this hole well climb out in the mean time matters are serious we neednt be afraid of not getting back well do that what weve got to fight isstarva tion planning for the foodsupply weve got to fight starvation and weve got to beat it arthur continued dogged ly im telling you this now because i want you to begin right at the beginning and pitch in to help we have very little food and a lot of us to eat it first i want some volunteers to help with rationing next i want every ounce of food in this place put under guard where it can be served to those who need it most who will help the swift succession of shocks had paralyzed the faculties of most of the people there but half a dozen moved forward among them was a single grayhaired man with an air of accustomed au thority arthur recognized him as the president of the bank on the ground floor i dont know who you are or if youre right in saying what has happened said the grayhaired man but i see somethings got to be done and well for the time being ill take your word for what that is later on well thrash this matter out arthur nodded he bent over and spoke in a low voice to the grayhaired man who moved away grayson walters terhune simpson and for sythe come here the grayhaired man called at a doorway a number of men began to press dazedly toward him arthur resumed his harangue you peoplethose of you who arent too dazed to thinkare remembering theres a restaurant in the building and no need to starve youre wtong there are nearly two thousand of us here that means six thousand meals a day weve got to have nearly ten tons of food a day and weve got to have it at once hunt someone suggested i saw indians some one else shouted can we trade with them we can hunt and we can trade with the indians arthur admitted but we need food by the tonby the ton people the indians dont store up sup plies and besides theyre much too scattered to have a surplus for us but weve got to have food now how many of you know anything about hunt ing fishing trapping or any possible way of get ting food there were a few hands raisedpitifully few arthur saw estelles hand up very well he said those of you who raised your hands then come with me up on the second floor and well talk it over the rest of you try to conquer your fright and dont go outside for a while weve got some things to attend to before it will be quite safe for you to venture out and keep away from the restaurant there are armed guards over that food before we pass it out indis criminately well see to it theres more for tomor row and the next day he stepped down from the counter and moved toward the stairway it was not worth while to use the elevator for the ride of only one floor estelle managed to join him and they mounted the steps together do you think well pull through all right she asked quietly weve got to arthur told her setting his chin firmly weve simply got to the grayhaired president of the bank was wait ing for them at the top of the stairs my name is van deventer he said shaking hands with arthur who gave his own name where shall our emergency council sit he asked the bank has a board room right over the safety vault i dare say we can accommodate everybody thereeverybody in the council anyway arthur followed into the boardroom and the others trooped in after him im just assuming temporary leadership ar thur explained because its imperative some things be done at once later on we can talk about electing officials to direct our activities right now we need food how many of you can shoot about a quarter of the hands were raised es telles was among the number and how many are fishermen a few more went up what do the rest of you do there was a chorus of gardener i have a garden in my yard i grow peaches in new jer sey and three men confessed that they raised chickens as a hobby well want you gardeners in a little while dont go yet but the most important are huntsmen and fishermen have any of you weapons in your offices a number had revolvers but only one man had a shotgun and shells i was going on my vacation this afternoon straight from the office he explained and have all my vacation tackle good man arthur exclaimed youll go after the heavy game with a shotgun the sportsman asked aghast if you get close to them a shotgun will do as well as anything and we cant waste a shell on every bird or rabbit those shells of yours are precious you other fellows will have to turn fishermen for a while your pistols are no good for hunting the watchmen at the bank have riot guns said van deventer and there are one or two repeating rifles there i dont know about ammunition good i dont mean about the ammunition but about the guns well hope for the ammunition you fishermen get to work to improvise tackle out of anything you can get hold of will you do that a series of nods answered his question now for the gardeners you people will have to roam through the woods in company with the hun ters and locate anything in the way of edibles that grows do all of you know what wild plants look like i mean wild fruits and vegetables that are good to eat a few of them nodded but the majority looked dubious the consensus of opinion seemed to be that they would try arthur seemed a little dis couraged i guess youre the man to tell about the restaur ant van deventer said quietly and as this is the food commission or something of that sort
