the malignant entity mcgraw asked its too ghastly a thing to believe im afraid it is replied dr dorp the chief knelt and examined the star on the bag ging blue coat its hellish positively hellish he said rising do you know what killed him we are working on a theory began the doctor but was interrupted by the chief theories be damned he snapped work on your theories if you want to this thing has gone too far im going to get some facts he swung on the four men behind him search the house he said look sharp foi nything of a suspicious nature an infernal machine perhaps or a blood sucking animal there is a mankiller of some kind human or otherwise hidden in this house and its our business to find it when the men had departed he stepped over rooneys skeleton ill search this room myself he said he did with professional thoroughness looking for hidden panels and sounding the walls both in the open areas and behind the shelves for hollow spaces then he began opening the drawers in a tall cabinet that stood in one corner disclosing sur gical and dissecting instruments of various kinds an indexed set of microscope slides with some extra lenses platinum dishes porcelain drying pans crucibles glass rods and tubing pipettes rubber tubing and stoppers rubber gloves and aprons and other miscellaneous laboratory paraphernalia the bottom drawer of the cabinet was quite large and deep the chief cried out excitedly when he saw its contents good lord look at that he exclaimed it was filled to the top with dry white bones nothing but the bones of small animals said dr dorp picking up a skull this for instance is the skull of a dog then taking up another here is the skull of a rabbit notice the charac teristic chiselshaped teeth this one beside it once supported the bewhiskered countenance of a com mon house cat what do you suppose he was doing with them asked the chief it is my belief that they were brought here to be killed and devoured by the same thing that killed the professor and rooney and that thing is at present merely a shadowy theory although it most certainly has an existence there is a power in this house that is a menace to everyone under this roofa malignant entity that destroys human beings in some mysterious manner unparal leled in the annals of science or human experience this much we know reasoning from effects rea soning from possible causes we are aware that the hobby of professor townsend was the endeavor to create a living thing from inorganic matter and putting the two together it seems to me that the logical hypothesis would be that he either succeed ed in creating a monster of a sort unknown to biologists or discovered and developed unheard of powers and habits in a creature already known if theres such a thing in this house believe me im going to find it said the chief stamping out of the room now that we have a few moments to ourselves said dr dorp when mcgraw had departed let us conduct a search or rather an inquiry on our own account i perceive that we have a very excellent compound microscope at our disposal and am curious to examine the liquid whichhas so myster iously risen and changed color in the tank he took a blank slide from the cabinet drawer and a small glass rod from the table as he was about to dip the rod in the liquid he uttered a low exclamation of surprise whats up now i asked this amazing liquid has again become trans parent he replied the red tint is gone he plunged the tip of the rod into the viscous liquid twisted it slightly and withdrew it al though the liquid seemed quite heavy it slipped from the end of the rod much after the manner of the white of an egg after considerable juggling he succeeded in obtaining a small amount which he smeared on the slide he then placted the slide in position and adjusted the microscope with a prac ticed hand well i asked after he had peered into the eye piece for a full ten minutes what is the stuff any way here look for yourself he replied what i saw in the field of the microscope ap peared to be a mesh work or foam work of exceed ingly fine bubbles or perhaps globules granules of different sizes and shapes seemed imbedded in these globules and the whole was dotted at inter vals with small white objects while i watched several of these white objects seemed to dissolve and disappear all of them apparently were en dowed with life for i noticed that they expanded or contracted spasmodically and seemed endeavor ing to push their way through the surrounding bubbles seems to be a sort of foam i said with some thing alive floating in it the foam as you call it bears a singular re semblance to the basic life principle protoplasm when seen under the microscope replied the doc tor but those white things i began the white things he went on are the living remnants of a complex organism that has been de stroyed they are waging an unequal and hopeless battle against assimilation by the globules that sur round them these faithful guardians of the or ganism when alive still fight and will continue to fight the enemy until figuratively speaking the last man falls but what are they i demanded unless i am very much mistaken he replied they are his answer was cut short by the appearance of chief mcgraw coroner and jury are downstairs he said terse ly i suppose theyll want your testimony ill leave a couple of men on guard here if you want to come down let us go down to the study and complete our perusal of the professors manuscripts while the jury is in session said the doctor we can thus save considerable time and will be on hand when they are ready to question us we met coroner haynes and his jurors at the
