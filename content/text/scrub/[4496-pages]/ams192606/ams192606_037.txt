 amazing stories i stood pale and shuddering in the dazzling light and heat it pirouetted round my feet which i en deavored to withdraw an odor of nitrous gas filled the whole air it penetrated to the throat to the lungs i felt ready to choke why is it that i cannot withdraw my feet are they riveted to the flooring of the raft no the fall of the electric globe has turned all the iron on board into loadstonesthe instruments the tools the arms are clanging together with awful and horrible noise the nails of my heavy boots ad here closely to the plate of iron imbedded in the wood i cannot withdraw my foot at last by a violent and almost superhuman ef fort i tear it away just as the ball which is still executing its gyratory motions is about to run round it and drag me with itif what intense stupendous light the globe of fire burstswe are enveloped in cascades of living fire which flood the space around with luminous matter then all went out and darkness once more fell upon the deep i had just time to see my uncle once more cast apparently senseless on the flooring of the raft hans at the helm spitting fire under the influence of the electricity which seemed to have gone through him tuesday august i have just come out of a long fainting fit the awful and hideous storm still continues the lightning has increased in vividness and pours out its fiery wrath like a brook of ser pents let loose in the atmosphere are we still upon the sea yes and being car ried along with incredible velocity we have passed under england under the channel under france probably under the whole extent of europe another awful clamor in the distance this time it is certain that the sea is breaking upon the rocks at no great distance then chapter xxxiii our route reversed here ends what i call my journal of our voyage on board the raft which journal was happily saved from the wreck i pro ceed with my narrative as i did before i commenced my daily notes what happened when the terrible shock took place when the raft was cast upon the rocky shore it would be impossible for me now to say i felt my self precipitated violently into the boiling waves and if i escaped from a certain and cruel death it was wholly owing to the determination of the faith ful hans who clutching me by the arm saved me from the yawning abyss the courageous icelander then carried me in his powerful arms far out of the reach of tne waves and laid me down upon a burning expanse of sand where i found myself some time afterwards in the company of my uncle the professor then hans quietly returned towards the fatal rocks against which the furious waves were beating in order to save any stray waifs from the wreck this man was always practical and thoughtful could not utter a word i was quite overcome with emotion my whole body was broken and bruised with fatigue it took hours before i was anything like myself meanwhile there fell a fear ful deluge of rain drenching us to the skin its very violence however proclaimed the approaching end of the storm some overhanging rocks afforded us a slight protection from the torrents under this shelter hans prepared some food which however i was unable to touch exhausted by the three weary days and nights of watching we fell into a deep and painful sleep my dreams were fearful but at last exhausted nature asserted her supremacy and i slumbered next day when i awoke the change was magical the weather was magnificent air and sea as if by mutual consent had regained their serenity every trace of the storm even the faintest had disap peared i was saluted on my awakening by the first joyous tones i had heard from the professor for many a day his gayety indeed was something terrible well my lad he cried rubbing his hands together have you slept soundly might it not have been supposed that we were in the old house on the konigstrasse that i had just come down quietly to my breakfast and that my marriage with gretchen was to take place that very day my uncles coolness was exasperating alas considering how the tempest had driven us in an easterly direction we we had passed under the whole of germany under the city of hamburg where i had been so happy under the very street which contained all i loved and cared for in the world it was a positive fact that i was only sepa rated from her by a distance of forty leagues but these forty leagues were of hard impenetrable gran ite all these dreary and miserable reflections passed through my mind before i attempted to answer my uncles question why what is the matter he cried cannot you say whether you have slept well or not i have slept very well was my reply but every bone in my body aches i suppose that will lead to nothing nothing at all my boy it is only the result of the fatigue of the last few daysthat is all you appearif i may be allowed to say soto be very jolly this morning i said delighted my dear boy delighted was never happier in my life we have at last reached the wishedfor port the end of our expedition cried i in a tone of considerable surprise no but to the confines of that sea which i be gan to fear would never end but go round the whole world we will now tranquilly resume our journey by land and once again endeavor to dive into the center of the earth my dear uncle i began in a hesitating kind of way allow me to ask you one question certainly harry a dozen if you think proper one will suffice how about getting back i asked how about getting back what a question to ask we have not as yet reached the end of our journey i know that all i want to know is how you propose we shall manage the return voyage in the most simple manner in the world said
