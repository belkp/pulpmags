the coming of the ice passionlove between two cold intellects i do not know i did not ask then i accepted anything that would make our way more easy there is no need to draw out the tale already my hand wavers and my time grows short soon there will be no more of me no more of my tale no more of mankind there will be only the snow and the ice and the cold three days later i entered sir johns hospital with alice on my arm all my affairsand they were few enoughwere in order i had insisted that alice wait until i had come safely through the operation before she submitted to it i had been carefully starved for two days and i was lost in an unreal world of white walls and white clothes and white lights drunk with my dreams of the future when i was wheeled into the operating room on the long hard table for a moment it shone with bril liant distinctness a neat methodical white chamber tall and more or less circular then i was beneath the glare of soft white lights and the room faded into a misty vagueness from which little steel rays flashed and quivered from silvery cold instruments for a moment our hands sir johns and mine gripped and we were saying goodbyefor a little whilein the way men say these things then i felt the warm touch of alices lips upon mine and i felt sudden painful things that i cannot describe that i could not have described then for a moment i felt that i must rise and cry out that i could not do it but the feeling passed and i was passive something was pressed about my mouth and nose something with an etherial smell staring eyes swam about me from behind their white masks i strug gled instinctively but in vaini was held securely infinitesimal points of light began to wave back and forth on a pitchblack background a great hollow buzzing echoed in my head my head seemed sud denly to have become all throat a great cavernous empty throat in which sounds and lights were mingled together in a swift rhythm approaching receding eternally then i think there were dreams but i have forgotten them i began to emerge from the effect of the ether everything was dim but i could perceive alice be side me and sir john bravely done sir john was saying and alice too was saying something but i cannot remember what for a long while we talked i speaking the nonsense of those who are coming out from under ether they teasing me a little solemnly but after a little while i became aware of the fact that they were about to leave suddenly god knows why i knew that they must not leave something cried in the back of my head that they must stayone cannot explain these things except by after events i began to press them to remain but they smiled and said they must get their dinner i commanded them not to go but they spoke kindly and said they would be back before long i think i even wept a little like a child but sir john said something to the nurse who began to reason with me firmly and then they were gone and somehow i was asleep when i awoke again my head was fairly clear but there was an abominable reek of ether all about jme the moment i opened my eyes i felt that some thing had happened i asked for sir john and for alice i saw a swift curious look that i could not interpret come over the face of the nurse then she was calm again her countenance impassive she re assured me in quick meaningless phrases and told me to sleep but i could not sleep i was absolutely sure that something had happened to them to my friend and to the woman i loved yet all my in sistence profited me nothing for the nurses were a silent lot finally i think they must have given me a sleeping potion of some sort for i fell asleep again for two days two endless chaotic days i saw nothing of either of them alice or sir john i be came more and more agitated the nurse more and more taciturn she would only say that they had gone away for a day or two and then on the third day i found out they thought i was asleep the night nurse had just come in to relieve the other has he been asking about tlem again she asked yes poor fellow i have hardly managed to keep him quiet it is going to be very hard to tell him we will have to keep it from him until he is recovered fully there was a long pause and i could hardly control my laboured breathing how sudden it was one of them said to be killed like that i heard no more for i leapt sud denly up in bed crying out quick for gods sake tell me what has hap pened i jumped to the floor and seized one of them by the collar she was horrified i shook her with a superhuman strength tell me i shouted tell meor ill she told mewhat else could she do they were killed in an accident she gasped in a taxia collisionthe strand and at that moment a crowd of nurses and attendants arrived called by the other frantic woman and they put me to bed again i have no memory of the next few days i was in delirium and i was never told what i said during my ravings nor can i express the feelings i was saturated with when at last i regained my mind again between my old emotions and any attempt to put them into words or even to remember them lies always that insurmountable wall of my change i cannot understand what i must have felt i can not express it i only know that for weeks i was sunk in a misery beyond any misery i had ever imagined before the two only friends i had on earth were gone to me i was left alone and for the first time i began to see before me all these endless years that would be the same dull lonely yet i recovered i could feel each day the growth of a strange new vigour in my limbs a vast force that was something tangibly expressive of eternal life slowly my anguish began to die after a week more i began to understand how my emotions were leaving me how love and beauty and everything of which poetry was madehow all this was going i could not bear the thought at first i would look at the golden sunlight and the blue shadow of the wind and i would say god how beautiful and the words would echo meaninglessly in my ears or i would re member alices face that face i had once loved
