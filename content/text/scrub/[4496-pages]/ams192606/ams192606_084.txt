the malignant entity tell you evans said dr dorp banging his fist on the arm of his chair for emphasis the science of psychology is in much the same stage of develop ment today as were the material sciences in the dark ages but surely i objected the two centuries of in vestigation just past have yielded some fruit it cannot be that the eminent men who have devoted the greater part of their lives to this fascinating subject have labored in vain the doctor stroked his irongray van dyke medi tatively with a fewa very few exceptions im afraid they have he replied at least so far as their own deductions from observed phenomena are con cerned take sir oliver lodge for example i began the conclusions of sir oliver will serve as an excellent example for my analogy said the doctor no doubt you are familiar with the results of his years of painstaking psychical research as expound ed in his books i believe he has become a convert to spiritism i replied with all due respect to sir oliver said the doctor i should say that he has rather singled out such facts as suited his purpose and assembled them as evidence to support the spiritistic theory it may seem paradoxical to add that i believe he has always been thoroughly conscientious in his inves tigation and sincere in his deductions im afraid i do not quite follow you there are times in the life of every man con tinued the doctor when emotion dethrones reason at such crisis the most keenwitted of scientists may be blinded to truth by the overpowering influence of his own desires sir oliver lost a beloved son only those who have suffered similar losses can appre ciate the keen anguish that followed his bereave ment or sympathize with his intense longing to communicate with ray mond most men are crea tures of their desires they believe what they want to believe under the circumstance it was not difficult for a clever psy chic to read the mind of the scientist and tell him the things he wanted to hear but what of the many investigators who have not been similarly influ enced i inquired surely they must have found some basis i was interrupted by the entrance of the doctors housekeeper who announced beggin your pardon sir a gentleman to see you sir show him in dr dorp said rather petulantly his frown of annoyance changed to a welcoming smile of recognition at sight of the tall bulky in dividual whovstrode through the doorway how are you doc roared the big man as they shook hands cordially havent bothered you for a scientists and inventors have made enormous strides forand in many ways againsthumanity for they have discovered and invented powerful destruc tive materialsin that way sometimes courting their own destruction so many impossible things have been done why is it not possible that the venture into the realms of the in finite may sometime protjc fruitfulthat some day life may be implanted in unorganised matter the malig nant entity is the story of such a venturecarried to a dreadful success this is a gripping talc marvelously well told read it long time have i got a case for you now that will make you put on your thinking cap all right sounds interesting replied the doctor let me present an old friend of mine mr evans who writes a story every now and then when the spirit moves him mr evans chief mcgraw of the de tective bureau we were just discussing our mutual hobby psychic phenomena when you came in he continued after we had acknowledged the intro duction no doubt chief mcgraws communication is of a confidential nature i began with the purpose of taking leave of my host nothing secret about it so far as dr dorp and his friends are concerned interrupted the chief it may be that if you are a psychologist you can offer some solution of the mystery of course i dont exactly know whether its a case for a psy chologist or not damned curious thing and ghast ly too stay and listen if you are interested said the doctor if it has any smattering of psychology or the occult you know my failing i responded cant say as to that said the chief its queer enough thoughand horrible you gentlemen have heard of professor townsend i presume you mean albert townsend the chemist and inventor asked the doctor assuredly who hasnt heard of him and his queer theories about creating life from inert matter what has he done now i dont know whether its something he did or something that was done to him but anyway hes dead murdered thats the point i want you to help me clear up i dont know his daughter phoned the office this morning and asked for me when i got on the wire i could hardly understand her she was so hysterical sobbed out something about her father being gone and a human skele ton lying on the floor of his laboratory i jumped in the car and took hirsch the fingerprint expert out there with me we found the frightened girl weep ing in the arms of a moth erly neighbor who in formed us that the labor atory was on the second floor the whitened skeleton of professor townsend fully clothed in garments that hung like rags on a scarecrow lay on the floor of the laboratory you made sure of course that it really was the skeleton of the professor beyond the least shadow of doubt in the first place it was clothed in the professors garments his watch with his name in the back was ticking in the vest pocket his monogrammed ring a present from his daughter circled a bony finger on the bones of his right forearm were the marks of a fracture that had healed and the skull was slightly indented above the right temple these marks re
