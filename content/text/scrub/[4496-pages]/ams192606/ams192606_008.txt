arne saknussem a trip to the center of the earth by jules verne part ii chapter xvi the eastern tunnel the next day was tuesday the d of july and at six oclock in the morning we resumed our journey we still con tinued to follow the gallery of lava a perfect natuial pathway as easy of descent as some of those inclined planes which in very old german houses serve the purpose of stair cases this went on until seventeen minutes past twelve the precise instant at which we rejoined hans who having been somewhat in advance had suddenly stopped at last cried my uncle we have reached the end of the shaft i looked wonderingly about me we were in the center of four cross paths somber and narrow tunnels the question now arose as to which it was wise to take and this of itself was no small diffi culty my uncle who did not wish to appear to have any hesitation about the matter before either me or the guide at once made up his mind he pointed quietly to the eastern tunnel and without delay we entered within its gloomy recesses besides had he entertained any feeling of hesita tion it might have been prolonged indefinitely for there was no indication by which to determine on a choice it was absolutely necessary to trust to chance and good fortune the descent of this obscure and narrow gallery was very gradual and winding sometimes we gazed through a succession of arches its course very like in the first installment we got our travelers well started on their way to the internal cavities of the globe they have reached iceland have climbed mount sneffels and with a stolid icelander for a guideor rather com panionhave penetrated down through the crater of the volcano and have started their adventurous and exciting trip but now wonders really begin to happenstrange forms of prehistoric life are encountered ami dangers are met with but our travelers gel through all their troubles in the end and come back to tell us all about it jules vernes astonishing scientific knowledge combined with his talents as a narrator gives the novel great value from a scientific as well as from a literary standpoint few authors could write so vivid a description of adven ture fewer yet could fill it with such correct science follow our travelers through these exciting chapters the aisles of a gothic cathedral the great artistic sculptors and builders of the middle ages might have here completed their studies with advantage many most beautiful and suggestive ideas of archi tectural beauty would have been discovered by them after passing through this phase of the cavernous way we suddenly came about a mile farther on upon a square system of arch such as that adopted by the early romans projecting from the solid rock and keeping up the weight of the roof suddenly we came upon a series of low subterranean tunnels which looked like beaver holes or the work of foxes through these nar row and winding ways we had literally to crawl the heat still remained at quite a supportable degree with an involun tary shudder i reflected oil what the heat must have been when the vol cano of sneffels was pour ing its smoke flames and streams of melted lava all of which must have come up by the road we were now following i could imagine the torrents of hot seething stone darting on bubbling up with accompaniments of smoke steam and sulphurous stench only to think of the consequences i mused if the old volcano were once more to get to work i did not communicate these rather unpleasant reflections to my uncle his only idea was to go ahead he walked he slid he clambered over piles of fragments he rolled down heaps of broken lava with an earnestness and conviction it was impossi ble not to admire
