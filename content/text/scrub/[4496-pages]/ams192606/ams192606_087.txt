amazing stories like a little child with fire until it suddenly de stroyed him the death of officer rooney is ample proof that this terrible force whatever it may be survived him now let us conjecture regarding the nature of this thing that has taken the lives of two human beings we know that the professors chief ambi tion was to create life from inert matter all of his experiments in the laboratory were made with this object in view all his printed works show plainly his firm belief that the thing could be accomplished some of them going so far as to point out the pro cesses by which he believed protoplasm the primi tive basic life substance might be analyzed as protoplasm is a compound of almost unlimited com plexity in its physical and chemical constitution our most skilled chemists have been unable to unravel its secrets in fact the further a chemist gets in his attempts at analysis the more baffling and com plex he finds it to be being a compound composed of complex substances which are in turn composed of others still more complex and so on ad infini tum its secrets are fully as inscrutable as those of the starry universe the professors first step therefore in this seemingly impossible undertaking would be to an alyze protoplasm assuming that he succeeded in reducing it to its basic elements his next prob lem would be to take similar elements and through a process even more complex than vjthe pievious one assemble and reassemble theni until they were capable of sustaining life let us suppose that he did these things let us assume that he has succeeded in creating proto plasm what next we will say that he has taken some primitive form of life for a pattern a mone ron perhaps the most simple type of animal con sisting of a single cell of protoplasm there still exists a difference between the moneron and the synthetically created cell chemically and physi cally they are the same but the moneron is alive what is life broadly defined as we recognize it on this earth it is a temporary union of mind and matter there may be and probably is another kind of life which is simply mind without matter but we of the material world know it not to us mind without matter or matter without mind aie equally dead the moneron has a minda soula something that makes it a living individual call it what you will the professors cell of manmade protoplasm has not can you conceive of any pos sible way in which he could having reached this stage create an individual mind or soul an essence of life that once united with his cell of protoplasm would form an entity it seems impossible i admitted so it seems he replied yet it is only on such an hypothesis that i can account for the mysterious deaths of the professor and officer rooney but i dont see how a moneron or a creature remotely resembling one could kill and completely devour a man in less than two hours i objected nor i agreed the doctor in fact i am of the opinion that if the professor did succeed in creating life the result was unlike any creature large or small now inhabiting the eartha hideous monster perhaps with undreamed of powers and possibilitiesan alien organism among billions of other organisms hating them all because it has nothing in common with thema malignant entity governed solely by the primitive desire for food and growth with only hatred of and envy for the more fortunate natural creatures around it if the professor did succeed in creating or dis covering such a creature i said it is evidently in this house at this very moment unless it has the faculty of making itself invisible a thorough search should reveal its whereabouts for having consumed two men it must be a monster of mean proportions that is true replied the doctor however we have another hypothesis that is equally worthy of our consideration if we accept the premise that the professor created a living creature judging from his writings he spent a considerable portion of hsis time studying and experimenting in micro biology suppose he succeeded in creating a micro scopic organism and that organism had the power to reproduce its kind if it reproduced by fission that is by simply dividing itself after it had at tained a certain size the only check to its increase would be death or lack of food the more food it could obtain that much more rapidly would it and its descendants multiply countless billions of such creatures might occupy this room and yet be in visible without the aid of a compound microscope there is ample room for a swarm of such creatures numerous enough to devour a man to float in the air above our heads without revealing its presence the words of the doctor affected me strangely involuntarily i looked upward half expecting a swarm of maneating microbes to descend and de vour me for a moment i was seized with a feel ing of panic so strong i could scarcely restrain my self from leaping for the door the fact that the sun had just set and dusky shadows were thicken ing in the room augmented the illusion i crossed the floor nervously and pressed the switch beside the door instantly the place was flooded with blue white light from a cluster of powerful globes de pending from the middle of the ceiling as i was recrossing the room my eyes fell on the contents of the glasslined tank i stared unbeliev ingly for a moment then called dr dorp what is it evans he asked the liquid in this tank i replied it has changed color something has turned it pink the effect of the artificial light no doubt he said coming up beside me then i saw the expres sion of doubt on his face change to one of surprise and wonder you are right he exclaimed it has not only changed color but a still more remarkable trans formation has taken place when we noticed it this afternoon the tank was a third full of the colorless liquid this pink fluid reaches half way to the top a drawer filled with bones he tread of many feet sounded in the hall chief mcgraw paused in the doorway star ing down at the blueclad skeleton the floor a look of horror on his face behind him were four policemen in uniform isis that the skeleton of poor old rooney
