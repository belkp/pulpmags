a trip to the center of the earth well said the professor with the most im perturbable tranquility it is the shell of a crus taceous animal of the extinct order of the trilobites nothing more i assure you but cried i much troubled at his coolness do you draw no conclusion from it well if i may ask what conclusion do you draw from it yourself well i thought i know my boy what you would say and you are right perfectly and incontestably right we have finally abandoned the crust of lava and the road by which the lava ascended it is quite possi ble that i may have been mistaken but i shall be unable to discover my error until i get to the end of this gallery you are quite right as far as that is concerned i replied and i should highly approve of your decision if we had not to fear the greatest of all dangers and what is that want of water well my dear harry it cant be helped we must put ourselves on rations and on he went chapter xvii deeper and deeperthe coal mine in truth we were compelled to put ourselves upon rations our supply would certainly last not more than three days i found this out about supper time the worst part of the matter was that in what is called the transition rocks it was hardly to be expected that we should meet with water i had read of the horrors of thirst and i knew that where we were a brief trial of its suffer ings would put an end to our adventuresand our lives but it was utterly useless to discuss the mat ter with my uncle he would have answered by some axiom from plato during the whole of the next day we proceeded on our journey through this interminable gallery arch after arch tunnel after tunnel we journeyed without exchanging a word we had become as mute and reticent as hans our guide the road had no longer an upward tendency at all events if it had it was not to be made out very clearly sometimes there could be no doubt that we were going downwards but this inclination was scarcely to be distinguished and was by no means reassur ing to the professor because the character of the strata was in no wise modified and the transition character of the rocks became more and more marked it was a glorious sight to see how the electric light brought out the sparkles in the walls of the calcareous rocks and the old red sandstone one might have fancied himself in one of those deep cut tings in devonshire which have given their name to this kind of soil some magnificent specimens of marble projected from the sides of the gallery some of an agate gray with white veins of variegated character others of a yellow spotted color with red veins farther off might be seen samples of color in which cherrytinted seams were to be found in all their brightest shades the greater number of these marbles were stamped with the marks of primitive animals since the previous evening nature and creation had made considerable progress instead of the rudimentary trilobites i perceived the remains of a more per fect order among others the fish in which the eye of a geologist has been able to discover the first form of the reptile it was quite evident to me that we were ascending the scale of animal life of which man forms the summit my excellent uncle the professor appeared not to take notice of these warnings he was determined at any risk to pro ceed he must have been in expectation of one of two things either that a vertical well was about to open under his feet and thus allow him to continue his descent or that some insurmountable obstacle would compel us to stop and go back by the road we had so long traveled but evening came again and to my horror neither hope was destined to be realized on friday after a night when i began to feel the gnawing agony of thirst and when in consequence appetite decreased our little band rose arid once more followed the turnings and windings the as cents and descents of this interminable gallery all were silent and gloomy i could see that even my uncle felt that we had adventured too far after about ten hours of further progressa progress dull and monotonous to the last degreei remarked that the reverberation and reflection oigt our lamps upon the sides of the tunnel had singu larly diminished the marble the schist the cal careous rocks the red sandstone had disappeared leaving in their places a dark and gloomy wall som bre and without brightness when we reached a remarkably narrow part of the tunnel i leaned my left hand against the rock when i took my hand away and happened to glance at it it was guite black we had reached the coal strata of the cen tral earth a coal mine i cried a coal mine without miners responded my uncle a little severely how can we tell i can tell replied my uncle in a sharp and doctorial tone i am perfectly certain that this gal lery through successive layers of coal was not cut by the hand of man but whether it is the work of nature or not is of little concern to us the hour for our evening meal has comelet us sup hans the guide occupied himself in preparing food i had come to that point where i could no longer eat all i cared about were the few drops of water which fell to my share what i suffered it is useless to record the guides gourd not guite half full was all that was left for us three hav ing finished their repast my two companions laid themselves down upon their rugs and found in sleep a remedy for their fatigue and sufferings as for me i could not sleep i lay counting the hours until morning the next morning saturday at oclock we start ed again twenty minutes later we suddenly came upon a vast excavation from its mighty extent i saw at once that the hand of man could have had nothing to do with this coal mine the vault above would have fallen in even now it was only held to gether by some miracle of nature this mighty natural cavern was about a hundred feet wide by
