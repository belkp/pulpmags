a trip to the center of the earth look around you my dear harry no botanist ever before gazed on such a sight my uncles enthusiasm usually a little more than was required was now excusable you are right uncle i remarked providence appears to have designed the preservation in this vast and mysteri ous hothouse of antediluvian plants to prove the sagacity of learned men in figuring them so mar velously on paper well said my boyvery well said it is indeed a mighty hothousebut you would also be within the bounds of reason and common sense if you also addeda vast menagerie i looked rather anxiously around if the animals were as exaggerated as the plants the matter would certainly be serious a menagerie doubtless look at the dust we are treading under footbehold the bones with which the whole soil of the seashore is covered bones i replied yes certainly the bones of antediluvian animals i stooped down as i spoke and picked up one or two singular remains relics of a bygone age it was easy to give a name to these gigantic bones in some instances as big as trunks of trees here is clearly the lower jawbone of a masto don i cried almost as warmly and enthusiastically as my uncle here are the molars of the dinothe rium here is a legbone which belonged to the megatherium you are right uncle it is indeed a menagerie for the mighty animals to which these bones once belonged have lived and died on the shores of this subterranean sea under the shadow of these plants look yonder are whole skeletons and yet and yet nephew said my uncle noticing that i suddenly came to a full stop i do not understand the presence of such beasts in granite caverns however vast and prodigious was my reply why not said my uncle with very much of his old professional impatience because it is well known that animal life only existed on earth during the second period when the sedimentary soil was formed by the alluviums and thus replaced the hot and burning rocks of the primitive age i have listened to you earnestly and with pa tience harry and i have a simple and clear answer to your objections and that is that this itself is a sedimentaiy soil how can that be at such enormous depth from the surface of the earth the fact can be explained both simply and geolo gically at a certain period the earth consisted only of an elastic crust liable to alternative up ward and downward movements in virtue of the law of attraction it is very probable that many a landslip took place in those days and that large portions of sedimentary soil were cast into huge and mighty chasms quite possible i dryly remarked but uncle if these antediluvian animals formerly lived in these subterranean regions what more likely than that one of these huge monsters may at this moment be concealed behind one of yonder mighty rocks as i spoke i looked keenly around examining with care every point of the horizon but nothing alive appeared to exist on these deserted shores i now felt rather fatigued and told my uncle so the walk and excitement were too much for me in my weak state i therefore seated myself at the end of a promontory at the foot of which the waves broke in incessant swells i looked around a bay formed by projections of vast granite rocks at the extreme end was a little port protected by huge pyramids of stones a brig and three or four schooners might have lain there with perfect ease so natural did it seem that every minute my imagi nation induced me to expect a vessel coming out under all sail and making for the open sea under the influence of a warm southerly breeze but the fantastic illusion never lasted more than a minute we were the only living creatures in this subterranean world during certain periods there was an utter cessa tion of wind when a silence deeper more terrible than the silence of the desert fell upon these soli tary and arid rocksand seemed to hang like a leaden weight upon the waters of this singular ocean i sought amid the awful stillness to pene trate through the distant fog to tear down the veil which concealed the mysterious distance what unspoken words were murmured by my trembling lipswhat questions did i wish to ask and did not where did this sea endto what did it lead should we ever be able to examine its distant shores but my uncle had no doubts about the matter he was convinced that our enterprise would in the end be successful for my part i was in a state of painful indecisioni desired to embark on the journey and to succeed and still i feared the result after we had passed an hour or more in silent contemplation of the wondrous spectacle we rose and went down towards the bank on our way to the grotto which i was not sorry to gain after a slight repast i sought refuge in slumber and at length after many and tedious struggles sleep came over my weary eyes chapter xxviii launching the raft on the morning of the next day to my great surprise i awoke completely restored i thought a bath would be delightful after my long illness and sufferings so soon after ris ing i went and plunged into the waters of this new mediterranean the bath was cool fresh and in vigorating i came back to breakfast with an excellent appe tite hans our worthy guide thoroughly under stood how to cook such eatables as we were able to provide he had both fire and water at discre tion so that he was enabled slightly to vary the weary monotony of our ordinary repast our morn ing meal was like a capital english breakfast with coffee by way of a windup and never had this delicious beverage been so welcome and refreshing my uncle had sufficient regard for my state of health not to interrupt me in the enjoyment of the meal but he was evidently delighted when i had finished now then said he come with me it is the height of the tide and i am anxious to study its curious phenomena
