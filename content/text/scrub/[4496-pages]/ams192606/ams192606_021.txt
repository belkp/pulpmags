 amazing stories and whatever little may remain the retina of the eye will succeed in finding it in this place nothing not the faintest ray of light it mazed me my head was now wholly lost i raised my arms trying the effects of the feeling in getting against the cold stone wall it was painful in the extreme madness must have taken possession of me i knew not what i did i began to run to fly rushing at haphazard in this inextricable labyrinth always going downwards running wildly underneath the terrestrial crust like an inhabitant of the subter ranean furnaces screaming roaring howling un til bruised by the pointed rocks falling and picking myself up all covered with blood seeking madly to drink the blood which dripped from my torn fea tures mad because this blood trickled over my face and watching always for this horrid wall which ever presented to me the fearful obstacle against which i could but dash my head where was i going it was impossible to say several hours passed in this way after a long time having utterly exhausted my strength i fell a heavy inert mass along the side of the tunnel and lost all consciousness of existence chapter xxv the whispering gallery when at last i same back to a sense of life and being my face was wet but wet as i soon knewi with tears how long this state of insensibility lasted it is quite impossible for me to say i had no means left to me of taking any ac count of time never since the creation of the world had such a solitude as mine existed i was com pletely abandoned after my fall i had lost much blood i had felt myself flooded with the lifegiving liquid my first sensation was perhaps a natural one why was i not dead because i was alive there was something left to do i tried to make up my mind to think no longer as far as i was able i drove away all ideas and utterly oveicome by pain and grief crouched against the granite wall i commenced to feel the fainting coming on again with the sensation that this was the last struggle before complete annihilationwhen on a sudden a violent uproar reached my ears it had some resemblance to the prolonged rumbling voice of thunder and i clearly distinguished sonorous voices lost one after the other in the distant depths of the gulf whence came this noise again i listened with deep attention i was extremely anxious to hear if the strange and inexplicable sound was likely to be renewed a whole quarter of an hour elapsed in painful expectation deep and solemn silence reigned in the tunnel so still that i could hear the beatings of my own heart i waited waited waited with a strange kind of hopefulness suddenly my ear which leaned accidentally against the wall appeared to catch the faintest echo of a sound i thought that i heard vague incoher ent and distant voices i quivered all over with ex citement and hope it must be hallucination i cried it cannot be it is not true but no by listening more attentively i really did convince myself that what i heard was the sound of human voices to make any meaning out of the sound however was beyond my power i was too weak even to hear distinctly still it was a positive fact that some one was speaking of that i was certain there was a moment of fear a dread fell upon my soul that it might be my own words brought back to me by a distant echo perhaps without knowing it i might have been crying aloud i res olutely closed my lips and once more placed my ear to the huge granite wall yes for certain it was in truth the sound of human voices i now by the exercise of great determination dragged myself along the sides of the cavern until i reached a point where i could hear more distinct ly but though i could detect the sound i could only make out uncertain strange and incompre hensible words they reached my ear as if they had been spoken in a low tonemurmured as it were afar off at last i made out the word for lorad repeated several times in a tone betokening great mental anguish and sorrow what could this word mean and who was speak ing it it must be either my uncle or the guide hans if therefore i could hear them they must surely be able to hear me help i cried at the top of my voice help i am dying i then listened with scarcely a breath i panted for the slightest sound in the darknessa cry a sigh a question but silence reigned supreme no answer came in this way some minutes passed a whole flood of ideas flashed through my mind i be gan to fear that my voice weakened by sickness and suffering could not reach my companions who were in search of me it must be they i cried what other men can by any possibility be buried a hundred miles below the level of the earth the mere supposition was preposterous i began therefore to listen again with the most breathless attention as i moved my ears along the side of the place i was in i found a mathematical point as it were where the voices ap peared to attain their maximum of intensity the word forlorad again distinctly reached my ear then came again that rolling noise like thunder which had awakened me out of torpor i begin to understand i said to myself after some little time devoted to reflection it is not through the solid mass that the sound reaches my ears the walls of my cavernous retreat are of solid granite and the most fearful explosion would not make uproar enough to penetrate them the sound must come along the gallery itself the place i was in must possess some peculiar acoustic prop erties of its own again i listened and this timeyes this time i heard my name distinctly pronounced cast as it were into space it was my uncle the professor who was speaking he was in conversation with the guide and the word which had so often reached my ears forlorad was a danish expression then i understood it all in order to make my self heard i too must speak as it were along the side of the gallery which would carry the sound of my voice just as the wire carries the electric fluid from point to point but there was no time to lose if my companions were only to remove a few feet from where they stood the acoustic effect
