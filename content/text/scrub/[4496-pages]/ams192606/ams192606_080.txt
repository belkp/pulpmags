an experiment in gyrohats the only test of the gyrohat must be on the head of a man who without the hat could not help stag gering and reelinga thoroughly intoxicated man we did not of course admit anne into our little conspiracy and we chose a restaurant where we were sure intoxicants would be sold we proceeded to the restaurant about the dinner hour and after studying the waiters carefully i selected one that seemed likely to know something about intoxicants and we seated ourselves at his table i placed the gyrohat carefully across my knees first setting the starter and beckoned the waiter to us my good fellow i said when he had approached with his pencil and order card in hand i desire to become intoxicated this evening and i presume you know something about intoxicating liquors yes sir said the waiter tell him henry said my wife that we also wish something to eat but that as our principal object in coming here is to secure intoxicants we wish him to be particular about them you have heard what the lady said i told the waiter and you will be guided accordingly yes sir said the waiter politely does the lady desire to become intoxicated also heavens no exclaimed my wife certainly not said the waiter now i said to the waiter you doubtless have different kinds of intoxicating liquors heresome strong and some not so strongand i do not desire to drink a great quantity to obtain the result i desire what would you recommend to give the re quired reeling and staggering condition as quickly as possible well sir he said if you will let me advise i would advise a certain brandy we have of that brandy sir a little goes a long way i have seen it work sir and i can assure you that a small quantity of that will make you stagger and reel to your hearts content very well i said you may bring me some i suppose a quart would be enough i beg your pardon sir he said but have you ever tried the brandy of which i speak i have not i said then sir said the waiter apologetically un less you are a very heavy drinker i would not advise a quart of that brandy a quart of that brandy sir would if i may so speak lay you out flat you would not reel and stagger sir you would be para lyzed stiff sir dead to the world i thanked the waiter warmly you observe i said that i am not used to this sort of thing and i appreciate the interest you are taking i am inclined to leave the matter en tirely in your hands i may not know when i have had exactly the right quantity but you with your larger experience will know sir yes sir and i think the lady will know sir said the waiter i found the brandy most unpleasant to the taste but certain symptoms assured me that the waiter had not belied its effectiveness long before the waiter was satisfied that i would stagger and reel my long lost vocal prowess returned and i caroled gaily some songs that had been favorites of my youth many of these were affectionate songs and when i sang them i had a great longing to hold my wifes hand and did so but as she would not let me kiss her i felt the need of kissing the waiter here again i was repulsed but it did not make me angry i merely slid down into my chair and waved my hand at him coquettishly if you please sir said the waiter when i had finished another burst of song i think you are pretty ripe now if you would just get up and walk a few steps i can tell more definitely my wife smiled at me reassuringly and nodded to me that what the waiter proposed had her full sanction but even so i was filled with a fear that we were about to be parted forever and for a few minutes i clung to her neck weeping bitter tears i then tore myself away and i did indeed stagger and reel i believe i knocked over two small tables and ended by seating myself in the lap of a young man who was dining alone he accepted my apology before i had spoken more than fifteen minutes of it and then he aided the waiter in steering me back to my table whatever may have been my past opinion of wals ingham gribbsfor it was hei loved him most dearly at that moment and in my incoherent man ner i tried to tell him so i think he understood at any rate he spoke to my wife like a true gentle man madame he said i can sincerely sympathize with your husband and if you will allow me i will gladly help you assist him to a cab i beg you not to be frightened by his condition i myself am sub ject to the same trouble and although he may seem drunk seem drunk exclaimed my wife seem drunk i beg you to know that my husband is as drunk as a man can become without being senseless either that or we have been defrauded by this waiter walsingham gribbs looked at my wife and then smiled very well he said if what you wanted was to have him drunk ill admit that he is about the drunkest man i have ever seen i only spoke as i did in order that i might spare your feelings for most wives object to seeing their husbands stagger and reel i myself stagger and reel continually and i have never tasted intoxicating liquor in my life but i can share the feelings of one who staggers and reels or who has a relative that staggers and reels at this my wife said are you not walsingham gribbs if you are i am delighted to meet you even in this unconventional manner for what brought us here will interest you she then told him of the gyrohat i had invented and explained just why i had come to this place and had swallowed the strong brandy i took no part in this conversation but walsingham gladly agreed to accompany us and he put my gyrohat on my head the result was indeed marvelous instantly the vacuum pump began to work and the gyroscope to revolve my head which had been lying one side straightened up the rubber sweat band grip ped my head tightly with a slight pulling sensation without assistance i arose from my chair and stood erect my brain was still confused but i walked as straight as a string direct to the door of the restaurant and stood holding it open while my wife
