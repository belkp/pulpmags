 adventure modically and between the spasms the en gine drove the steamer down the stream with a frightful velocity they were not caught by the dreaded wreckagethey caught it finally at eleven oclock they reached the still water covering a tree less plain and there they anchored that plain although the samaritan knew it not covered corona station they breakfasted at noon and the cap tain was unusually jolly the loss of the barge did not matter much he thought with a curious smile on his face he wouldnt want it any more but he was sorry for the boys sake all the same during the afternoon the wreckage be came larger it was not confined to tree and river debris now fencerails boxes furniture and to show how far the water could penetrate a cradle came bobbing and turning into the haven of the steamer they found that the cradle by virtue of its shape was an ark of this deluge the rescued being mostly snakes and tarantulas and scorpions and centipedes and all the insect horrors and creeping things which no living man may imagine at four oclock a hut came down escaped from the current careered wildly in the eddies and then collapsed with a noise like the discharge of artillery against a tree which had so far been too strong for the flood then a minute later another hut swimming high out of the water ran down in midstream and then abeam of the tilpa suddenly shot athwart the current and collided with the same tree but it did not go to pieces a projection in the timber wedged it in the tree fork and there it stood exposing its bulk to the swirl of the deluge stephen been and the mate and garth looked at the arrested shanty expecting it to break up suddenly the captain exclaimed if there aint a man on the thing quite as suddenly he lowered the dingey one of the two only boats of the tilpa sprang into her and pulled for the wreck before anybody fairly understood his intention he had become a samaritan again he had forgotten his revenge at the sight of a man in danger he had left a haven for the jaws of death the man on the hut was still now he had been waving his arms to the tilpa until he saw the boat put off to his rescue the samaritan pulled to the wreckage as if his own existence depended on his speed his struggle to keep the broadside on to the boiling current was almost titanic but at last he reached the lee of the anchored hut and after fastening the dingey to a project ing spar swung himself into the tree the castaway greeted him with a cry of joy stephen been clambered on to the hut and straddled the ridgepole so that he was face to face with the man who had suf fered the perilous voyage on the quaking building and then the samaritan been became the convict again his face was transfigured he looked at the wretch whose eyes were so close to his as a terrier might look at a rat his face expressed an awful joythe happi ness of the strong courageous devil who finds a coward devil in his grasp the informer noted that sudden change and in the space of a thought recognized his old enemy and shrieked aloud so ive got you said stephen been very slowly enjoying to the full shaws ac cession of fear i knew id get you some time and then with the snarl of a wolf dye remember little hutchins an peter wells you dirty liar do yer dye re member bendigo and woods point an youre a swell now are you an a squatter an a jp an allan yeve got a son whod drown yer if he knew what yare and ive been playin a lone andall me life through you you dog through you the informer opened his mouth to shriek for mercy but the roar of the water drowned his voice and the grip of the captain on his wrist made him dumb im goin to leave ye here said been again an its an easier death than i meant for yerits an easier death than theyd agree totheyll ave ter content themselveswith it he spoke of them as if they were in deed men and not impotent shadows the informer made no answerhe was dumb with terror so goodby to yer concluded the cap tain may ye go to the hell ye sent those boys ter an may ye meet em there he ceased and swung himself from the roof but ere his foot touched the tree the informer mad with fear caught his wrists in a grip of steel and screamed aloud above the artillery of the flood
