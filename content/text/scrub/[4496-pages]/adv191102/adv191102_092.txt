dixie pasha think that already the darkness was blot ting out the ksarwhich was tiny but a labyrinthand that beyond that lay the great refuge the great hidingplace the desert the arab smiled and made as if to turn with a swift movement he seized the end of the musket and wriggling aside from the thrust tore it from the sentrys hands turned it about and drove it through his breast with a single motion the other sentinel shouted and would have fired but the arab was upon him with a bound the soldier threw up his weapon in defense and the bayonets locked the negro forced him backward jerked his weapon free and a sudden lefthanded thrust sent the blade out six inches behind the zouaves back the assassin planted his foot on the dead mans breast and drew the bayonet forth seized the other gun and leaped away balls whistled about his ears twenty zouaves sprang in pursuit but a sharp com mand brought them back the officer was furious why didnt you kill himthe rest of you he demanded while they gazed in consternation on their slain comrades it had suddenly become entirely dark and he redoubled the guard shoot every thing that moves was his last command it was incredibletwo sentries killed within fifty yards of the camp and the murderer had escaped well tomorrow there would be reprisal for a squadron of spahis or chasseurs dafrique would be sent to benigarfa where the assassin had undoubtedly fled there was no moon but the night was clear with the soft luster of the stars the milky way shone like an incandescent ribbon of gauze stretched across the sky and the shootingstars fell like rockets all about the horizon the long line of campfires of the column glowed like splashes of vermilion on the murk of the earth their light was reassuring yet the sentinels of the zouaves were uneasy it was the desert mysterious threaten ing and ravenous that seemed to draw up closer and shut them in with horrors that waited just beyond the circle of light it was after midnight when a sentry thought that he saw something move in the dry bed of the oued he watched it a moment and then raised his gun but a hand was slapped over his mouth his head was jerked backwards a razoredged sec quin was drawn softly across his throat and he fell back into a pair of arms that laid him carefully on the ground it is a very simple thing for a twain that have worked together before but some one bungled a bit somewhere for one zouave managed to let off his gun the hubbub of screams and occasional shots that came faintly to the ears of the column lasted but a few moments and ceased altogether just as a zouave weapon less and breathless burst in gasping of an attack the drums rolled the call to arms and the column quickly formed but the expected attack did not come although the first zouave was followed by a dozen cor roborative others the spahis circling quickly about came to the camp by the river it was silent and the fires were extinguished the rest of the zouaves were there and a dozen or so of arabs to boot but not many the attack had been too sudden and overwhelming also there were a few rifles that had been over looked but not many of these either it was a stunning blow a company of zouaves wiped out in five minutes within a mile of the main column the next day the punitive expedition went through benigarfa with fire and sword of course the people there were not the assassins but they must have known and should have told and a lesson was never amiss among the children of the prophet it was a man of genius who planned that attack said the french general he has modern guns and plenty of ammunition we shall find him at boudenib with mo hammed jebbour in the meantime the men of oud aghir were dreaming while the negro harangued them in his broken ara bic he had been a marvel to them when he first came amongst them as a slave he had been a marvel since and now he was thrice a marvel that he had planned this wonder ful coup and won for them the weapons of their dreams and sam ames once of the twentyfifth u s infantry and more recently an outlaw in the republic of li beria looked on the eagleeyed hooknosed sons of the desert that gathered about him
