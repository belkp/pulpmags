yellow men and gold thats all god knows ive enough mur ders on my conscience to last me and i dont want another so jim any time you dont like your company you can either get a prescription from the doctor orjump thank you i said and meanwhile said he you will be free daytimes to go and come as you like to eat with us and to steep your sense of the picturesque in such bacchanalian scenes as are liable to occur from time to time boys will be boys said he and now let us bury the dead chapter xxviii waiting since i was allowed to come and go as i pleased i passed the rest of the day with the women and lichee in the cabin they were no longer bound but had been forbidden the deck under pain of death it being the intention i suppose to reduce them to quiet submission by this and other bullying methods and woful as was my own perspective fate i am happy to think that at this time my thoughts were mostly for them i was to die before very long by my own hand according to carrols calcu lations but bessie and carmen were to furnish sport before their necks were wrung for them and dreadful as that thought must have been to them yet i think it was more dreadful to me and i was resolved that when the time came when the first violence was offered to one or the other i would choose that mo ment for my enforced act of suicide but it should not be a meek and sheepish finale man of peace that i was i was determined to go warlikely out of the world with blood upon my hands i tell you said carmen for to kill that man long time ago you not do it an now i say i tol you so we were fools i said and now what become of us woman i ask now look here said bessie her face haggard and white with grief but the luster and shining quality of her eyes undimmed one thing at a time were not threatened at the moment and wont be as long as this wind holds for gods sake lets have no postmortems or antemortems lets either get together and think a way out or lets pass these last hours cheerfully i think sometimes said carmen i run out and jump into the water i think of that too said bessie but so long as they dont hurt lichee im going to hold on to life as hard as i canno mat ter what happens what difference does it make im low enough by all human rules and im ready to step loweryes smilingif only theres an off chance that theyll sicken of me and not hurt the boy and put us ashore somewhere theres no chance they do that said carmen not me they let us gowe tell on them pretty quick they not let that happen no said bessie its just a pipedream but my little boyhe cant hurt them he cant bear witness against them he couldnt could he jim not legally i said but dont you worry about him bessiewere full grown and can stand anything and must i dare say but there must be a white spot in every man and i believe that carrols got a speck of a one honestly i think he wont hurt the boy the cabin floor was strongly pitched to port owing to the deep keeling of the shan tung its angle was as a barometer of dan ger or safety let it but keep its pitch indefinitely and the women were indefi nitely safe for our captors would need every man among them to sail the ship but let the wind fall and the cabin floor swing back to the level then i made sure other mat ters would at once occupy their minds but all that afternoon of waiting and thinking out desperate and futile stratagems the boards maintained their sharp slant only varying it with the pitch and roll of the ves sel but toward sundown the general angle began sensibly to diminish and it was evi dent that the wind had begun to fall winds falling jim said bessie yes bessie i said well she controlled her voice with some difficulty dear old jim weve been good pals youve liked me in spite of the black marks and ive liked you god knows how much carmen rose walked to the cabin port and stood looking out upon the sea in a corner that same occupied by chang in his coffinlichee lay sleeping and curled into a ball jim said bessie weve all got to die
