 adventure any of the others and kneeling for careful aim i fired once more for some reason my aim was bad the bull lifted his trunk in astonishment evidently hit but not much hurt then he swung around and came rushing toward us an impressive spectacle the biggest animal of the bush in rage there was something fine about his onrush but it evidently was not to the liking of the dutchman for he flung my express rifle to the grounda proceeding which annoyed me greatlyand took to his heels the charge of the bull straight toward me was so unexpected that i had no time for fur ther shooting the raging beast towered above me his trunk raised like a huge club his driving tusks and small eyes which seemed to blaze with fury making a picture of violent death which is still vivid in my memory in desperation i threw myself to one side and to the ground then i began to crawl so heavy was the grass that rapid movement was impossible and after forcing myself along for a few yards on my hands and knees i lay still hardly breathing thrashing about tramp ling the grass waving his trunk and bellow ing loudly the bull came so close that i could have hit his big legs with a stick i felt that this was my last hunta step or two in my direction would have brought his feet upon my body and i knew that if he should scent me it would be the end but miracles i am glad to be able to say sometimes happen the wind favored me and i was concealed completely in the grass with a movement as sudden as his onrush the bull swung around and went crashing back toward the herd rising i pushed my way back to where i had been forced to drop my rifle in my flight on hands and knees and aiming quickly took a shot at the retreat ing beast hoping that this would cause him to swing again so that i could hit him in the head the bullet struck him in the flank but only served to hasten him on his way i now sat down to get my breath and to wipe the perspiration from my fevered brow and in a few moments i saw the round face of the dutchman peering at me cautiously through the grass needing a vent for my wroughtup feelings i promptly poured a hot volley of words into my companion for casting away my cherished rifle and taking to his heels to tell the truth however i did not blame him much he explained half humorously that he had not been able to control the motions of his legs and said that he did not believe he could have faced the charge of that elephant for a thousand pounds the big bull come so quick he exclaimed but the flush of the hunt was now upon him and with protestations that the next time he would try to stand his ground he readily agreed to follow the herd with me so we started off again and after about a mile of hard going through the thick under growth once more saw the elephant mob the animals were grazing on a long slope just above us a short distance to our right was a mass of tangled bushes which i knew marked a swamp we stole up slowly and quietly to get within easy gunshot of our quarry but they must have got our wind for sud denly each trunk was thrown up almost with the precision of soldiers handling arms then all together the mob stampeded and came thundering down the slope headon toward us the bulls in advance as usual and the cows hurrying along their calves by pushing and half lifting the small elephants with their tusks only for an instant i watched the spectacle i knew that this stampede could not be stopped by bullets there were too many elephants and they were charging too directly come on come on i shouted to the dutchman well have to run for it follow me i made for the swamp with my friend clutching the rifle desperately this time bringing up the rear in excellent form once he stumbled and i thought for an instant that our race was finished but he recovered himself somehow and we waded on thi grass being only about up to our armpits we could see all too vividly the advancing mob what was more important the ele phants could see us and the bulls in front had their trunks suspended for blows that would knock us many feet if we could not reach the refuge of the swamp before the beasts reached us i was beginning to despair of this we had struck a rise in the ground which made our progress slower with the tangled grass about our feet it was like a flight in a night mare when one tries to run and can not but in a moment the ground sloped down again and we made more speed the bel lowings of the elephants had become a roar when we finally reached the marsh plunged
