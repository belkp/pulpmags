looking for trouble strength his eyes hair beard and mus tache were as black as coal you could feel his eyes looking through you and would almost lose a realizing sense of what was in your mind it was not hypnotism or mental or physical dominance but he could almost read your most secret thoughts he was perfectly irreligious cynical and cold blooded under the most severe tests a slight twitching of his eyes was his only sign of excitement he was daring to the supreme degree but never foolishly reckless and i dont believe he ever experienced the sensation of fear he was too as he needed to be almost a deadshot in offhand firing with rifle or pistol and an expert swords man when i first met him he was wild about the china sea where he had spent several thrilling years and made several fortunes but i had heard so much of venezuela and of guzman blanco that my heart was set on going there before i undertook to explore any other strange lands the upshot of our many discussions was that i sent nor ton to london to take command of the leck with until i was ready to join him when it was agreed we should go out in the yacht to his beloved china sea after nortons departure i bought the small foreandaft schooneryacht juliette fitted her out at new london conn for a six months cruise and started for bermuda to test her seaworthiness with lars loren sen as sailingmaster formerly of the leck with and a brave and loyal norseman guz man blanco was not at st thomas so we went on to curasao always a revolutionary rendezvous and there in the latter part of december i met guzman and general pul gar his chief of staff guzman after many exciting political and military ups and downs was planning an invasion of vene zuela against the monagas faction then in power after he had studied me asked all sorts of questions and apparently satisfied him self that i could be relied on guzman told me in a general way of his plans and asked me to secure for him old remington rifles and cartridges and deliver them as quickly as possible at curasao some two months later i arrived at cura sao where instead of guzman blanco i found general ortega who was with guz man when i first met him and seemed to be fully in his confidence ortega handed me a note bearing what purported to be the signature of guzman which directed me to deliver the cargo at a place to be indi cated by ortega and stated that payment for it would be made on my cabin table i showed the signature to two men who knew guzman well and both pronounced it gen uine i had no suspicion that anything was wrong and took this precaution simply as a matter of ordinary business sense ortega directed me to deliver the cargo at tucacas point about one hundred miles west of la guayra and on arriving ortega went ashore and returned with a request that i order off the hatches and start the unloading of the cargo in my boats and then go ashore with him and get my money this was not in accord with my contract with guzman or with the note ortega had handed me but i had great confidence in guzman and did not wish to offend him as soon as the unloading was well under way i went ashore with ortega we climbed the bluff and walked half a mile inland to a mudthatched hut before which a sentry was pacing ortega gave the countersign and we stepped inside to find general pul gar who was chief of staff for guzman when i was introduced to him wrapped in a chin chora and smoking in a hammock he ex plained evasively that he was there instead of guzman but when i asked him for my money he smiled and straightened up i told ortega to deliver that message to you he said but there is no use min cing words and i may as well tell you that you are my prisoner your cargo is being taken care of and will be put to a very differ ent purpose from that which you expected as i have said you are my prisoner but i have an offer to make you it cant make much difference to you whether you serve guzman or me if you will join my forces i will make you a colonel and give you com mand of a battalion and when the revolu tion is over i will pay you for your rifles just as guzman agreed to do you seem to forget i replied that i have a contract with general guzman well you dont appear to be in a very good position just now to carry it out do you he asked i again inquired where guzman was but a shrug of the shoulders was the only answer i could get to questions along that line not knowing so much about venezuelan revolu tions then as i did later i could not fathom
