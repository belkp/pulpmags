 adventure the only way i was once called in as an expert to visit a dynamiteplant where a new form of high explosive was being manufac tured instead of the ordinary nitroglycerin dynamite this consisted of a mixture of chlorate of potash sulphur charcoal and paraffin wax the inventor of it had con cocted the reassuring name xx safety dynamite unfortunately this safety mixture went off unexpectedly with no apparent cause and drove a crowbar deftly through the head of one of the workmen this un scheduled performance awakened the ap prehension of the president of the company who was also the chief backer and he grew suspicious as to the exact amount of safety in the mixture on that account i was sum moned and the president himself accom panied me to inspect the plant when we were close to the factory a sud den explosion occurred which shook the earth for miles and a tremendous pall of smoke instantly covered the sky going on after a moment of stunned pause we found that the site of the plant was now one vast crater around which lay a litter of debris a number of men had been in the factory at the time of the catastrophe now the sole survivor was walking busily about the crater with a basket on his arm picking up bits of something from the ground here and there as he observed us he spoke casually i cant find much of the boys i guess youll have to plow this ground if you want to bury em the bomb and the train one of the most anxious moments that i ever experienced was during some experiments in throwing aerial torpedoes from a fourinch cannon at maxim these torpedoes were about four feet in length charged with a very powerful high explosive and armed with a detonating fuse we had successfully fired several of them into a sandbutt where they exploded with great violence there were six of them five had been fired and the sixth was loaded into the gun ready to be dis charged when a passenger train hove in sight and was passing us about a thousand feet away when the gun was fired we had no idea of there being any danger to the train as its position was at right angles to the line of fire and each of the pre ceding projectiles had behaved so well but this time the torpedo glanced from the sandbutt and went after that train we stood paralyzed with dread as we saw it pass over the train close to the roof of a car and strike in the swamp just beyond it perhaps a couple of hundred feet behind the track an inverted cone of black earth shot up followed by a dull sound in imagination we had witnessed a fright ful catastrophe the wreck of a passenger train with fearful loss of life and all the horror of our own resultant predicament now that the danger was past the even tenor of our way did take on a new relish what objects we are after all of the mercy of chance patriots selfdoomed during the russojapanese war more than one of the czars warships disap peared without leaving a trace i received the following narrative somewhat indirect ly and for that reason i do not dare to vouch for its truth its origin as i was given to understand was a japanese officer who revealed the facts while in a mood more confidential than is customary among his kind this officer held a command at the time on board a torpedoboat in the flotilla there was a torpedoboat that carried neither guns or torpedoes for that mat ter aircompressors and every mechanical device not absolutely essential to the navi gation of the craft had been removed to lighten it it was then loaded with the most deadly explosives to the fullest capacity that it could carry at high speed next a call was issued for volunteers to make up the small crew necessary for navigating the boat the japanese officer declared that ten times the number required offered them selves despite the fact that they were well aware that those who voyaged in this vessel went to certain death the flotilla was steaming slowly along a short distance out at sea from port arthur in the dead of night when the huge gray bulk of a russian warship loomed up in the dark just in front the dynamiteladen torpedoboat which in itself constituted an enormous floating mine made a dash
