 adventure less he that prepareth the way how ever could refer to but one person and if i could intercept his way the effendi thought i would be richer by exactly pounds and who knows but that enver pashas own boots might be none too big for me the arrangements for the ren dezvous were precision itself stankos inn livady tuesday afternoon the apostles disguise being a priests cassock and a flow ing beard so much was plain another thing equally plain was that tetino did ac tually hold the apostle selim effendi was thinking hard three courses were open to him he might ap prise enver pasha of his findand be sent at once on a special mission to salonica while the pasha turned tetino upside down captured the apostle and kept the pounds or he might try to catch the apos tle himself on his way to dobridol but this was uncertain and would also involve the cooperation of more allies than selim ef fendi cared to share the money with or else he that prepareth the way could be trusted to see his way clear to livady and then find in stankos inn a trap waiting for him in the form say of a dealer in ikons or else a merchant or an american mis sionary the choice was a minor matter to selims mind there was no question about the relative merits of the three courses in order to follow the third course however it was necessary that the iden tity of robespierre should be estab lished and the letter forwarded to its des tination without exciting any suspicion the captured peasant was stolidly stubborn during the first fifteen minutes of selim effendis argumentation down in the cellar of the tetino jail but the tipsy blood hound was a past master in the art of exqui site torture and by the time the third beech splinter had been hammered under the fingernails of the captives left hand his right hand had traced upon a bloodstained scrap of paper the name of the poliany schoolmaster having copied the letter selim carefully resealed it and putting it into another envelope directed it to the onbashi at poliany with instructions that it be left secretly on dascal zoeffs desk in the schoolhouse and that the onbashi make certain of it that zoeff got it also that zoeff be not interfered with in any way for the length of a week much rather would i have you go with it osman he turned to his zaptieh but if you were missing tomorrow id have to answer questions and i care little what happens tuesday once we get to livady for we shall meet our manyou can trust apostle boyan to make his way through the tetino sen trywatches then he turned to the peasant there are some christian curs that give the wrong name but after the beech splinter i always try the hot olive oil and there is quicksilver aplenty to dance up and down your eardrums and burning charcoal to make your soles sizzle this cellar i lock and i unlock do you hear you giaour in a couple of days ill know whether you have been lying to me or not then you may learn to know some things that your mother never taught you monday passed as usual but on tues day morning enver pasha did not see selim effendi kick the konak gates open as was his custom with osman managing to rush in after him just in time to escape being hit by the gate as it slammed to off on a spree again like as not drunk as a seaman enver pasha remarked and thought little about it ii livady is a village at the foot of the payak mountains about five hours ride on muleback from tetino the road from the city zigzags along the bank of the vardar river which here spreads its bed lazily and sprawls over the entire valley making the country a rich ricegrowing region but also one abounding in boggy swamps and treacherous morasses its close proximity to the payak mountains made the village a favorite rendezvous of insurgents who found the mountain crags as hospitable as the fens of the vardar in offering hidingholes to the enemies of islam but there was no branch organization of the revolutionary committee in livady maybe the primitive life of the natives and their low level of intelligence could account for the fact their humble poverty and their superstitious character made hard any attempt to instill new ideas or inspire a spirit of opposition to the established order they were mostly charcoalmen their skinny mules grunting under huge loads of charred timber formed an integral part
