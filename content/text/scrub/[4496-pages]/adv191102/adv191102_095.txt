 adventure on the town side the hill dropped ab ruptly to the narrow plain beyond lay the river like a sheet of quicksilver and then boudenib halfhidden behind the motion less fronds of the palmeraie its bluewashed walls and housetops crowded with women and children even a couple of priests could be seen on the minaret of the mosque but not a sound came to the hill in the other direction the french column advanced in the form of a rectangle the caravans had been left behind the infantry formed the lines within were the cavalry and artil lery a crowd of arabs hung on either flank and kept up a continual harassing each puff of smoke when a gun was fired rose like a tiny white cloud all day the french had been kept so continually on the alert that their nerves were worn to a raw edge no one knew how many men mo hammed jebbour had and the desert as far as they could see was swarming with them and lives were cheap in the desert mohammedan lives were doubly cheap at times the arabs took advantage of a rise of ground to make a frantic charge and were swept back by the volleys of the infantry soon the pops of the firing began to come to the hadgis ear as they drew nearer the french could see him too plainly as he stood high on the crest of the hill in his green tur ban and snowwhite haik he was within range and dixie pasha who knew it won dered why they did not open fire for the sun was sinking and in a few moments it would be dark and too late he knew that the attack was to take place when it grew dark enough to get to close quarters without being swept down by the volleys but the french were old hands at this sort of business they too were waiting for the darkness to cometo admin ister a crushing blow that is the hadgi on the hill yonder thee general had said just before the arabs start to charge shell it and sweep in with mitrailleuse when the enemy break and retreat let the cavalry follow them around both sides of the hill and let the infantry support them the hill is very difficult of descent on the other side the guides say and if he waits there a few mo ments longer we will get him but dixie pasha had a keen eye and he knew the warfare of the roumi when they trained the machineguns and sixpounders on the hill he threw his men around the hadgi and the sheiks and hustled them over the summit at the same moment the cry of allah il allah thundered from the plain below and the thousands of arabs swept forward in a universal charge but they were not met by volleys this time the infantry opened up and the machineguns began to rattle when the arabs were only a hundred yards away they swept the floor of the desert clear in a moment and then the infantry poured a volley into the arabs that completed the work and the spahis and chasseurs dafrique rode out and cut down the few that had got to close quarters but the bulk of the arabs had broken and fled un der the withering hail of the machineguns shells were bursting on the hilltop too but the men of dixie pasha with the hadgi in their midst were picking their way with difficulty down its precipitous farther side a company or two of the foreign legion took the lull on one side of it the spahis swept at a trot followed closely by the zouaves and legionaries on the other side the chasseurs dafrique pursued the algerian tirailleurs at their heels it grew totally dark with the suddenness of the desert the stars came out and a thread of moon swung over the minaret of the mosque dimly outlined against the sky the arabs had seen the hadgi himself flee in the last gleams of light and never drew rein until they had splashed through the oued and were gathered on the farther shore and dixie pasha with his eighty men thrown about the hadgi and his sheiks reached the foot of the hill just as the two wings of french troops came curving around its flanks they met out beyond him in the center of the plain between him and boudenib he was caught between them like a grain of corn between two millstones but first the millstones were to grind each other a bit the spahis galloped up in the darkness the sound of their hoofs was like farmut tering thunder but only their white tur bans were visible at a distance of fifty yards the chasseurs and tirailleurs were waiting and the last poured a volley into them and then the chasseurs were out to meet the charge with drawn swords they in their turn were riddled by the blast of a volley from the zouaves and legionaries and it was only when the cavalry gasped under the
