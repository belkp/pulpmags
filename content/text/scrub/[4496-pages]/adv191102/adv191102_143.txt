 adventure missing element and that the specimen of gum which he was sending had come out of his retort not more than half an hour before he told me that he was exhausted and that he would retire at once and asked me to come to the laboratory at ten the next morn ing the young man paused to open a drawer from which he took a square of a dark red substance which he held up in front of blon die doyle it was a pliable and elastic solid which seemed to the strangler not a whit different from any other square piece of rubber this is what he sent me the speaker continued and from laboratory tests i have corroborated the old mans statement this rubber grew in a retort instead of a tree and the secret of making it is worth millions you may be sure that i went to the laboratory at ten next morning but at first the house seemed to be deserted after i had knocked the third time a window was cautiously lifted abovestairs and some one dropped a cylinder of paper out on the steps beside me i picked it up and found that it was a note addressed to me in a peculiarly irreg ular hand i read it through twiceand then i realized that the old scientist had lost his reason the strain ending in sud den and unexpected success had completely maddened him he stated that he had worked out the formulae and had put them together with my manuscripts which detailed the prelim inary work into a receptacle in the house and had contrived a series of electrical con nections so that from any point in his labo ratory or livingrooms he could press a but ton which would ignite and utterly destroy the whole accumulation of material he had blundered upon the perfecting link in the chain and it was his to do with as he pleased he would wager it against my share in the work if i could obtain the manuscript it was mine but if he caught me within the house he would set off his in fernal machine and put the discovery for ever beyond my reach again the young man paused and sat watching blondie his eyes with their hint of glacial ice and of uncompromising deter mination narrowed and fierce what i want is a man with the courage and the skill to enter this house at night and get these papers he will have this great advantage over me that if he is caught at the work he will be taken for an ordinary burglarand the manuscript will not suffer he must be one built and trained for the business cool even in danger and defeat alert and strong and determined and for this service i will pay ten thousand dollars without a proviso or hitch he will receive the money in any shape he desires to take it in and will be free to spend it openly without danger of protest or molestation now then do you want it he slid close to blondie and shot out this last question with such force that the stran gler blinked there was little considering to be done however blondie had followed the young mans narrative closely enough to be able to understand what was required from him it was in his line and he knew that he could do it if it could be done you can deal me in he said speaking gruffly and for the first time since he had been captured one thing i wants to ask boss supposn i tries my best and doesnt find the stuffwhat then does i get the coin or the boottoe the scientist laughed do your best and youll not fail he predicted i can tell you just where to look but if anything goes wrong you wont lose your reward the gods of this world have dealt bounti fully with me and i deal bountifully with those who try honestly to serve me i believe you are my man i fished for big fish the sight of so much money scared out the little fellows and you who had the cour age to follow into so forbidding a country should have both the courage and the ability to succeed very easily against this old man he was smiling into blondies face and the strangler felt his heart slow down and then start to sprintthere was something almost terrifying in that smile iii where blondie crouched in the shadow of a hedge in the out skirts of the city he might have been again plunged into his own underworld of gloom and darkness about him however scattered cottages were set in squares of lawn and garden and the fragrance of a bank of roses came to him heavy and sti fling as with the sodden breath of the night
