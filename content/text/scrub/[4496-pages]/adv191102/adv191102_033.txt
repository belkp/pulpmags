 adventure this strange situation to my entire satisfac tion but it was my guess that in some way pulgar had become arrayed against guz man and it turned out that i was right i told pulgar that i would give him an answer in the morning and spent the night with ortega under guard i tried to draw him out but evidently according to orders he would not even talk about the weather at sunrise we went to see pulgar when asked for my decision i inquired what the result would be if his revolution failed then i am sorry my dear captain but you will lose your cargo while i will lose my life which is of infinitely more importance to me but the revolution will not fail he vehemently declared as though impressed by his confidence i announced that i would accept his offer with a mental reservation to escape at the first opportunity for i did not propose to fight against guzman that is excellent he said with the sug gestion of a bow after coffee i went with him to inspect his troops he had about men many of whom were already armed with the rifles i had brought in and they were strung across the narrow arm of the peninsula in a line almost as ragged as their clothes i was formally given com mand of a battalion of men and an in dian servant who i afterward found had orders to shoot me if i attempted to escape was assigned to me i accompanied pulgar back to his headquarters where i was given an old sword and the tarnished shoulder straps of a colonel these constituting my uniform now that you have allied yourself with my forces he then said you will have no use for your ship you will therefore write a note to the officer in charge directing him to proceed to curasao and await orders she will be safe there and with a quizzical smile you will be safe here as there was nothing else for me to do i complied with it at once it was cutting off my one only forlorn hope of rescue but the adventure was getting into my blood and to tell the truth i rather liked the idea of being left to my own resources amid such strange surroundings i had been trying for about a week to whip my lazy ignorant troops into some sort of shape when word was brought in one morning that the enemy was ap proaching we had no advance guard out though i had tried to induce pulgar to post one and a few minutes after the scouts had been driven in the action became general with the forces apparently about evenly matched in numbers instead of allowing me to lead my bat talion pulgar ordered me to remain with him on a little knoll in the rear from which he made a pretense of directing his forces he could have accomplished much more in front for what his men needed was a leader not a director they were fighting in indian fashion with every man shooting indis criminately from behind a tree or log and they paid no attention to commands i will say for them though that they fought hard and stubbornly but they were gradually driven back and pulgar who had a terrible temper was furious all at once the opposing troops were largely reenforced and came with a rush which quickly con verted our orderly retreat into a rout pul gar cursing like a madman dashed into the disorganized mass of his libertyloving louts with ortega and the rest of his staff at his heels i was left alone and was hesitating as to what i should do when my indian servant tugged at my trousersleg follow me colonel he said i know where there is a boat he started off at the run and covered ground so fast that i had to gallop my horse to keep up with him he led the way to the beach near where my cargo had been landed and pushed a native boat from under a clump of mangrove trees we jumped in and shoved off in a hurry for ortega and several of his men had just appeared on the bluff above and were making for us there were no oars in the boat but we pulled a board loose from the bottom and used it as a paddle a strong current from the east swept us clear of the peninsula and out to sea but i was not alarmed for i fig ured that we would soon be in the path of coasting vessels scattered rifle patter reached us for a long time indicating that my former comrades in arms were being ignominiously chased around in a way that must have been most discouraging to pul gar toward the middle of the afternoon as we were trying to work in toward the land the indian let our paddle get away from him which left us entirely at the mercy of the elements we drifted around for three days and
