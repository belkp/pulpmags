 adventure able than kohinoors i was invalided to guard duty over our four precious rascals in the galley hitherto i had only taken my turn at this but for the whole of the last day during which we lay anchored in the fiord i kept the necessary eye on them and played the bugbear generally the four now well fed and warmed began to take life very easily and to joke with their jailors but that the least oppor tunity would fill them once more with the old nick was not to be doubted during that last day for instance carrol pro posed if i would set them free and arm them to make me sole master of three parts of the treasure to murder the china men was the merest detail of the plan and although he opened the matter jocosely i could see that he was not altogether sure as to whether i was to be tempted or not having heard him out to the end however i laughed in his face and he laughed back you treated me so faithfully and honor ably in frisco said i that i feel sure you would do the same now if i set you free all you have to do is to give your word to be believed by any one aboard this ship why man i dont believei honestly dontthat you ever so much as kept a promise given by yourselfto your self suppose that yours had been the successful party how many of them would you have allowed to survive to tell the tale and ill give you others a piece of mighty good advice its thiswhen you go ashore at rio with your share of the fifty thousand thats to be handed over to you keep an eye on carrol here hell want the whole of it and hell get itif you dont watch out parrish dont think much of you do e said kelsey and i dunnos i blame im its a long rolling road to rio said brandreth cheerfully and between here and there the oceans deep and maybe well all roll on the bottom together i dreamed last night said swigot that the ship blew up and while i was in the air the ropes that bound me burst asunder and i fell flop into the water and was just striking out for shore when i gets all tangled up in the chinks pigtails and is dragged under on the level jim said carrol what do you think the treasures worth well said i i toted the smallest share of anybody from the cliff to the boat and i calculate roughly that that share was about twentyeight hundred pounds of goldthats more than a million dollais just what i carried alone some of the boys made as many trips as i did and car ried about a hundred pounds each time to my sixty then there are the emeralds and things and the good lord only knows what theyre worth when i was in the land of the free said kelsey pathetically emeralds was high and thus we argued and estimated just as in a cafe four men may sit about a table and guess by the hour as to the fortune of mr vanderbilt or mr rockefeller starting upon guessed premises and arriving of course nowhere it was wonderful to see how cheerful a topic to these four men was that of the millions that they had all but secured for them selves so every family loves to dwell upon the gold mine that should have made it rich or upon the timber lands sold at the wrong time by the unprophetic grand father and so i fancy the civilized world over the most toothsome of all gossip where men are met together is that of un boundable wealth and if it were not for heavy gold light women and fast horses civilized man would soon lose the use of his tongue a figure blocked the galley door and a shadow fell among us conversing carmen was on her rounds fifty times a day she would thus steal silently upon the prisoners stand a while in the frame of the door look her fill upon carrol in his fallen fortunes and steal as quietly away but on this occasion she spoke it is better she said that fat man be kill before he do mischief you think he mind them rope not so much and she snapped her distorted little fingers you keep faith with heem but nobody keep faith with me when i say i come along and not want any gol you promise me that man for myself now you not give heem me but i tell you i creep in here some fine night when nobody on the look and then i have my little fling with heem she gazed for a long time into carrols
