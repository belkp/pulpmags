the joke by manchester willdy i have always prided myself upon being able to laugh as heartily as anyone when the joke is on me and i have never believed in doing things by halves so when i found a note lying upon my wifes dressing table i read it it was a dulcet bit of foolishness reeking with love and sentiment and written by my wife it was addressed to my own darling bill rapidly i named over the bills of our acquaintance seeking to name the guilty one for of course i must hunt him out and kill him immediately also my wife there were but three persons who could be suspected and after inquiring on the phone learned that two of these were out of town so there was no further doubt left in my mind as to who was the scoundrel not in the least nervous in the face of the terrible thing i was about to do i searched out one of my hunting knives put a razor edge on it and then got into my heaviest motoring coat for the note had directed bill to meet her at our summer house across the lake even as i let myself into the cottage and heard my wife coming to meet me i ran a finger along my knifes edge and waited dispassionately as she ran to my arms i drove the blade into her soft flesh up to the hilt stupidly she looked up at me whybill she sobbed youve killed me then i saw the joke and began to laugh i had entirely forgotten you see that my name is bill too i have always prided myself upon being able to laugh as heartily as anyone even when the joke is on me
