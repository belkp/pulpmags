consider the moving staircase by cleveland moffett if you observe the men and women on a moving staircase you will see that some stand still and let the ap paratus carry them comfortably to the top while others stride up the steps even while they are in motion thus gaining a few secondsbut wasting precious strength i have seen a redfaced man carrying a heavy bag or a tired mother with a baby restlessly wearily pushing on up to save those few unimportant seconds why for no particular reason except that this is the american way and it is a foolish way we devise an admirable mechanism for relieving the overbur dened human machine then we refuse to use it a moving staircase is an elo quent sermon on our national unwilling ness to rest we know that our human machines are driven by nervous energy stored up somehow in the brain probably by a chemical action while we sleep and rest but we do not dwell enough upon the fact that a brain depleted of its nervous energy is as ineffectual as a storage bat tery depleted of its electricity this is literally true we can do nothing we are nothing without a rested and replen ished brain health happiness love work patriotism every form of physical mental and spiritual achievement de pends upon a rested and replenished brain therefore men and women have no higher duty especially after fortyfive when the life forces begin to wane than to see that they get sufficient rest in many cases rest is more important than exercise we often exercise too much but we seldom rest too much i am a golf enthusiast i play golf on sundays and enjoy it but i am be ginning to think that from a purely phys ical point of view it may be a mistake god probably knew his business when he gave us one day in seven in which to rest what do doctors prescribe in the pres ence of almost every ailment a rest cure a few days in bed breakfast in bed all day sunday in bed a complete change and rest they order the change because they know there is more chance that a patient will really rest if he is away from his ordinary worries and excitements it is the rest that cures with a few exceptions any dis ease that can be cured at all can be cured by rest together with the right attitude of mind but we americans will not rest we must be always under pressure always forcing ourselves up some moving stair case we telephone needlessly we write letters needlessly we make ap pointments needlessly an unoccupied evening is a tragedy a lonely day in the country a disaster quick call up soandso get out the automobile golf bridge poker set the vic trola going dance the foxtrot when does the next train leave for town no wonder we break down shockingly as compared with more restful people in middle life and die ten or fifteen years before our time american cities abound in tired discouraged ineffectual men and women full of pains and apprehen sions who might be restored to serenity and usefulness if they would learn to rest ls
