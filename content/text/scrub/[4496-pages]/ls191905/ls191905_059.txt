she loves me by hale merriman she loves me until last night i never guessed never dreamed that she cared she has always been so apparently indifferent so casual but last night i discovered that she has loved me all the timethat it was all a maskmaidenly shyness she confessed it it came about in this way i was just reading over the evening papers when there came a timid rap upon the door of my bachelor apartment kato my japanese servant being out i an swered the door myself she shrank back as if contemplating flight when she saw mecovered her face with her hands alarmed as well as astonished i drew her into the room she melted into my arms clung to me passionately kissed me she spoke in broken sentences she could endure it no longer she loved me so it was stronger than pride greater than maidenly reserve it was like a flame that scorched and seared and consumed her and would not be satisfied would i be kind to her merciful she was lovely i have always coveted her my fragmentary phrases mingled with her own our lips clung kisses turned to wine upon them i would have asked her to marry me long ago but i am such a penniless beggar but she loves me for myself alone having compromised herself by appearing unchaperoned at my apartments she suggested that we be married at once before the midnight bells rang out over the city we had been made one forever by jove the wonder of it that queenly creature loves me for myself alone how glad i am otherwise she might be disappointed when she finds out that it was not her newly acquired husband but a cousin of the same name who inherited the fortune mentioned in the afternoon papers
