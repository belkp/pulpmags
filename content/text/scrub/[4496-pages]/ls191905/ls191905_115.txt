 the handwriting detective wise young working girl who has a heart of gold but does not forget that harolds checkbook will be more useful as a life long companion than honest johns good ness and right there is where the stage director would be all wrong because the telephone girl at the busy wire of live stories would cheerfully chuck harolds checkbook into the extraordi nary place known as the middle of next week for one smile from honest john ill tell you how i know it look at those sudden spurts of the pen look how the last stroke in that i in love thickensthickens why that girl is just a bundle of emotions impetuous ardent counting a kiss as worth more than a lobster supper its a sure sign that thickening of the hori zontal strokes so i smiled a little as i heard her telling carrie how very in differently she had answered him when he said something thatand then i went in to see the lady editor the editorial room of this magazine was arranged by a person of exceeding wisdom what you see is a slender figure in wonderful blue and a blond head and a classic profile and blue cur tains of the same blue as the dress and a jar of pink roses femininemy im a breezy sort of a person myself and the effect of that room and that per sonality was to make me suddenly con scious of my hands and feet she looked frail and ideal and dreamy and i thought how hard it must be for her to do any thing except sit among cushions of the right color and dream of some golden knight she was finishing a letter as i went in and you know i said i couldnt make my eyes behave under those cir cumstances well i looked and i got a shock this is a piece from that letter moulya question of taste please note those compact letters that well regulated t bar that cautious capi tal m observe that the tops of the letters are angular and that the bottoms are round the t bar showed me temper and temperament severely kept under control the m showed me somebody who wanted to be selfish but despised herself for it the compact let ters showed me a shrewd level head but that angularity at top and round ness at bottom screamed aloud of a cap tious exacting contradictory intensely subtle and devious mindthe kind of a mind capable of standing off and calmly watching the worst agonies of the heart which beats below it not at all the dream ladyvery much not i told her some of that she looked at me with her impenetrable blue eyes and i knew that that brain was estimat ing me and my talk about handwriting she was new too since my time and then the business manager came in i knew him years ago and thought that i thoroughly understood himhon est kindly shrewd far seeingbut it happened that i had never seen his hand writing he sat down at his desk and wrote for me the first two words that came into his mind i suppose im giving myself away sadly he remarked with a smile you said something i slangily agreed look at those two words forum topics do you see it as i did here is the companion soul to the ardent unselfish and warmhearted telephone girl oh with differences of course time and experience and mental training have done a great deal to differentiate the young girl and the mature man but here also is one to whom a checkbook is less important than a smile and hes the business manager and famous for the way he holds down his job
