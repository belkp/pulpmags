louise rice number eight has some family re semblance to six and seven which is the reason i put it in here to show you how carefully a graphologist must judge my best regards the resemblance is superficial note that there are no similar letter forma ations this particular specimen is a baffling one and i have a suspicion that the personality is one of much reserve not that personality is accurately re flected in writing but that element of being like sex is sometimes hinted at as it were to an experienced eye note the suave attenuated small letters which are perfectly distinct and yet have their outlines cut down to the utmost sim plicity people who use that kind of a hand are more highly developed men tally than they are physically or spiritual ly not that any lack of physical health is indicated but that the writers inter ests are not fixed upon matters which concern only the body neither is the spiritual nature greatly encouraged to function this is a person of clear ac curate rapid thinking power who is not credulous who is what is known as hard headed and who has very clearly de fined ideas and convictions an inter esting personality i am sure but not especially magnetic except upon a de liberate intention of being so or on those rare occasions when the emotions are stirred that there is a capacity for deep and serious affection is indicated by the sloping of the writing rightward and you can see that this specimen is inclined very sharply speaking of affection if you want to know how loving your sweetheart is look at this matter of which way his hand writing leans roughly speaking we may estimate that the upright hand rep resents the zero mark in emotionalism from which each slight deviation right ward marks a step onward handwrit ing which all but lies down upon the line represents the limitthe hysterical and neurotic an illustration of this unemotional type is found in number nine not it was simply you will observe that the handwriting is really placed at the zero mark but that the effect of the writing makes it seem upright this effect is partly due to the formation of the letters which are plain and unobtrusive this person lacks imagination note the closeness of the dot of i to the letter which is a sure sign of a practical and literal mind this writer does not believe in fairies you may be surein fact doesnt be lieve in much of anything which cannot be demonstrated in words of few syl lables people of this type are very useful to the world it is they who keep us sane and practical and who provide us with steady and reliable and con scientious workers i dont know about number ten i was a lovely really i dont once in a while an hon est graphologist comes across a speci men either intentionally disguised or written when the hand was very tired or in sickness or in a fit of rage which it is almost impossible to decipher this is one of those if i read the speci men the way surface indications point id sayinconstant uncertain temper disposition to be moody some imagina tion a dry sort of humor affections in tense but unreliablebut i have a feel ing that the specimen has been doped maybe not but if not then it is a most unusual specimen indeed and i should need a hundred or so more words before i should be willing to stand by my diagnosis
