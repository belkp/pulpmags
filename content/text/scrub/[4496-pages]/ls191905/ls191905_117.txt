 the handwriting detective as it is possible for two human beings to be this person is fearful of every thing and cautious and reserved and introspective do i have to explain to any thoughtful reader why i know that isnt that the instinctive estimate you would make of this minute tortuous bit of writing and your instinct as to handwriting is frequently correct for graphology is based upon a long long line of instinctive reasonings reduced to a system why away back in camillo baldobut you dont want to hear that do you anyway there are a lot of famous names among the grapho logists of the centuries since camillo first began the serious investigation as to the meaning of the utter individuality of every individuals fist to return to the specimen anybody who writes that little cramped hand needs to get out in the world and breathe some new air he needs to learn to laughno hu mor in this specimen at all on the other and quite obviously without even a suggestion from the science of grapho logy there is the capacity for taking m inite pains if to that element more courage and initiative were added the character of this writer would promise a good deal for work requiring close and accurate attention number six nice girl that now and the train has give im guessing for there is no such thing as telling sex in handwriting i know of no better argument for the complete equality of the male and female than this one thingstripped down to the reveal ing chirography men and women are not marked by a single distinguishing mark just the same i think shes a nice girl there is sometimes a something about a bit of handwriting which suggest that which we rather vaguely call feminine and a person who has examinedoh some millions or so of specimens can sometimes be right in finding that some thing aside from that however the character as revealed would fit any young person of normal instinct good heart and fair brain development as for its being a youthful hand of that at least i can be sure after middle age is reached it is very difficult to say approximately how old a writer is ive known people of eighty who wrote as firm a hand as those of fiftybut youth fulness shows in the unformed nature of the letters just as it shows in the un formed features of the face in num ber six there is too much imagination and too much lack of forcefulness but that is true of all nice young people its a good fault if you want to see the evidences of maturity in a hand which has some re semblance to number six look at num ber seven the difference is plain the greatest day enough anybody can see it but it is almost impossible to describe it is like the very slight differences which exist between the face of a boy of twenty and that of a man of thirty there are no lines as later in life no real change that can be seized upon and yet exactly well here is a person too with imagination and some lack of force fulnessbut that is a more serious fault here than it is in number six it is in need of instant correctionor rather of instant attention the correction will take a long time each of these people is affectionate in that gentle sincere and tender way which makes one fond of home and tender and pitiful to weak things and a little sentimental my if they really understood each other and if six were that nice girl that i sus pected and sevenwell anyway they could be friends couldnt they if they were two nice girls
