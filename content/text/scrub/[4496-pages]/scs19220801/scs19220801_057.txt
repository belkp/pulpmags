 the house of the missing you either very very sorry or very very glad natalie she looked down for a moment and when she looked up again she was her usual friendly frank self well then why do you talk in that disillusioned way it isnt a bit like you clayton was silent then taking a wild leap in the dark he tried to be equally frank whatever the conse quences natalie i know it isnt like me it isnt even a real side of me but i had to do it today as i have had to do it before there is a real and vital reason and that is all i can tell you do you believe me she looked up laughing then as her eyes met his her smile faded into a look of wonder do you really mean that she demanded i really mean just that he assured her earnestly and i really mean that i simply cannot tell you any more than that butbutwhy that is absurd why cant you be yourself he shook his head despairingly natalie i have told you the truth and our friendship means far too much to me for me to lie to you of all people but i cannot tell you any more than that she stared at him for a moment or two and then he realized what a really wonderful girl she was for her hand went out impulsively to his sleeve and the eyes she raised to his were full of sincerity i believe you then she said simply and your reason does not matter he must have let some of his appre ciation show in his eyes for she flushed a delicious pink and dropped her own quickly he leaned a little nearer to her and you see i can still be very very glad about something he told her she changed the subject rather hastily do you remember my telling you about some wonderful tea i had had just before our first meeting she asked clayton hastened to assure her that he did remember that they had discussed that tea several times and wondered about its peculiar properties well mrs fawcette has promised me some more of it and she is taking me there this afternoon to the same place clayton asked her words filled him with a vague apprehension perhaps because by now he hated the thought of associating her closely with anything that had to do with his quest yes to the same place now whats the matter she added laughing well he answered frankly i hate the thoughts of your taking drugs of any kind however mild you dont be long in that crowd natalie she laughed oh but i must have some more of that tea if only to con vince myself that there was nothing in it and that my queer mood was only a mood well if you must go there i wish youd let me go with you i know its a funny request and i dont quite know why i dont want you to go there with out mebut i dont clayton felt very young and awkward with that speech but there was so little that he could tell her to warn her and he did not trust either mrs fawcette or her friends natalie looked up at him curiously you are in a funny mood today she said but if you want to come along i should think mrs fawcette would be delighted to take you before he could answer she had turned to that lady mrs fawcette she called gaily mr clayton is dying to come to the tea
