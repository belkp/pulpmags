the house of the missing came into contact left her comprehend ing at least in part and yet quite un touched in her own sweet calm and slightly shy personality to clayton during those days she was like a breath of sea air in a crowded departmentstore or a bunch of roses on a tramp steamer before many days had passed she filled most of his waking thoughts and many of his dreams they saw a great deal of each other and had many happy days together days so happyat least to claytonthat he could never think of them without a catch in the throat and a tightening of the hands in view of what came after for as their friendship ripened he grew to realize that her mind and spirit were as sweet and lovely and gracious as her person moore accomplished little more than clayton did during those three weeks the young fellow from whom he had obtained his first hint of a circle of drug takers de luxe had in truth disappeared being a wealthy young man of consid erable social position his disappearance became a ninedays wonder but for all that no trace of him was found moore and clayton decided that their first surmisehis lack of reticence that nighthad been the cause of his disap pearance moore did however get in touch with young dr vining who had overheard that conversation and after a while suc ceeded in making his acquaintance vining apparently took to him at once and when moore carelessly mentioned the fact that he had independent means vining contrived to see a good deal of him aided and abetted by moore him self once or twice moore vaguely skirted the subject of his conversation with the young fellow who had disappeared but vining displayed a bland ignorance of any such conversation or of any place where such a party as the young man had described could be found however moore did not despair but continued to cultivate the friendship in his effeminate and lackadaisical way until presently vining knew all about his passion for new and outlandish sen sations but events were shaping themselves for both clayton and moore during those weeks the end of their period of inactivity came suddenly and at the same time to both a few days before natalie planned to leave new york mrs furneau ar ranged a little luncheon to which clayton was invited among others the luncheon included mrs fawcette clayton spent a trying two hours he had fallen almost unconsciously into the habit of being very much himself when natalie and he were alone together and his change of manner when talking to mrs fawcette and to mrs furneau must have been striking he caught natalie looking at him once or twice in a puzzled way during the luncheon but so far as the quest was concerned it would have been more costly to strike a false or inconsistent note in the ears of the older women than in the ears of natalie so clayton was forced to carry on a miserably cynical disillusioned and worldweary conversation with his hostess and mrs fawcette sick at heart all the time at the halfconcealed sur prise in natalies eyes it was a little better after luncheon however he contrived with some dif ficulty to have a word or two with na talie away from the others they had always been frank with each other and this conversation was no exception al though she was just a little cool at first imim very very sorry that you are going away he said to her are you i should not imagine that anything would have the power to make
