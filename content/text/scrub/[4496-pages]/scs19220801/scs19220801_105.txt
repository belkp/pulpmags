 her friend the burglar mr kenyon told me of your request for a loan mrs kenyon went on i can realize the temptation which dress must hold for a girl in your position but doris interrupted her angrily can you she cried contemptuously i wonder if you can and i wonder if you could resist it if you did but i tell you i didnt take the moneythat every word ive said is trueand im not going to admit something that isnt so no matter what you promise to do if i should in disgust at the brazenness of the girl mrs kenyon took her departure and chief collins himself escorted her to the motor in which her daughter was waiting it is really too bad she deplored to the official she is so young to be so stubborn and so callous yet i suppose we must expect it in view of the mod ern attitude of young girls toward lavish adornment and enjoyment of lux uries beyond their means but chief collins knew more about human nature than mrs kenyon did and his experience was wider with young men and women who had made similar slips because of their envy of others more fortunate in worldly pos sessions so he walked meditatively back into the station house and with a friendly light in his eyes paused before the bars of the cell in which doris was sitting dejectedly her burning cheeks hidden in the palms of her quivering hands now dont take on like that kid he consoled her gently maybe things wont be so bad after all i hateall of you doris blurted out unable to control her emotion sure you do agreed the chief thats only natural we all hate people who catch us doing something we oughtnt to do i tell you i didnt raged doris and i tell you you did contradicted the chief calmly we wont fight over thatbut ill tell you how you can keep on sticking to the truth and get out of this little cage doris looked up at him in astonish ment but the officials eyes were twink ling you didnt spring anything new he said did you think you did i dont understand stammered doris no queried the chief arching his eyebrows suppose you tell me the name of the young man who was work ing with you and explain what fright ened you both away before youd com pleted the haul so that was what he thought doris realized in an instant why she was being held and it only increased her helpless nessfor she did not know the burglar and could not even attempt to explain what he looked like that in itself she saw only made it seem as though she was trying to shield the man they be lieved to be her accomplice he was foxier than you the chief told her for he wore gloves and rub bersoled shoes but we found his foot prints in the grass the same as yours now youre too good a kid to tie up with a crook like thata contemptible skunk wholl slink away and leave a silly girl to get caught in his place come onout with it wherell we find him doris could only protest that she did not know well all ive got to say was chief collins parting shot youre about as senseless a little fool as i ever came across if you wont loosen your tongue you deserve whats coming to you vi when doris closed her eyes she seemed to live again all that had taken place and she found herself wondering
