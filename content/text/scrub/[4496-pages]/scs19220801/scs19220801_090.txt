the radio roadster grinding of brakes in front of the bungalow a light gleamed through the leaded panes of the window and streamed bril liantly through the open door yet save for the noises of the night the place was as still as a tomb even in the anxiety of the moment van horn blamed himself for permitting the girl to come but he could not help admiring her fearless courage in fact she was so impetuous that he was obliged to seize her roughly and thrust her aside to prevent her entering the place before him then he crossed the veranda at a bound and stepped alone through the doorway of the spacious livingroom obviously the police had not arrived and none of the neighbors appeared to have ventured up there the easels and furniture of the familiar room seemed to be undisturbed and so far as van horn could see the apartment was deserted with his gun clutched tightly in his fingers he called out loudly but no one answered him and alicia crowded be hind him into the room over his shoul der she caught sight of the feet and legs of a man protruding from under a table and involuntarily she uttered a horri fied scream van horn stepped forward quickly and kneeling beside the body found himself peering into the features of car ter harrington at a glance he saw that the artist was dead and the blood was oozing from a jagged hole in his forehead clearly there was nothing they could do for him and van horn with some apprehension began to search the place quite possibly they might be watched and he was afraid for alicia but if she felt any timidity it was not apparent with a businesslike air she examined the room while van horn peered into the alcove where harringtons bed was made up and then satisfied himself that the kitchen was empty he found no vestige of any intruder the two were alone with the corpse and the murderer was gone if carmen cas tleton had been there not even a trace of the exotic scent she used was notice able but the lid of the phonograph cabinet was raised and on the dial was set the fillex de cadiz record in mute evidence that the signal of distress had come from this very room harrington was dressed in a dinner jacket and a polo cap lay upon the rug but the studio was dusty and despite the open door the air was damp and stale no trunk or other luggage was to be found and it seemed as though the bun galow had not been occupied since the owners departure for europe some months before nor was there a car parked outside anywhere near the building van horn looked at alicia with a hopeless expression i guess im pretty sad as a detective he confessed rue fully who was herehow they got hereand where theyve gone is much too much for me and for me conceded alicia but a bullet made that woundand poor carter has no gun she turned away from the gruesome object on the floor and went curiously to the table where a radio set was mounted its clicking she said in surprise the varnished surface on which the double throwswitch rested was blistered and burned and if it had not been for the wound in harringtons forehead van horn might have supposed that an electric shock had killed him whether the dead man or someone else had been receiving or sending ted could not tell but he saw that the switch was now barely touching the receiving amplifier he pushed it all the way over and put the headpiece to his ears
