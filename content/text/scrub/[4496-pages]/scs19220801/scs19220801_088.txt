the radio roadster things youve heard this valleys full of amateur stations but you surely have an idea it was insisted vaguely he admitted it must have come over a threehundredmeter wavelength or lessso it couldnt be far away but i havent any means of figuring what station is meant by those letters although an official register would tell well why bother shrugged court ney blair somebodys trying to pull a joke on us everybody knows we pick up waves in the evening and theyre hoping well fall for the trick but alicia gripped van horns arm and whispered excitedly theres something about it that makes me feel all creepy she told him oh cant he catch them again and find out whether anythings wrong ive been trying the operator said but they seem to be dead alicia gave a horrified shudder but van horn reassured her he only means in a radio sense ted explained he cant catch any more waves from them just wait a minute the operator suggested ill broadcast a bit myself and ask whether anyone else heard what we did then as they stood about him he be gan to send his spoken queries through the air in every direction to be caught by countless radio sets in the valley and up the mountainside a few moments ago in his efforts to pick up the song more distinctly he had adjusted his loops to intercept it to better advantage that experiment had made him believe that the singers voice came over the waves from the north consequently he started to volley questions diagonally to the east and west of the point where he suspected the musical message had emanated soon he began to be flooded with replies and it was some moments before he could establish order out of chaos in his receiving set but gradually one by one he commenced to receive answers from various spots over the country side the song and the supposed shot and the partial sos had all been distin guished by houses equipped with anten na for miles around and the consensus of opinion was that the alarm was a hoax but the operator told van horn that police headquarters at west farming ton was now taking a hand in the hunt the campers were in a flurry of ex citement but the wireless operator shut off his amplifier so that incoming news reached no ears but his own dick duars and emlyn warren were for getting out their plane and soaring over the valley in search of what they might see but the others argued that such a proceeding was hopeless espe cially at night when the roads could hardly be seen at the altitude the two would have to maintain nevertheless the men started off for the hangars and ted van horn gave a surprised exclamation as he glanced at the memo the wireless man was writing on his pad the chief of police had traced the mysterious signal letters and advised the camp operator of the name of the man from whose set they had comeif the call was genuine without a word to the others van horn led alicia aside and told her what he had seen the name the operator had penciled was that of carter har rington whose bachelor studiobunga low was perched halfway up the moun tain not twenty miles from carefree as the crow flies ted alicia said as she gripped his arm i wish i knew whether nick has gone home somehow i cant help link ing nick with anything that concerns carmen castleton just suppose she
