a rogue in love more about rehearsing alice was dumbly grateful and hurried away however it didn t occur to her that miss devereaux had staged this scene especially for her benefit she was spared that agony alice went home to her boarding house and cried herself to sleep on the bed but at six o clock hal ross came to take her to dinner and for the first time in her life perhaps she was glad to see a man and showed it oh hal it s you she said and held his hand so tightly that he caught himself dreaming extravagantly and blushed they were a great deal together during the next week and it was only because his professional future was undecided that hal restrained himself from declaring his love yet he believed that alice knew he cared for her and hoped she would wait let me get a chance at sutherland s part once i ll show em all what i can do ross said setting his teeth and gripping his hands now the managers won t trust me with a big part because i ve never done anything important there s got to be a beginning to everything but these theatrical moguls apparently don t see it that way i ve got to show them first though i m given no opportunity to do that very thing well let me get my teeth in sutherland s role just once alice felt discouraged humbled chastened i don t know whether i could play miss devereaux s part if i got a chance at it she said iii seeing alice and hal together so much and recalling the girl s expression after she had listened to the scene between maurice and herself diana ceased to bother her head over the probability of the actor s indulging in another love affair he might be smitten but alice was cured miss devereaux was malicious enough to laugh at the idea of sutherland suffering from unrequited passion as for maurice the play had settled down on broadway for what looked like a healthy run and he found himself again with both time and the inclination to play around he had never forgotten alice ainsley s long and untiring efforts to secure a position in his company and it needed only hal s attention to the girl in order to set the wheels in motion another man found her desirable therefore it was time for sutherland to act and how do you like your first new york engagement miss ainsley maurice said to her one night in the wings alice had a chair and was supposed to be studying miss devereaux s performance once had he spoken to her she would have blushed and stammered now she laughed a little at his question for it stirred her sense of humor i suppose it is a new york engagement mr sutherland she told him still smiling though i have never set foot on the stage before an audience nor spoken a line out loud he laughed too an understudy s job isn t very thankful is it he said however who knows when you will go on in the part we aren t wishing miss devereaux any bad luck are we but you re quite prepared for any emergency if i know the signs miss ainsley love the theater yes like new york i ve seen really very little of the city with daily rehearsals but now it was his opportunity and he seized it i adore new york said sutherland with the impressiveness which characterized his love scenes i was born here have lived here pretty much all my
