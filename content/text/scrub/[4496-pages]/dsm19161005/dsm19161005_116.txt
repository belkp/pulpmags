tales of the chemists club they succeeded before ritchie could make up his mind upon a course of pro cedure when they were gone the chemist sat by the table trying to think he made poor work of it being deadly tired in the brain he would fancy himself engaged in formulating a line of action and would wake with a start to find his thought busy with a prob lem of years gone by a question of conduct long ago decided the wrong way again he would picture himself denouncing atherton on the follow ing dayspeaking a speech to him full of high moral principles and absurdly unsuited to the person addressed while his mind was thus running around like a squirrel in a revolving cage accomplishing nothing at great ex pense of energy he was suddenly aware of medway who entered in haste ive got rid of those fellows said he and now i want a few minutes quiet talk with you you cant talk too quietly to suit me replied ritchie ive got nervous prostration medway looked as if he thought the chemist expected him to laugh and then he shifted to the serious side of the proposition youve been having a hard time said he i know that and its the real cause of my being here atherton thinks its your reputation for honesty and that i trust you no sir youre hard up and youve made up your mind not to stand it any more suppose i have said ritchie what then medway leaned forward and tapped him on the knee in the britons hand were some coins which jingled as he tapped youll give me a private report on that ore said he ritchie had hardly expected the lamb in this transaction to show so much worldly wisdom why whats the game he asked stupidly they think the yellow dog is no good said medway and they intend to bribe you to make a favorable report to me take their money take my money and make three reports one pri vately to atherton that the claim is no good another privately to me stating the facts and a third to all of us con taining whatever they want you to put into it you can all go to blazes cried ritchie i dont want anything to do with you medway laughed youll feel better about this tomor row he said sleep on it but for the love of heaven get to work on that assay as soon as you can im scared grayheaded for fear some one else will come along and make them an offer for that property ten thousand dollars would buy it and unless ive lost my eye its worth fifty times as much my terms with you will be these a full price for your work anyway and you can get another one out of atherton so youre a winner anyhow and if my game works ten per cent of the difference between what i pay for the mine and its honest value get out said ritchie medway laughed and made a hur ried exit saying as the door closed think it over think it over ritchie tried to think it over but the harder he tried the less he accom plished experience had taught him that when he got into that condition he could find some small relief in work so having nothing else to do he began to prepare some samples of yellow dog ore for assay no sooner were his hands busy than his brain evolved a ra tional idea ill make an honest assay of this stuff said he to himself and force those fellows to pay for it ill charge them enough to get me out of this for a ds
