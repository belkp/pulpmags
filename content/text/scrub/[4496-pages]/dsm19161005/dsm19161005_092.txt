the captive soul nificance i will explain to you what has happened to miss white the name of elie metchnikoff is perhaps familiar to you for he is the greatest man in his field todayex cept myself to prove out a certain line of theories my grandfather began work in this laboratory more than a hundred years ago he left the work to be finished by my father who after years of labor passed it still uncom pleted on to me so that more than a century of incessant toil and study has been the work necessary to produce re sults that i have reached where metchnikoff is today i ar rived twenty years ago metchnikoff has said that under certain conditions man can live forever he is right but he has never yet found those condi tions he is on the right track his theories are all sound however his greatest opponent is man himself metchnikoff has found that life is made difficult in the animal body and finally ended by certain protoplasmic cells and the place where these bac teria get in their best work is in the in testinal tract the obvious remedy therefore is to introduce something that will destroy this deathproducing enemy and with the discovery of the microbe glycobacterium the problem appeared solved so it isif this mi crobe can be kept alive in sufficient quantities but to do this it must be fed the right food and to feed it you must first feed the man in whose intes tine it is living that is the task that can never be accomplished for unfortunately man is so constituted that he is a slave to his appetites what man do you think unless he was put in a cage and fed like a beast would maintain a life long diet of the required kind i have solved the problem in the only logical way he went to the stand that supported vivians head it has been demonstrated that when the animal stops breathing the tissues of the body do not always die but that provided with the proper me dium they can be kept indefinitely alive this baseindicating that from which the neck aroseis filled with a liquid that will feed the tissues of the head forever with all the food necessary for healthy reproduction she is the fifth person to whom i have given everlast ing life and i find that rid of the en cumbrance of a body the brain is clearer and more capable of concen trated thought after i have made my discoveries known to the world it will be only a question of time when people will live to a certain age under normal conditions then have the body re moved and the real being consisting of or closely allied to the brain will con tinue to live and the great work of the world will be carried on by these clear brained thinkers miss white will remain in a state of coma for perhaps a week come i will show you the other people i have with me yes i actually sat and listened to that fiend that archvivisectionist as he expounded his hellish theories indeed such was my state of mind that at his invitation i arose and followed him into an adjoining room there we found the heads of four men and women each mounted on its pedestal to my further astonishment if that is the word to express the mental shock i had sustained they were con versing in low wellmodulated voices as i entered an old graybeard looked at me sadly and said in a firm clear voice as though speaking to the others another who will be denied the peace of death strange but the significance of his remark did not strike me and still in a kind of daze i followed hetzel back into the laboratory the scientist who was in advance said
