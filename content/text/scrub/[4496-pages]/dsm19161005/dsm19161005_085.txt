the captive soul by h ellis davis i had arrived the day before for some late fishing but as the weather was raw and gusty i re mained inside my little oneroom lodge and sorted tackle i had built this camp several years before and two or three times each year i came here to fish or hunt ducks it was two miles up the winding bayou from the mississippi sound and stood on a little eminence surrounded by scrub oak with the somber swamp stretching away at its back it was perhaps a dreary lonesome spot but to me a busy practicing physician of new orleans the days spent here alone relaxing my mind exercising my body were welcomed periods of rest on this trip i had promised myself i would do something i had wanted to do for a long timevisit an old savant a doctor hetzel who lived across the sound on gull island from the mouth of my bayou his big white house which except for one servant he oc cupied alone could be plainly seen on the western extremity of the island a mere strip of sand running for miles along the outer edge of the sound living the life of a recluse hetzel was hard to approach but i had read several of his books with interest and had a desire to meet their author those on vivisection especially were written with a boldness and finish far beyond anything by his contemporaries showing throughout where a fixed end was to be reached the ruthless fanati cism of the true teuton wealthy seclusive a mysterious family of scientists the hetzels had lived on gull island since beyond the memory of the oldest natives and this old man was the last of his line tradi tion had it that out of the east had come a great ship with the first of them and the material for the big stone house and back into the east it had gone never to return as the dusky twilight began to creep into the room and i bent lower and lower over my work suddenly without hail or knock the door opened and a man entereda man stooped white locked wrinkled trying to show no surprise at his sudden appearance as i was seated on the floor i pushed a chair toward him with my foot and invited him to sit down listlessly he sank into the chair and sat there in the half light regarding me with an expressionless stare his lips forming words and moving without sound as is often the case with very old people at last he spoke and i was surprised to find his voice clear and strong with scarcely a quaver doctor tyson who i am makes no difference but what i am about to re late if i can force myself into the tell ing will shock the entire civilized world rising nervously from his chair he several times paced the length of the room then but i cannot shake from my mind the doubt cannot remain decided whether or not i should tell you and let the world take its action in the matter
