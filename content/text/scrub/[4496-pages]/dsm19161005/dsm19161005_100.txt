snarled identities order from me dont think you can stop this by trying to have me arrested you will fail and the whole story will come out i have fully arranged for its publication no matter what happens to me the money is the only thing that will buy my silence pay it and your secret is safe what is more you will never hear from me again refuse to pay it andruin it was a bold letter but flint saw that it was nothing but a bluff he said as much i hope you havent been deceived by this he remarked tapping the sheet this fellow is working alone you may be sure and therefore it isnt at all likely that he has arranged anything of the sort in case he should be ar rested by this as you ought to know the newspapers would not publish a story about you without warning you have too much money and too many friends you would have an oppor tunity to bring your influence to bear and the story would be killed that sounds plausible enough gil lespie admitted thats what i would tell any one else in my position if he were similarly threatened when this sort of thing comes home to a fellow though it makes a lot of difference i know the detective replied with a nod thats the sort of mood such a scoundrel counts on he paused and thoughtfully fingered the letter i must confess that this is a disap pointment he resumed slowly i had hoped that the blackmailer would set a definite time for his call or ask you to take the money to some specified place this however avoids anything of that sort and leaves me nothing definite to go on all it tells us is that he expects to call at some unnamed hourperhaps today perhaps tomorrow perhaps not for several days i think we need not bother about the hint that he may send some one with a written order for if such a person presented himself i feel sure it would be the blackmailer and no other this absence of details how ever makes it rather difficult to know just what to do how would this do gillespie said hesitatingly you are a genius at makeup why dont you pass your self off for me go to my place on fifth avenue and wait for this fellow wherever he is to call the chances are that he wont put it off very long and even if you had to remain there a couple of days you would not mind would you if you could nab your man at the end of your wait chapter xliii an astounding ruse giillespie went on more confi dently it ought to give him the shock of his life to think hes dealing merely with me and then to have you reveal yourself to him of course we could both stay there and you could walk in and collar him while he was holding me up but im afraid he may be watching the house in that case he would be suspicious if he saw any one else going in and not coming out again no matter whether he recognized you or not flint smiled slightly you must have been reading detec tive stories lately gillespie he com mented however it isnt a bad idea and im inclined to try it there are certain other advantages about it which make it appeal to me how about you though you would have to remain here as long as i found it necessary to stay at your place oh thats all right i dont mind ill promise to keep out of sight and if i have to stay overnight i suppose i can find a bunk somewhere if youll explain my presence to your servants you certainly can flint assured him and lets hope that you wont have to kick your heels here very long the detective conducted him into an a ds
