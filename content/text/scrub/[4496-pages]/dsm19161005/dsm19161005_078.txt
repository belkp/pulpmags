a rustic rival bennett had just got back from some where all this time i was doing some thinking why had mrs bennett told me her husband had gone off to stay a day or two when she knew that the horse and wagon were in the yard what had she been doing in the stable how did she account for the horse being there without any driver it wasnt reasonable to suppose that she had been out anywhere in the wagon dressed as she was in short said nick you believed mrs bennett guilty of the crime no sir replied fairman with something like a chuckle id been keeping my eyes open and id seen one or two things in the first place the thief had ripped up several planks be fore hed found the right one mrs bennett knew where it was in the second place she never could have ripped up those planks it re quired a mans strength now heres the problem and i think its worthy of your genius mr carter mrs bennett lied to me she tried to keep the affair a secret her man ner was calculated to excite suspicion in anybody her story about her hus bands absence shows that she knew something had happened to him yet she didnt do the deed she screamed when she found that it had been done how do you reconcile these facts let me have a few more facts first said nick what happened after she left you and wilson several other men came by and wilson called them in they were most of them strangers who had come up here to fish wilson explained the case to them and a search of the stable was begun i didnt wait for it i didnt have the time to waste he looked knowingly at nick as he said these words i could not fathom his meaning but nick seemed to under stand i told wilson about your being here fairman continued i made him promise not to disturb things to hunt for the body but not to move it in case he found it till you arrived of course he wont find it why not i asked because it isnt there he replied with a wink at nick i was nettled to be treated in this way by a yokel yet i could not deny that he was a shrewd fellow i see your point said nick you think that the murder was committed somewhere else and that the bloody coat was put there just as a blind precisely cried fairman why should the murderer take pains to hide the body and leave the coat in plain sight theres something in that said the detective did you have any further conversation with mrs bennett no she hadnt got back from the house when i left i hurried away be cause i hoped to catch you before you left marvins that was the substance of fairmans story as it was told to us as we hurried toward the bennett house half a dozen men were talking ex citedly in the road before the house as we came up wilson was one of them others could be seen in the yard before the stable door well wilson did you find the body asked fairman as we came up no is that mr carter all eyes were turned upon the great detective thats the man said fairman with the air of one who is exhibiting a trophy im glad to see you sir said wil son walking up to nick this is a very strange affair from what this gentleman has told
