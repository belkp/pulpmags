the fool by charles woodstock if her husband hadnt been such a sheer fool as she contemptu ously dubbed him irene wal ters might at least have felt a slight qualm for the thing she had done to him as it was how ever her double betrayal of him in stilled in her naught but a feeling of vicious unalloyed joyfor it would mean that soon even in a scant few days or so she could at last leave for ever with the man she loved and the man who loved her the half dozen years of her marriage during which each succeeding day had seemed more dull and more dissatis fying than the other would then be behind hernothing more than a grim nightmare that would but serve to con trast with the glorious life that would be hers it was difficult to contain her elation she felt like calling up several friends and letting them know like tell ing the very servants downstairs like shrieking it aloud to all the world but she stilled her emotion and con tinued sitting quietly in her boudoir gazing steadfastly and with faroff eyes at her own reflection in the mirror presently she smiledslowly trium phantly a bit cruelly after all it was jasper himself who had been his own ruin for once though unknowingly and through no absolutely direct fault of his own he had mentioned just a few brief words of the thing he always kept religiously locked up in the very depths of his soulhis business not that she had wanted formerly to hear anything about it noheav ens no the very word alone was enough to send a shiver of repugnance through her if she were giving a din ner and he were late it was always that word business that was the excuse when he had to break an engagement they had made the same thing was blamed for it whenever she spoke of new expenditures for the house or of an elaborate affair or of some rather costly clothes or jewels it was always to remain undecided until he saw how business was going and how the books would balance at the end of the month she didnt know anything about the thingor didnt want to decidedly no even if she had it would have been useless for jasper never talked it was said to either man or woman in re gard to his affairs down in wall street that in fact was what had lately made her task so difficult that was why she had searched through his papers and his pockets that was why she had care fully cautiously cunningly sounded him in reference to his latest deal in the effort to find out just one thingthe name of the stock he intended unload ing as a surprise and a ruse to an opposing clique again she smiled it seemed ironic that she of all people should finally wish to learn something about that which she had abhorred however it was only through this very finding out her lover had shown her that they could ever hope to run off and have each other forever and all time and at last thank god it was to come to pass that very afternoonperhaps
