the green hat by v omar whitehead he street was deserted save for the usual be rated policeman and a few amorous cats which oblivious to all but lamour made pledges and sang serenades in their fashion even though draggled and cold from the fog which mantled all in a diaphanous but disagreeable cloak through which the moon shone fitfully it was in that part of the city which belonged to the bohemian element and though eminently respectable to look at was often the scene of boisterous hilarity but now even the night hawk had long since wobbled his way home the fog had put down a dampener against which even the spontaneous spirits of bohemia could not prevail and one might at this hour imagine that these houses were inhabited by the most sober of longhairs on the steps of a house rather more pretentious than its neighbors two cats sang in melancholy unison and nearby the policeman seeking what shelter he could find enjoyed even their compan ionship as compared to the deadly hush of the fog blanketed street without preface the door of the house was suddenly flung open and the cats with one dismal but most vociferous yowl sprang apart and there followed a si lence so profound that the policeman could hear the heavy breathing of the man who stood for a moment in the doorway a red shaded lamp somewhere back in the interior throwing his fig ure into a shadowy silhouette leaving the door slightly ajar the man ran swiftly but none too steadily down the steps and turned along the street away from the policeman used to such sights the guardian of the peace watched the man disappear in the mist and now that the entertaining cats had vanished the hushed silence which only a fog can produce left him no other companionship than that of his own footfalls so he continued on his beat he had taken but a few steps when the stillness was broken by shrieks the shrieks of a woman in terror perhaps in mortal agony a light in the house flashed on and off and the screams died down or as the policeman thought were choked back and again there was the peculiar quietness of the fog laden air the neighbors used to all kinds of noises paid no attention but the police man his professional acumen aroused investigated the following morning brainerd bennison was late down to breakfast and his wife a little darkeyed woman remarked with a suggestion of reproach in her voice as she handed him the morning paper you had to work late again on that old case last night i might just as well be a doctors wife the little i see of you and bennison snapped back as a man will when trying to cover his own fail ings well why didnt you marry doctor illington he wanted you bad enough and you still seem to enjoy his atten tions after a moments hesitation which bennison did not notice she said i think you are horrid brainerd ever since little marie came i have seen less
