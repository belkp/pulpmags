reflections of a vampire by june gibson i gaze at paul through lowered lashes and he thinks i tempt and pants if i looked openeyed upon his freck led nose and florid neck i would order him from the house ii harrys wife does not know that there are two kinds of wives those who manage their husbands and those who pretend they do not iii when i pass my hands lingeringly across roberts sleek hair he trembles he does not know that my jeweled fingers are more pleasing to look upon than the top of his head where it is beginning to grow bald iv john brings me pearls to match my exquisite beauty when he comes again i am wearing a clever duplicate of paste the pearls are edu cating my grandchildren v peter thrills at my anger when he drops a roll of crisp green bills in my lap it pleases him to think my love for him genuine not to be bought i am angry because he gives me the bills before my servant to whom i owe three months wages vi as i throw myself with abandon in to vincents arms he does not know that his scarf pin is being concealed in the folds of my gown vii yesterday franks wife pleaded with me she does not know that it is better to have a husband who is false than to have no husband to be false viii i clutch my bosom when harold kisses me he imagines he has aroused my passion i catch the odor of corned beef and cabbage escaping from the kitchen ix there are two kinds of women those who are not afraid of mice and those who have wellshaped legs
