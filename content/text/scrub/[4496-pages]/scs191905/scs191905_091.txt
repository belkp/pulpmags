 lonely heart know what i would doprobably stare like an idiotand get killed i merely obeyed an impulse that was anything but heroic perhaps i was morbidly curious perhaps i was horribly afraidfor i have heard that under the influence of fear one often does strange things perhapsbut there is no use to attempt analysis it wouldnt suit the story in the rear of the black hole i was confronted by a door over my head i saw an open window coughing pitiful gusts of light i was standing where the light fell upon me and as i moved into the protecting shadow of the door way some heavy object hurled from above crashed on the stone paving a fragment of it struck me on the cheek the pain of countless needles shot through my face i caught my upper lip between my teeth in an effort to con trol myselfa habit of mine that blow stung me to action it made me mad i felt as though i could batter the door down with my fists dammit i whispered tersely i am not often profane but that seemed the only possible way to express my feelings i hurled myself against the door and it crashed in it must not have been bolted for i was flung for ward face downward on the floor an instant i lay there stunned dammit i said again between my teeth unseen hands grabbed me they tore at me i heard my clothing rip dammit i choked for the third time let me it felt as though my skull was crushed it burned with the heat of a thousand flames there was nothing but darkness i could see a light like a starso very very dim that it must have been a million miles away the happenings of that period of unconsciousness are so twisted that i only retain a slight knowl edge of when i first opened my eyes there were many shadowsand in the shadows a face are you awake i heard a voice asking the words were far away are you awake it repeated then the veil was drawn i struggled to a sitting position my head swimming horribly who are you i asked but even as i asked it i knew i could never forget the pitiful face she seemed more forlorn than ever in the dimness of the room her large eyes more poign ant than stars i think i know who you are i said i saw you at olaf bjorns didnt i she nodded slowly my name is clelia she announced in good english her eyes never leav ing me clelia i repeated what an odd name i am partly englishmy mother we have always lived in london her eyes were more solemn than ever her fathers mother was from venice clelia is italian my mother like the name suddenly i remembered where i was and what had happened my head ached terrifically but tell me about all this i asked didnt i hear someone scream a little smile twisted her lips i am sorry i had to scream she confessed someone was hurting you clelia shook her head oh no my father told me to scream you mean that you did it deliber atelyto lure me here at a sudden thought i felt for my pocketbook it was gone ive been robbed that was why i screamed she said calmly but i am sorry oh so sorry i wouldnt have done it for the world
