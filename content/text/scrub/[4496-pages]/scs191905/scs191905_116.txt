the comet and the star how much collinge was beginning to mean to her no other man with whom she had been associated either on the legitimate stage or in pictures had awakened this tender feeling that had a maternal quality about it neva lloyd hated the ugly facts of life a woman of strong passions she had always held herself in check waiting for the man who would come to mean all the world to her and now she faced the realization that he had come but he belonged to another woman and she must neither forget it herself nor allow him to do so collinge was miscast as an actor his heart was not in his work he was flashing meteorlike across the motion picture sky but his trail would be brief he had too much virility to remain con tent with makebelieve incidents and some day he would go back to the busi ness world that called out his best ac tivities she saw that clearly but now she wondered if he would go soon enough to spare them both a disil lusioning scene she spoke now of his former occupa tion do you ever think of going back to it she asked not now he returned frankly at first i used to but i guess the lure of wealth has got me too five thousand a year doesnt seem much to me nowa days but you wouldnt remain a five thou sand a year man itd be tough climbing up to the twentyfive thousand class i thought you liked hard work i thought so myself once im hoping youll see how much bet ter it would be for you it isnt as if you were a born actor you know collinge turned puzzled eyes in her direction but im making good on your face and your figure and your ability to do stunts that hurt it startled him out of the complacent mood into which he had drifted since he had come south i have no real talent he asked slowly its just my personal appearance that gets across neva lloyd felt like a surgeon facing a delicate operation but she did not flinch from the task before her though it would probably take this man out of her life its your youth and your good looks and youre too big a man to go on making money out of those things he tried to digest her statement a few months ago he had had her own viewpoint of the situation but of late he had deluded himself with visions of his own glory but im a paradox star he protested neva lloyd smiled indulgently youre a comet with a brilliant tail and you never will be a fixed planet in our painted sky thank heaven for that it looks as if you wanted to get rid of me if i do its for your own good she said gravely your present work is not conducive to marital happiness arent you conscious of how little you see of your wife his brow darkened i dont believe she cares if shes drifting away its up to you to win her back before its too late you wouldnt want to lose her would you of course not his answer came quickly for he was still a primitive man with fixed ideas of right and wrong and an oldfashioned sense of the sacred claims of duty they walked on in silence for a few moments and then he stopped im not going in elsie went motor boating this afternoon and i think ill play the dutiful husband stunt and meet her on the dock he said with an attempt at lightness good boy neva lloyd commented and get out of pictures soon tom smay
