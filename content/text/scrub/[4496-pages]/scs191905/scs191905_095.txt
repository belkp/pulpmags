 lonely heart i think i have seen your lonely heart and tonight rather a singular coin cidence i happened to be down on east india dock and as i passed one of the shipping schooners a fairsized craft i saw a man and a girl it seemed rather strange to take a girl aboard one of those vessels but even at that i wouldnt have paid them any spe cial notice if she hadnt seemed reluc tant to accompany him i wasnt sure at the time but now i am positive that her hands were bound she looked back over her shoulder and in a sort of hazy way i saw her face it had the expression of a captured animal i be lieve she started to speak i passed on giving it very little more thought but her face haunted me i had proceeded only a short distance when i thought i heard a scream i stopped for a sec and but hearing no repetition decided i was mistaken id be willing to swear now that it your lonely heart and her master do you remember the name of the boat fortunately it was the wilhelmina hello i believe were here he thrust open the door and jumped out before the car came to a standstill i followed close at his heels wait till we return he instructed the chauffeur pushing a banknote into his hand misty darkness brooded over the squatty dark buildings of east india dock a stillness broken only by the shrilling of a river boat pervaded the air from where we were i could see the outline of the river front i walked close to braithwaites side his head was bent forward slightly his keen eyes scrutinizing the semidarkness before him suddenly he stopped damnation burst from his lips theres no need to go any further her mooringplace is vacant i can see from here theres just one more chance come on were going to olaf bjoras why to olaf bjorns i asked as we were once more deposited in the limousine youll see he snapped ive been a big ass i should have gone back when i heard that scream this last chance is based only on a sudden thought of mine it seemed years before the car drew up before the swedish beerhouse in structing the chauffeur to wait we en tered the stuffy place with its sawdust covered floor the usual motley crowd was theredrinking that unspeakable beer braithwaite sought out the slov enly blond waiter whom i had seen on the preceding night and asked for erics son upstairs came the surly reply come on my companion flung over his shoulder as he hurried from the room up a pair of creaking stairs i followed him into a musty hall he pushed open a door just above the landing yan ericsson was sitting be fore a table his pipe between his teeth his yellow hair more tousled than ever he looked up surprised as we en tered ericsson braithwaite snapped youre the damndest fool i ever knew the big swede got up he didnt know whether to smile or frown what do you mean i mean that even a boy of fifteen wouldnt let his girl be taken away from him and sold like a piece of cattle an angry snarl curled the big blonds lips its a lie he screamed he start ed to make a leap but braithwaite whipped out his pistol no you dont sit down the swede never moved sit down my friend repeated ericsson obeyed in a surly manner
