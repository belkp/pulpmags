the halfasleep girl one as though he had had a hand in it prowling in the yard with his deeply set dark eyes de brunner studied fleming knibbs you were here last night werent you he asked knibbs refused to answer though he knew the sick man was not de ceived what do you want de brunner continued still knibbs maintained his silence bring him here the command came in a hard inflexible tone from among the pillows the lean spokes man and his companion leaped to obey they half carried knibbs to a chair be side the bed fleming found himself looking squarely into de brunners eyes go said the paralytic to the two men lingering in the background they went knibbs felt the others eyes boring into him and he glared back defiantly no words were spoken it was a bat tle of minds de brunners pupils seemed to glow like coals and his whole attitude was of striving for domination it came to fleming at that dramatic moment as he fought back that bas tian de brunner possessed hypnotic power and a thrill of fear coursed through him he suppressed it quickly concentrating every force into his star ing eyes he must hold his own he must not allow himself to fall under the spell absolute silence prevailed in the room slowly knibbs became conscious of a numbness in the legs it grew upon him an inch at a time crawling like a snake past the knee and upward he became desperate frantic he tried to shout for help but no sound issued from his lips he tried to tear himself from the chair and dash from the room but his muscles were immovable re fusing to obey the mental impulse vaguely knibbs marveled at this it always had been his impression that hypnotic control of an unwilling sub ject was impossible obviously de brunner possessed an extraordinary power then a sudden calmness swept over him as he realized that fear would only undermine his resistance thus adding to the others strength though this was his first experience with hypnosis and he was accordingly handicapped by a natural awe of mysterious un known forceshe now coolly rallied all his faculties to defense and once again clearly met de brunners gaze and then the door opened and lola entered bearing a tray it was this interruption plus flem ings rally that spelled defeat for the paralytics initial stupendous attempt at controlling his captives mind with out a word he removed his gaze and sank deeper among the pillows send jim up he said in a normal voice lola set the tray on a bureau and going to the door called softly below shortly the tall thinlipped fellow sauntered in make this man secure in the next room ordered de brunner i want to see him later neednt gag him un less he gets noisy the chap called jim yanked knibbs to his feet and then they were in a small bare room furnished only with a cot silently jim pushed his helpless charge on the cot stretched him out at full length and made him fast to the frame with stout ropes ably knotted i guess thatll hold you awhile he grinned as he departed v knibbs lay there the balance of the morning and far into the afternoon occasional footsteps passed the door
