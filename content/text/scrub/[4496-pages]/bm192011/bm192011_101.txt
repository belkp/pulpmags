 two bells three days agothe one time he had gone ashorehe had seen her clinging to the doorframe of a thatched bamboo dwelling old babaches kid a leper he heard someone say and she had smiled at him an hour after that when the long boat was putting away from the beach and the tawny maidens of hivaoa ran out waistdeep in the green bay to wave farewell she was there her gold hair falling like glinting fire about her pale spfaydashed face ia ora na i te atua with the marquesan girls she sang that farewellthis white lotus that he had found dying in the mulch of the south seas the sight of her was to him a light that pierced his poisoned vaporclung brain and because he had seen her this pallid leperchild he knew that the hour had arrived when the master of the libertine must pay the penalty for having murdered his soul yet what would she think if she knew but she woxild never know hiva oa dreaming its eternal dreams beneath the brooding thunders of temetiu had already slipped into the pastand in its dreams she lay a part of them he shuddered again yes he would kill black michael he was below in his bunk nowdrunk as usual with the skipper gone the first mate cardi gan would come into commandand then he crept across the wet deck and down the companionway a door in the rear of the lazarette which was just off the main cabin ad mitted him to a passage amidships be neath the deck leading forward to a space in the focastle where he and five others of the crew bunked in the bulkhead door he paused a sooty slushlamp swung from the blackened beam cast sluggish light upon six bunks arranged in double tiers along the bulkhead it was a foul place reeking of vile sea odors two of the bunks were occupied the lower tier of one supported the hulk ing body of a bulletheaded mulatto clad only in short breeches while above him lay the boatswain a creole from new orleans they were both asleep and breathing heavily thrusting the weapon under his belt he retraced his steps along the passage amidships and in the gloom of the main cabin groped toward black michaels quarters a terrible fear laid frigid fingers upon his heart as he reached the door for a full minute he stood transfixed to the spot his breath caught in his throat then he grasped the knob turned it and the door swung open within the closed portholea pale eye of dreadstared at him the air was closetainted with rum and human flesh he listened for the sound of breathing but only the mo notonous murmur of the bilge water and the creak of straining timbers could be heard he drew the knife from beneath his belt the leper child came to him then a blinding flash of spiritual pal lor the shining recoil of hisdead self that sprang through the darkness of his soul and smote him paralyzed for the moment but black michael must die he reached the bunk looked down upon the indistinct sprawling figure a wave of hysteria swept him swamping his cottrage he wanted to run to throw himself upon his mattress and weep out the sorrows that twisted his heart but a swing of the blade a sick ening sound and it was finished he never released his grip on the hilt
