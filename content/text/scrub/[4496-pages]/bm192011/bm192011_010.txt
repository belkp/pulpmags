the man in the black mask she excused herself and before we had completed our cigars she danced into the room again attired in a natty motor ing costume her abstraction gone and gay as a butterfly taking the wheel her self i took the front seat with her while grimes lolled in the rear workmen had already completed the job of cleaning away the debris in the office a truck load of gravel and a pile of bricks gave evidence that despite the threats of the mysterious blackmailer to destroy the entire plant it was grimess intention to rush repairs as rapidly as possible as we climbed out of the machine backus who had been standing in the background his round red face wearing a puzzled expression stepped forward and greeted us find anything new chief grimes demanded the big man looked about him cau tiously then motioning us to one side produced from his pocket a small thin slightly bent piece of metal he handed it to the little president without a word grimes looked at it with a puzzled expression then passed it on to me im danged if i know what it is he admitted how about you lar son i gave the bit of metal a cursory ex amination then handed it to joan i think that the chief has struck oil the first shot i replied in other words that same piece of metal is a bit of the shell that kicked down your tower where did you find it chief in the upper room just over the of fice replied the officer it wasnt there this morning for i made a per sonal inspection and locked the door my self before stationing mitchell at the foot of the stairs shell jerked grimes non sense nevertheless i reiterated your tower was blown up with some kind of a shell you cant get away from the evidence backus wagged his head sagely as he replaced the metal in his pocket i had already won him for a friend i could readily see all right well admit its a shell then for the sake of argument grimes responded that doesnt put us any closer to the solution of the puzzle on the contrary i interrupted it does it stands to reason as any one who is acquainted with explosives will tell you that the shell was of small cali bre and filled with but very little high explosive else the damage would have been greater it was fired from some where and by somebody and from some sort of gun result we have but to find where the shell came from and we have your man in the black mask by the heels as well look for a needle in a hay stack my opinion is that some sort of explosive was planted in the tower in spite of the chiefs precautions and de tonated by electricitypossibly by wire less ive heard of such things dont you think that more probable than the idea you and backus have of some won derful gun and still more wonderful marksman not at all although my experience at the front taught me that despite the high point of efficiency reached by the gunners a direct hit is only scored acci dentallyunless the range is almost point blank ill venture the assertion that the gun from which that shell was fired is located not over two miles away in fact a mile would be a closer guess backus agreed with me for despite the fact that he was only a small town policeman he was no fool
