the georgetown mystery are you mad i asked i guess so helen he said mad with love of you hurry helen for we are going away to happiness that is just the way he put it again she paused and her eyes fell to the floor she presented a sad pic ture as she struggled to repress her emotion i finally got the straight of it af ter the first note he had s sent me an other proposing that we go away to gether it did not come until the next dayhe had taken the precaution to mail it in another town he pleaded i should go anyway because of his love for me andand would not leave he tried to take me in his arms i ran up stairs to escape him and he started to follow then i heard a car in the drive and and i knew mr lewis had come home it was a terrible moment i stopped on the stairs and begged mr harley to go finally he seemed to comprehend the situation and turned to go down the stairs but it was too late the car stopped outside the garage and it seemed only a second before i heard mr lewis on the rear porch mr harley had taken only two or three steps when mr lewis opened the kitchen door he came in quickly wondering i suppose why there was a light in the hall maybe he heard us mr harley started to run for the front door a rug slipped under him and he fell striking his head on the floor his neck must have been broken that way i darted on upstairs i did not dare stop i hurried into my room and lay down then in a minute i heard a gasp from mr lewis and and a dull sound i waited for perhaps thirty minutes not know ing what to do at last i crept down stairs the hall light had been jostled out i stumbled over something i found the light and turned it on mr lewis body lay over mr harleys i sup pose mr lewis had died from the shock an act of providence the tears welled in her eyes thats about all of the story she sobbed except that after i had stared at them in dumb agony for what seemed an age i came to realize they must not be found here frantically i paced up and down the hall not know ing what to do then a heavensent idea came to me i carried mr lewis out and placed him in his car just as he was found next morning then i half carried half dragged mr harley to the com mon dodging in and out of the shad ows it was a moonlight night and it seemed to me a thousand pairs of eyes were watching from each window he was heavy but i did not seem to notice that my muscles were deadened with fear then i stole home to my misery like a hunted animal she lay back against the divan ut terly weary and almost limp from her recital but what of the money dorgan managed to ask thats another miserable part of it she faltered of course he took it to go away on i noticed it in his pock et it made such a bulge something told me it was not his and i felt i owed it to him to protect his name when it was partly my fault that he did such a wild thing so i took it i remembered what he had told me about his sis ter he had given me her address so that i might get in touch with her should anything happen to him so i sent it to her i went to cincinnati per sonally and told the bank there to send it on saying that it came from a bank in ohio that is all will what is to become of me am i damned forever the
