 dust in the house floor when he died she stroked his hair and she dropped a kiss on his hair and she whispered that she was sorry that he was going to do what he was going to do because they might have been happy if things had been different and now he should listen to her little heels taptap tapping out of the room and out of his life because he was going to take the dagger and kill himself and he could not keep from doing it if he kept looking at the candles and thinking of lilith lame reaux and the past years when he might have been happy if he had been differ ent and then taptaptap and she was gone and he was alone across the table the woman dead a hundred years looked at him and it seemed that she smiled and urged him to be a man at last and not be afraid because it was not such a hard thing to be dead if there was love even a dead love in your life and the more he looked at her and at the two candles the more he knew that he had to kill himself and the more sure he was that he would kill himself the woman across the table seemed to change to lilith and there was the tappitytaptappitytap of his heart and the taptaptap of her heels on the flooror was she tapping on the table with her polished finger nails he could hear the blood pounding in his ears and everything was beating rhythmically to the tune of the taptaptap and words came and kept time with the music in his ears and he heard her say again and again you have to kill yourselfyou have to kill yourselftaptaptappitytap tapyou have to kill yourself little white drops of sweat came out on his face and slowly very slowly he reached for the dagger and with clenched hand did the thing he had to do two weeks later the old lawyer sat alone in his office now and then he reached in his pocket took out his little bottle and placed a tablet of nitro glycerin carefully under his tongue he was trying to think and his thoughts did not make any sense his stenographer brought in a card he glanced at it took another tablet and simply said have her come in in came a little lady beautifully dressed in black her little heels tap tapped on the bare floor please do not say a word till i am through urged the lawyer where have you been and why did you fail to answer our advertisements dont you know it cost you nearly two million if you know me now you knew me then and knew about the will and where were you that night let me tell you something i took your cousin to that house and left him there there wrere two bodies there tied to chairs around the center table and i left him there in the third chair the room was spotless there was no dust i was afraid so the next morning i brought a witness with me the very best detective i could find and when we entered that diningroom there was only one dried body there that of the woman the other body was gone and your cousin was dead he had been killed with the dagger that i found in the room and the detective took finger prints of the dead man and the dagger and he says that the man killed himself and it does not make sense and where is the other body and where were you that night i will tell you in confidence that the dead man was afraid of you he said that you had tried three times to kill him and now everything points to the fact that he got drunk and killed him self but why was the room so clean of course there is nothing i can do
