 weird tales like but i donr expect the authors to please everyone the loss of howard and love craft is irreparable to my mind how ard was tops and i hope you will honor mr robert j hoyers request for reprints or a book of mr howards stories especially the conan series i also propose that one of your other authors study mr howards style and characters and continue the conan series i dont think any howard fan would be too harsh with criticism after all conan was a strong character and many weaker ones have outlived their creators so lets make conan a monument to his creator lets hear what some of the others think of this proposal as to quinn let me say i heartily disagree with marian shortess i think roads was a truly wonderful story i read it to my children and i am sure it was more acceptable than the ageworn lies told to children down through the centuries i would like to suggest that our friend marian look up the real history of our socalled christian holidays then she will find that mr quinn really knew whereof he spoke as to mentioning christ and the virgin mary in a magazine filled with witchcraft ghosts werewolves and vampires etc i would suggest that she borrow someones holy bible and read it but i am afraid that if she did she might like the horrible and gruesome as well as the witchcraft stories contained therein so well she would forget to buy the next issue sorry to deny your request for some other author to carry on the conan stories of the late robert e how ard his work was touched with genius and he had a distinctive style of writing that put the stamp of his personality on every story he wrote it would hardly be fair to his memory if we allowed conan to be re created by another hand no matter how skil fullythe editor a lone cry donald v allgeier writes from licking missouri congratulations on the fine may issue i give first place to dreadful sleep williamson has done it again i agree with those who compare his style to mer ritts they are similar but williamson is a splendid author in his own right this seems to me to be as great a story as the now al most legendary golden blood pigeons from hell gets my vote for second place it cer tainly makes one long for howard to be back again theres a story that really caused the goosepimples horrible and frightening are the wordsa real weird tale perhaps its my preference for serials but even without that thunder in the dawn would rank high i rate it third it has all the elements of a true weird talemystery black magic fan tastic settingplus action that makes it comparable to the conan saga congratula tions to kuttner a writer who has certainly developed recently im sorry this story is only in two parts quinns latest yarn is so close behind that its practically a tie goet terdaemmerung struck me as an experimental type of storyto test readers reactions personally i prefer a story that i can under stand but as usual quinn delivers a fine job of writing the secret of the vault was quite good i wonder if the style reminded others of poe it seemed to me quite like some of e as masterpieces hamiltons latest is little but a clever idea but is worth reading the reprint was fair but the writ ing seemed strained why wait so long to reprint early stories by howard the eyrie is demanding them in recent issues i particularly liked the house of ecstasy with farleys abductor minimi digit and vallisneria madness it completes a trilogy of delightfully unique short tales i voice a lone cry for less lurid covers reprint from old issues edith mulder writes from lindenhurst long island i like the new serial dread ful sleep immensely im eagerly awaiting the finish i wish you would reprint stories in wt that other readers keep talking about like shambleau once in a thousand years and oh so many others that readers write about they make me long so for all the wts that were ever printed so i could read them all couldnt you reprint serials that were acclaimed also i agree with others that say they would rather have a serial reprint than a lot of new stories where once poe walked t gelbert writes from niagara falls new york features of the april issue are the temple dancer the garden of adompha and the very charming hawthorne tale feathertop mediocre and very much so are dreadful sleep and forest of evil i am glad to see seabury quinns tales featur ing others besides jules de grandin and the
