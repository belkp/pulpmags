 spawn of dagon the frightful devilmasks of monsters glared into elaks eyes the children of dagon came sweeping in a resistless rush cold eyes glazed and glaring tentacles questing iridescent bodies shifting and pulsing like jellyand elak and lycon and the girl coryllis were caught by their fearful wave and forced back up the staircase snarling inarticulate curses lycon swung his sword but it was caught and dragged from his hand by a muscular tentacle elak tried to shield coryllis with his own body he felt himself going down smothering beneath the oppres sive weight of cold hideous bodies that writhed and twisted with dreadful life he struck out desperatelyand felt a hard cold surface melting like snow beneath his hands the weight that held him down was dissipatingthe things were retreating flowing back racing and flopping and tumbling down the stairs shrieking an insane shrill cry they blackened and melted into shapeless puddles of slime that trickled like a little gray stream down the stairway elak realized what had happened a rosered light was glowing in the air all about him the wizard had repaired his magic globe and the power of its rays was destroying the nightmare menace that had crept up from the deeps in a heartbeat it was over there was no trace of the horde that had attacked them gray puddles of oozeno more elak realized that he was cursing softly and abruptly changed it to a prayer with great earnestness he thanked ishtar for his deliverance lycon recovered his sword and handed elak his rapier what now he asked were off were taking coryllis with ustheres no need to linger here true we helped the wizardbut we fought him first he may remember that theres no need to test his gratefulness and wed be fools to do it he picked up coryllis who had quietly fainted and quickly followed lycon down the steps they hurried across the great room and into the depths of the corridor beyond and five minutes later they were sprawled at full length under a tree in one of sanmus numerous parks elak had snatched a silken robe from a bal cony as he passed beneath and coryllis had draped it about her slim body the stars glittered frostily overhead uncon cerned with the fate of atlantisstars that would be shining thousands of years hence when atlantis was not even a memory no thought of this came to elak now he wiped his rapier with a tuft of grass while lycon who had already cleaned his blade stood up and shading his eyes with his palm peered across the park he muttered something under his breath and set off at a steady lope elak stared after him wheres he going theres aby ishtar hes going in a grog shop but he has no money how a shocked thought came to him and he felt hastily in his wallet then he cursed the drunken little ape when he slashed my bonds in the wizards pal ace he stole the purse ill elak sprang to his feet and took a stride forward soft arms gripped his leg he looked down eh let him go coryllis said smiling hes earned his mead yesbut what about me i let him go coryllis murmured and ever after that lycon was to wonder why elak never upbraided him about the stolen purse
