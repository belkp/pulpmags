 weird tales fence with me and waved as i got into my car i wasnt coming back any more i didnt want to see gannet again he was such a nice little guy but next noon saw me knocking for admittance a third time summoned by a call from nick got an exclusive for you if you want it he said an escape i dont know that its very important to you but weve never had one before that might make it worth a couple of inches escape i said yeah your man gannet so he did it but how nick grunted suppose you tell me in the night i asked he shook his head a little while ago in broad daylight he was seen in his cell at ten an hour later the room was empty he was gone but he couldnt have simply walked out of the place in broad daylight no said nick he couldnt was his door unlocked it was not it was locked from the outside when we came to investigate the report that he was gone his window bars are all right too youve searched the grounds of course he isnt in them he isnt in any of the buildings nobody saw him after eleven oclock hes just gone with his cell still locked so even a monkey couldnt slip out you must have some idea how he got away no idea because it cant be done only it was how am i going to get a story out of that i asked how in thunder would i know thats your worry i put a cigarette between my lips unlit because smoking wasnt permitted here what in the world do you suppose he thought he was building i mused nick snorted i dont suppose any thing about it if i did id be as crazy as he was well theres your exclusive if you know what to do with it i didnt know what to do with it so i finally handed it in as it stands now this very story in fact and the little man with the big vizor at the editors desk promptly handed it back not that i blame him nobody ever saw gannet again no body ever thought of him again i guess except me i had a rush of curiosity to the head a few days later and went to his cell armed with a level and a steel rule the floor of the barred cubicle gannet once occupied is three thirtyseconds of an inch off level now how do you suppose he could have determined that without tools of any kind to aid the naked eye
