 weird tales bin ayyub fellow may be the exception though i contend that whatever the art the orient provides is the result of in stinct and not intent i granted most of his contentions and then we discussed the great jar of attar and the surpassing loveliness of bin ayyubs family most fascinating really this sounds like what people think the orient ought to be but never actually is houris and incense and all that sort of thing then just as he left by the way did you ever read the quaint little tale of aladdins lamp sure what of it nothing really nothing at all merely curious you know now what had that buzzard meant by that remark a subtle way of calling me an outandout romancer or did he mean that in getting my isphahan i had stumbled into something aladdinlike and then i carefully examined the isphahan no revell had not palmed it and left a replica in its place strangely enough he had not even tried to trade or bargain for it it was fully two weeks before i could find time to call on bin ayyub to in spect the restoration of the thronerug but finally i did contrive to find some spare time and just to convince revell that i had not been releasing an arabian fantasy i decided to take him along cheers old bean greeted revell i was just thinking but how do you like it it the thronerug of saladin stared me in the face rich lustrous magnifi cent now that it had been cleaned and the pieces spliced together where in revell laughed at my amazement most amazing what but dont rub your eyes it is exactly what it looks like the rug of the justly popular saladin i was just thinking of asking you to trans late the inscription couldnt remember the exact wording you gave me several nights ago devil take inscriptions how did you get it unless he suddenly needed the money you could have done the same thing revell began as he poured him self a drink then painstakingly selected a cigar especially after i told you in so many words how to go about it how come told me how to go about it this was too much for me hed been up to dirty work of some kind it was unbelievable that he had purchased that rug and i doubted that he was clever enough to have outwitted bin ayyub then what breaking and entering well not very likely the last thing i said the other night was something about aladdins lamp i fancy you recollect but i was jolly well certain youd not follow my train of thought well the magician from el moghreb paraded up and down in front of aladdins palace offering to exchange old lamps for new ones and the prin cessmrs aladdinwas tickled pink to take an unfair advantage of an old mans foolishness so she joyously swapped the greasy tarnished old magic lamp for a nice new one never occurred to aladdin to tell the young person his wife that the rather crude old lamp was of some value simple really do you mean to say oh yes quite exactly in fact mrs bin ayyub greatly fancied a lovely ana tolian silk rug about the same size as the revered saladins thronerug which by the way she thought was a bit passăš liked my silk rug bright colors and not at all worn and all that sort of thing so we swapped and i fancy i noted a gleam
