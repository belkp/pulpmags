 weird tales told him what i had encountered and asked for advice he gave it the old lon chaney line he coun seled mystery man we say nothing about him until the picture is released after that i have a hunch things will work out for themselves the fellow is a marvel so dont bother about stories until the film is canned consequently i abandoned publicity efforts in karl jorlas direction now i am very glad i did so for there is no one to remember his name or suspect the horror that was soon to follow the script was finished the front office approved stage four was un der construction the casting director got busy jorla was at the studio every day kincaid himself was teaching him eng lish the part was one in which very few words were needed and jorla proved a brilliant pupil according to les but les was not as pleased as he should have been about it all he came to me one day about a week before production and unburdened himself he strove to speak lightly about the affair but i could tell that he felt worried the gist of his story was very simple jorla was behaving strangely he had had trouble with the front office he re fused to give the studio his living ad dress and it was known that he had checked out from his hotel several days after first arriving in hollywood nor was that all he wouldnt talk about his part or volunteer any informa tion about interpretation he seemed to be quite uninterestedadmitting frankly to kincaid that his only reason for sign ing a contract was to leave europe he told kincaid what he had told me about the devilworshippers and he hinted at more he spoke of being fol lowed muttered about avengers and hunters who waited he seemed to feel that the witchcult was angry at him for the violation of secrets and held him re sponsible for the release of return to the sabbath that he explained was why he would not give his address nor speak of his past life for publication that is why he must use very heavy makeup in his film debut here he felt at times as though he were being watched or fol lowed there were many foreigners here too many what the devil can i do with a man like that kincaid exploded after he had explained this to me hes insane or a fool and i confess that hes too much like his screen character to please me the damned casual way in which he professes to have dabbled in devilwor ship and sorcery he believes all this andwell ill tell you the truth i came here today because of the last thing he spoke of to me this morning he came down to the office and at first when he walked in i didnt know him the dark glasses and muffler helped of course but he himself had changed he was trembling and walked with a stoop and when he spoke his voice was like a groan he showed me this kincaid handed me the clipping it was from the london times through european press dispatches a short para graph giving an account of the death of fritz ohmmen the austrian film direc tor he had been found strangled in a paris garret and his body had been frightfully mutilated it mentioned an in verted cross branded on his stomach above the ripped entrails police were seeking the murderer i handed the clipping back in silence so what i asked but i had already guessed his answer fritz ohmmen kincaid said slow
