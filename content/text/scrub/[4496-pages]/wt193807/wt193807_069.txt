 weird tales old man he wanted to turn toward his own room on the second floor but var duks voice spoke his name and we both looked up startled on the stairs to the third flight stood varduk holding that black book open against his chest he spoke to schaefer i told you that i wanted to see you schaefer tried to swear at him after all here was a frail pale little frosh who didnt seem to have an ounce of muscle on his bones giving orders to a big football husky who weighed more than two hundred pounds but the swear words sort of strangled in his throat varduk laughed neither of you have ever heard a sound so soft or merciless perhaps youd like me to come to your room after you varduk suggested schaefer turned and came slowly to the stairs and up them when he got level with varduk i didnt feel much like watching the rest as i moved away toward my room i saw varduk slip his slender arm through schaefers big thick one and fall into step with him just as if they were going to have the nicest schoolboy chat you can imagine davidson shuddered violently and so despite the warm june air did i pursui vant seemed a shade less pink here ive talked too much david son said with an air of embarrassment probably its because ive wanted to tell this storyover a space of years no point in holding back the end but id greatly appreciate your promiseboth your promisesthat youll not pass the tale on we both gave our words and urged him to continue he did so i had barely got to my own digs when there was a frightful row outside shouts and scamperings and screamings yes screamings of young men scared out of their wits i jumped up and hurried downstairs and out there lay schaefer on the pavement in front of the dormi tory he was dead with the brightest red blood all over him about twenty witnesses more or less had seen him as he jumped out of varduks window the faculty and the police came and varduk spent hours with them being questioned but he told them something satisfactory for he was let go and never charged with any responsibility late that night as i sat alone at my desk trying to drive from my minds eye the bright bright red of schaefers blood a gentle knock sounded at my door i got up and opened there stood varduk and he held in his hands that black vol ume i saw the dark red edging on its pages the color of blood three hours old i wondered he said in his soft voice if youd like to see the thing in my book that made your friend schaefer so anxious to leave my room i assured him that i did not he smiled and came in all uninvited then he spoke briefly but very clear ly about certain things he hoped to do and about how he needed a helper he said that i might be that helper i made no reply but he knew that i would not refuse he ordered me to kneel and i did then he showed me how to put my hands together and set them between his palms the oath i took was the medieval oath of vassalage and i have kept my oath from that day to this davidson abruptly strode back along the way to the lodge he stopped at half a dozen paces distance maybe id better get along he sug gested you two may want to think and talk about what i have said and my ad vice not to get in varduks way with that he resumed his departure and went out of sight without once look ing back again
