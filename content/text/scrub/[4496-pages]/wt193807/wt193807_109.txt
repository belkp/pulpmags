 weird tales the grain of hasheesh dissolved in wine ones house becomes a place designed for the sheltering and storing of rare rugs though of course the collector him self has no moral scruples about utilizing a bit of that same shelter for himself one may wear last years overcoat and have last years shoes halfsoled but one can always raise the price however ex orbitant of a threadbare ladik a battle scarred ghiordes or a motheaten fera ghan thus though morgan revell was ex aggerating when he smiled in a way reminiscent of a cat who has just had a pleasant tăşteă tăşte with a canary and re marked id cheerfully have committed murder for that rug he was well within the limits of poetic license not that he would actually consider going as far as rope pistol or poison in fact i think he would stop short of breaking and entering but the fact remains that trifles can not stand in ones way when a really rare rug is in sight and very often a jest is the essence of truth well and that is that either you still maintain that a rug is but something to put on the floor or else you have grasped some conception of the fanaticism that consumes the confirmed collector of antique rugs if the former well and good de gustibus non disputandum est but if the latter if you have grasped the idea then perhaps you will understand why i crave a bit of fresh air and a change of scene whenever i catch a whiff of attar of roses or a glimpse of a fine hardspun silken cord i was making one of my customary reconnaissances prowling tours in search of the perfect rug the wondrous prize though what id have done with it is a bit beyond me unless id have tacked it to the ceiling all other space is occu pied furthermore i am at times hereti cal enough to fancy that it is better to know that the rent due on the morrow will be in cash available for payment to the landlord instead of being draped over a lounge or parked on the last bit of vacant wall or floor space a chubby oily little fellow from some where in asia minor with features that combined mephisto with kewpie ap proached and offered his services assur ing me that some rare bargains would be auctioned off that afternoon i assured him that i was merely prowling about a fine kirman worth seven hundred dollars he began just from force of habit perhaps you will bid on it get it for twothree hundred i didnt bother to tell him that id not use it for a bath mat that it was a sicklylooking mess with its flabby tex ture its aniline dyes bleached to un natural softness and its fearful glassy luster gained from glycerin and hot rollers and that it would hardly be a fit companion for a kirman roserug of the old school so he left me to my own de vices to tear down several piles shoul derhigh of rugs of varying quality mainly atrocities recently woven to satisfy the everincreasing demand for oriental rugs wretched rags which the auctioneer would later exhibit glassily agleam under a powerful floodlight and describe as royal bijar royal sarouk or royal kashan or royal whatever travesty it was on some ancient honor able weave weariness and more weariness i worked my way through the second pile and with like result an old feraghan tempted me but i decided that though honest and ancient it would cost too much to have the worn spots rewoven nor did the third pile bring forth any thing of interest then poking about in a dark corner i found behind a baled roomsized carpet a scrap of something
