 escape by paul ernst a brief weird tale about the escape of a madman he had the craziest form of crazi ness ive ever seen of course i hasten to add i hadnt seen much id been through an asylum once before as now to get a story for my paper on treatment and conditions of state inmates and that was all on that former trip id witnessed nothing like this nor had i till now on this trip the man didnt look crazy so often they dont he was a mediumsized chap with gray in his hair and a look of sad ness on his thin mild face a look of sadnessand determination neatly dressed precise of movement he was very busy in his cell he paid no atten tion for a while as the guard and i stood at the barred door and watched him he was building something he would pick up a tool adjust it carefully work with all the delicacy of a watchmaker for a moment then he would lay the tool down and pick up a gage and check his work all very accurate and careful the only thing was that you couldnt see what he was building and you couldnt see any tools nor gages nor workbench there was nothing in the cell but the man and a bolteddown cot and chair nevertheless the fellow was extraor dinarily industrious he would seize a nonexistent tool examine it with a frown and then use it on thin air after which would come the inevitable measur ing movements it certainly looks i said in a low tone to the attendant as though there should be something there the attendant grinned and nodded and i continued to watch fascinated you could follow the man through his whole box of tools from his rational movements now he was boring a hole obviously a very small hole with a tiny metaldrill equipped with an eggbeater handle now he was just touching a surface with a file now he was sawing something else after which he took the sawed part from an imaginary work bench and tried it in its placewhatever and wherever that was i got still another glimpse of unity of effort as i watched him each little period of accurate workmanship ended with a trip four steps to his left to a corner of his cell which was bright with sunlight there his motions said was the thing he was working on there was the object slowly growing bit by accurate bit which he was making and assembling it was uncanny there simply ought to have been something therea cabinet chair whatnotand there wasnt the man slowly screwed an imaginary part to an imaginary whole then laid down his imaginary screwdriver and walked to the door for the first time acknowledging our presence there hello nick he said to the attend ant his voice was as mild and as sad and as oddly determined as the rest of him hello said the attendant aifably his goodnatured broad face turned from the man in the cell toward me meet mr freer mr gannet mr freers with a newspaper
