 he that hath wings in pairs each mating season he felt the same thing in his own breast now the urge toward this girl he did not think of it as love but suddenly he loved her he told ruth hall slowly im all right now but she said you must stay here un til youre completely well its the least we can do when it was our servant who almost killed you david stayed as the wound healed he did not like the house whose rooms seemed so dark and stiflingly close to him but he found that he could stay outside during the day and could sleep on a porch at night neither did he like the newspaper men and cameramen who came to wilson halls house to get stories about the winged mans accident but these soon ceased coming for david rand was not now the sensation he had been years ago and while visitors to the hall home stared rather disconcertingly at him and at his wings he got used to that he put up with everything so that he might be near ruth hall his love for her was a clean fire burning inside him and nothing in the world now seemed so desirable as that she should love him too yet because he was still mostly of the wild and had had little experience in talking he found it hard to tell her what he felt he did tell her finally sitting beside her in the sunlit garden when he had finished ruths gentle brown eyes were troubled you want me to marry you david why yes he said a little puzzled thats what they call it when people mate isnt it and i want you for my mate she said distressed but david your wings he laughed why theres nothing the matter with my wings the accident didnt hurt them see and he leaped to his feet whipping open the great bronze wings that glit tred in the sunlight looking like a figure of fable poised for a leap into the blue his slim tanned body clad only in the shorts which were all the clothing he would wear the trouble did not leave ruths eyes she explained its not that davidits that your wings make you so different from everybody else of course its wonderful that you can fly but they make you so different from everyone else that people look on you as a kind of freak david stared you dont look on me as that ruth of course not ruth said but it does seem somehow a little abnormal monstrous your having wings monstrous he repeated why its nothing like that its justbeautiful being able to fly see and he sprang upward with great wings whirringup and up climbing into the blue sky dipping and darting and turning up there like a swallow then cometing down in a breathless swoop to land lightly on his toes beside the girl is there anything monstrous about that he demanded joyously why ruth i want you to fly with me held in my arms so that youll know the beauty of it as i know it the girl shuddered a little i couldnt david i know its silly but when i see you in the air like that you dont seem so much a man as a bird a flying animal something unhuman david rand stared at her suddenly miserable then you wont marry me because of my wings he grasped her in his strong tanned arms his lips seeking her soft mouth
