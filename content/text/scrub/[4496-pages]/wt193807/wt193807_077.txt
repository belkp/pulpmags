 weird tales rand and an elderly nursehousekeeper there he took also a strong norwegian watchman who was very efficient at repel ling the boats of reporters who tried to land there after a while the newspapers gave it up they had to be content to reprint the photographs and articles which doctor harriman gave to scientific pub lications concerning davids growth david grew rapidly in five years he was a sturdy little youngster with yellow hair and his wings were larger and covered with short bronze feathers he ran and laughed and played like any youngster flapping his wings vigorously he was ten before he flew by then he was a little slimmer and his glittering bronze wings came to his heels when he walked or sat or slept he kept the wings closely folded on his back like a bronze sheath but when he opened them they extended much farther than his arms could on either side doctor harriman had meant to let da vid gradually try flying to photograph and observe every step of the process but it did not happen that way david flew first as naturally as a bird first flies he himself had never thought much about his wings he knew that doctor john as he called the physician had no such wings and that neither did flora the gaunt old nurse nor holf the grin ning watchman have them but he had seen no other people and so he imagined the rest of the world was divided into people who had wings and people who didnt have them he did not know just what the wings were for though he knew that he liked to flap them and exercise them when he was running and would wear no shirt over them then one april morning david found out what his wings were for he had climbed into a tall old scrub oak to peer at a birds nest the child was always inordinately interested in the birds of the little island jumping and clapping his hands as he saw them darting and circling overhead watching their flocks stream south each fall and north each spring prying into their ways of living because of some dim sense of kinship with these other winged things he had climbed nearly to the top of the old oak on this morning toward the nest he had spied his wings were tight ly folded to keep them out of the way of branches then as he reached up to pull himself the last step upward his foot pressed on the merest rotten shell of a dead branch abnormally light as he was his weight was enough to snap the branch and he fell cleanly toward the ground instincts exploded in davids brain in the moment that he plummeted toward the ground quite without will his wings unfolded with a bursting whir he felt a terrific tug on them that wrenched his shoulders hard and then suddenly mar velously he was no longer falling but was gliding downward on a long slant with his wings unfolded and rigidly set there burst from his innermost being a high ringing shout of exultation downdowngliding like a swooping bird with the clean air buffeting at his face and streaming past his wings and body a wild sweet thrill that he had never felt before a sudden crazy joy in living he shouted again and with instant im pulse flapped his great wings beating the air with them instinctively bending his head sharply back and keeping his arms flattened against his sides his legs straight and close together he wras soaring upward now the ground swiftly receding beneath him the sun blazing in his eyes the wind scream ing around him he opened his mouth
