 weird tales as a last years birds nest i was stumped stopped dead saoud entering with coffee inter rupted my thanks after having served the steaming nightblack deathly bitter beverage the negro took his post at the farther end of the salon in front of a pair of heavy curtains that i fancied must conceal an alcove in elkรกhireh it is the custom to per fume ones coffee with a tiny bit of am bergris remarked bin ayyub but i have devised a more subtle combination in response to the masters nod saoud parted the silverembroidered curtains and caught them on the hilts of the simi tars that hung at each side of the alcove a great jar fully as tall as the negro and gracefully curved as a grecian amphora glowed in the level sunset rays like a monstrous rosyamber bead he lifted the cover of the jar and from it rolled a wave of overwhelming sweetness an unearthly fragrance so curi ously blended that i could not pick the dominant odor jasmine or the rose of naishรกpรบr or all the mingled spices of cebu and saigon with undertones of sandalwood and patchouli a dizzy ing madness a surge of intoxicating warmth and richness poured resistlessly from the glowing pulsating almost transparent depths of that great urn i wondered how saoud could endure it at such close range and then drink ing fully of the potent wave that swept past me i lost all physical sensation save that of floating in a sea of torrid con fusing sweetness and then the african replaced the cover of the jar i fancied that he reeled ever so slightly as he with drew from that throbbing luminous fountain of unbelievable fragrance and wondered that he did not collapse bin ayyub had apparently forgotten my presence he sipped his coffee and with halfclosed eyes stared into the depths of the urn the unfathomable perfect peace which moslems wish each other with their essalaam aleika had descended upon him keyf the placid en joyment of wakefulness that is half sleep the silence the utter repose was con tagious i found myself gazing eyes half out of focus at the thronerug and then i sensed that eyes were staring at me from some place of con cealment i turned and caught a glimpse of a dainty armful shapely and elegantly contoured a girl with smoldering sara cenic eyes pools of dusky enchantment just for an instant i held her level un abashed gaze which lingered long enough to let me fully sense her imperious calm and composure it was just a glimpse barely enough to let me recognize the transparent olive complexion and faint ly aquiline features of a transcaucasian a gurjestani the most flawlessly lovely of all oriental women and then the por tiรจres closed on the vision what a mad afternoon the throne rug of saladin and then the descend ant of that great prince and that girl with her smoldering kohldarkened eyes the familiar spirit of the urn whose byzantine curves imprisoned that glow ing rosyamber sea of sweetness wild thought but she was small and dainty enough to have emerged from that great jar and then vanished back into its shimmering pulsating depths the contents of that jar began bin ayyub emerging from the silence would make a rich perfume of all the seas of the world it would be folly to try to imagine the countless myriads of blos soms and herbs spices and gums that are imprisoned in that essence a drop a thousandfold diluted and a drop of that dilution equally diluted would be more potent than the strongest scents known to your feringhi perfumers w t
