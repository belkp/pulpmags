 return to the sabbath by robert bloch a shuddery weird tale of hollywood and the film industrya story of the gruesome thing that emerged from the burial crypt its not the kind of story that the columnists like to print its not the yarn pressagents love to tell when i was still in the public relations depart ment at the studio they wouldnt let me break it i knew better than to try for no paper would print such a tale we publicity men must present holly wood as a gay place a world of glamor and stardust we capture only the light but underneath the light there must al ways be shadows ive always known that its been my job to gloss over those shadows for yearsbut the events of which i speak form a disturbing pattern too strange to be withheld the shadow of these incidents is not human its been the cursed weight of the whole affair that has proved my own mental undoing thats why i resigned from the studio post i guess i wanted to forget if i could and now i know that the only way to relieve my mind is to tell the story i must break the yarn come what may then perhaps i can for get karl jorlas eyes the affair dates back to one september evening almost three years ago les kin caid and i were slumming down on main street in los angeles that night les is an assistant producer up at the studio and there was some purpose in his visit he was looking for authentic types to fill minor roles in a gangster film he was doing les was peculiar that way he preferred the real article rather than the casting bureaus readymade imitations wed been wandering around for some time as i recall past the great stone chows that guard the narrow alleys of chinatown over through the touristtrap that is olvera street and back along the flophouses of lower main we walked by the cheap burlesque houses eyeing the insolent filipinos that sauntered past and jostling our way through the usual satur day night slumming parties we were both rather weary of it all thats why i suppose the dingy little theatre appealed to us lets go in and sit down for a while les suggested im tired even a main street burlesque show has seats in it and i felt ready for a nap the callipygy of the stageattraction did not appeal to me but i acceded to the suggestion and purchased our tickets we entered sat down suffered through two striptease dances an incredibly an cient blackout sketch and a grand fi nale then as is the custom in such places the stage darkened and the screen flickered into life we got ready for our doze then the pictures shown in these houses are usually ancient specimens of the quickie va riety fillers provided to clear the house as the first blaring notes of the sound track heralded the title of the opus i closed my eyes slouched lower in my seat and mentally beckoned to morpheus i was jerked back to reality by a sharp dig in the ribs les was nudging me and whispering look at this he murmured prod
