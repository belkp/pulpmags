the last pharaoh i had become whole for countless hours he amused me with his pleadings of love and then in a gay mood he would dance and sing the most ridiculous songs till i was weary with laughter oh you should have heard him she insisted and he has left none ever leaves this castle of death some spy must have overheard us and re ported it to karamour i never knew or bothered to ask one day he disappeared that was all the calmness with which she spoke the words horrified me so you must not be shocked if i use the slang of your country on the contrary i would like it i answered dryly aware of a vague fear of this weird creature the gray shades of eventide had now stolen across the sky already could be felt the first cool breeze that an nounced the quick coming of the tropical night high above us in the spiral bel fry the evening bells were tolling the lonely hour of dusk my last answer had pleased the royal beauty and she now leaned slightly to ward me her curving body glowed with the flaming warmth of africa her love ly face was temptingly close to mine the fragrance of a delicate perfume was waft ed toward me a soft sigh escaped her perfect lips and then with a thrill that burned like dancing flames her ivory fin gers ran through my hair i am going to like you came the soft whisper i am going to like you very much and you will quickly learn to care for me we will have wonderful hours togetherjust you and iwonder ful happy hours i must leave you now but carry your memory with me always karamour departs at sunrise for a three day inspection of the desert tribes taking his savage raiders with him there will be but a few slaves left at the castle only some faithful servants whose tongues are ever silentand ourselves her voice was eager expectant ââtomorrow night when the moon hangs low over the waters i will have zena bring you to the beach where i will be waiting will you come like one entranced i could but nod i will instruct the slaves to allow you complete freedom mr bryant came her clear voice as she rose you will be at liberty to come and go from the gar dens as you choose tonight karamour will send for you but have no fear i have seen to your safety at the doorway the enchantress turned suddenly in a reckless wideeyed manner remember then she whispered eagerly tomorrow night on the beach we meetalonejust you and i and when we do a snap of her fingers the roll of her eyes accompanied the next two sharply accented words oh baby the justice of karamour early that evening i had taken my solitary watch upon the tiny balcony that gave a view of the lighted yacht in the harbor below the one forlorn hope of freedom depended on my vigilance but long before the appointed time set by the russian as his hour of departure the hideous usanti had come to escort me once more to the throneroom in the great reception hall lolled some fifty arab henchmen of the pharaoh grim and silent in the shadows of the pillars but these richly robed men were all chieftains plainly some important meeting could be expected their dark eyes watched my every move with an ominous silence the princess atma had told me that i might expect a summons to the throne
