the ocean ogre seemed to come up in my throat the small room careened drunkenly i final ly became conscious of two dark objects struggling on the floor i heard a gulp ing and a low moaning and then the still night was rent with peters forced screams of horror oh lord where are the rest he shrieked and shrieked and between the screams he vomited a torrent of jumbled words greeneyes ugh ooze mouth wet his last throttled shriek lashed at me like a whip i finally managed another match and lit it i kept my eyes averted and carried the match quickly to the candlewick i knew that if i looked at the thing on the floor i would drop the match i waited until the sickly glow flared and theni looked something was on top of peter it covered him and seemed about to absorb him in its evil distorted features i recognized a carica ture of gervais but the evil in the man had sprouted it had turned him into a jellyish fishy monstrosity his middle was festooned with soft flesh his legs and arms actually gave but worst of all the body of the creature was covered with greenish scales and it had pulsating pink suckers on its chest these were lustily at work on peter i thought of the revolver on my bunk found it and gripped the butt and lev eled it i aimed it at peter and the thing on the floor i fired at the two of them for i honestly had no intention of sparing peter i knew that peter would not want it and the mute appeal in his eyes was unmistakable again objects refused to retain their identity in my sight i cracked mentally i have a vague recollection of bringing two bodies on deck i remember one was light brittle and hollow like an empty matchbox the other wet and strangely heavy silvered its path with slime as i laboriously dragged it up the companion way in the dim halfglow of the ships watchlights i bent over the bodies peter was done for there was no doubt about it my merciful shot at short range had found its mark and one temple was singed with powder i stooped and lifted him tenderly then with a sob i lowered him gently into the ocean i stood for a moment looking over the side thinking of the finality of it all and watching the ever widening ripples on the surface of the oily water finally i turned to regard what was gervais with a mingling of loathing and interest i unhooked a lantern and set it near his head the sickly glow jumped and played on the cruel twisted features to my surprize i perceived a slit deep in the folds of his neck very much like the breathingorgans of a fish the gill was rigid and distended now revealing a dark inner lining of red the body exuded an oily scum malodorous even in the clean salt air i hunched closer over the body and to my amazement a look of ineffable happiness and gratitude had suffused gervais face was it the weird light the softening touch of death or final libera tion no one will ever know but i do not think it requires an answer i am ready to be finished with the entire mat ter just as gervais is finished i later went down into gervais cabin and breathed deeply of the fresh clean air that blew through it june we are saved there is a breeze this morning the heavy canvas is bellying and all hands are busy forward the gray sky above us is sagging like a wet blanket filled with spring rains our casks are on deck waiting for the down pour i thank god that we are safely headed toward france
