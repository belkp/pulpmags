jailbreak from the next tower came a voice whats the matter pete i thought i saw something move on the wall said the near guard looked like a guy climbing but i dont see it now guess it was the fogor else im nuts for minutes littell hung there then nearing exhaustion warned him that he must move again he wasnt made for this kind of thing he wasnt trained for it his body was soft with fat living on the income from elizabeth moores for tune which he had handled till she was twentyone he drew himself slowly up to the top of the wall lay there till he saw the near guard look in the opposite direction and then rolled across there he hung by his hands and dropped an even longer drop than the one from his cell window but he was free free he could have shouted and sung but he did neither he ran he ran till his lungs were bursting through the outly ing street of the small town in which the penitentiary was located he had to get clothes now and get away from here before the cell block guard sauntered by on his next round and saw an empty cell a woman was coming toward him along the deserted sidewalk littell abruptly slowed his pace he hadnt seen her before she must have turned sud denly out of one of the houses lining the street the walk had seemed empty then there she was he started to race across the street then remembered the fantastic thing that protected him he stepped to a big tree beside the walk and leaned against the rough bark he would simply stand there blending with the tree till she had passed she came closer walking slowly but evenly in spite of his knowledge of the way he was shielded littell shrank back against the tree bole she came up to where he stood and stopped there she half turned on the walk till she was facing him and she looked squarely at him looked squarely at him and saw him after ten terrible seconds littell knew that there was no mistaking the com prehension of her level gaze and then he saw who the woman was and all else was lost in that tremendous realization scream after scream strug gled to his lips and burst soundlessly there unable to tear free murderer said the woman and her face was the face of mur dered elizabeth moore tt beats me said the warden stand ing with the cell block guard and the prison doctor in littells cell he had the bar all sawed and ready for an attempted escape and then he commits suicide by swallowing that stuff what did you say it was strychnin mainly said the doctor i suppose he got it from the prison hospital all ready to try to crush out and he takes strychnin repeated the warden maybe he took one look at the way the yard was lighted realized he hadnt the guts to try a break for the wall and downed the poison in a fit of despair maybe shrugged the doctor but what id like to know is why he took all his clothes off before doing it what on earth did he have in his mind when he did that the warden grunted and looked at the flaccid body on the lower bunk in death as in life littell was the opposite of at tractive stirsimple i guess anyway who cares
