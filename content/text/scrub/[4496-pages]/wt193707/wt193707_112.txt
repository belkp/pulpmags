the creeper in the crypt him up regetti indicated a fruitcellar adjacent to the stairs the pole still grumbling dragged me across the floor and into the room he lit a candle casting strange shadows over the cobwebbed dustdrowned shelving on the walls jars of preserves still stood un touched storing perhaps the crop of a hundred years ago broken jars were still strewn about on the tottering table as i glanced about the pole tossed me into a chair beside the rickety board and pro ceeded to lash me to it firmly with a stout rope i was not gagged or blindfolded again though the choking atmosphere about me served as a good substitute for both he left me closing the door i was alone in the candlelit quiet i strained my ears and was rewarded by hearing regetti dismiss his henchman for the night evidently to deliver the ransom note to the proper authorities he regetti would stay behind on guard dont run into any ghosts on your way he called after his companion as the big pole lumbered up the stairs a slamming outer door was his only response from the ensuing quiet i judged regetti had gone back to his soli taire meanwhile i looked about for some means of escape i found it at last on the table beside me the broken jars glass edges to cut my bonds purposefully i edged my chair closer to the table end if i could get a piece of that glass in my hands as i moved i strained my ears once more to make sure that any noise made by the chair would be inaudible to regetti waiting outside there was no sound from the chair as i reached the table and i sighed with relief as i maneuvered my pinioned hands until they grasped a piece of glass firmly then i began to rub it against the edge of the rope which bound them it was slow work minutes ticked away into hours and still no sound from out side save a muffled series of snores regetti had fallen asleep over his cards good now if i could get my wrists free and work on my feet i would be able to make it my right hand was loose at last though my wrist was damp with mingled sweat and blood cutting away from behind was not a precise calculated sort of job quickly i finished the work on my left then rubbed my swollen fingers and bent over to saw at the ropes on my legs then i heard the sound it was the grating of rusty hinges anyone who has lived in archaic houses all his life learns to recognize the pecu liar eery clang rusty hinges grating from the cellar beyond from an iron door a scuffling sound among the coal the iron door is concealed by the coal pile fellippo only stayed down here one night all they found was his leg jonathan dark babbling on his death bed the door locked from the other side tunnels to the graveyard what lurks in graveyards ancient and unseen then creeps from crypts to feast a scream rose in my throat but i choked it back regetti still snored whatever was going on in the outer room i must not wake him and lose my only chance of escape instead i had best hasten and free my legs i worked fever ishly but my ears were alert for develop ments they came the noise in the coalpile abruptly ceased and i went limp with relief perhaps rats were at work a moment later i would have given anything to have heard the coal rattling again if only to drown out the new noise there was something creeping across the cellar floor something crawling as if
