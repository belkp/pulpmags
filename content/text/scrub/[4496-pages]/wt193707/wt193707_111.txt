 weird tales i knew about the house too so thats where i was in the old chambers house on pringle street many a story ive heard from the old folks when i was a boy about the old man ezekiel cham bers whose wizard tricks bequeathed him such an unsavory reputation in colonial days i knew about jonathan dark the other owner who had been tried for smuggling just before the terrible days of and the abhorrent practise of grave robbing he had been said to pursue in the ancient cemetery directly behind the house on the hill many peculiar rumors were circulated about the moldering house with the iron door in the cellar at this timeabout the door particularly which dark was said to use as a passageway for bringing his stolen cadavers back to dispose of it was even claimed that the door had never been opened when dark was tried be cause of his astounding and hideous claim that the key which locked it was on the other side dark had died during the trial while in prison babbling blasphe mies that no man dared believe mon strous hints of what lay beneath the old graveyard on the hill of tunnels and bur rows and secret vaults used in witchdays for unhallowed rites he spoke of ten ants in these vaults too and of what sometimes would come to visit the house from below when a wizard invoked it with the proper spells and sacrifice there was more toobut then dark was quite mad at least everyone thought it better to believe so old tales die the house had stood deserted for many years until most men forgot the reason for which it had been forsaken ascribing its vacancy only to age the public today were utterly un aware of the legends only the old ones rememberedthe old ones who whis pered their stories to me when i was a boy so this was the dark house to which i had been brought and this was the very cellar of the tales in question i gathered from the remarks between regetti and the superstitious pole that another gang had recently used it for a hideaway until the death of their leader indeed i even vaguely remembered some newspaper reports of tony fellippos mysterious murder and now regetti had come from new york to use it as a base clever scheme of his evidentlycom ing to an old new england town and kidnapping the local gentry to hold for ransom then hiding them away in some old deserted house so conveniently pro tected by superstition i supposed that there would be more victims after me too the man was smart and cunning enough to get away with it these thoughts flashed through my mind during the argument between the pole and his leader but their altercation came to an abrupt halt i wish you get out of here the pole was saying if you stay only one night dot ting he come dots all tony fel lippo stay shut up you fool didnt we stay here last night too before the job and nothing happened yeah sure i know but we stay up stairs not by cellar why not keep feller upstairs because we cant afford to risk being seen regetti snapped wearily now cut the chatter he turned to me listen you im sending this guy out with a ransom letter right now to your friends back at the party all you have to do is keep your mouth shut and sit tight but any funny business means youre through see i kept silent take him in there polack and tie
