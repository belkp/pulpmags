 the strange case of nathaniel broome two faces pale and drawn reflected in the mirror her countenance beautiful as a ma donnas was aglow from the flickering mellow light of the grate fire i stared at her half mad with her loveliness you have never been so beautiful i began the scent from her hair and the nearness of her adorable self the smoothness of her bare shoulders made the blood leap intoxicatingly in my veins i wanted to kneel to her i yearned with all my soul to worship to abase my body at her exquisite feet you are wonderfully beautiful waitwait keep looking into the mirror she whispered is thereis there any change she asked fearfully no i replied and she gave a deep sigh of relief then slowly her image in the mirror began to grow misty and indistinct its a trick i cried and my voice seemed high and strained its a trick you are playing a joke upon me then it is true i heard her say in a hard cold voice whatin gods name look look and you shall see the blurred image in the looking glass started to clear but instead of the face of my wife there began to take shape an image so hideous so ghoulish that i can only compare it to the disintegration ofof a human corpse ix at this point in the extraordinary narrative i stopped reading for hap pening to glance up from the manu script i saw such horror in my listen ers eyes that i had not the courage to continue it is too harrowing i said i must not go on read read my friend replied miss broome shielding her eyes with her hands i wondered at the remarkable nervous force displayed by one so young then first allow me to get you a drink of water i replied she thanked me with a gracious incli nation of her head as i returned with the glass as she accepted it from my hand her cool fingers touched me some thing leaped in my turgid veins at the contact and i resumed the reading of the story x there was something however which i was able to notice even during the panic of fear that possessed me i saw that the mysterious transmission of flesh had not changed the eyes i seized my wife by the shoulders and turned her sharply about her face was as i had always seen it radiantly hauntingly beautiful the only change was in her eyes staring search ingly into them i tried with all my mind to read what i saw there and the look that was in them was pain we were both of us horribly fright ened after our extraordinary experi ence and sat up discussing it all night long while little marguerite all unsus pecting lay sleeping peacefully upstairs the gruesome illusion hung over our spirits for days neither one of us dared to leave the other for a moment alone the shadows were peopled with ghosts and dark places became hideous with the hidden menace i had all the mirrors in the house re moved and when we went out into the streets i hurried my wife past shop windows with averted eyes afraid to see in some chance lookingglass the spec tre that had become the terror of our lives i awoke each morning afraid to look into her eyes i went to sleep beside her
