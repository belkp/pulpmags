daughter of the pigeon me ill attend to habuhamos men i saw her smilea fixed lifeless ex pression my heart went cold within me as we swung down from the dripping rocks of the cavern as the deluge showered her slim body i caught a glimpse of her face paler than the whitest moons that plunge was a horror to me bruised and breathless my vision flecked with fire i sank down into a reeling watery world my feet touched bottom before i was able to begin the fight upward and when at last i gained the surface i dashed the spray from my eyes tahaiupehii was a yard or more ahead of me arms agleam in the moon light they were there the three islan ders sleek and sinister slipping down from the bank of granite basin there was a fourth too a fat sprawling form high on the rocks habuhamo again i wished i had killed him in the bamboo hut the islanders were between tahai upehii and me and habuhamo was running along the shore parallel to the girl straight after the marquesans i swam until i was abreast of the rear one he was a wiry fellow smaller than i with an ugly blade gripped in his teeth i struck him between the eyes and literally tore the knife from his mouth as he sank i saw some thing black upon his lips after that objects swam in a blurr blended water and rocks and over all the tranquil moon instead of launch ing an offensive against the other two natives i succeeded in gaining a lead on them and side by side tahaiupehii and i were borne with the churning riv er occasionally i glanced behind at the pursuing islanders and that obese effigy on the bank with the deadliness of sharks the marquesans followeddown with the boom and thunder of the stream into the mouth of the sea here the con flicting currents caught us in their tur bulence and lashed us toward the giant rocks that fringed the shore a new peril loomed in the shape of the crags where the surf gave vent to its wrath and we swam with all the strength we could assemble against the menace tahaiupehii was the first to reach the shore i saw blood on her shoulder where the sea had flung her cruelly upon a jutting stone in her at tempt to crawl from the surf i was not far behind her and as i staggered out of the thrashing water the bulky figure of habuhamo ap peared from behind the rocks of the river bank trapped i threw the girl a look of futility it was the finish unless the cave i shouted pressing the knife into her hand and pointing to a nearby cavity in the rugged cliffs de fend yourself until i come i caught the gleam of her pallid face as she obeyed habuhamo must come first i told myselfbut fate decided otherwise upon glancing back i perceived that one of the marquesans had reached the shore and was clambering upon the rocks with a slim blade in his hand i looked about for some means of defense and my eyes dropped to the broken bits of boulders that lay at my feet i bent and gripped one lifted it above my head and let it fly it struck him on the forehead with an ugly soundlike a crushed cocoanut shell throwing a glance toward the cave i saw tahaiupehii entering habuhamo at her heels as i started to follow a lean something from behind closed about my anklethe hand of the last marquesan a terriblelooking fellow naked and tattooed to a kings delight
