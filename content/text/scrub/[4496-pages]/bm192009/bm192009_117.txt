 the yellow dog man hankinson made round the coun ter to the door in his opinion the man who has done his work effectually should go away as soon as his job is done but going he took care to turn out the gas hankinson had manipulated the key the chain and the bar and was about to open the door in gingerly fashion when he heard a sound at the rear of the shop he turned muttering a curse a door had noiselessly opened and there holding a lamp above her head stood marcovitchs granddaughter she was in her nightgown her hairlong black lustrousfell far below her waist her great eyes dilated with alarm shone like stars and at her side nuzzling against her knees was the strangest ugliestlooking beast of a dog that han kinson had ever set eyes on it was queerly shaped it was of no known breed it was a vile yellow in color and it had only one eye it was borne in upon hankinson amidst the rush of thoughts which this new situa tion forced on his consciousness that he would have bad dreams about that dog and he cursed it without knowing that he was even thinking of it there were other things to think of just then hankinson realized his dan ger he made a sudden dash back at the girl the girl set up a loud scream dashed the lamp in his face drew back with the agility of a snake and locked the door behind her hankinson went too then he groped his way to the street door and let him self out as he crossed the threshold he had an unpleasant feeling of a sinu ous wiry body that cannoned against his legs and he kicked out at it in sheer frenzy of hatred but when he reached the pavement and looked round him there was no dog there and with an other oath he made off there was nobody about just at that point but there were people twenty yards away on either hand and hankin sons chief desire was to mingle with and get beyond them he turned to the right and sped swiftly away and just then the jewess darted out into the street from the side entrance and let out a yell that startled every midnight stroller within the eighth of a mile murder hankinson shot into the nearest entry it was light where he entered it it was black where he traversed it it was light again where he left it and flinging a glance over his shoulder as he turned at the end of it he saw figures dart after him also he heard a queer padding sound not so far away from his heels he knew then that hre was a serious business and he set his teeth and ran there was a network of al leys and courts and queer places there abouts hankinson dodged from one to the other as a rabbit dodges about in its warren when the ferrets are after it but wherever he went he heard the queer padding sound and he cursed that oneeyed yellow dog to the depths of a dogs hell and yet once twice thrice he looked roundat least once with his re volver in his handand never saw any dog at all not even when there were patches of light which the pursuit brute or human must cross eventually hankinson spent of breath made two or three desperate twistings and twinings and darted into a dark court the next minute something seemed to catch him by the ankle he made a violent plunge forward dashed his head against a wall saw thousands of stars flash and coruscate before his eyes and felt a great buzzing and hum ming rise up somewhere behind his ears and immediately after that hankinson for the time being felt and saw noth ing more
