daughter of the pigeon was named i could see that she wore a pareu twisted about her not two yards behind her an islander was squirming over the spraywet stone following him was another on the opposite side of the pool the other mar quesans were crouched behind boulders unaware of her danger tahaiupehii stood on the edge of the rock but even as i looked her straight body flashed through the air plunging into the foam as she vanished beneath the water one of the islanders crawled to the rim of the pool an instant later her head appeared and she must have seen him for a cry rang above the dull boom of the waterfall the marquesan slipped into the pool i experienced a moment of indecision my brain strove to function quickly the two figures were almost side by side in the current nineteen feeta straight drop and i did not know the depth yet i gripped the blade between my teeth took a deep breath after that i was conscious of shooting through space down into what seemed a depthless pit i struck the poolwent under with a force that lashed my flesh and expelled the air from my lungs in the battle against the torrent i al most lost the knife but in some manner i managed to retain it through a whirling opaque mass i came up every inch of my body stinging not more than a rod away i saw the two figures i caught the gleam of grappling armssaw a face that in the night was pale like blue moonlight as exquisitely beautiful as any i have ever seen in a moment i reached them closing about the shining dark neck with the other hand i swung the knife together we sank in that gray chaos we strug gled i slashing with the deadly blade of a sudden it was conveyed to my brain along with a strangling sensation that my hand was holding nothing that the knifethrusts had told i buoyed myself upward and attained the surfacealone i doubt if the native ever came up it must have been a rock that sent me out at any rate the pain was sharp in the back of the skull things went dim i realized that a hand gripped my hairthen i knew nothing iii the sleep that followed was not calm nor can i hardly call it sleep for dur ing the whole period i had a peculiar awareness of things of movement and a sound like unleashed thunder and with the advent of full consciousness i was not as i expected in the water al though it was damp and i could feel a cool spray upon my body i sat upright on cold stone my head aching dreadfully something close at hand was roaring and in a hazy way i realized that the noise was responsible for the spray but as my vision cleared i saw only dimness broken on one side by a glimmering sheet that was a shade lighter than the surrounding gloom gradually i comprehended i was under the waterfall in a dark recess in the rocks the shifting curtain was noth ing less than the cascading water then i was startled by a voice almost at my elbow speaking in marquesan menike you are awakeat last i knew her instantly though she was little more than a blot in the dimness tahaiupehiithat exquisite young crea ture whose face i had seen momentarily as i fought the islander i am glad you have come back menike she said creeping closer to me and slipping her small spraywet hand in mine her nearness made me con scious of a pleasant odorthat of red
