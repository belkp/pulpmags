 the heart on the mantel and if it ceases moving i will have won my situation was no longer terrify ing it became a game a battle i was fighting playing against the reddish brown streak that thrashed continuously against its background of white i was fighting its monotonous beats its zig zagging progress its splashing sounds the agitated wavelets it made a mellowtoned clock boomed faintly in the distance i counted its strokes onetwothree the heart shot to the middle of the jarfor a moment became wholly rigid then its beating slowed i stared listened yes its beats were timed ex actly with each stroke of the clock they came slowly relentlessly like a knell i kept on counting eightnineteneleventwelve at the last stroke the heart again be came rigid then it sank slowly to the bottom of the jar and lay there mo tionless i have won i told myself fiercely exultingly i have beaten it it was my nerves but i have conquered them surely a sedative could do no harm now i thought the crisis had passed i had shown my strength so i hastily bared my arm and pricked into it a double dosage of morphine languor came speedily i decided to not wait for leon so i went to bed fell into a heavy sleepand dreamed i dreamed about the heartthis red dishbrown lump on the mantel i dreamed that it had eyes that it watched me i dreamed that it had a soul a soul that was troubled and that troubled me i dreamed that it had power invisible and terrible power that charmed me cowed me molded me tortured me i must have slept solidly throughout the night i do not remember of awak ing a single time all i remember is that it was a night of hideous dreams against which i was powerless i was awakened by a clatter at the stairs by a pounding on the door by a voice crying shrilly queerly henri let me in henri let me in i sprang up into the study room and opened the door francois bourlin stumbled in his face as chalklike as the white of his eyes henrihavent you heard he be gan in a panicky tremolo heard i stammered what about leon ah it is terrible all on account of that womanfanchette leon has been arrestedhas confessed last night at twelve oclock the police found leblancs mutilated body in a sewer in the rue de loix he had been dead for at least two days frangois clutched my arm fearfully and his voice fell to a husky whisper leonleon had cut his heart out i recoiled then my eyes flashed to the jar on the mantel glistening in the fresh morning light against the white background of wall was a shriveled lump inert silent dead and i knew that it would never beat again
