 fear i had a temper he had been in my office for a year i guess he was all set for a fight right away but he smiled and went on not buy exactly but i think it can be arranged to suit us both like hell you do i yelled i was more than surprised i thought he must have gone crazy but i didnt like his smile he didnt say anything just sat there and smiled at me he didnt look like a crazy man and i began to wonder all the time he had been with me he had been perfectly sane and he had never tried to joke he was efficient and always on the job what had happened to make him start out like he had was a mystery to me what do you mean have you been drinking or dreaming i tried to keep myself in hand because at the back of my brain something had started to stir men with brains dont usually have crazy schemes and i knew he hadnt been drinking and he wasnt the sort to dream without something to base it on i began to think of reasons for him getting up the nerve to say what he did it took nerve and something else i had never let him in on anything and outsideof the deal with king there hadnt been anything that could really cause trouble and that king deal was safe i had written the only papers in the thing myself after the deal was over king and i had taken care to burn them but he had to have some reason and i was losing my temper again all the while he just sat listen brentwood i told him then i dont know what you are talking about but the only satisfactory arrange ment you can reach with me is to be ready to find another job by the first of the month you are leaving us then i am afraid you are wrong mr barnes and he reached into his pocket he brought out a leather case and from it he took something and unfolded it very carefully i couldnt make out what it was at first it was black about the size of a letter sheet then i saw it was a piece of carbon paper even then i didnt get on right away did you ever see this before and he held it up for me to see the marks of the typewriter stood out i couldnt read them but i knew what it was i remembered the morn ing of my deal with king and brent wood being down at the office early when i wrote the agreement with king i forgot all about the carbon paper i really didnt realize until then that the carbon would carry any record i must have just dumped it into the waste basket when i finished brentwood was watching me and he must have known what i was thinking what is it anyway and i tried to keep my voice what it had been before but i was beginning to get nervous i had been learning things about brent wood ever since he began the conver sation do you want me to read it to you mr barnes as he asked the question he smiled again i had stood all of that smile i was going to it must have made me lose my head i couldnt take a chance on that thing coming out with landis not yet dead a year i had to have that piece of carbon he sidestepped me as i rushed and grabbed me from behind i told you he had played football there is no need for excitement barnes he dropped the mr then you cant get this away from me with out killing me you had better listen to reason i saw i couldnt manhandle him i never have been a strong man and his grip on my wrists was like iron well say what youve got to say
