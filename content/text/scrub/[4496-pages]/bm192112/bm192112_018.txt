the prisoner speaks some of your questions are so involved that i cannot answer them i dont know what you are driv ing at that is the second time i have earned the same rebuke from you mr raggan if you do not know what i am driving itthough i think you do only too well for your own peace of mindi will make it most clear very soon meanwhile i ask you again do you recognize this letter as having been written by you and recall the circum stance with sufficient clarity to remem ber that you did not sign it i dont remember anything at all about it then why did you declare without having seen the ending that it was without signature i guessed it wasnt on what previous knowledge did you base that guess i wouldnt be such a fool as to sign that kind of a letter another step ahead you wouldnt be such a fool as to sign such a letter as this you say how do you know what kind of a letter it is i can seei can read part of it from here so we are getting on a little more and the end of our long jodrney should be in sight will you kindly re peat to the jury that portion of the letter that you can read no you refuse of course i refuse why you have not proved that i wrote that letter that is for the jury to decide not for you or me mr raggan but if you did not write it why should you refuse to read it aloudsuch portion or portions as you can decipher itthe jury would receive a wrong impression because you read it or because you wrote it because they would think i rote it why should they think you wrote it if you swear that you did not do so you do swear that you did not write it dont you no no what which fact is it that you are denying both you deny having written the letter and deny also that denial i am afraid mr raggan tnat the jury will fail to understand just what you are intending to swear to come for the sake of the jury and brevity i will go back to first principles and reword my question did you randolph raggan write this letter that i intend to offer in evidence and which i again show you i refuse to answer on what grounds insufficient identification then it is at least possible that you might have written this letterother wise you would have no hesitancy in denying its authorship anything is possible you are right mr raggan though i had thought previous to this case that there were certain things beyond human possibilitiessuch a letter as this for instance such a sequel as fol lowed the writing of this letter for an other but i will proceed to my next question why do you refuse to re peat aloud in this courtroom the part of this letter which you are able to read becausebecause it would have a tendency to incriminate and degrade me the letteror the reading of it butnever mind i will not force the issue i am more interested and i am sure the gentlemen of the jury are like wise to have you identify the hand
