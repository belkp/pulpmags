 fit for a king in the second one he says that he feels sure that if i had been on the job he would have been perfectly safe of course that is more of a com pliment like some kings like to make than anything else because this king never saw the aerie he got too busy with a war they were having over in europe and had to cancel his acceptance of jim plain fields invitation jim plainfield him self got pretty busy in that same war in the shipping end of it and i guess he and all the rest of the world would have pretty nearly forgotten all about the aerie if a newspaper man in seattle hadnt assembled a lot of facts and strung them together in a sensational story he called the house of fatal mystery which was copied all over the country that was the way i got in on it the big chiefs in washington read it and as it was in our territory we got orders to look into the matter and it surely did seem serious and mysterious enough for somebody to look into it seems that in six months no less than four men who were last seen in the neighborhood of the aerie had disappeared off the face of the earth more than that two women who couldnt tell what had happened to them or the missing men they had ac companied to the house on the cliff had been found exhausted and more than half crazy in the big woods that the placp on three sides surround it was a house of mystery all right but as fine a structure as you ever saw plainfield had given orders that it was to be fit for a king and it was in more ways than one it was a sort of glorified logcabin something like what i understand they call chalets or hunting lodges in europe but i dont believe there is one in europe like this house on the cliff jim plainfield as i said had been a common sailor but he had a soul far above tar and ropes and can vas he had roamed the far seas and seen a lot he had studied a lot and when the riches came he kept on traveling and seeing and reading he loved the sea and his big yacht the fir was a common sight on every ocean it was in this way he met the king i never knew the exact details but i believe he saved the kings life or something like that during a yacht club regatta at any rate their friend ship became common knowledge and when the king planned a visit to america it was common gossip that he would be plainfields guest when he reached the coast plainfield was always a very busy man and depended for details a great deal upon subordinates who had been with him for years in most cases so even in so important a matter as the building of this house for a king he only went as far as drawing the plans and giving directions for the furnish ings the actual superintendence of the thing we learned had been left to a man named harry stanwood who had been steward of the big yacht valet to plainfield and generally his man of affairs in minor business and quite largely in social matters so while the boss planned the house it was really stanwood who built it and had it all ready with every convenience to receive a king and it was some job too out in that wilder ness materials had to be hauled for miles and labor was very scarce stanwood who was something of a mechanic had to do a good deal of the work himself but he had plenty of time so it did not make a great deal of difference he was a most interesting sort of character we found out all about
