 ananias ltd since cryder had appeared at home in his wild west outfit and mysteri ously whispered about gold at first his friends had merely laughed among themselves at what they called herbs latest but finally cryder had begun to scatter a few nuggets around as souvenir gifts in the form of scarf pins cuff links and one thing and another and he even tried to pay for a round of drinks out of a poke of gold dust raised quite a row it seems because they didnt have gold scales at the cashiers desk to weigh it like they do in a new mining camp pretty soon his friends were de manding to buy shares in the mine cryder had laughed at them just like he laughed at me but they kept at him and persuaded himas they thoughtto form a company and is sue stock he sold it cheap enough ten dollars for a sharebut ap parently he had sold quite a lot nobody knew then just how much he had pretended that he wanted to keep it a close corporationso that he could have full control him self he saidand wouldnt sell to anyone except close friends and rela tives old ezekiel bought quite a block and even jedidiah bought some he had an honest young lawyer as general counsel and almost at the start declared a dividend of ten per cent the stock certificates were beauti fully engraved and the prospectus was a work of art i read it through three times before i discovered that it was all generalities and that no where in it was the mine definitely located it was some place that the book described as the el dorado of the munificent west and thats no place to buy a railroad ticket to it was after the dividend that he hired garrity and the ten extra stenographers and opened the ma hogany offices several of his friends got pinched in the market about that time and sold their stock to stran gers these began calling for infor mation and reports and things and young cryder did not laugh as much as he used to folks said something was really worrying him in another week jedidiah quinot among others became suspicious and he would have carried the tale to old ezekiel had not the physicians forbidden him to see the sick man as a result of this he had appealed to the department and i was put on the case of course i could have gone straight to cryder showed my cre dentials and demanded his books the location of the mine and all the rest of the information i wanted but cryder was supposedly a citizen of some importance in that community no common crookand besides that there kept buzzing in the back of my mind a lingering suspicion of jedidiah quinot the chief complain ant in the case while he seemed to be all broken up over the matter nevertheless i had found out that in case old ezekiel cryder disinherited his nephew his fortune would go to quinots son so instead of declaring myself to herbert cryder i called on his gen eral manager mr richard garrity dick was not exactly pleased to see me when i ran across him in the lobby of his hotel but he was quite willing to renew our acquaintance and talk at length garrity had been wonder ing for some time why i did not send him to the penitentiary and seemed to think it was because i had use for him outside the fact was i did not have the evidence but he thought i had and i was willing to let him hold that belief it certainly helped in this case wheres the mine echoed gar
