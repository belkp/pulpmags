 the prisoner speaks is possible even probable that i now would be undergoing trial for his mur der instead of for the murder of the woman he so vilely wronged in thought and act it has been alleged that the fishing trip which i took was a subterfuge a blind in one sense it was i had brooded over the letters received by my wife from this man until my temper was getting beyond my control i went away ostensibly to fish but really to wrestle with myselfto have a quiet place in which to take stock of myself and the situation to decide upon what i should do consider gentlemen the conflicting emotions that you would have felt had you been in my place it is a serious matter to deliberately ponder the killing of a man sometimes as in this in stance not because of the man nor because of yourself or the penalty you may suffer but because of the effect on innocent others i will not inflict upon you the wearisome rounds of the con flict i fought with myself the countless pros and cons of the silent argument there in the woods by the river a soul in torment is not a sight for the eyes of others enough that i won the battle that i started back home deter mined to find some other means short of killing to put an end to the persecu tions of randolph raggan i knew and know that my wife was a good woman pureminded almost to the point of innocence more faithful to me and my interests than i could be myself she bitterly resented the ap proaches of this man his attempts to supplant me in her affections but even i was not able to appreciate the full worth and strength of harriet smiths nobility and purityqualities which gentlemen cost her her life a price which i am sure she paid willingly rather the one with which she could have bought her safety i might dwell upon this theme for hours contrasting the whiteness of the woman with the blackness of the man but i must hasten to my conclusion trusting to your own sentiments for that understanding which any words of mine would fail to convey i imagine gentlemen of the jury that knowing i was to be out of town for several daysand i have reason for my belief that he did know itthis man went to my house with the hope and intention of accomplishing one of of two thingsor both the final ac complishment of his evil desires and orthe recovery of the letters which he had written to my wife and which he knew she had kept in the latter purpose he succeeded partially but not entirely not en tirely because by some intervention of providential justice he overlooked or was prevented by some means from se curing this one and the most important of all those letters i say the most important i had read the others be fore i left home they contained no threats this one undoubtedly was de livered the evening of the eleventh and that delivery closely followed by the writer in person no one now alive except the man himself can know all the circumstances that preceded and took place during that clandestine call but that he murdered my wife arranged the evidence that he planned would convict me of his own crime and has done everything in his power since then to sacrifice my life on the same satanic altar upon which he slew herof this i am as sure as if i had been his shadow this then gentlemen of the jury is the letter in which randolph raggan has written his own indictment in ad vance of his final crime most beautiful of womenit be gins and that is the only worthy state ment in iti have learned that s is
