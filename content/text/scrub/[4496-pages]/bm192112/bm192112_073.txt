 fear private secretary landis never could see the need of one i even had trouble persuading him to hire enough stenog raphers he wasnt tighthe just couldnt see the need of them but i insisted on the secretary idea i needed one it wasnt a question of style so brentwood came in with me from the main office you know what he looked like re cently then he was only about and he was handsome he had played foot ball at collegefenced to i believe he showed the results of both in his size and manner he was one of those men who look like statues or models for clothes advertisements i believe that was one reason i took him i didnt go to college myself didnt have time had to make money brentwood was always welldressed he wasnt making much but i believe he had a small income from some money an aunt had left him besides that i hadnt heard then of any vices he had of course he took a drink now and then and he smoked but no one ever called him a spendthrift he had a social posi tion i didntand he went places then i couldnt get in i never wanted to dont get the idea i was jealous about that i got everything in the world i wanted even if i did have to pay for them i wanted money because money was power and power was my dream i have both at least i had them until last night whatever had made me bring brent wood into my office as private secretary he justified my choice before he had been with me a week he started right in taking minor details off my hands i had more time for getting some of my big plans straightened out but the size of my plans didnt help me any landis was a fool if we made six per cent he was satisfied if we made eight he thought we were beginning to speculate and if we made ten which happened as often as he let me have my way he thought it was il legal i wonder what the old man would say if he had lived until now i wasnt going to be tied down to a rock like that and by the time brent wood had been with me a year i had too much time on my hands to stand it any longer then i hit on the scheme i would have preferred to do it with landis he had been good to me but what i had in mind i couldnt even talk to him about he would have fixed it so i couldnt get in with anyone else i needed his money and other things he had they made the thing possible so i went after someone else even though landis wouldnt listen other firms had been getting a line on me whenever the firm put over any thing big they all i knew i did it you remember old tom king crooked as a snake but he knew how to make money i had met him at lunch once or twice but he had kept track of me i knew from things he said he never ate anything but crackers and milk he saw me order the same one day so he took more interest in me i thought he would when i decided it was time to put over my scheme i picked out king for the second man it took two of us i knew he would be the best i could find and he would be willing to do it too but i had to tie him up some way i had made up my mind that i would doublecross landis if i had to but i was going to protect myself i went to kings house one night and told him my plan not all of it just enough for him to see that it would work if properly handled he wanted to know everything but i wouldnt tell him unless he consented to sign an agreement to put the thing through that agreement was a risky thing be cause what we were going to do would
