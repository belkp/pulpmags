 fear marked that you must be trying to check me up because you had been down to the office the night before using the typewriter you see i had a pretty clear trail the cigar i smoked that night was the last comfortable one i have had un til this there hasnt been a moment until last night that i havent thought about that piece of carbon paper and dont think brentwood let me forget about it either he didnt mention it for a year then he came in and remarked that he thought he was growing more valuable as a member of the firm i wasnt quite cowed then and i let myself go for a minute but he brought me up sharp oh he had me all right i agreed the next time came about two years later he asked me up to his apartment to dinner that night i went and he asked for another five per cent there wasnt any argument at all dont think that brentwood wasnt making good he had a genius for finance he never had a scheme that failed of course we didnt make mil lions out of everything he brought up but we never lost and he worked hard my dinner engagements with him came about every two years which brought us up to six months ago i never had anything to do with him out side of the office except at dinners at my house formal dinners when he was just one of the guests each time i went to his place he had a five per cent larger interest in the firm the last time left him with a full half i had begun to take it for granted i knew that every two years i would have to eat all alone with him and listen to his rotten talk about women he was a cad and he knew i hated his stories thats the reason he told them then after dinner he would make his same smiling demand and there was nothing for me to do did i tell you that i hadnt had a peaceful moment since he showed me that paper i couldnt tell my wife about it she is a wonderful woman she doesnt even suspect that i was mixed up in the landis affair you are the first human being i have been able to tell this thing to after fif teen years of living it fifteen years is a long time i dont want your sym pathy its all over now and i want to get it off my mind but that doesnt make any difference about my shooting brentwood as i said he called on me last about six months ago i thought then that i would have two more years of almost peace when something else came up you may have seen a picture of my daughter lucia it was published last winter when she made her debut she is her mother all over again and i am just daddy to her she has always been my pal since she was a little girl and she is now too anyway she made her debut last winter and brentwood started coming to the house more frequently i would come home in the afternoon and find him at tea my wife asked him to din ner two or three times just with the family she had never seen him ask for a larger share of the firm it kept up so that i began to have a big fear bigger than my fear of brent wood and his carbon paper suppose my girl should fall in love with him a couple of nights ago by some chance she was staying at home she came into the library where i was try ing to read and i decided to try to find out how much she liked brentwood she came over and sat on the arm of my chair and pulled my hair where is brentwood tonight i started to question her pining away in some dark den prob ably i refused to let him come up i told him it was daddys night
