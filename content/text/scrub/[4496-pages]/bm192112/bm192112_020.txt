the prisoner speaks cretion to such an extent that she carried the letter home with her and read it and then was too frightened at first to bring it to the attention of the authorities as she should have done as from my standpoint it is very fortu nate that she did not do viewing her action from the strictly technical point of the law there can be of course no excuse for this suppres sion of vitally important evidence on the part of mrs garford but for the ultimate ends of justice she could not have done better she should not have taken the letter in the first place hav ing taken and read it she should have as a matter of duty and right turned it over to the prosecuting attorney but again i repeat that her technical error in act and judgment was pos sibly the result of that divine guidance upon which the just administration of the law so often must depend god moves in a mysterious way his wonders to perform when i was arrested and indicted for the murder of my wifethe wife whom i loved and love more than i do my hopes for present or future salva tionmrs garford was moved by her conscience she told me to go to the rector of her church and to him confess what she both had done and refrained from doing again i will state that if necessary i will have both mrs garford and the reverend mr sweyd come upon this stand and repeat under oath in their own words the facts that i now am stating as these two persons told them to me moved by his advice mrs garford consented to visit me in the county jail in company with the rector there mrs garford told me her story and rightly or wrongly gave me this letter which i have retained in my possession ever since mrs garford recognized the handwriting knew the author as did the reverend mr sweyd because they were intimately acquainted with both the man who wrote this letter wasisone of the vestrymen of st lukes church and in that capacity had written many times to each of them without failing those times to sign his letters i now will read this letter which though without signature as correctly stated by mr raggan is directed on this envelope which contained it to mrs harriet smith there is no other address given simply the name mrs harriet smith the woman who was so brutally murdered my wife it is probable though that can be only pure supposition that it was de livered by hand either that of the one who wrote it or a messenger of his i have not been able to discover who car ried it on its fateful mission that it was written sent and received is enough enough to prevent the guilty man from escaping the consequences of this and his subsequent acts a grave lapse from his habitual caution one of those errors which even the keenest minds maketo their undoing i also will state under oath your honor and gentlemen of the jury that i have positive knowledge of the fact that this letter while the last was by no means the first written to my wife by the same man it was in fact only one of many that i saw with my own eyes in the possession of my wife great stress has been laid in this trial upon what has been called my ungovernable temper and my threats to do great bodily harm to kill men who i conceived to be paying unwel come attentions to my wife in so far as that refers to one man it is true i did threaten to kill him if he continued his insulting persecution that man was randolph raggan had i seen this last letter before i left town on the night of the eleventh of november it b mdec
