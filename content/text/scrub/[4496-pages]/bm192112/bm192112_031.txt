 ananias ltd lumbia but he did not know that then i found myself facing again that strange loyalty and sentimental ity in this rough mineworkman that i had found in dick garrity soft palmed swindler could cryders swindle be as far reaching as this i wondered could he possibly have enlisted and coached this man in three days and then bra zenly left him here alone i knew that cryder had never been in the district before i knew that mcguire the foreman was a native of hope i knew that all cryder had done in the camp was to take a few snap shots after the men he had brought in had started digging and put up a sign he had had painted in hope the sign was noncommittal it was merely a white board with black let tering planted against the face of a huge cliff hectopus mine was all it said two days later i was again walk ing the brink of the fraser river canyon i was waiting for cryder reported somewhere in the neighbor hoodand for a train a hundred feet below me the same river boiled and swirled it might have been the same water i had first seen turning a corner and returning so eternal was the tumult it seemed as though the fraser were composed of liquid hills and valleys so firmly did the cur rents force the water into fantastic moulds turning a bend in the stream in a longer cast for views i finally came upon a spectacle that was strangely familiar far down below me was a tiny platform made of driftwood on driftwood piles and upon it perched an indian with a long spear his lance darted once into the tumbling water and was withdrawn with a huge fish squirming on its point a salmon i knew and with the knowl edge came recollection this was a picture almost the same as the paint ing over cryders desk i had wronged the man from the start not suckers but game fish that was his ideal even as i looked another figure clambered to the little platform cryder himself i could see the in dian shake his head and motion him back with his hand but cryder climbed on and strode out upon the platform it showed he was new to the country the little perch was safe enough for the indian but under the second mans two hun dred pounds it buckled swayed col lapsed and both were thrown into the torrent fifty yards above me i have said that i knew at the start that cryder was no ordinary crook i have told about the strange senti mentality of garrity and mcguire i have said nothing about my own feel ings i doubt if i had analyzed them myself but i held my breath as i saw him fall and almost before i knew it had peeled my coat and plunged into the fraser after him i am a rather strong swimmer or i would not be alive to tell this today the indian helped me a little at first but cryder had got a bump on the head and was a drag on both of us next minute the indian was crashed against a rock and only managed to struggle ashore i finally landed cryder a mile down the canyon where the current rather than i washed us on a sandbar where a chinaman was stolidly panning out gold from some place the chink pro duced a bottle of alcohol or gin i dont know which and finally cryder opened his eyes he did not remem ber ever having seen me before and was a little woozy i suppose
