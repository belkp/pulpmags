after midnight why rake all that up snapped dwyer impatiently all that detail came out at the trial because you are going to know the truth because i am going to prove my statements i dont know if andrew willoughby is insane or not but i do know that in the interest of science he will stop at nothing not even murder please he continued raising a silencing hand as they would have interrupted him he was making some tests of a new very strange and interesting eastern poi sonit left no trace of any kind a touch of it on a mucous membrane would produce instant death this was not enough for dr willoughby he was searching for a poison whose mere contact would be deadly at last he hit upon one a harmless enough liquid until combined with metal and moisture lannen gave an exclamation of surprise willoughby had seated himself and now sat staring at the speaker with beaded fascinated eyes he wet his lips with the tip of his tongue but otherwise made no move ment the trouble with this poison continued moore was that the vic tim died in convulsionsthe death being of several moments duration consequently willoughby was still dissatisfied i dont know what his desire was in making of poisoning a fine art i dont think that at that time murder was his object he sacrificed numerous animals in his experiments even louises pet airedale and a per sian cat belonging to the house keeper were destroyed the brutal ity of their death the horrible agony they suffered was getting on my nerves i wanted to get away he did not let john gordon into the se cret of these poisons so gordon was in total ignorance of willoughbys ambition i began to fear my brotherinlaw there was an insane glitter in his eyes when at work it dawned upon me that he would not endure any ob stacle being placed in his way and that because of my knowledge of his tests he hated me although he needed me then john gordon was found dead his attitude the tor tured expression on his face proved conclusively he had been poisoned though if willoughby had not so painstakingly explained the nature of that poison no one would have de tected it in his system whether my brotherinlaw deliberately killed him as a testor it was an accident i am not prepared to statebut i had nothing to do with it the metal cup which contained the coffee which gordon drank i never saw before so help me god willoughby swore in court to my carelessnesthat i had deliberately left that cup which had been used on a tea tableand young gordon had poured coffee in to it and drank it it was a lie dr willoughby himself did it i had nothing to support my statement then i was working for a reputable famous scientist what was my word against his with every proof in the world against me but i made up my mind that the instant those prison doors closed behind me and i was again a free man i would not only prove my innocencebut an drew willoughbys guilt and i have done so he paused abruptly i escaped the papers gave the details i took a chance in coming herebut as louises gardener i was safe from you if willoughby did not recognize me for a long time he never noticed me one servant was the same as another to him his wife
