the valley where dead men live to the death between the two groups both seemed to exhaust their ammuni tion at the same time by what ap peared to be mutual consent they left their guns and charged at each other meeting in the middle of that once peaceful little dell there were not over twenty men on either side grappling they fought hand to hand using knives clubs stones their revolvers their bare hands they were like cavedwellers giving no quarter and asking none at the end there was no one left on either side only a heap of dead and dying when it was all over the dead arose and again went through the monoto nous performance iv i was hypnotized held by a spell i could not break try as i would i seemed unable to drag myself away from the ghastly sights i dont know how long i remained in the valley of horrors you say it was four days look at my hairsnow white when i left sourdoughs cabin my locks were dark i am just past thirty years of age yet from my appearance one would swear that i had passed the three score years and ten allotted to man i have not slept for the hellish panorama continued on and on and on only at night a different group of actors filled the stage the darkness was hideous with the roar of the big guns the screech of shells signal rockets filled the air as if by magic trenches appeared here and therelit tle sectors each with its own melan choly drama of life and death here was a stretch of no mans land with its grisly tenants men hung on barbed wire entanglements their clothes in tat ters swaying to and fro in the breeze like scarecrows in a farmers field often i lost consciousnessfainted i suppose much of the time i wan dered about in a daze i knew not which way to turn dead menliving dead meneverywhere i dragged myself into a tiny house that seemed to stand in the center of the valley it was empty i threw myself on the floor thinking to gain a minutes respite from the horrors around me i dropped into a deep sleep i was awakened by the sound of voices i crouched farther back in the darkness of the corner frightened not daring to make a move what was i afraid of i do not know one need not fear spectres need he there was a sound of a match being scratched and then a candle flared up by its uncertain light i made out the figures of two men wearing the german uni form they groped about until they found a trap door cut in the floor raising it they lowered themselves through the opening seized by some impulse which even now i am unable to explain i de termined to follow them the events that transpired are inexplicable to me the only solution that i have for the puzzle is that for the time being i was someone elsesome poor devil who lost his life in the attempt to avert a german surprise on verdun for i swear that i was propelled by some force stronger than my own will cautiously i waited until i heard their voices trailing off in the distance then i sprang to the trap and a sec ond later dropped through into the darkness of the cellar i stumbled about until i found the wall following it with my hands i came to an opening far ahead in the darkness i saw a tiny speck of light bobbing up and down it was the candle carried by the men i was follow ing without thought of the future i followed in their wake
