the man who was seven the gray pellet carefully on the desk be side him then more with the idea of getting daniels away from that vault where he might happen to see what i had seen than with any idea of finding anything more i asked to be shown the other vaults i went through them all but discovered nothing until we came to the one used for the safedeposit de partment next to and directly east of the one from which the money had been taken in the floor of this vault and as far as i could judge without making measurements in direct line with the other loose plate was a section in ex actly the same conditionthe same thin crack all around it filled with this carranaugh touched the gray pellet and replaced it in his wallet and isnt that enough there have been at least twenty trained men sup posedly experts who have gone over that vault with finetoothed combs in the past week and not one of them discovered a smidgeon of evidence to show how the vault or the buildingwas entered and here i its mighty fine work jim i didnt mean that it wasnt i simply was anxious to know what came next if you mean what did i do nexti told snedeker i thought i would have something interesting to report within fortyeight hours he sniffed and mumbled something about they all say that but i didnt mind his being scep tical cant blame him for sniffing at the end of a week of nothing but prom ises without performances then i came here and put in the time while waiting for you in figuring out a work ing theory have you got one sort of one remember im not sure those plates are loose i only think so but im basing as much of a theory as i have on their being so then they must have tunneled un der the building after allis that it it looks that way something like that but what im bothered about is the loose plate if it is loose in the safe deposit vault instead of making the proposition simpler it complicates it what on earth did they want to mon key round that vault forprobably not enough valuables in the boxes to pay high class crooks for the taking men who were figuring on more than a mil lion can you dope that out i cant yet maybe they made a mistake opened up the wrong vault first and then went on to the right one maybe thats possible but not probable expert cracksmen who could locate the center of the vaults at all wouldnt make a mistake of over twenty feet in their point of attack no that isnt the explanation im sure it isnt theres some other twist in the tangle a better reason than that then maybe hold on a minute tom an al most human idea is trying to bore its way into my brain and im afraid to frighten it away by talking sit still and pray peiperson smoked his pipe and was silent as directed while carranaugh almost visibly labored in his effort to concentrate on the glimmer of thought that suddenly had occurred to him finally slowly his eyes brightened his huge body seemed to bulk even more hugely he breathed like a diver com ing to the surface as he whispered bythesevengods who rule the seas i believe ive got it i believe i believe i know where that million is lying this blessed minute and how it got there i believe i could lay my hands on it in less than ten minutes walk from where were sitting i be lievei believehis voice trailed
