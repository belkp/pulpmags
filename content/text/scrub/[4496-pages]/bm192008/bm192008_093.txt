 the strange story of martin colby ii i was suffering from brain fag the novel on which i was at workmy latest by the waythreatened to be a dismal failure as a result for weeks i had not touched the type writer lacking ideas to put on paper my publishers were clamoring for the manuscript the book had been announced through the press and the advance royalties were already banked to my credit i owed it to them as well as myself to bring my work to a close but i was dissatisfied the plot itself wasâťthe best thing that i had ever done but the story lacked that indescribable something that marks the really finished product from the machinemade drivel it sounded forced and strained in other words it had no punch and my heroine heavens what a woman she had as much life as a wilted rag doll anyone who is familiar with my work knows that i write of the wilds the prairies the forests the icy bar rens but this story was to be a de parture it was to be a tale of human emotionsa drama seething with passion and depicting the under side of life among the dwellers of the great city but my heroine was to be a woman of the northland trans planted from her native snows and ice hedged in on all sides by wicked ness yet keeping herself clean and pure in spite of her surroundings i wanted to make her a girl of un usual strength of character one who dominated every page of the book and held the readers undivided love rather than the insipid whitelivered anaemic who wandered through the story like an automaton but in spite of everything i was unable to concentrate on herto inject any life into her every writer has such ex periences at times i have had them before and i expect to have them again and then one afternoon like a bolt of lightning out of a clear sky came a working streak i tackled the story with renewed vim and enthusi asm for hours i wrote and rewrote hacked and edited from somewhere in the hidden recesses of my brain evolved a new heroineedith mor leya sweetfaced golden haired fullbreasted redblooded womana lovable girl and a true daughter of the vikings i love so well far into the night i worked under my flying thoughts edith morley grew developing with every change blossoming forth into radiant womanhood i tell you i was ob sessed with her and gentlemen without egotism i say frankly that she became so real to me that she walks through the pages of my book a living pulsating character instead of a creature of my imagination but as for that you can judge for your selves when the story comes out next month i forgot dinner everything in the enthusiasm of my work i have no idea how long i worked it was far into the night and sometime during the evening i had automatically switched on the lights but finally flesh and blood could stand it no longer i fell across the table my head pillowed in my arms whether i fainted or whether it was the sleep following exhaustion i do not pre tend to say was i really asleep i do not know ill swear that i could hear the clock ticking in the adjoining room and the thousandandone other odd mysterious little sounds that come in the middle of the night yet i must have been asleep there is no other explanation
