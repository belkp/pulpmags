 the summons dodd did not reply once more the bell in the outer office rang the indicator clicked dr stock bridge turned to observe the effect on the youth he lay there very still as though he had not heard but his eyes turned to the wall were wide open he seemed too stunned for any sensation as the moments fled by the surgeon grew more and more ill at ease under the strain of the silence and the unsolved mystery he wondered why they were waiting there inactive undecided and yet when he tried to think what they could do he was at a loss he could not wait there all day however obedi ent to a vague call an intangible sum mons from the dead if only he could persuade dodd of the absurdity of the whole situation but how could he convince dodd when he was himself so completely at sea he had never believed in these things had always waved aside any testimony concerning spirits as the invention of gullible minds yet here before him there was evidence that he could not thrust aside so easily he paced the room restlessly finally pausing beside carringtons friend what can we do he asked i am thinking said dodd quietly his eyes still on the horizon but persisted the surgeon do you still believe i am sure that the bell is a summons to some one if you do not understand its message it is because it is not for you perhaps it is not even for me for i do not seem to grasp the meaning of it but it is calling to some one here or it would not ring and that one will understand if he is here still pursued the surgeon encour aged even granting the existence of a spirit that exists after death is it con ceivable that that spirit can assert itself in this way as a man of science it seems too fanciful to me what replied dodd can be more fanciful than science itself it is dumb before the mysteries which it pretends to understand can you as a scientist explain to me why when a button is pressed in room a bell should ring in this room electricity began the surgeon and what is electricity even science does not pretend to know is it not in conceivable that it should be able to flow through a solid copper wire and yet it does mans soul his spirit is more mysterious than electricity why can it not flow through the ether and create a disturbance in its environment re leased from the body which it inhabit ed why can it not hover near by and make its will known to those it wishes to reach scofield carringtons body died but his spirit refusing to die un satisfied is still alive restless insistent urging the fulfillment of its desire that it may be set at peace and it will not give up until it is satisfied there he added as the bell rang it is still call ing it will continue until he for whom it is meant obeys the call but who is it for asked the sur geon weakly madison dodd turned slowly but his eyes did not meet the surgeons they made a circuit of the room and came to pause on the figure of young carring ton who had stirred for the first time and was now sitting up his elbows on his knees his face buried in his hands the surgeon followed his companions gaze it suddenly came to him that per haps young carrington who had not ut tered a word understood for he could see that beneath the surface of his im mobility there was a great struggle go ing on that a difficult resolve was form ing he turned to dodd expecting some revelation from him but the mans face was a mask his fingers were twined in the cord hanging from the window
