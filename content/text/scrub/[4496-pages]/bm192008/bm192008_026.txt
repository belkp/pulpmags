the man who was seven now begin i know all about the seven samuel smiths stopping at the seven hotels the six who went away and the one whowho stayed how they stole and hid the money and the wonderful work you two did finding it what you are to tell me now is why and how the one was killed how the money was taken after the six were gone and the seventh was dead why they masqueraded that way when it was sure to attract attention why they put the money in another vault of the same bank instead of taking it away with them andand all the rest of it go ahead im listening guess its up to you jim perform for the lady said peiperson dropping into a touch of the brogue that he sometimes affected when in cer tain moods carranaugh grinned back saying shes your wife not minesorra be its too full i am of her dinner and good things to talk yet awhile im too busy looking at her and thinkin what a fool for luck y are tom dear besides ive gained another twenty pounds the past week and its on my conscience i must bant again bad luck to the fat of me let me meditate in peace upon the last mans meal ill have for manys the day do you tell the girl ill add a word or two here and there should you forget or correct you if you dont give me the credit thats due me egregious egotist that y are make him mary theres the darlin and mary made him well dear itll do no harm to con fess in the bosom of our family that we only can guess at part of what you want to know deduce other parts from cir cumstantial evidence and be sure only of the little that remains but if you will take the explanation as a mixture of all three and let it go at that without being too particular about which is which here it is so that you will understand from the outset something that bothered us a good deal and very nearly threw us off the right trackas it was intended to doill begin in the middle with the fact that the body found in the vault was not one of the original seven samuel smiths at all was not murdered or killed by them or anyone else and had nothing to do with the looting of the bank except as a bit of evidence plant ed in the vault to complicate the case and confuse the police the leader of the gang the real samuel smith or whatever his name is saw very clearly that an attempt at least would be made to trace the move ments of the seven men he made the departing trails of his six assistants very easy to follow once they had done their part of the heavy preliminary work in the old sewer he figured that the police finding six identical clues would be so puzzled that they would simply begin to chase their tails and even if they caught one or two of the six they would still be beaten for the money was still safe in the vault but since he himself was compelled to remain in the city to carry out the actual robbery and then wait until it would be reasonably safe to take the swag out of town without being caught at railroad station or steamship dock by the plainclothes men on guard it was necessary that the seventh mem ber also should be as easily accounted for thats where the murdered man came in as part of the setting of the scene he had it is probable been pro vided for in advance and held in readi ness for the silent but important part he played it was no insuperable diffi culty for such a clever and resourceful crook as samuel smith to secure from some other city a body of a man with a vandyke beard and looking sufficiently like himself and the other six to pass
