the valley where dead men live booming the ground rocked beneath them was i dreaming was i the victim of a horrible nightmare in which my subconscious mind was again living the scenes i had gone through across the seas i pinched myself to make sure i was at a loss for an explanation i shook like an aspen leaf i was filled with supernatural terror then something happened that gave me a better light on the matter just at my right was a small knoll scarred and pitted with machinegun nests through the drab smoky haze i could see the illfitting german uniforms on the men who manned them across the gap which separated them from me a man was crawlingdragging himself along on hands and knees he turned his head toward me for an instant i recognized howard prestin an old frienda captain of infantry who had been killed in the argonne after silen cing a number of german guns which had stopped the american advance did he still live but no i had seen his body the day it was buried was i crazy my head whirled i was unable to move so transfixed was i by what was going on around me suddenly i saw prestin leap for ward a dozen guns opened on him yet they failed to stop him i saw him fire from the hip then he leaped among the germans with the buttend of his rifle a second later he hurled the weapon aside and drawing his au tomatic from its holster he sprang into a second nest the man seemed to bear a charmed life the germans swarmed over him time after time but after each effort he emerged trium phant his clothes hung on him in tat ters he was bleeding from a dozen wounds his face was a red smear through which his eyes gleamed like burning coals a german officera great hulking blond manfired a pistol pointblank at him it failed to stop his rush both reached for their trench knives they came together locked in a death struggle their weapons plying like mad slowly the german dropped to the ground a peculiar dazed look on his flat round face prestin turned wear ily away and beckoned as if waving for his men to move forward then he crumpled up and fell forward across his victims body then i knew the truththe horrible truth the legend of the indians was not fiction this was the valley where dead men lived here men who could not break their earthly ties came back to fight on and on until their berserker rage had expended itself here they were enacting over and over again the final tragedy of their lives god it was the most diabolical thing that the human mind could imagine think of it all over that vast plain in the midst of that icebound valley similar tragedies were being enacted by mendead men wraiths were grap pling here there and everywhere the peculiar feature of it all was that i seemed to be able to see each individual feat of valor at the same time although they were transpiring over miles of ter ritory it was like looking at an im mense moving picture which unreeled itself before me i can liken it to noth ing better than one of the huge old fashioned panoramas that were in vogue a few years after the civil war some few of which still remain in southern cities i seemed to be floating over the entire basin the guns seemed to be real guns shooting real bullets the cannon were the monsters of steel that i had seen in france yet i swear that several times i pissed directly through barrages unscathed the weapons like the men who served them were only phantoms god in heaven it was the most
