 weird tales lights our best weapon neither of us said anything for a while after that i stoked up the fire to be doing something and it made us so uncomfortably warm that we had to crowd away from it sitting close against the treetrunk i began to imagine some thing creeping up the black lane of shad ow it cast behind us to the edge of the clearing and yet again i thought i heard noises club in hand i went to investi gate and i was not disappointed in the least when i found nothing finally susan spoke this she said is a new light on the thing its nothing to be upset about i tried to comfort her not be upset she sat straight up and in the light of the fire i could see a single pained line between her brows deep and sharp as a chiselgash not when i almost turned into a beast how much of that do you remem ber i asked her i was foggy in my mind talbot al most as at the săšance but i remember be ing drawndrawn to what was waiting out there her eyes sought the thickets on the far side of our blaze and it didnt seem horrible but pleasant and welcome andwell as if it were my kind you and she glanced quickly at me then ashamedly away you were sudden ly strange and to be avoided is that all it spoke to me she went on in husky horror and i spoke to it i forbore to remind her that the only sound she had uttered was a wordless howl perhaps she did not know that i hoped not we said no more for another awkward time finally she mumbled im not the kind of woman who cries easily but id like to now go ahead i said at once and she did and i let her whether i took her into my arms or whether she came into them of her own accord i do not remem ber exactly but it was against my shoul der that she finished her weeping and when she had finished she did feel better that somehow washed the fog and the fear out of me she confessed al most brightly it must have been a full hour later that rustlings rose yet again in the timber so frequently had my imagination tricked me that i did not so much as glance up then susan gave a little startled cry and i sprang to my feet beyond the fire a tall gray shape had become visible with a pale glare of light around it dont be alarmed called a voice i knew it is iotto zoberg doctor i cried and hurried to meet him for the first time in my life i felt that he was a friend our differences of opinion once making companionship strained had so dwindled to nothing in comparison to the danger i faced and his avowed trust in me as innocent of mur der how are you i said wringing his hand they say you were hurt by the mob ach it was nothing serious he re assured me only this he touched with his forefinger an eye and i could see that it was bruised and swollen half shut a citizen with too ready a fist and too slow a mind has that to answer for im partly responsible i said you were trying to help me i understand when it happened more noise behind him and two more shapes pushed into the clear ing i recognized judge pursuivant nod ding to me with his eyes bright under his wide hatbrim the other man angular falconfaced one arm in a sling i had also seen before it was constable obry
