the shadow on the screen hind me was my own shadow grotesquely elongated and beside it was the squat amorphous patch of blackness i had seen on the screen upstairs my back was toward keene and my fingers crept into my pocket touching the metal paperweight i had dropped there earlier that evening briefly i con sidered the possibility of hurling the thing at keene and then decided against it the bars were too close together and the man would shoot me at any sign of dan gerous hostility my eyes were drawn to the shadow on the wall it was moving it rocked slightly and lifted the spikes lengthened the thing was no longer inanimate and dead and as i swung about stark amazement gripping me i saw the incredible metamorphosis that had taken place in the thing that cast the shadow it was no longer barrelshaped a dozen smooth glistening appendages ending in flat pads supported the snake thin body and all over that grayish up right pole tentacles sprouted and length ened writhing into ghastly life as the horror awakened keene had not lied and the monstrous survival he had brought from the aztec temple was lum bering from the alcove its myriad ten tacles alive with frightful hunger keene saved me he saw me standing motionless with abysmal fear in the path of that gigantic nightmare being and realizing that he was being cheated of his picture the man shouted at me to run his hoarse voice broke the spell that held me unmoving and i whirled and fled across the cave to the barred door skin ripped from my hands as i tore at the bars run keene yelled at me his shal low eyes blazing it cant move fast look out a writhing snakelike thing lashed out and a sickening musky stench filled my nostrils i leaped away racing across the cave again the arclights died and others flared into being as keene manipu lated the switchboard he was adjusting the lights so that our shadows would not be lostso that in the climax of the nameless the shadow of that ghastly hor ror would be thrown on the cave wall beside me it was an infernal game of tag we played there in those shifting lights that glared down while the camera lenses watched dispassionately i fled and dodged with my pulses thundering and blood pounding in my temples and ever the grim shadow moved slowly across the walls while my legs began to ache with the strain for hours perhaps or eons i fled there would come brief periods of respite when i would cling to the bars cursing keene but he would not answer his hands flickered over the switchboard as he adjusted the arclights and his eyes never paused in their roving examination of the cave in the end it was this that saved me for keene did not see ann stir and open her eyes he did not see the girl after a swift glance around get quietly to her feet luckily she was behind keene and he did not turn i tried to keep my eyes away from ann but i do not think i succeeded at the last moment i saw keenes face change and he started back but the chair in anns hands crashed down and splintered on the mans head he fell to his knees clawing at the air and then collapsed inertly i was on the far side of the cave and my attention was momentarily diverted from the monster i had been watching it from the corner of my eye expecting to be able to dodge and leap away before
