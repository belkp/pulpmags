the hairy ones shall dance that i had heard the movements and cries of the being that had so strongly moved and bewitched susan my heart whis pered rather loudly that i must look for myself at its traces or lack of them or for ever view myself with scorn almost at once i found tracks the booted tracks of my three allies shaking my lantern to make it flare higher i went deeper among the clumps my eyes quar tering the damp earth after a few mo ments i found what i had come to look for the marks were round and rather vague as to toepositions yet not so clear cut as to be made by hoofs rather they suggested a malformed stump or a palm with no fingers and they were deep enough to denote considerable weight the tracks of my own shoes next to them were rather shallower i bent for a close look then straightened up looked every where at once and held my torch above my head to shed light all around for i had suddenly felt eyes upon me i caught just a glimpse as of two points of light fading away into some leafage and in the direction of the clearing and toward them i made my way but there was nothing there and the only tracks underfoot were of shod human beings myself or one of the others i returned to my outward search following the round tracks they were plainly of only two feet there were no double impressions like those of a quadrupedbut i must have stalked along them for ten minutes when i realized that i had no way of telling whether they went forward or backward i might be going away from my enemy instead of toward it a close examina tion did me little good and i further pondered that the creature would lurk near the clearing not go so straight away thus arguing within myself i doubled back coming again close to the starting point i thought of a quick visit to the clearing and a comforting word or two with susan and zoberg surely i was al most there but why did not the fire gleam through the trees were they out of wood perplexed i quickened my pace a gnarled tree grew in my path its low branches heavily bearded with vines be yond this rose only the faintest of glows i paused to push aside some strands and peer the fire had almost died and by its light i but half saw two figures one tall and one slender standing together well to one side they faced each other and the tallera seeming statue of wetlook ing grayheld its companion by a shoul der the other gray hind was stroking the smaller ones head pouring grayness thereon i saw only this much without stop ping to judge or to wonder then i yelled and sprang into the clearing at my outcry the two fell apart and faced me the smallest was susan who took a step in my direction and gave a little smothered whimper as though she wras trying to speak through a blanket i ran to her side and with a rough sweep of my sleeve i cleared from her face and head a mass of slimy shiny jelly you i challenged the other shape what have you been trying to do to her for only a breathingspace it stood still as featureless and clumsy as a half formed figure of gray mud then dark ness sprang out upon it and hair eyes blazed at me green and fearsome a sharp muzzle opened to emit a snarl now i know you i hurled at it im going to kill you and i charged claws ripped at my head missed and tore the cloth of my coat one of my
