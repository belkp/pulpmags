 weird tales der if old doctor fenton was not right when he charged it all to my excited im agination i recall that he listened with great kindness and patience when i told him but afterward gave me a nerve powder and arranged for the halfyears vacation on which i departed the next week that fateful night i was wildly agitated and perturbed for despite the excellent care he had received joe slater was un mistakably dying perhaps it was his mountain freedom that he missed or per haps the turmoil in his brain had grown too acute for his rather sluggish physique but at all events the flame of vitality flickered low in the decadent body he was drowsy near the end and as darkness fell he dropped off into a troubled sleep i did not strap on the strait jacket as was customary when he slept since i saw that he was too feeble to be dangerous even if he woke in mental disorder once more before passing away but i did place upon his head and mine the two ends of my cosmic radio hoping against hope for a first and last message from the dream world in the brief time remaining in the cell with us was one nurse a mediocre fellow who did not understand the purpose of the apparatus or think to inquire into my course as the hours wore on i saw his head droop awkwardly in sleep but i did not disturb him i myself lulled by the rhythmical breathing of the healthy and the dying man must have nodded a little later the sound of weird lyric melody was what aroused me chords vibrations and harmonic ecstasies echoed passionately on every hand while on my ravished sight burst the stupendous spectacle of ultimate beauty walls columns and architraves of living fire blazed effulgently around the spot where i seemed to float in air extending upward to an infinitely high vaulted dome of indescribable splendor blending with this display of palatial magnificence or rather supplanting it at times in kaleidoscopic rotation were glimpses of wide plains and graceful val leys high mountains and inviting grot toes covered with every lovely attribute of scenery which my delighted eyes could conceive of yet formed wholly of some glowing ethereal plastic entity which in consistency partook as much of spirit as of matter as i gazed i perceived that my own brain held the key to these en chanting metamorphoses for each vista which appeared to me was the one my changing mind most wished to behold amidst this elysian realm i dwelt not as a stranger for each sight and sound was familiar to me just as it had been for uncounted eons of eternity before and would be for like eternities to come then the resplendent aura of my brother of light drew near and held col loquy with me soul to soul with silent and perfect interchange of thought the hour was one of approaching triumph for was not my fellowbeing escaping at last from a degrading periodic bondage escaping for ever and preparing to follow the accursed oppressor even unto the ut termost fields of ether that upon it might be wrought a flaming cosmic vengeance which would shake the spheres we floated thus for a little time when i per ceived a slight blurring and fading of the objects around us as though some force were recalling me to earthwhere i least wished to go the form near me seemed to feel a change also for it gradually brought its discourse toward a conclu sion and itself prepared to quit the scene fading from my sight at a rate somewhat less rapid than that of the other objects a few more thoughts were ex changed and i knew that the luminous one and i were being recalled to bondage though for my brother of light it would w t
