guarded turned aside to go around a cluster of young cedars which was directly in his path suddenly he drew back sharply again his hand tested the keen edge of that knife but not this time from nerv ousness jed was not thinking now of defense two hundred feet beyond the cedars on the smooth unbroken grass floor of the hollow was a man milking his back was turned to the cedars but jed thought he recognized that slim youthful form he believed it was ezekiel stepping lightly one hand on his belt where he could immediately grasp the knife jed moved into the open half way across the level space his hand moved yet closer to the knife while the ghost of a grin curved his lips without a doubt it was ezekiel simmons the man milking did not look up the milk jetted into the halffilled bucket with a low murmur just loud enough to mask jeds guarded footsteps step by step jed advanced if only ezekiel did not see him if only the cow did not sense his presence and turn un expectedly step by step furtherjed was tense with excitement there was no midday sun this time to blind his eyes and fill his soul with a nameless fear nor would he be unnerved by the twilight stillness it was always still at sunset here in these mountains ten feet now the milk still swished into the pail uninterruptedly the steady grinding of the cows molars never ceased suddenly jed tugged at his belt and leapt forward got you he shouted aloud but the exultant cry died suddenly in to a moan of horror the arm bearing the knife poised high for the blow jed felt something like an electric shock course through its length instead of swinging forward to strike the man in front of him the knife turned in his hand his wrist and elbow bent at a crazy angle and the razoredge steel ripped through the cords of his neck staggered more by his realization of the awful consequences than by present pain jed sank to the grass while gouts of blood spurted from a torn jugular his first mad terror past he became aware that ezekiel was standing over him scorn darkening his features so it was you tolliver abner warned meabout you id have got you tooonly ab ner abner was a good brother he told meweeks before he diedthat if any thing happened hedguard me jed felt himself weaker his head was strangely without weight and objects around swam lazily in the pale twilight he lay back on the grass should have got you ezekiel shouldnt havemissed he murmured sleepily as the shadows gathered he raised his head slightly to listen was that a light mocking laugh he heard in the grass beside him he listened again before the darkness came down nohe could not be sure
