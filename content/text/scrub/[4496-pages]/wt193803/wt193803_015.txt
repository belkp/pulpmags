 weird tales a longdrawn sigh came from the audience then the tableau was abruptly broken as the girl turned from us mount ed nimbly to the blackdraped altar and stretched herself full length upon it crossed her ankles and thrust her arms out right and left so that her body made a white cross on the sable altarcloth her eyes were closed as though in peace ful sleep but her bosoms rose and fell with her tumultuous breathing she had become the altar silence fell upon the congregation like a shadow and next instant herbules came in he wore a priests vestments a long red cassock over it the alb and stole and in his hand he bore a small red book behind him came his acolyte but it was not an altarboy it was a girl slender copperhaired petite she wore a short surcoat of scarlet cut low around the shoulders sleeveless reaching just be low the hips like the tabards worn by mediăśval heralds over it she wore a laceedged cotta otherwise she was un clothed we could hear the softlyslap ping patter of her small bare feet upon the altarsill as she changed her place from side to side genuflecting as she passed the reversed crucifix she swung a brazen censer to and fro before her and the gray smoke curled in spurting puffs from it filling the entire place with a per fume like that generated by the candles but stronger more intense intoxicating herbules began the service with a muttered latin prayer and though he seemed to follow a set ritual even i could see it was not that prescribed by any church for when he knelt he did so with his back turned toward the altar when he crossed himself he did it with the thumb of his left hand and made the sign beginning at the bottom rather than the top but even in this mummers parody the service was majestic i could feel its power and compulsion as it swept on toward its climax herbules took up the silver chalice and held it high above his head then rested it upon the living altar placing it between her breasts and we could see the flesh around her nails grow white as she grasped the black palled altar table with her fingers her body shining palely on the coffinpall under the flickering candles light was arched up like a tauted bow she shook as if a sudden chill had seized her and from her tightdrawn scarlet lips there issued little whimpering sounds not cries nor yet quite groans but something which partook of both and at the same time made me think of the soft whining sounds a newborn puppy makes the kneeling acolyte chimed a sac ringbell and the congregation bent and swayed like a wheatfield swept across by sudden wind when all was finished we were bid den to come forward and kneel before the altar steps herbules came down and stood above us and each of us was made to kiss the red book which he held and take a fearful oath swearing that he would abstain from good and embrace evil serve satan faithfully and well and do his best to bring fresh converts to the worship of the devil should we in any manner break our oath we all agreed that satan might at once foreclose upon his mortgage on our souls and bear us still alive to hell and the sign that we were come for was to be the odor of the per fume which the candles and the censer gave that night when this ritual was finished we were bidden name our dearest wish and told it would be granted i could hear the others mumble something but could not understand their words i dont know what possessed me when it came my turn to ask a boon of satanpossibly he put the thought into my mind maybe it was my longing to get out of school and go
