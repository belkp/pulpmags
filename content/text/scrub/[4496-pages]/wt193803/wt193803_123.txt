 weird tales the girl from samarcand continued from page recollectthe barred windows of a princes palace failed to keep you from me and eunuchs with crescentbladed simitars likewise failed but in the end why must all loveliness have an enda bowstring for me and a swordstroke for you the yellow girl shuddered as she stroked her smooth throat with fingers that sought to wipe off the last lingering memory of a cord of hardspun silk and from the first continued the girl i knew what our doom would be so i started weaving and completed my task before they suspected us and the bowstring did its work my soul my self being woven cunningly and curiously into silk rich enough to hang on the wall of the khans palace waited patiently and wondered whether you and i could have our day again thus it was in the begin ning ah now it does come back to me interrupted clarke as in a dream dimly remembered how compactly and stiflingly they would wrap me in a bale of silk and carry me past the guards and into your presence and by what devious routes i would leave you yes and how painlessly swift is the stroke of a simitar the yellow girl shuddered a simitar truly wielded is really nothing after all continued clarke i might have been sawn asunder between planks well and that meeting in the garden these short twenty years ago was after all not our first it seems that i knew then that it was not the first though but for an evening yes just for an evening so to what end were we spared bowstrings and the stroke of swift simitars since we had but an evening and thinking of the empty years of luxurious imprisonment that fol lowed she smiled somberly for only an evening and then you forgot until this rugthis same rug i wove centuries agointerrupted your pleasant adventur ing and reminded you death stared me in the face the end of life more vainly lived than the first i knew that i was leaving this avatar after having lived but one stolen evening so i sent a trusted servant to carry this very rug to meshed for when we met in the garden you were hunting rugs for him who now seeks them for your delight and i knew that he would find you if you still lived thus it is that i have crossed the border and stand before you as i did once beforethis time on that very rug which i wove centuries ago while living in hope of another meeting and in dread of the bowstring i knew would in the end find me the moon patch had marched toward the end of the rug from samarcand and was cutting into the blue web at its end clarke knew that when there remained no more room for her tiny feet she would vanish not ever to reappear but clarke hoped against knowledge yellow girl he entreated my door will be barred to friend and ac quaintance alike if you will but return on whatever nights the moon creeps across our rug had diane listening at the door understood she would have used her key but diane merely heard and i shall wait for these nights as long as life remains in me for all that has happened since then is nothing and less than nothing and all has been a dream since that one night in a garden of zarabshan very little remained of the moon
