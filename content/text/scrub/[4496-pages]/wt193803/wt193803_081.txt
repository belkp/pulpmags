 weird tales yet mostly conflicting and incoherent stories of his family and neighbors slater raved for upward of fifteen minutes bab bling in his backwoods dialect of green edifices of light oceans of space strange music and shadowy mountains and val leys but most of all did he dwell upon some mysterious blazing entity that shook and laughed and mocked at him this vast vague personality seemed to have done him a terrible wrong and to kill it in triumphant revenge was his para mount desire in order to reach it he said he would soar through abysses of emptiness burning every obstacle that stood in his way thus ran his discourse until with the greatest suddenness he ceased the fire of madness died from his eyes and in dull wonder he looked at his questioners and asked why he was bound r barnard unbuckled the leather harness and did not restore it till night when he succeeded in persuading slater to don it of his own volition for his own good the man had now admitted that he sometimes talked queeriy though he knew not why within a week two more attacks ap peared but from them the doctors learned little on the source of slaters visions they speculated at length for since he could neither read nor write and had apparent ly never heard a legend or fairytale his gorgeous imagery was quite inexplicable that it could not come from any known myth or romance was made especially clear by the fact that the unfortunate lunatic expressed himself only in his own simple manner he raved of things he did not understand and could not inter pret things which he claimed to have ex perienced but which he could not have learned through any normal or connected narration the alienists soon agreed that abnormal dreams were the foundation of the trouble dreams whose vividness could for a time completely dominate the wak ing mind of this basically inferior man with due formality slater was tried for murder acquitted on the ground of in sanity and committed to the institution wherein i held so humble a post i have said that i am a constant specu lator concerning dreamlife and from this you may judge of the eagerness with which i applied myself to the study of the new patient as soon as i had fully ascertained the facts of his case he seemed to sense a ccrtain friendliness in me born no doubt of the interest i could not conceal and the gentle manner in which i questioned him not that he ever recognized me during his attacks when i hung breathlessly upon his chaotic but cosmic wordpictures but he knew me in his quiet hours when he would sit by his barred window weaving baskets of straw and willow and perhaps pining for the mountain freedom he could never again enjoy his family never called to see him probably it had found another temporary head after the manner of decadent moun tain folk by degrees i commenced to feel an overwhelming wonder at the mad and fantastic conceptions of joe slater the man himself was pitiably inferior in men tality and language alike but his glowing titanic visions though described in a bar barous disjointed jargon were assuredly things which only a superior or even ex ceptional brain could conceive how i often asked myself could the stolid im agination of a catskill degenerate conjure up sights whose very possession argued a lurking spark of genius how could any backwoods dullard have gained so much as an idea of those glittering realms of supernal radiance and space about which slater ranted in his furious de lirium more and more i inclined to the belief that in the pitiful personality who cringed before me lay the disordered
