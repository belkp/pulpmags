 weird tales tain remainder whose immundane and ethereal character permits of no ordinary interpretation and whose vaguely excit ing and disquieting effect suggests pos sible minute glimpses into a sphere of mental existence no less important than physical life yet separated from that life by an all but impassable barrier from my experience i cannot doubt but that man when lost to terrestrial conscious ness is indeed sojourning in another and uncorporeal life of far different nature from the life we know and of which only the slightest and most indistinct memories linger after waking from those blurred and fragmentary memories we may infer much yet prove little we may guess that in dreams life matter and vitality as the earth knows such things are not neces sarily constant and that time and space do not exist as our waking selves com prehend them sometimes i believe that this less material life is our truer life and that our vain presence on the terraqueous globe is itself the secondary or merely virtual phenomenon it was from a youthful revery filled with speculations of this sort that i arose one afternoon in the winter of when to the state psychopathic institution in which i served as an interne was brought the man whose case has ever since haunted me so unceasingly his name as given on the records was joe slater or slaader and his appearance was that of the typical denizen of the cats kill mountain region one of those strange repellent scions of a primitive colonial peasant stock whose isolation for nearly three centuries in the hilly fast nesses of a littletraveled countryside has caused them to sink to a kind of barbaric degeneracy rather than advance with their more fortunately placed brethren of the thickly settled districts among these odd folk who correspond exactly to the deca dent element of white trash in the south law and morals are nonexistent and their general mental status is prob ably below that of any other section of the native american people joe slater who came to the institution in the vigilant custody of four state police men and who was described as a highly dangerous character certainly presented no evidence of his perilous disposition when i first beheld him though well above the middle stature and of some what brawny frame he was given an ab surd appearance of harmless stupidity by the pale sleepy blueness of his small watery eyes the scantiness of his neglect ed and nevershaven growth of yellow beard and the listless drooping of his heavy nether lip his age was unknown since among his kind neither family rec ords nor permanent family ties exist but from the baldness of his head in front and from the decayed condition of his teeth the head surgeon wrote him down as a man of about forty from the medical and court documents we learned all that could be gathered of his case this man a vagabond hunter and trapper had always been strange in the eyes of his primitive associates he had habitually slept at night beyond the ordinary time and upon waking would often talk of unknown things in a man ner so bizarre as to inspire fear even in the hearts of an unimaginative populace not that his form of language was at all unusual for he never spoke save in the debased patois of his environment but the tone and tenor of his utterances were of such mysterious wildness that none might listen without apprehension he himself was generally as terrified and baffled as his auditors and within an hour after awakening would forget all that he had said or at least all that had caused him to say what he did relapsing into a bovine halfamiable normality like that of the other hilldwellers
