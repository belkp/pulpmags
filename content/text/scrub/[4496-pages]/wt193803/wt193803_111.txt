 weird tales tion but the face of the bearded de fender the man whose life was forfeit to these vicious assassins would not come clear to him finally he grew tired of searching undressed and went to bed tomorrow he said to himself when i am fresher i shall be able to think the thing out better he went to sleep at once and slept soundly but in the course of the nighthe had no idea how long he had been asleephe started up in bed with the definite impression that he had heard something a call a cry or voices talking together he listened complete silence if he had heard anything it must have been in his dream it did seem to him as if he had had a dream and that he had dreamed about something disturbing something alarming but he could not remember what the dream had been about he was in the act of lying down again when he glanced into his studio which lay bathed in the moonlight from the great window he saw his dog stand ing erect in the center of the room his head thrust forward and turned toward the window watching and listening in tently without barking he had never seen the animal act like that before the painter called softly the dog gave no sign of hearing him he did not change in the slightest his attitude of absorbed interest then the painter raised his eyes to the window at first it seemed to him as if he must be dreaming still he threw the bed clothes aside stared at the window brushed his hands across his eyes and gazed again there was no doubt about it the painters eyes were looking into the eyes of the bearded man whose con duct had puzzled him the night before it looked as if the man had climbed up and stood on something that lifted him breasthigh before the secondstory win dow the roughboned carelessly kept face with the tangled hair and beard was unmistakably the face he had caught a glimpse of on his way home a few hours before it was frightfully distorted the eyes were wide open and staring the lips were open and drawn back from the teethit seemed almost as if the man were uttering a terrified cry for help but not a sound was audible on the left temple there was an ugly wound with the hair matted over it but with the blood still trickling down over the face there was no sign of the hands the arms fell straight down from the shoulders it al most seemed to the painter as he studied the figure and its attitude a little more calmly as if someone had pushed a dead man up into the window from below then all at once the horrible apparition disappeared noiselessly and the painter saw the trees and the quiet sky behind and above them at that moment the dogs muscles re laxed from his position of tense watch fulness he ran to his master cowered against him as if he were seeking pro tection turned his head back toward the window then he sat down expectantly before the painter exactly as he was in the habit of doing when he saw the artist take down his hat and his caped cloak to go out for a moment the distracted artist could do nothing but stare at the rectan gle of moonlight where the ghastly fig ure had been then he realized the changed attitude of the dog and spoke to the animal when the little creature saw that he had his masters attention he stood up wagged his tail and looked around expectantly toward the stairway the artist took his revolver and went to the window the moonlit landscape was calm and silent not a sight or a sound
