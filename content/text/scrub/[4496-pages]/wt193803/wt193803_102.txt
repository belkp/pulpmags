guarded jed chuckled to himself here in tennes see folk didnt believe more than a week passed before jed again took his welloiled shotgun from its place on the wall and started over the mountain he was in no great hurry about ezekielinstead he rather enjoyed waiting ezekiel was the last of the three simmons brothers and knowing that the foreigner was over there and that he was going to kill him gave life a curious sort of zest likely the kid didnt even know who shot his brother jed laughed silently at the thought add ing to himself that the boy probably wouldnt do anything about it if he did know he wasnt like the mountain people but this morning all of jeds im patience had returned the sun shone hotly on the tennessee hills and raised an almost visible veil of vapor from the tiny branch which flowed through the hollow well hed waited long enough with a grimace of distaste at the three mile traipse across two mountains jed swung his gun over his shoulder and started down the slope when an hour and a half later he arrived at the small clearing which was the simmons place he was not as tired as he had expected to be the nervous exhilaration of the manhunt buoyed him up made him tensely aware of things around him he paused only a moment at the fringe of scrub oak that bordered the clearing then bending almost double he sprinted a hundred feet to the grapearbor safe inside the leafy bower jed leaned his gun against a supporting post and looked about here the vines had been trained over a rude wooden lattice so that a thick wall and roof of leaves now effectively hid him from anyone outside jed parted the leaves carefully and peered out a hundred feet behind him was the low wall of forest he had just left two hundred feet in front of him was the housea rude tworoom shack two hundred feet beyond that the wall of the forest began again jed looked at the house more closely there was no sign of movement but the thin line of smoke which curled from the chimney told him that ezekiel was inside probably prepar ing his midday meal with a sigh of con tentment he sat down and leaned back closer to his gun idly listening to the chatter of birds in the forest and the rustling of the leaves in the arbor how long jed sat there he did not know he was suddenly aroused from a semistupor by the sound of a banging door startled into instant activity he swung around to peer through the leaves ezekiel was leaving the house swinging in his hand an empty waterbucket going to the spring jed reckoned if so his path would take him within fifty feet of the arbor jed gloated with hands suddenly unsteady the man in the arbor laid his gun on the ground the muzzle barely extending through the leaves why take a chance he would waitat fifty feet he couldnt miss unmindful of his danger ezekiel came slowly down the path bearing diagonally nearer to the arbor jed suddenly wondered why he no longer heard the aimless chatter of birds in the forest why the light wind no longer stirred the broad leaves above him it was uncanny this noonday quiet impa tiently he shook off the feeling so i cant do it abner he whis pered to the empty air but somehow the words clutched at his throat and he wished he hadnt said it no matter a few seconds now
