the hairy ones shall dance among them and dropped to the mossy ground the creature fell craftily silent then i felt sudden panic and regret at being left weaponless and i retreated toward the fire susan i said huskily give me an other stick hurry she did not move or stir and i rum maged frantically among the heaped dry branches for myself catching up the first piece of wood that would serve i turned to her with worried curiosity she was still seated upon the cloak draped root but she had drawn herself tense like a cat before a mousehole her head was thrust forward so far that her neck extended almost horizontally her dilated eyes were turned in the di rection from which the whining and crooning had come they had a strange clarity in them as if they could pierce the twigs and leaves and meet there an answering understanding gaze susan i cried still she gave no sign that she heard me if hear me she did she leaned far ther forward as if ready to spring up and run once more the unbeastly wail rose from the place where our watcher was lurking susans lips trembled from them came slowly and softly then louder a longdrawn answering howl aoooooooooooooo aoooooooooooo ooooooo the stick almost fell from my hands she rose slowly but confidently her shoulders hunched high her arms hung forward as though they wanted to reach to the ground again she howled aoooooooooooooooooooo i saw that she was going to move across the clearing toward the trees through the trees my heart seemed to twist into a knot inside me but i could not let her do such a thing i made a quick stride and planted myself before her susan you mustnt she shrank back her face turning slow ly up to mine her back was to the fire yet light rose in her eyes or perhaps be hind them a green light such as reflects in still forest pools from the moon her hands lifted suddenly as though to repel me they were half closed and the crooked fingers drawn stiff like talons susan i coaxed her yet again and she made no answer but tried to slip side wise around me i moved and headed her off and she growled actually growled like a savage dog with my free hand i clutched her shoulder under my fingers her flesh was as taut as wire fabric then sud denly it relaxed into human tissue again and she was standing straight her eyes had lost their weird light they showed only dark and frightened talbot she stammered whwhat have i been doing nothing my dear i comforted her it was nothing that we werent able to fight back from the woods behind me came a throttling yelp as of some hungry thing robbed of prey within its very grasp susan swayed seemed about to drop and i caught her quickly in my arms hold ing her thus i turned my head and laughed over my shoulder another score against you i jeered at my enemy you didnt get her not with all your filthy enchantments susan was beginning to cry and i half led half carried her back to the fireside at my gesture she sat on her cloak again as tractable as a child who repents of rebellion and tries to be obedient there were no more sounds from the timber i could feel an emptiness there as if the monster had slunk away baffled
