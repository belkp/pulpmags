 the extra dozen eggs and evidence were against him at the very outset in my heart i wished him good fortune while believing that in this instance good fortune could not come to him indeed there seemed no other ex planation of marshs death than that which i had just stated to mountfort there was no doubt that he had died of poison administered in a glass of wine there was no doubt that the wine had been poured for him by gerald gray son could there be any doubt that the poison was mixed with the wine by the same person who poured it and graysons motive for this terrible deed it was known to every man and woman in the town he loved and was loved and the woman was marshs only daughter who was prevented from marrying him by her fathers prejudices against him these prejudices were the result of one of those absurd feuds which still exist in southern communities at some remote period the graysons and the marshes had been involved in a dis pute over certain lands which when taken to the courts had been decided in favor of the former family since that time the name of grayson had been anathema to a marsh and succeeding generations had at different times done their utmost to bring misfortune to members of the grayson family it is only fair to state in favor of the graysons that their activities in this quarrel had been directed along only defensive lines until this act of the last of the race in poisoning robert marsh not one of them had done any thing to keep alive the fires of hatred and in the beginning even young gerald had shown no animosity toward his hereditary enemies he had permitted himself to be attracted by a daughter of the race and in an upright manly way had done his best to gain her fathers consent to their marriage only when this consent was refused did he strike i was not present at the gathering at graham cumberlands house where grayson committed the act that would send him to the gallows but what hap pened was adequately described to me by an eyewitness the meeting was not a social one but was called by cumberland as president of the towns largest bank to obtain the consent of his directors to certain innovations he de sired to establish present besides cumberland him self and marsh and grayson were her bert stanley the banks vicepresident and cashier samuel townsend the richest and most powerful man in the state and cashel heming an attorney who held proxies for the absentee directors except by marsh no objec tions were raised to cumberlands plan but marsh who always enjoyed being in the minority and was of an unusually antagonistic disposition fought cumber land tooth and nail at moments he was positively insulting and had it not been for his adversarys tact and toler ance of an old mans irritability a serious quarrel might have ensued as it was after a great deal of argument it was decided to hold the matters under discussion over to another meeting when it would be possible to get together a greater numbfr of the banks directors it was when they had all risen to go that cumberland with his wellknown suavity and tact had said mr marsh you and i have spoken pretty plainly this evening to show these gentlemen that our disagreement in no manner affects our personal relations i am going to ask you to drink a glass of wine with me he turned to grayson who had been sitting with his back to the buffet gerald he said will you oblige me by reaching into the cabinet there and getting out the decanter and glasses
