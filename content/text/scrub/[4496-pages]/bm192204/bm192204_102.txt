a trackandahalf country but had never before been known to work in new york city it was their hometheir playground al most any night they could be found in eichoms restaurant with their friends in fact harbin had seen them there the night before it was incomprehensible yet there was the evidence and so at noon the police alarm went out to bring in dave bamfield red doran billy evans and jim anthony ii harbin more methodical than the other detectivesperhaps a trifle more intelligentwent over the evidence like a schoolmaster as four police officers sat down to lunch in eichorns where he had seen two of the wanted men the night before apparently just before the robbery bamfield and doran had been seated at the marbletopped table in the corner with june jennings evanss girl as the detective noted that billy evans was missing he recalled the gossip he had heard that the coming of the pretty blonde girl into the society of the gang was threatening to disrupt it his attention had been attracted to the gang by meeting just outside frog fagin looking as though he had failed in his nightly effort to sponge a meal from the prosperous crooks and slink ing away to quarters more within his measly means just beyond he had seen evans hurrying toward the restaurant with determined stride and protruding jaw he had been half tempted to wait to see a grand row over june jennings but his bed had called loudly and he had gone home now it seemed that while he slept these acquaintances of his had been not fighting but hard at work the picture identified as that of the purchaser of the overcoat was that of bamfield the cap had been definitely placed as one used by doran for motoringindeed had his initials scratched on the inside of the sweatband in small letters thus two of the men were fixed to a cer tainty it was considered almost certain that a third man had acted as lookout and also that a fourth had remained at the wheel of the automobile what two men would doran and bamfield most likely have with them on such an enter prise they associated habitually with anthony and evans the deduction seemed clear as gin and the finding was so entered and confirmed by the old man himself the capture of the four was ridicu lously easy jim anthony was found in what his wife violently insisted was a sickbed and she was not a whit pla cated at the grinning assurance of the officers that the prison physician would give her husband the best of care with out cost doran was nabbed as he came to eichorns for a belated breakfast bamfield was arrested at the hotel where he always stopped when in town and evans was found drunk with a bottle beside him in the furnished room he had lately occupied with june jennings the girl was nowhere to be found probably that was the reason for the bottle to say that the men denied their guilt is putting it far too mildly they were profanely vociferous about it almost in tears at the injustice of the accusation a strange feature of their behavior though was that as they sat in the same room for a time at headquar ters three of them each shot searching looks as though of puzzled inquiry at jim anthony that cracksman however seemed to have troubles of his own he was either a most excellent actor or really had a severe cold in the chest it wasnt necessary to take their finger prints these were already on record to attempt a third degree with such veterans would have been a waste
