the man who was two when the trouble broke loose latham was standing midway between the row of prisoners and the little knot of guards as the missiles flew through the air he was caught between two fires somethinga dish or bowlstruck him squarely on the head he dropped to the floor unconscious for five minutes the battle waged across his body then he recovered consciousness and plunged into the fray with almost maniacal strength aiding the guards wherever possible when the affair was ended and the mutineers were finally herded back into their cells he was bleeding from a dozen wounds here is the peculiar feature imme diately after the fight latham the model prisoner became a prison outlaw he refused to obey prison discipline in sisted on hobnobbing with the guards and attempted to escape whenever occa sion offered itself he was taken before the warden the latter who had taken a great in terest in the case of the former gun man especially since his services at the time of the break tried argument latham insisted to the warden that he was being unjustly held he as serted that he was not simon latham the outlaw but captain john conners the policeman the warden a man not prone to for get favors finally ordered him taken from the cell where he had been con fined after his outbreak and placed in the insane ward under observation he is there now here are the facts as i deduce them i am positive that i am right captain conners was in the act of arresting latham when the wreck oc curred he had as i have said drawn his revolver and with it covered the murderer who dye think i am damn yeh the gangster demanded i dont thinki know conners answered you are before he could finish his sentence the cars were piled together he was thrown forward and received a terrific blow on the head then and there all memory disappeared but in his subconscious mind were the thoughts that had been flashing through his brain while he was making the arrest his subconscious memory retained nothing but the impressions of simon latham he had known latham for years his history was to the police man an open book he was about to utter lathams name when the blow came that erased all memory so while the conscious mind of captain john conners was obliterated there remained in the tiny cells in the back of his head the recol lection of the man who stood before him at that last instant latham was killed his body muti lated beyond all recognition was buried as captain john conners conners disfigured and mutilated speaking only the thoughts that as i have said were in his mind at that last instant thoughts that had only to do with simon lathamaccepted the role of simon latham lived it accepted the punishment of simon latham yet somewhere in those tiny cells of subconsciousness remained the police man he could not be the renegade that latham had been because it was not in his makeup even though in his own mind he was latham why be cause his training had all been on the side of law and order then came the prison break that flying dish striking him on the head removed in some way the pressure against his brain immediately the role of simon latham was forgotten and he started in again where he had left off six years before he was again captain
