 the extra dozen eggs of god ill have that boy out of jail before im a day older without listening to my protests and vouchsafing me no further information he led me hurriedly along the street toward the upper end of the town when at length i was going to declare my intention to go no farther unless he told me what wild goose chase we were pursuing he turned in at the gate of a fine old mansion surprised beyond belief i saw that the house toward which we were head ing was the home of graham cumber land what are we doing here at this time of night i demanded surely youve been over the case with cumberland a hundred times before this mountfort ignored my question in stead of answering it he took the steps of cumberlands stoop at a bound and an instant later i heard his ring at the bell the door was opened to us almost instantly and it was cumberlands hand some genial face that looked out at us from the lighted doorway come in gentlemen come in he cried when he had recognized us i am very glad you have taken the trouble to look in on me i had become so bored with my own company that i was just about to pack off to bed he stood aside and held the door wide for us to enter mr cumberland mountfort said when a minute or so later we were seated in our hosts library enjoying the flavor of his cigars our visit is not entirely a social one in fact ive come to ask you a further question or so about the death of robert marsh per haps you will bear with me when i tell you that my belief in graysons inno cence is still unshaken and i do not want to leave anything undone that might in any way help him cumberland made a deprecatory gesture he spoke in a tone of the utmost sincerity no one more than myself pities that unfortunate young man if there is anything i can tell you or do that will aid him in any way come to me at any time of the day or night and as often as you choose i turned toward mountfort to see how he was impressed by our hosts generous speech and i was amazed to see him grinning almost malevolently then why mr cumberland he asked in a voice barely above a whisper did you purchase so many eggs on the afternoon of march eggs cumberland cried quite rightfully startled out of his habitual calm what in heavens name do you mean mountfort drew a memorandum book from his pocket and with exasperating slowness turned the pages until he found the notation he was seeking on march he read at length from simon greene grocer at four thirty in the afternoon you purchased a dozen eggs which you carried home yourself graham cumberland settled back in his chair and regarded mountfort with an amused smile well grant that astounding fact he said goodhumoredly but what has a quite ordinary household purchase of mine to do with robert marshs death but it wasnt an ordinary household purchase you see just the day before your cook had purchased her usual weekly amount of three dozen cumberland shook his head and re garded my friend with a puzzled expression im sorry he said but dont quite see what you are driving at are you suggesting that i am extravagant in the matter of buying eggs or is it that you think eggs are bad no no mountfort broke in not
