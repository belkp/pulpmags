 the light that lies didnt know the road to edgewood and long might turn off the bayfield when he reached the highway how could he find out then too there was the real car slim bates was sending after him per haps that was roaring down the road behind him even now apparently it had been due just when he arrived he stepped on the accelerator as the car started to climb the last grade where the cutoff joined the main highway the lights of edgewood would be in sight then and he would have to decide quickly whether to try the run for bay field the car reached the top of the grade and shot down the road at a speed that drove the convict against the back of the car slow down bo slow down came the harsh command from the back seat do you want one of these bayfield speed cops stopping us they used to hang around here longs question was answered he had to keep on to edgewood the man on the rear seat stirred un easily why was slim getting so care ful and if he couldnt come himself why did he have to pick an outsider this one could drive all right but he didnt like it hed tell slim so when he met him whered you say slim was going to meet me he asked again at the edgewood hotel i will have to go for him long had to stick by his story the convict didnt like the idea of the hotel why didnt slim pick out one of the regular hangouts how you goin to get me in that hotel i cant go through the front slim must be crazy sending me to a hotel where the bulls could find me with out lookin why had slim picked out a hotel it didnt seem natural again long took a chance a hotel is just the place they wouldnt look for you its too public ill take you up the back way and have everybody asking why no you dont no one will see you but the porter and he knows me i live there if he could get the man to his room he might find a way that menacing tone behind him had driven out any thought of attempting to hail an officer well see that you keep to the dark streets i dont like this much and the convicts tone carried dread they were in the outskirts of edge wood and the man on the back seat pulled the cap down over his eyes and huddled into a comer his eyes never left longs hands as they gripped the steering wheel he wasnt quite sure of this driver even though he talked so smoothly and long gave up hope of being stopped by a policeman that first cau tion about driving had been sufficient he was going carefully now through side streets and up alleys he drove and he twisted and turned by devious ways long could not shake off the thought of slim bates following close behind finally he brought the car to a stop in an instant the convict was leaning over him and longs vision of the re volver at his back was a reality what are you doin he demanded a nameless iron door showed under the glare of a light iron doors meant barred windows to the man who had done murder to escape them and there was murder in his voice now this is the back door of the edge wood hotel and long struggled to keep his voice steady wait until i get the porter dont you leave me just knock until he comes so long knocked and prayed that no questions would be asked by whoever opened it eventually the knock was
