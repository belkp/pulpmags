the live book for july the secret city painting a midget with a highly elaborated mountain as a back ground is scarcely fair to the midg et it could not be blamed for complain ing of the artists judgment of relative values it is very nice for the mountain but the bit of a thing standing as the central figure has a sorry enough time indeed it is hardly fair to the artist his background overwhelms him rises portentous and awful and the midget for which after all the picture was painted is lost in the confusion of dis jointed proportions hugh walpole in the secret city george h doran company has told a thirdrate story against a firstrate background the setting for his latest novel is nothing less than the russian revolution but the story is merely the everlasting triangle with a sort of fourth side dragged in for good measure mr walpole assumes to know russians that is to say he must be a sort of demigod shining like the angels to know the russian is to grasp the scope of human passions as dominating men and women and directed by the irrespon sible whim of children mr walpole says he has sensed all of this and he pro ceeds to exhibit men and women who do not differ as far as can be judged at this distance from the men and women the best known russian writers have cre ated hence they must be true as hinted the story is slim enough and as to the accuracy of his picture of the revolution one can only guess accurate or not it reads well and the arrangement induces a dramatic tension it is interesting to note that mr wal pole has sounded the first indication that the french revolution for purposes of fiction is henceforth passăš however the similarity of the two mighty events has already been so strenuously noted that the reader will not be at all confused by the fiction dealing with the russian upheaval the book is worth reading as an indication of what one may expect in addition to the fact that it is in itself a creditable work marie corelli is still writing you may not believe it but assuredly it is true age seems not to have given hesitation to her pen naturally it is not surpris ing that she is turning to the question of rejuvenation her latest offering the young diana george h doran in no sense a novel deals with the acquisition of beauty and youth by a homely spinster surely the book shows miss corelli at her worst it lacks plot ingenuity care in construction human sympathy understanding ideals inter est originality outside of these trifling defects it may be a great work the flail by newton fuessle moffat yard amp company analyzes the psychology of an american born ger man boy before and during the war take the first two books that is the first two hundred pages throw them away and give the last two books your attention and you will have a rather good picture of the ambitious german american caught in the throes of the great conflict judith of blue lake ranch by jack son gregory charles scribners sons
