robert campbell spinning from her bows swing a wide arc and come tearing back to cut a com plete circle around the convoy to report to the essex by code they were not using the wireless unnecessarily for fritz is a curious being and is constantly lis tening to the gossip of the seas at night the ships felt their way as best they could in the pitchy darkness with only the bin nacle lights on deck and when one of the gray shapes would loom perilously near to another shadowy bulk explosive and highly specific language would result for running a convoy at night in war time is a matter for hunch and intuition and then on the seventh day just as the blackness was begining to yield to the daily miracle of the dawn and the coast of ireland but some six hundred miles away four dirty gray conning towers with the water dripping down their sides rose out of the sea almost at the same in stant the shriek of the sirens and the crack of guns were simultaneous here they are cried captain butts with a yell as he called a hardover order to the quartermaster at the wheel jam her over you blighter he roared and anxiously watched the asheville heel over to starboard as the great steel rud der gripped her briggs raced up on the bridge and took his statiop with the captain heres where we find out whether they are after us cried butts in the ear of his mate the convoy had spread out to offer as poor a target as possible to the fire of the submarines and in the growing dawn the cruisers and destroyers were banging away with every thing they had the asheville headed into the north and the skipper grinned as they began to leave the convoy astern and then he grinned a wider and more grim grin for one of the submarines ceased firing at the con voy and swinging about shaped a course in the wake of the freighter it looks as if berlin wanted that cop per after all muttered butts to himself it is an old sea axiom that a stern chase is a long chase and a tramp steamer that can dig fourteen knots out of her engines can give even a supersubmersible a long run when the latter is four miles astern and has a surface speed of but a trifle over fifteen knots captain butts walked aft to where the ensign and his crew were training their fourinch gun that gentle soul astern there has a sixinch rifle mounted on his fore gun platform if im any judge he said and i have a very private belief that the one thing he doesnt want is to sink this packet but he will surely make it a lot interesting for our upper works so if you can drop one of your pills anywhere on that sixincher of his it will be re garded as a merciful dispensation of providence the ensign looked up with a scowl ill blow his blasted tub out of the water and let it fall back again if i have any luck he growled perhaps the subs engines were car bonized perhaps his oil was not up to grade or perhaps mcpherson managed to get another knot out of his engines but on that point there is no definite infor mation ordinary arithmetic would indi cate that the sub should have ranged alongside the asheville within five hours at the least but the facts are that she didnt it is even true that the asheville managed to draw slightly away until the little skipper scowled and interviewed the chief engineer it is also true that evening began to draw on and there was almost no perceptible change in the situation save that the shells from the fish had knocked the charthouse into a mass of splinters cut away one half of the funnel and ripped up enough deck plates to build two extra large box girders the ships gun had effected no damage that could be noted for it was practically out ranged and when the night began to fall the ashevilles way diminished the mate looked anxiously into the ditch alongside then glanced at the pur
