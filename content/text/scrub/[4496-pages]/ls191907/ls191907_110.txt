the silver lining by sam s stinson little fables of inconsistency wherein is shown that the wise saws are generally equipped with crosscut teeth love laughs at locksmiths but once upon a time before the high cost of living raised its hydraheaded menace in the land there lived a youth and a maiden named respectively jack and jill in the theatre of life they listened to the clever patter of the little vaude villain billed as love and fell for his stuff so they were married and all was as merry as the wedding bells until one day poverty came in at the door the door was locked but that made no difference to poverty he came in just the same by way of a joke love jumped through the window poverty took possession of the spare room and proceeded to make himself at home jack and jill phoned for the locksmith to come and repair the damage the locksmith came with his kit of tools but catching a glimpse of poverty in the spare room demanded his pay in advance whereupon love stuck his head in the window and burst into roars of laughter ha ha ha ho ho ho cried love if theres anybody that can get a laugh out of me its a locksmith hes funnier than i am jack and jill were overjoyed to see the locksmith slink away nor did they know he had merely gone to fetch his gang but that is just what the miserable gangster did presently he returned reinforced by the butcher the baker and the candle stick maker all armed with cruel weapons known as bills using these horrible instruments of torture to extract their nefarious toll from jack and jill they beat love to an unrecognizable pulp while poverty stood outside to stall off any possible police interference thus making the world safe for democracy then they all went away to report to their master the high cost of living making the wellknown welkin ring with the peals of raucous mirth moral love laughs at locksmiths buthe laughs best who laughs last the lure of the unattainable is what makes life worth while after a mans search is rewarded by finding the ideal woman she passes him up because she is looking for the ideal man there is nothing so beautiful as sympathy a woman always feels sorry for a man who has trouble with his wife unless she happens to be his wife
