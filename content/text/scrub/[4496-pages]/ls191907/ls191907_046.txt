roger hartman marcia meant to give cresson freedom in the only way in which such a man as he might take it at her hands ah she was clever cresson i managed to say his name before my throat tightened she sighed a little it is all right jim hehe doesnt know but the years have broken what linked us i am almost fortythree and he is barely thirtyone he tells him self that love still spans that gulf but but he is careful not to set his weight upon the bridge jim i have come to understand a little better in these later years there is a difference between us that isnt in the books a man loves forward or backthe boy conceives his passion for a woman and the man as the years draw down on him for a child but a woman cant find comfort in the spectacle of youth porters youth is like a constant sneer in my teeth a woman wants to comfort herself behind the shelter of anothers age to hug the thought that she is not so old as some one else jim if you had guessed you would have told me long ago i have wanted you soso terribly i sat very still she would have made an actress such as no stage ever held knowing that she lied knowing that every word and tone was false i all but believed her womenthe best and the worstare infinitely more cruel than men she reminded me of the wife in some shaw playthe eternal feminine who tells her youthful suitor that she would cook him for her husbands sup per without qualm she knew that i loved her and she coolly used that love to shield her man from the reproach of his conscience for deserting her she would have ordered me flung to the lions as lightly as she played on the soul of me i knew she was marcia playre and i loved her more because i knew there is the paradox of love i adored her more utterly than ever now that i was wholly sure that she could watch me torn in pieces without a quiver if my destruction served the man she loved my mind worked swiftly in that mo ment how did she dare choose this expedient did she think that i could be hoodwinked like the pathetic old fel lows of french farce or did she really contemplate the sacrifice of herself i knew she could not marcia playre might sin splendidly but she would never sneak or cheat or steal then i guessed she thought me fiftyand fifty meant age unspeakable to her for all her near ness to its sinister boundaryline i was dear old jimmy in my dotage a man who might need a nurse a daughter but no wife i looked ahead measur ing the cost fifty when you come to it my cocksure friend you will discover for yourself that your illusion of youth is stronger than at thirty now you are young without thought or endeavor at fifty you will be young because you will cling passionately to the conviction that you are young i knew what i should pay for taking marcia at her word i think the martyrdom began in that still moment on the ancient roman marble i played my part convincingly i think i was the calm old lover to the very life i kissed her hands gently and still more gently kissed the cheek she turned to my lips i spoke softly calmly of the autumn days of life of indian sum mer suns she seemed to understand for she leaned affectionately against me relaxing confidently in my arms her cool cheek pressed to mine for just a mo ment i lost my rigid grip on myself my arms tightened and my lips found hers a kind of phantom youth throbbed in methe madness of the spring does not die when the leaves turn then i was frightened because she lay so still and silent in my arms i must not alarm her with the spectral apparitions of that youth she believed long dead and safely sepulchered in the years we told cresson together it wasnt
