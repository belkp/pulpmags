roger hartman well begun it is no more possible to put marcia into lines and shadows and lights than to paint a star starthat is the best keyword there is some thing starlike about her something of the distance the ineffable pathos that surround the unattainable something too of the purity that only a star seems fitted to typify the weakness of the simile is its cheapness every towheaded wench since the race learned to grunt an embryo speech has made somebody think of a star i can do no better but you must imagine a star different from any other ever used for purposes of comparison a higher clearer more ethereally luminous star than any you can see in the sky tonight or if you are young enough perhaps you can envi sion marcia playre by giving her name to the dream woman you hope to find and love before you die it doesnt mat ter whether her eyes are blue or gray or her hair flax or red or midnight black you wouldnt inquire the specific gravity of your star would you i brought porter cresson to marcia it seems incredible now that i should not have foreseen what must inevitably grow out of that encounter i knew marcia as a man sometimes comes to know the woman he loves with a hope lessness so complete that it keeps his secret even from such eyes as marcia playres i used to be glad in those days that marcia didnt know if she had known she would have sent me away for my souls sake but she did not and i after i had seen for myself that there was that in porter cresson which made a womans heart quicken at the sight of him brought him to marcia marcia the starwoman fatuously cock sure that no woman of sixandthirty need fear an overgrown bearboy twelve years younger by the calendar and twelve hundred centuries younger in that age of the soul that is understanding oh i didnt even think about itit would have impressed me then as being quite as needless as to worry over the results of letting the aphrodite of melos meet john keats cresson was blind to her beauty mar cia had the kind of loveliness which is in the blue of a september sky too perfect to advertise itself to obtrude insistently on the senses and cresson was taken off his feet from the first in stant by his discovery that she could think he has the type of brain which is closed against simultaneous impres sionshe has room for only one idea at a time i doubt if he had any clear mental image of marcias face when he came up to my rooms after that first visit to spend half the night telling me about her mind can you see him filling my biggest chair so that it seemed absurdly frail blazing at me with the vivid words he chose like a master of speech and alight with the miracle of a woman whom the gods had seen fit to endow with a brain i remember smiling tolerantly at him and thinking what a wonderful thing it was to be young enough to have enthusiasms i suppose i looked a hundred years old to him he talked to me as if i wrere an innocent bystander i was thirtyeight then his confidences were rather hard to bear as he grew to understand marcia for no better reason i think than that i had introduced them he chose me from the very beginning as the repository of his emotional processes he twitched at my sleeve as a vivisector might to urge me toward the operating table on which he dissected his souldissected it like the genius he was with an uncanny sure ness of hand but with savage ruthless ness it revolted me but with the hyp nosis that horror can exert on the least sanguinary fascinated me it was only when he began dissecting marcia that i stopped him short i couldnt bear that still i heard enough it was no more than a question of years that lay between
