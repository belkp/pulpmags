robert shirley have i been able to find any trace of him since that was three days ago then theres that infernal dog he wont let me out of sight and shivers as hes doing now as soon as the sun goes down i looked at the dog he was crouched close against curtis leg shaking as with an ague perhaps the old gentleman went away on a little trip not expecting you so soon i suggested as for the dog he may be sick curtis scratched a match on the table and lighted his pipe gentlemen invariably go away on little trips without clothing he re marked they always get out of their beds leave their shoes beside a chair their watch on a table ticking and their doors bolted on the inside i sat up quickly and the dog howled mournfully the door bolted on theare you sure i asked and he grinned ironically bring that lamp with you and ill show you he answered come this way he pushed open the door that led into the house proper i followed him and the dog squeezed through between my legs as if afraid to be left alone see that asked my friend with a look at the animal we walked down a short hall that smelled old and mildewed and stopped before another door this is where the old man slept curtis remarked taking the lamp from me he turned the knob and pushed the door open as he did so the dog growled savagely and looking at him i could see the hair rising along his spine while his fangs showed white come on pete said tom to him but the dog backed away and crouched close against the wall outside he would not enter the room curtis pushed at him with his foot but the animal snarled viciously and snapped at him let him alone i said and with curtis entered the old mans chamber when i got here said my friend putting down the lamp on the oldfash ioned bureau the door was bolted on the inside as i told you the window was open about two feet and the dog was in the room howling when i had tried the door and found it locked i went outside and climbed through the window as soon as i opened the door the dog rushed out as if he had been frightened half to death how long ago was that i asked outside in the dark passage i could see the dogs eyes shining three days ago was the answer the poor beast was half starved of course ever since hes shivered at night just as you see him but why didnt he jump out of the window i asked that would have been easy for him answer me that and ill make you a present replied curtis look here you see ive left everything just as it was save that i unbolted the door here are my uncles things evidently just as he removed them his clothes neatly folded over the chair here as you see his collar tie and scarf pin on the bureau shoes socks etc on the floor beside the bed handkerchief and book within easy reach and his watch on the small stand as you see it everything as methodical as you would expect from a man who has been doing the same thing for years i glanced about the room and found everything as curtis had described it the open window again attracted my at tention why should a man have left his room by the window when he could have gone by the door and why would he leave without his clothes i muttered exactly agreed jim and that is why ive sent for you i tell you theres a mystery here even if the dog didnt act the way he does
