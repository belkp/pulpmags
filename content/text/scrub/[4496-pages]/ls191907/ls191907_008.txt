robert campbell the navy folk his work was to take the new asheville from port to port and spend as little time as possible in doing it nevertheless i suppose it is a weakness of human kind to want to do some other fellows job for him and it is a fact that butts had in two or three specific cases where he had gotten his fish gone out of the way to do that job on one of the occasions he had chased the scan dalized sub for fifty miles or so having had the fortune to drop one shell into her inner works with such effect that her sub merging pumps were knocked out of kil ter and consequently she had to depend on her speed in getting away the sight of a heavy thirteenknot tramp steamer savagely chasing a somewhat erratic and badly frightened submarine about the western ocean so shocked a certain lieu tenant commander who happened on the scene in time to see butts plug a four inch projectile into the sub with such ef fect that she blew up in the middle and sank in two sections that he complained to the admiral ashore at queenstown about it as an infringement of privilege i dont mind seeing a freighter fight if she has to sir he objected but i do think this chap neednt have gone out of his way to run the fish down and to chase it its taking chances after all sir and anyway what are we out there for being a human being first the admiral chuckled ive heard of captain butts before he said if you take my advice young man dont tell him your opinion and above all dont get between captain butts and the next fish he goes after hes likely to ram you whereupon the lieutenant commander came as near a snort as is permissible in the presence of an admiral and went off in a huff so captain butts walked up and down gnawing on his ungratified desire until the wireless operator handed him a slip of paper on which were penciled the or ders for which he had been waiting as sembly in the lower bay was next and then a procedure of six ships accom panied by two destroyers to the rendez vous off the banks where they were to meet the main convoy the doughty captain gave the necessary orders and watched his big ship work her way slowly out of the basin with the help of two fussy but efficient tugs when she had passed through the narrows butts glanced again at his orders and called briggs his mate we may have to drop the hook down the bay he said maybe theyll give us the clear signal to keep on out if the others are ready anyway here are the orders were to join the rest at the banks take our orders for formation from the essex and in the event of an attack in force scatter and get to port on our own the best way we can while the snakes look after the subs got that mr briggs signifying that he had cap tain butts snorted and went below to the chart room where he wedged himself in a corner and read three pages of plu tarchs lives as a sedative but at the end of the third page he sent the steward for mcpherson and when that calm per son appeared wiping his hands on a piece of waste butts motioned him to a seat ive been thinking about our cargo mac he said im inclined to think theres more in what you said than per haps youve any idea of ye surprise me now remarked the engineer with a wry grin possibly replied butts with a frown but as that happens so often youll not mind if it doesnt excite me now listen you know theyre horribly short of cop per in germany of course and that they ll take desperate chances to get some im not foolish enough not to know that they come pretty close to getting a line on every cargo that steams out of these ports and that we cant do anything to stop it whats to prevent them having a try for us
