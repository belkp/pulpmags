 robert dale denver down softly until he was certain there were no sticks to crack under them there was no further call but he heard several groans someone had been shot but an injured man if still alive can be as dangerous to someone wanting to help him as to an enemy pushing aside a growth of small pines roane looked out on a little open space the light was just sufficient to show the dark blot of a man lying on his back roane moved in quietly to kneel by the fellows side first making sure that the fellow had no gun the wounded mans hands were empty and drawn up under his right shoulder roane struck a match cupped it the man was a long sandyhaired cowboy somewhere in his early twenties his eyes were closed another match in a swift examination showed that his pair of highheeled boots were much small er than those worn by the man who had ambushed roane and andy this cow boy was a victim of that ambusher which warmed roane to him at once building a little fire out of dry twigs he took away the clenched hands and found blood soaking the flannel shirt just below the shoulder cutting away part of the shirt revealed a hole made by a bullet which had smashed through the mans right side high up leaving a gaping wound from which blood flowed freely to staunch the flow roane divided his neckerchief to make two wads fastening them with strips of cloth torn from the mans shirt hearing the murmur of a creek not far away he brought a hat full of water to pour some down the throat of the man who had begun to whisper faintly waterstill without opening his eyes there was not much help roane could give a doctor was needed here they were roane knew somewhere on the big mesa above the cross seven headquarters in dusk canyon he could go down the trail and along the canyon bottom until he came to the ranch but that would be a long time to leave the young fellow maybe too long in cutting away the bloodsoaked shirt hed heard paper crinkle in a pocket examining the paper now he found it was a letter addressed to one tom gary if this were one of the garys deadly enemies of the cross seven that did away with his idea of going to the cross seven for help there would be no help there for a gary looking about him he suddenly saw a faint glimmer of light through the pines to the north climbing a little hill he could see the mounting flames of a fire a fire started recently since he had not seen it before it offered a prospect of help and he started off on a trot near the campfire which was burning low by the time he came near it he saw the gray tarp of a covered wagon he raised a hail it was not answered but as he went close to the wagon a voice sounded from behind hima fem inine voice drop that rifle the voice ordered him firmly then put up your hands and march toward that fire and dont try any tricks yes maam no maam he said meekly and letting his carbine fall went along with his hands up he grinned a little he liked that voice despite the attempt of its owner to make it sound very harsh and forceful reaching the fire he calmly used a moccasined foot to kick up the fire then turned to look at his captor she was a girl of sixteen at most he judged garbed in a blue skirt leather jacket highheeled boots her hair brown with luminous lights caught from the fire was fluffed above a darkeyed face that was the prettiest roane had ever seen a mighty cute kid despite the double barreled shotgun she held in a business like manner sorry to disturb you miss he said but i ran onto a man whos been shot and is in a bad way hes lying close to the place where this road drops through the rimrock id like to bring him here to be taken care of laying
