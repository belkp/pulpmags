 street amp smiths love story magazine i told my friend about it and she said she had known for a long time that my husband was dating different women but she just couldnt tell me because i was so wrapped up in him as it often happens by the time the wife finds out anything every one else knows all about it he was always good to me and never objected to getting me anything i wanted onenigh i caught him talking to a girl on the street he had told me earlier in the evening that he had to work that night then my husband left town and didnt tell me where he was going this girl left the same day although she came back in a week my husband stayed away for al most three weeks then i received a let ter from him in which he said that he still loved me and would send for me as he was thinking of staying in that town i didnt answer his letter and when he came back i made up with him for the babys sake and because i still loved him with all my heart i think its too bad that some of us cant help loving a man when we know he isnt worthy of our love my husband still goes out on the aver age of two nights a week but i dont be lieve the excuses he offers i cant seem to trust him any more girls sometimes call him up right here at home and when he happens to be home the minute he hears the girls voice he hangs up and tells me there was no one on the line do you think i should break with my husband we have lived with my father ever since i was married and i really would have no place to go i have no brothers or sisters and have never worked although my father and my husband get along fairly well my father wants me to leave my husband he says he will take care of me and the baby he is grieving over mothers death and i wont have any one if he ever goes he tries to comfort me by saying that if anything ever hap pens to him there will be enough left to take care of the baby and me maybe all this sounds foolish mrs brown but i just had to write and ask your opinion and tell me what you think would be best for me to do im really un decided about leaving my husband i sup pose i feel this way because i still care mary de l but dont you think my dear that it wouldnt be quite fair to saddle your father with the problem of taking care of you and the baby when that is your husbands job it is heartbreaking of course when a husband disregards his wifes love and devotion but it would not ease your heartache if you were to break with your husband if you love him as you say you do it might help if you tried to reach a better understanding with him his actions in the past were not at all commendable of course how ever if you appeared to trust him it might have a favorable effect and in time you two could again find a satisfactory degree of happiness to gether you know mary there is some thing in the old saying nothing ventured nothing gained try to make yourself more attractive and interesting and a little mysterious it will be more effective than show ing openly how hurt you are and how hard it is for you to believe in him lsf
