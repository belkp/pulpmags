 street amp smiths love story magazine almost lost my mind when i realized that all my love was just a passing fancy to him of course i couldnt let my folks know what had happened so i went to stay with my sister she lived in the same town as ronnys mother and his older brother murray my sister said i ought to tell ronnys mother how he had treated me but i couldnt do it especially as i really liked her she is a fine woman ronnys mother and i talked about the engagement but i didnt have the heart to tell her that i no longer heard from ronny or that he was responsible for mak ing my life so miserable she wanted me to come to see her often the next time i went to see her i met ronnys brother murray we talked about different things including my com ing marriage to ronny on the way home murray told me that he knew why i was so blue because the last time he saw ronny he heard the whole miserable story he said that ronny didnt want to marry me or any girl because it would spoil his career i cant tell you how that hurt me i sent back ronnys ring and said he could go right ahead with his career and that we were through for good i met murray again and he was very sweet he wanted to come to see me and take me out and i was glad to have a friend we became good friends one day i was cleaning house and fell from a ladder i had to go to the hospital my baby was born dead when i realized what had happened all my feeling for ronny died too when i was well again murray began coming to see me regularly but i couldnt stay with my sister forever and when i told him that i was going home soon he took me ia his arms and asked me to marry him i began to feel alive again murray was very good to me and what girl doesnt appreciate kindness when she is in trouble however although i love murray more than i ever loved ronny he said that he probably didnt have the right to ask me to marry him since i was in love his brother of course when i told him how i felt it was different but do you think that i should marry him knowing about ronny and me do you think he would throw it up to me later on im only nineteen and murray is twenty five i want to marry him and live hap pily but under the circumstances im afraid to take such a serious step your opinion will be greatly appreciated downhearted there is no reason in the world why you and murray couldnt be happy together unless of course you believe that he is the type of man who might indulge in the un pleasant habit of bringing up the past whenever something happened to upset domestic peace knowing him as well as you do you should be able to determine this fact better than any one else a man must be indeed generous and understanding to really dis regard the past and be interested only in the future many men ap pear to be unable to reach this point of forgetfulness while there are some who never stir the dead ashes of the past why not give yourself a little more time to study murray it is better to take your time my dear than to rush into a situation which may bring you more grief if your friend can close the door to the past you two could probably be very happy together dear mrs brown about five years ago i met a young man and have been in love with him ever since he has often told me that he loves me better than any one in the world my parents however wouldnt allow me to go with him but i slipped out to meet him whenever i could and they never knew he is now twentyfive and i am eighteen my parents say i am not old enough to be sure hes the right man for me to marry and they are sure he isnt in order to please them i tried to be come interested in other boys but every time i met jack id forget the others he seemed to feel the same way about me and would beg me to stop going with other boys and go out with him only i usually did though we continued to see each other secretly then some one told my father that i was meeting jack and he made me promise not to see him again i began keeping company with a cer
