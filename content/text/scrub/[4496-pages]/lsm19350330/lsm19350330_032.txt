young and beautiful to her joy gordon was stand ing on the side porch as she went toward the landing she pretended not to see him until he hailed her not going swimming in that icy lake are you pausing she looked up she had seen the eyes of many men widen with keen admiration at sight of her in a bathing suit but to see such a look on his face fairly made her tingle im going to paddle my own canoe she said that is unless i can find a strong man to help me howd you like to ship on a voyage around the lake im awfully sorry a deepen ing warmth of sincerity was in his tone but ive promised to make a fourth at bridge with mr sebas tian your mother and another lady oh she caught her breath and again exasperation swept over her if his eyes really meant what they said why was he always at her mothers side better be careful she advised him mockingly youll be tired out lifting those heavy cards i dont know how you stand the pace he glared down at her it isn t only your canoe that needs pad dling he growled for a moment she thought he was going to vault the railing and carry out his threat then he glanced out over the lake and his expression changed lots of whitecaps on the water dont you think its too choppy to go ca noeing maybe for bridge players bev erly retorted but i dont think so she swung on her heel and walked away disappointed that he called no reply after her as she started pad dling from shore she could see him on the porch watching her then he went inside during the next two hours he reappeared at inter vals no doubt when he was dummy she derived some satisfaction from believing that he was following her with his eyes pride alone kept her on the lake after the first half hour the water was choppy and the wind had a knifelike edge but she felt that to go ashore would be admitting that gordon had been right presently the wind increased and she decided to turn back she veered too sharply however letting the canoes bow leap out of the water the swirling waves rushed under it and beverly found herself in the lake with the canoe capsized the water was icycold but after she caught her breath she was not alarmed she was an excellent swimmer about to start for shore she glanced toward the hotel there on the porch stood gordons famil iar figure knowing that she was cleanly visible to him she sent out a long piercing scream she saw him leap the railing and run to the landing there he re moved his coat kicked off his shoes and dived into the lake as he cut through the water toward her with long strong strokes she perceived that he was an exceptionally good swimmer nearing the capsized canoe to which she clung he blinked the wa ter from his eyes and called hoarsely miss fenwick bev erly are you all right never better she responded cheerfully it was nice of you to swim out and visit me she smiled gayly at him his face grew grim as treading water he stared at her you dont seem to need help he
