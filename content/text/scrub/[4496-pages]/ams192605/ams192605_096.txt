off on a comet the only malcontent was palyrin rosette day and night he persevered in his astronomical pur suits declared his intentoin of never abandoning his comet and swore positively that nothing should in duce him to set foot in the car of the balloon the misfortune that had befallen his telescope was a neverending theme of complaint and just now when gallia was entering the narrow zone of shootingstars and new discoveries might have been within his reach his loss made him more in consolable than ever in sheer desperation he en deavored to increase the intensity of his vision by applying to his eyes some belladonna which he found in the dobrynas medicine chest with heroic forti tude he endured the tortures of the experiment and gazed up into the sky until he was nearly blind but all in vain not a single fresh discovery rewarded his sufferings no one was quite exempt from the feverish excite ment which prevailed during the last days of de cember lieutenant procope superintended his final arrangements the two lower masts of the schooner had been erected firmly on the shore and formed supports for the balloon which had been duly cov ered with the netting and was ready at any moment to be inflated the car was close at hand some inflated skins had been attached to its sides so that the balloon might float for a time in the event of its descending in the sea at a short distance from the shore if unfortunately it should come down in midocean nothing but the happy chance of some passing vessel could save them all from the cer tain fate of being drowned the st came twentyfour hours hence and the balloon with its large living freight would be high in the air the atmosphere was less buoyant than that of the earth but no difficulty in ascending was to be apprehended gallia was now within miles of the sun consequently not much more than miles from the earth and this interval was being diminished at the rate of nearly miles an hour the speed of the earth being about miles that of the comet being little less than miles an hour it was determined to make the start at two oclock threequarters of an hour or to speak cor rectly minutes seconds before the time pre dicted by the professor as the instant of collision the modified rotation of the comet caused it to be daylight at the time an hour previously the balloon was inflated with perfect success and the car was securely attached to the network it only awaited the stowage of the passengers isaac hakkabut was the first to take his place in the car but scarcely had he done so when servadac noticed that his waist was encompassed by an enormous girdle that bulged out to a very extra ordinary extent whats all this hakkabut he asked its only my little bit of money your excellency my modest little fortunea mere bagatelle said the jew and what may your little fortune weigh in quired the captain only about sixtysix pounds said isaac sixtysix pounds cried servadac we havent reckoned for this merciful heavens began the jew sixtysix pounds repeated servadac we can hardly carry ourselves we cant have any dead weight here pitch it out man pitch it out god of israel whined hakkabut out with it i say cried servadac what all my money which i have saved so long and toiled for so hard it cant be helped said the captain unmoved oh your excellency cried the jew now old nicodemus listen to me interposed ben zoof you just get rid of that pouch of yours or we will get rid of you take your choice quick or out you go the avaricious old man was found to value his life above his money he made a lamentable outcry about it but he unfastened his girdle at last and put it out of the car very different was the case with palmyrin ros ette he avowed over and over again his intention of never quitting the nucleus of his comet why should he trust himself to a balloon that would blaze up like a piece of paper why should he leave the comet why should he not go once again upon its surface into the faroff realms of space his volubility was brought to a sudden check by servadacs bidding two of the sailors without more ado to take him in their arms and put him quietly down at the bottom of the car to the great regret of their owners the two horses and ninas pet goat were obliged to be left behind the only creature for which there was found a place was the carrierpigeon that had brought the professors message to the hive ser vadac thought it might probably be of service in carrying some communication to the earth when every one except the captain and his ord erly had taken their places servadac said get in ben zoof after you sir said ben zoof respectfully no no insisted servadac the captain must be the last to leave the ship a moments hesitation and the orderly clambered over the side of the car servadac followed the cords were cut the balloon rose with stately calm ness into the air chapter xviii suspense when the balloon had reached an elevation of about yards lieutenant procope de termined to maintain it at that level a wire work stove suspended below the casing and filled with lighted hay served to keep the air in the in terior at
