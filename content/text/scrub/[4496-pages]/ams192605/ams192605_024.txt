a trip to the center of the earth be careful to remember this continued the professor at the approach of an eruption these spouts of vapor redouble their activityto disap pear altogether during the period of volcanic erup tion for the elastic fluids no longer having the necessary tension seek refuge in the interior of the crater instead of escaping through the fissures of the earth if then the steam remains in its normal or habitual state if their energy does not increase and if you add to this the remark that the wind is not replaced by heavy atmospheric pressure and dead calm you may be quite sure that there is no fear of any immediate eruption but enough my boy when science has sent forth her fiatit is only to hear and to obey i came back to the house quite downcast and dis appointed my uncle had completely defeated me with his scientific arguments nevertheless i still had one hopethat was when once we were at the bottom of the crater that it would be impossible in default of a gallery or tunnel to descend any deeper and this despite all the learned saknussems in the world i passed the whole of the following night with a nightmare on my chestand after unheardof miseries and tortures found myself in the very depths of the earth from which i was suddenly launched into planetary space under the form of an eruptive rock next day the d june hans calmly awaited us outside the presbytery with his two companions loaded with provisions tools and instruments two ironshod staves two guns and two large game bags were reserved for my uncle and myself hans a man who never failed to take even the minutest precautions had added to our baggage a large skin full of water as an addition to our gourds this assured us water for eight days it was nine oclock in the morning when we were ready the rector and his huge wife or servant i never knew whichstood at the door to see us off they appeared to be about to inflict on us the usual final kiss of the icelanders to our supreme astonishment their adieu took the shape of a formid able bill in which they even counted the use of the pastoral house really and truly the most abominable and dirty place i ever was in the worthy couple cheated and robbed us like a swiss innkeeper and made us feel by the sum we had to pay the splen dors of their hospitality my uncle paid without bargaining a man who had made up his mind to undertake a voyage into the interior of the earth is not the man to haggle over a few miserable rix dollars this important matter settled hans gave the signal for departure and a few moments later we had left stapi chapter xii the ascent of mount sneffels the volcano which was the first stage of our experiment is about five thousand feet high sneffels is the termination of a long range of volcanic mountains of a character different from the system of the island itself one of its peculiari ties is its two huge pointed summits from where we started it was impossible to make out the actual outline of the peak against the gray field of sky all we could distinguish was a vast dome of white which fell downwards from the head of the giant the commencement of the great undertaking filled me with awe now that we had actually started i began to believe in the reality of the undertaking our party formed quite a procession we walked in single file preceded by hans who calmly led us by narrow paths where two persons could by no possibility walk abreast conversation was wholly impossible we had all the more opportunity there fore to reflect and to admire the awful grandeur of the scene around as we advanced the road became more difficult the soil was broken and dangerous the rocks broke and gave way under our feet and we had to be scrupulously careful in order to avoid dan gerous and constant falls hans advanced as calmly as if he had been walking over salisbury plain sometimes he would disappear behind huge blocks of stone and we momentarily lost sight of him there was a little period of anxiety and then there was a shrill whistle just to tell us where to look for him occasionally he would take it into his head to stop to pick up lumps of rock and silently pile them up into small heaps in order that we might not lose our way on our return he had no idea of the jour ney we were about to undertake at all events the precaution was a good one though how utterly useless and unnecessary but i must not an ticipate three hours of terrible fatigue walking in cessantly had only brought us to the foot of the great mountain this will give some notion of what we had still to undergo suddenly hans cried a haltthat is he made signs to that effectand a summary kind of break fast was laid out on the lava before us my uncle who now was simply professor hardwigg was so eager to advance that he bolted his food like a greedy clown this halt for refreshment was also a halt for repose the professor was therefore com pelled to wait the good pleasure of his imperturbable guide who did not give the signal for departure for a good hour the three icelanders as taciturn as their comrade did not say a word but went on eat ing and drinking very quietly and soberly from this our first real stage we began to ascend the slopes of the sneffels volcano its mag nificent snowy nightcap as we began to call it by an optical delusion very common in mountains appeared to me to be close at hand and yet how many long weary hours must elapse before we reached its summit what undreamedof fatigue must we endure the stones on the mountain side held together by no cement of soil bound together by no roots or creeping herbs gave way continually under our feet and went rushing below into the plains like a series of small avalanches in certain places the sides of this stupendous mountain were at an angle so steep that it was impossible to climb upwards and we were compelled to get around these obstacles as best we could those who understand alpine climbing will appreciate our difficulties often we were obliged to help each other along by means of our climbing poles i must say this for my unclehe stuck as close
