a trip to the center of the earth was taking place had stopped precisely at twenty nine inches you perceive said the professor we have as yet only to endure the pressure of air i am curious to replace the barometer by the manometer the barometer in fact would become useless as soon as the weight of the air was greater than that calculated as about the level of the ocean but said i is it not very much to be feared that this everincreasing pressure may not in the end turn out very painful and inconvenient no said he we shall descend very slowly and our lungs will be gradually accustomed to breathe compressed air it is well known that aăťronauts have gone so high as to be nearly without air at all why then should we not accustom ourselves to breathe when we have say a little too much of it for myself i am certain i shall prefer it let us not lose a moment where is the packet which pre ceded us in our descent i smilingly pointed it out to my uncle hans had not seen it and believed it caught somewhere above us huppe as he phrased it now said my uncle let us breakfast and break fast like people who have a long days work before them biscuit and dried meat washed down by some mouthfuls of water flavored with schiedam was the material of our luxurious meal as soon as it was finished my uncle took from his pocket a notebook destined to be filled by memoranda of our travels he had already placed his instruments in order and this is what he wrotemonday july st chronometer h m morning barometer inches thermometer degrees fahr direction e s e this last observation referred to the obscure gal lery and was indicated to us by the compass now harry cried the professor in an en thusiastic tone of voice we are truly about to take our first step into the interior of the earth once before visited by man since the first creation of the world you may consider therefore that at this precise moment our travels really commence as my uncle made this remark he took in one hand the ruhmkorf coil apparatus which hung around his neck and with the other he put the electric current in communication with the filament of the lantern and a bright light at once illumined that dark and gloomy tunnel the effect was magical hans who carried the second apparatus had it put into operation too this ingenious application of electricity to practical purposes enabled us to move along by the light of an artificial day amid even the flow of the most inflammable and com bustible gases forward cried my uncle each took up his burden hans going first my uncle following i going third we entered the somber gallery just as we were about to engulf ourselves in this dismal passage i lifted up my head and through the tube like shaft i saw that iceland sky i was never to see again was it the last i should ever see of any sky the stream of lava flowing from the bowels of the earth in had forced itself a passage through the tunnel it lined the whole inside with its thick and brilliant coating the electric light added very greatly to the brilliancy of the effect the great difficulty of our journey now began how were we to prevent ourselves from slipping down the steeply inclined plane happily some cracks abrasures of the soil and other irregularities served the place of steps and we descended slowly allowing our heavy luggage to slip on before us at the end of a long cord but that which served as steps under our feet became in other places stalactites the lava very porous in certain places took the form of little round blisters crystals of opaque quartz adorned with limpid drops of natural glass suspended to the roof like lusters seemed to take fire as we passed beneath them one would have fancied that the genii of romance were illuminating their under ground palaces to receive the sons of men magnificent glorious i cried in a moment of involuntary enthusiasm what a spectacle uncle do you not admire these variegated shades of lava which run through a whole series of colors from reddish brown to pale yellowby the most in sensible degrees and these crystals they appear like luminous globes you are beginning to see the charms of travel master harry cried my uncle wait a bit until we advance farther what we have as yet discovered is nothingonwards my boy onwards it would have been a far more correct and ap propriate expression had he said let us slide for we were going down an inclined plane with perfect ease the compass indicated that we were moving in a southeasterly direction the flow of lava had never turned to the right or the left it had the in flexibility of a straight line nevertheless to my surprise we found no per ceptible increase in heat this proved the theories of humphrey davy to be founded on truth and more than once i found myself examining the ther mometer in silent astonishment two hours after my departure it only marked degrees fahrenheit i had every reason to believe from this that our descent was far more horizontal than vertical as for discovering the exact depth to which we had at tained nothing could be easier the professor as he advanced measured the angles of deviation and inclination but he kept the result of his observa tions to himself about eight oclock in the evening my uncle gave the signal for the nights rest hans seated himself on the ground the lamps were hung to fissures in the lava rock we were now in a large cavern where air was not wanting on the contrary it abounded what could be the cause of thisto what at mospheric agitation could be ascribed this draught but this was a question which i did not care to dis cuss just then fatigue and hunger made me in capable of reasoning an almost unceasing march of twelve hours had been kept up not without great exhaustion i was really and truly worn out and delighted enough i was to hear the word halt hans laid out some provisions on a lump of lava and we each supped with keen relish one thing however caused us great uneasinessour water re serve was already half exhausted my uncle had full confidence in finding subterranean resources but hitherto we had completely failed in doing so i could not help calling my uncles attention to the circumstance and are you surprised at this total absence of springs he said continued on page
