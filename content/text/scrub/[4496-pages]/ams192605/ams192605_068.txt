off on a comet countless snowwhite prickles were truly ludicrous the little professor most comical of all resembled nothing so much as the cub of an arctic bear it was eight oclock in the morning the sun was rapidly approaching the zenith but its disc from the extreme remoteness was proportionately dwarfed its beams being all but destitute of their proper warmth and radiance the volcano to its very summit and the surrounding rocks were still covered with the unsullied mantle of snow that had fallen while the atmosphere was still to some extent charged with vapor but on the north side the snow had given place to the cascade of fiery lava which making its way down the sloping rocks as far as the vaulted opening of the central cavern fell thence perpendicularly into the sea above the cavern feet up the mountain was a dark hole above which the stream of lava made a bifurcation in its course from this hole projected the tube of an astronomers telescope it was the opening of palmyrin rosettes observatory sea and land seemed blended into one dreary whiteness to which the pale blue sky offered scarce ly any contrast the shore was indented with the marks of many footsteps left by the colonists either on their way to collect ice for drinking purposes or as the result of their skating expeditions the edges of the skates had cut out a labyrinth of curves complicated as the figures traced by aquatic insects upon the surface of a pool across the quarter of a mile level ground that lay between the mountain and the creek a series of footprints frozen hard into the snow marked the course taken by isaac hakkabut on his last return from ninas hive on approaching the creek lieutenant procope drew his companions attention to the elevation of the dobrynas and ilansas waterline both vessels being now some fifteen feet above the level of the sea what a strange phenomenon exclaimed the captain it makes me very uneasy rejoined the lieu tenant in shallow places like this as the crust of ice thickens it forces everything upwards with ir resistible force but surely this process of congelation must have a limit said the count but who can say what that limit will be re member that we have not yet reached our maximum of cold replied procope indeed i hope not exclaimed the professor where would be the use of our traveling leagues from the sun if we are only to ex perience the same temperature as we should find at the poles of the earth fortunately for us however professor said the lieutenant with a smile the temperature of the remotest space never descends beyond ì§¸ c below zero and as long as there is no wind added serva dac we may pass comfortably through the winter without a single attack of catarrh lieutenant procope proceeded to impart to the count his anxiety about the situation of his yacht he pointed out that by the constant superposition of new deposits of ice the vessel would be elevated to a great height and consequently in the event of a thaw it must be exposed to a calamity similar to those which in polar seas cause destruction to so many whalers there was no time now for concerting measures offhand to prevent the disaster for the other mem bers of the party had already reached the spot where the hansa lay bound in her icy trammels a flight of steps recently hewn by hakkabut himself gave access for the present to the gangway but it was evident that some different contrivance would have to be resorted to when the tartan should be elevated perhaps to a hundred feet a thin curl of blue smoke issued from the copper funnel that projected above the mass of snow which had accumulated upon the deck of the hansa the owner was sparing of his fuel and it was only the nonconducting layer of ice enveloping the tartan that rendered the internal temperature endurable hi old nebuchadnezzar where are you shouted ben zoof at the full strength of his lungs at the sound of his voice the cabin door opened and the jews head and shoulders protruded onto the deck chapter vi money at a premium whos there i have nothing here for any one go away such was the inhospit able greeting with which isaac hakkabut received his visitors hakkabut do you take us for thieves asked servadac in tones of stern displeasure oh your excellency my lord i did not know that it was you whined the jew but without emerging any farther from his cabin now old hakkabut come out of your shell come and show the governor proper respect when he gives you the honor of his company cried ben zoof who by this time had clambered up on the deck after considerable hesitation but still keeping his hold upon the cabindoor the jew made up his mind to step outside what do you want he in quired timorously i want a word with you said servadac but i do not want to stand talking out here in the cold followed by the rest of the party he proceeded to mount the steps the jew trembled from head to foot but i cannot let you into my cabin i am a poor man i have nothing to give you he moaned piteously here he is laughed ben zoof contemptuously he is beginning his chapter of lamentations over again but standing out here will never do out of the way old hakkabut i say out of the way and without more ado he thrust the astonished jew to one side and opened the door of the cabin servadac however declined to enter until he had taken the pains to explain to the owner of the tartan that he had no intention of laying violent hands upon his property and that if the time should ever come that his cargo was in requisition for the common use he should receive a proper price for his goods the same as he would in europe europe indeed muttered the jew maliciously between his teeth european prices will not do for me i must have gallian pricesand of my own fixing too
