off on a comet down close to the dial are you quite sure that the needle touches the point yes look and see give it a little push please why becausebecause well because of what cried the orderly im patiently because i think perhapsi am not quite sure perhaps the scale is not quite correct the words were not uttered before the professor fierce as a tiger had rushed at the jew had seized him by the throat and was shaking him till he was black in the face help help screamed hakkabut i shall be strangled rascal consummate rascal thief villain the professor reiterated and continued to shake the jew furiously ben zoof looked on and laughed making no at tempt to interfere he had no sympathy with either of the two the sound of the scuffling however drew the attention of servadac who followed by his com panions hastened to the scene the combatants were soon parted what is the meaning of all this demanded the captain as soon as the professor had recovered his breath exhausted by his exertions he said the old repro bate the rascal has cheated us his scale is wrong he is a thief captain servadac looked sternly at hakkabut how is this hakkabut is this a fact no noyesno your excellency only he is a cheat a thief roared the excited as tronomer his weights deceive stop stop interposed servadac let us hear tell me hakkabut the scale lies it cheats it lies roared the irrepressible rosette tell me hakkabut i say repeated servadac the jew only kept on stammering yesnoi dont know but heedless of any interruption the professor continued false weights that confounded spring balance it gave a false result the mass was wrong the observations contradicted the calcula tions they were wrong she was out of place yes out of place entirely what cried servadac and procope in a breath out of place yes completely said the professor gallia out of place repeated servadac agitated with alarm i did not say gallia replied rosette stamping his foot impetuously i said nerina oh nerina answered servadac but what of gallia he inquired still nervously gallia of course is on her way to the earth i told you so but that jew is a rascal chapter xv a journey and a disappointment it was as the professor had said from the day that isaac hakkabut had entered upon his mei cantile career his dealings had all been carried on by a system of false weight that deceitful spring balance had been the mainspring of his for tune but when it had become his lot to be the pur chaser instead of the vendor his spirit had groaned within him at being compelled to reap the fruits of his own dishonesty no one who had studied his character could be much surprised at the confession that was extorted from him that for every sup posed kilogram that he had ever sold the true weight was only grams or just five and twenty per cent less than it ought to have been the professor however had ascertained all that he wanted to know by estimating his comet at a third as much again as its proper weight he had found that his calculations were always at variance with the observed situation of the satellite which was immediately influenced by the mass of its primary but now besides enjoying the satisfaction of having punished old hakkabut rosette was able to recommence his calculations with reference to the elements of nerina upon a correct basis a task too which he devoted himself with redoubled energy it will be easily imagined that isaac hakkabut thus caught in his own trap was jeered most un mercifully by those whom he had attempted to make his dupes ben zoof in particular was never wearied of telling him how on his return to the world he would be prosecuted for using false weights and would certainly become acquainted with the inside of a prison thus badgered he secluded himself more than ever in his dismal hole never venturing except when absolutely obliged to face the other members of the community on the th of october the comet reentered the zone of the telescopic planets one of which had been captured as a satellite and the origin of the whole of which is most probably correctly attributed to the disintegration of some large planet that for merly revolved between the orbits of mars and jupiter by the beginning of the following month half of this zone had been traversed and only two months remained before the collision with the earth was to be expected the temperature was now rare ly below ì§¸ below zero but that was far too cold to permit the slightest symptoms of a thaw the surface of the sea remained as frozen as ever and the two vessels high up on their icy pedestals re mained unaltered in their critical position it was about this time that the question began to be mooted whether it would not be right to reopen some communication with the englishmen at gi braltar not that any doubt was entertained as to their having been able successfully to cope with the rigors of the winter but captain servadac in a way that did honor to his generosity represented that however uncourteous might have been their former behavior it was at least due to them that they should be informed of the true condition of things which they had no opportunity of learning and moreover that they should be invited to co operate with the population of ninas hive in the event of any measures being suggested by which the shock of the approaching collision could be mitigated the count and the lieutenant both heartily con curred in servadacs sentiments of humanity and prudence and all agreed that if the intercourse were to be opened at all no time could be so suitable as the present while the surface of the sea presented
