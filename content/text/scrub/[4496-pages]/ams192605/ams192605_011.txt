 amazing stories very probably i replied not to contradict him let us see into the matter continued my uncle here you see we have a series of one hundred and thirtytwo letters apparently thrown pellmell upon paper without method or organization there are words which are composed wholly of consonants such as mrnlls others which are nearly all vowels the fifth for instance which is unteief and one of the last oseibo this appears an extraordinary com bination probably we shall find that the phrase is arranged according to some mathematical plan no doubt a certain sentence has been written out and then jumbled upsome plan to which some figure is the clue now harry to show your english witwhat is that figure i could give him no hint my thoughts were indeed far away while he was speaking i had caught sight of a portrait of my cousin gretchen and was wondering when she would return we were affianced and loved one another very sincerely but my uncle who never thought of such sublunary mat ters knew nothing of this without noticing my abstraction the professor began reading the puz zling cryptograph all sorts of ways according to some theory of his own presently rousing my wandering attention he dictated one precious at tempt to me i mildly handed it over to him it read as follows messunkasenraicefdoksegnittamurtn ecertserretterotaivsaduaednecsedsadne lacartniiilujsiratracsarbmutabiledmek meretarcsilucoisleffensni i could scarcely keep from laughing while my uncle on the contrary got into a towering passion struck the table with his fist darted out of the room out of the house and then taking to his heels was presently lost to sight chapter iii an astounding discovery what is the matter cried the cook en tering the room when will master have his dinner never and his supper i dont know he says he will eat no more neither shall i my uncle has determined to fast and make me fast until he reads this abominable inscription i replied you will be starved to death she said i was very much of the same opinion but not liking to say so sent her away and began some of my usual work of classification but busy as i made myself nothing could keep me from thinking al ternately of the stupid manuscript and of the pretty gretchen several times i was tempted to go out but my uncle would have been angry at my absence at the end of an hour my allotted task was done how to pass the time i began by lighting my pipe like all other students i delighted in tobacco and seating myself in the great armchair i began to meditate where was my uncle i could easily imagine him tearing along some solitary road gesticulating talking to himself cutting the air with his cane and still thinking of the absurd bit of hieroglyphics would he hit upon some clue would he come home in better humor while these thoughts were passing through my brain i mechanically took up the execrable puzzle and tried every imaginable way of grouping the letters i put them together by twos by threes fours and fivesin vain nothing intelligible came out except that the fourteenth fifteenth and sixteenth made ice in english the eightyfourth eightyfifth and eightysixth the word sir then at last i seemed to find the latin words rota mzitabile ira nee atra ha there seems to be some truth in my uncles notion thought i then again i seemed to find the word luco which means sacred grove then in the third line i ap peared to make out labiled a perfect hebrew word and at last the syllables măšre art mer which were french it was enough to drive one mad four different idioms in this absurd phrase what con nection could there be between ice sir anger cruel sacred grove changing mother art and sea the first and the last might in a sentence connected with iceland mean sea of ice but what of the rest of this monstrous cryptograph i was in fact fighting against an insurmountable difficulty my brain was almost on fire my eyes were strained with staring at the parchment the whole absurd collection of letters appeared to dance before my vision in a number of black little groups my mind was possessed with temporary hallucina tioni was stifling i wanted air mechanically i fanned myself with the document of which i saw first the back and then the front imagine my surprise when glancing at the back of the wearisome puzzle the ink having gone through i clearly made out latin words and among others craterem and terrestre i had discovered the secret it came upon me like a flash of lightning i had got the clue all you had to do to understand the document was to read it backwards all the ingenious ideas of the professor were realized he had dictated it rightly to me by a mere accident i had discovered what he so much desired my delight my emotion may be imagined my eyes were dazzled and i trembled so that at first i could make nothing of it one look however would tell me all i wished to know let me read i said to myself after drawing a long breath i spread it before me on the table i passed my finger over each letter i spelt it through in my excitement i read it out what horror and stupefaction took possession of my soul i was like a man who had received a knockdown blow was it possible that i really read the terrible secret and it had really been ac complished a man had dared to dowhat no living being should ever know never cried i jumping up never shall my uncle be made aware of the dread secret he would be quite capable of undertaking the terrible journey noth ing would check him nothing stop him worse he would compel me to accompany him and we should be lost forever no such folly and madness cannot be allowed i was almost beside myself with rage and fury my worthy uncle is already nearly mad i cried aloud this would finish him by some accident
