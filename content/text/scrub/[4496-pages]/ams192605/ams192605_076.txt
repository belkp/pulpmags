off on a comet have plenty of gold for the present we will leave the bank notes for by and by the jews counten ance brightened and servadac repeating that he should come again the next day was about to quit the vessel one moment your excellency said hakkabut sidling up with a hypocritical smile i suppose i am to fix my own prices you will of course charge ordinary prices proper market prices european prices i mean merciful heavens shrieked the old man you rob me of my rights you defraud me of my privilege the monopoly of the market belongs to me it is the custom it is my right it is my privilege to fix my own prices servadac made him understand that he had no intention of swerving from his decision merciful heavens again howled the jew it is sheer ruin the time of monopoly is the time for profit it is the time for speculation the very thing hakkabut that i am anxious to prevent just stop now and think a minute you seem to forget my rights you are forgetting that if i please i can confiscate all your cargo for the common use you ought to think yourself lucky in getting any price at all be contented with euro pean prices you will get no more i am not going to waste my breath on you i will come again to morrow and without allowing hakkabut time to renew his lamentations servadac went away all the rest of the day the jew was muttering bitter curses against the thieves of gentiles in gen eral and the governor of gallia in particular who were robbing him of his just profits by binding him down to a maximum price for his goods just as if it were a time of revolution in the state but he would be even with them yet he would have it all out of them he would make european prices pay after all he had a planhe knew how and he chuckled to himself and grinned maliciously true to his word the captain next morning ar rived at the tartan he was accompanied by ben zoof and two russian sailors goodmorning old eleazar we have come to do our little bit of friend ly business with you you know was ben zoofs greeting what do you want today asked the jew today we want coffee and we want sugar and we want tobacco we must have ten kilograms of each take care they are all good all first rate i am commissariat officer and i am responsible i thought you were the governors aidede camp said hakkabut so i am on state occasions but today i tell you i am superintendent of the commissariat de partment now look sharp hakkabut hereupon descended into the hold of the tartan and soon returned carrying ten packets of tobacco each weighing one kilogram and secure ly fastened by strips of paper labeled with the french government stamp ten kilograms of tobacco at twelve francs a kilogram a hundred and twenty francs said the jew ben zoof was on the point of laying down the money when servadac stopped him let us just see whether the weight is correct hakkabut pointed out that the weight was duly registered on every packet and that the packets had never been unfastened the captain however had his own special object in view and would not be diverted the jew fetched his spring balance and a packet of the tobacco was suspended to it merciful heavens screamed isaac the index registered only grams you see hakkabut i was right i was per fectly justified in having your goods put to the test said servadac quite seriously butbut your excellency stammered out the bewildered man you will of course make up the deficiency the captain continued not noticing the interruption oh my lord let me say began isaac again come come old caiaphas do you hear you are to make up the deficiency exclaimed ben zoof ah yes yes but the unfortunate israelite tried hard to speak but his agitation prevented him he understood well enough the cause of the phenomenon but he was overpowered by the conviction that the cursed gen tiles wanted to cheat him he deeply regretted that he had not a pair of common scales on board come i say old jedediah you are a long while making up whats short said ben zoof while the jew was still stammering on as soon as he recovered his power of articulation isaac began to pour out a medley of lamentations and petitions for mercy the captain was inexor able very sorry you know hakkabut it is not my fault that the packet is short weight but i cannot pay for a kilogram unless i have a kilogram hakkabut pleaded for some consideration a bargain is a bargain said servadac you must complete your contract and moaning and groaning the miserable man was driven to make up the full weight as registered by his own scale he had to repeat the process with the sugar and coffee for every kilogram he had to weigh seven ben zoof and the russians jeered him most unmercifully i say old mordecai wouldnt you rather give your goods away than sell them at this rate i would i say old pilate a monopoly isnt always a good thing is it i say old sepharvaim what a flourishing trade youre driving meanwhile seventy kilograms of each of the articles required were weighed and the jew for each seventy had to take the price of ten all along captain servadac had been acting only in jest aware that old isaac was an utter hypocrite he had no compunction in turning a business trans action with him into an occasion for a bit of fun but the joke at an end he took care that the jew was properly paid all his legitimate due chapter x far into space a month passed away gallia continued its course bearing its little population onwards so far removed from the ordinary influence of human passions that it might almost be said that its sole
