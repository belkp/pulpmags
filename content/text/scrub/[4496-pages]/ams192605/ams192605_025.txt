 amazing stories to me as possible he never lost sight of me and on many occasions his arm supplied me with firm and solid support he was strong wiry and ap parently insensible to fatigue he had another great advantagethe innate sentiment of equilib riumfor he never slipped or failed in his steps the icelanders though heavily loaded climbed with the agility of mountaineers looking up every now and then at the height of the great volcano of sneffels it appeared to me impossible to reach the summit on that sideat least if the angle of inclination did not speedily change fortunately after an hour of difficult climbing and gymnastic exercises that would have been try ing to an acrobat we came to a vast field of ice which completely surrounded the bottom of the cone of the volcano the natives called it the tablecloth probably for some such reason as the dwellers in the cape of good hope call their mountain table mountain and their anchorage or roads table bay here to our mutual surprise we found an actual flight of stone steps which considerably assisted our ascent this singular flight of stairs was like everything else volcanic it had been formed by one of those torrents of stones cast up by the eruptions of which the icelandic name is stinì°½ if this singular torrent had not been checked in its descent by the peculiar shape of the flanks of the mountain it would have swept into the sea and formed new islands such as it was it served us admirably the abrupt character of the slopes momentarily in creased but these remarkable stone steps a little less difficult than those of the egyptian pyramids were the one simple natural means by which we were enabled to proceed about seven in the evening of that day after having clambered up two thousand of these rough steps we found ourselves overlooking a kind of spur or projection of the mountainlike a buttress upon which the conelike crater properly so called leaned for support the ocean lay beneath us at a depth of more than three thousand two hundred feeta grand and mighty spectacle we had reached the region of eternal snows the cold was keen searching and intense the wind blew with extraordinary violence i was utterly exhausted my worthy uncle the professor saw clearly that my legs refused further service and that in fact i was utterly exhausted despite his hot and feverish impatience he decided with a sigh upon a halt he called the eiderduck hunter to his side that worthy however shook his head ofvanfor was his sole spoken reply it appears says my uncle with a woebegone look that we must go higher he then turned to hans and asked him to give some reason for this decisive response mistour replied the guide ja mistouryes the mistour cried one of the icelandic guides in a terrified tone it was the first time he had spoken what does this mysterious word signify i anxiously inquired look said my uncle i looked down upon the plain below and i saw a vast prodigious volume of pulverized pumicestone of sand of dust rising to the heavens in the form of a mighty waterspout it resembled the fearful phenomenon of a similar character known to the travelers in the desert of the great sahara the wind was driving it directly towards that side of sneffels on which we were perched this opaque veil standing up between us and the sun projected a deep shadow on the flanks of the moun tain if this sandspout broke over us we must all be completely destroyed crushed in its fearful embraces this extraordinary phenomenon very common when the wind shakes the glaciers and sweeps over the arid plains is in the icelandic tongue called mistour hastigt hastigt cried our guide now i certainly knew nothing of danish but i thoroughly understood that his gestures were meant to hurry us the guide turned rapidly in a direction which would take us to the back of the crater all the while ascending slightly we followed rapidly despite our excessive fatigue a quarter of an hour later hans paused to en able us to look back the mighty whirlwind of sand was spreading up the slope of the mountain to the very spot where we had proposed to halt huge stones were caught up cast into the air and thrown about as during an eruption we were happily a little out of the direction of the wind and therefore out of reach of danger but for the precaution and knowledge of our guide our dis located bodies our crushed and broken limbs would have been cast to the wind like dust from some unknown meteor hans however did not think it prudent to pass the night on the bare side of the cone we therefore continued our journey in a zigzag direction the fifteen hundred feet which remained to be climbed took us at least five hours the turnings and wind ings the nothoroughfares the marches and marches turned that insignificant distance into at least three leagues i never felt such misery fatigue and exhaustion in my life i was ready to faint from hunger and cold at the same time the rarefied air acted painfully upon my lungs at last about eleven at night when i thought i was gasping my last breath we reached the sum mit of mount sneffels it was in an awful state of mind that despite my fatigue i paused to behold the sun rise at midnight on the very day of its lowest declension and enjoyed the spectacle of its ghastly pale rays cast upon the isle which lay sleep ing at our feet before i descended into the crater which was to shelter us for the night i no longer wondered at people traveling all the way from england to norway to behold this magi cal and wonderful spectacle chapter xiii the shadow of scartaris our supper was eaten with ease and rapidity after which everybody did the best he could for himself within the hollow of the crater the bed was hard the shelter unsatisfactory the sit uation painfullying in the open air feet above the level of the sea nevertheless very rarely did i sleep so well as i did that particular night i did not even dream so much for the effects of what my uncle called wholesome fatigue
