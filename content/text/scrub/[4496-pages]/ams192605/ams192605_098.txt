off on a comet gallian should survive to tell the tale of their strange peregrinations moments were precious but hector servadac re solved that he would adopt a device to secure that at least some record of their excursion in solar dis tances should survive themselves tearing a leaf from his notebook he wrote down the name of the comet the list of the fragments of the earth it had carried off the names of his com panions and the date of the comets aphelion and having subscribed it with his signature turned to nina and told her he must have the carrierpigeon which was nestling in her bosom the childs eyes filled with tears but she did not say a word and imprinting a kiss upon its soft plumage she surrendered it at once and the mes sage was hurriedly fastened to its neck the bird wheeled round and round in a few circles that wid ened in their diameter and quickly sunk to an al titude in the comets atmosphere much inferior to the balloon some minutes more were thus consumed and the interval of distance was reduced to less than miles the velocity became inconceivably great but the increased rate of motion was in no way perceptible there was nothing to disturb the equilibrium of the car in which they were making their aerial ad venture fortysix minutes announced the lieutenant the glowing expanse of the earths disc seemed like a vast funnel yawning to receive the comet and its atmosphere balloon and all into its open mouth fortyseven cried procope there was half a minute yet a thrill ran through every vein a vibration quivered through the at mosphere the balloon elongated to its utmost stretch was manifestly being sucked into a vortex every passenger in the quivering car involuntarily clung spasmodically to its sides and as the two at mospheres amalgamated clouds accumulated in heavy masses involving all around in dense obscur ity while flashes of lurid flame threw a weird glim mer on the scene in a mystery every one found himself upon the earth again they could not explain it but here they were once more upon terrestrial soil in a swoon they had left the earth and in a similar swoon they had come back of the balloon not a vestige remained and con trary to previous computation the comet had merely grazed the earth and was traversing the regions of space again far away chapter xix back again in algeria captain yes ben zoof in algeria and not far from mostaganem such were the first words which after their return to consciousness were exchanged between servadac and his orderly they had resided so long in the province that they could not for a moment be mistaken as to their whereabouts and although they were incapable of clearing up the mysteries that shrouded the miracle yet they were convinced at the first glance that they had been returned to the earth at the very identi cal spot where they had quitted it in fact they were scarcely more than a mile from mostaganem and in the course of an hour when they had all recovered from the bewilderment occa sioned by the shock they started off in a body and made their way to the town it was a matter of extreme surprise to find no symptom of the least excitement anywhere as they went along the popu lation was perfectly calm every one was pursuing his ordinary avocation the cattle were browsing quietly upon the pastures that were moist with the dew of an ordinary january morning it was about eight oclock the sun was rising in the east noth ing could be noticed to indicate that any abnormal incident had either transpired or been expected by the inhabitants as to a collision with a comet there was not the faintest trace of any such pheno menon crossing mens minds and awakening as it surely would a panic little short of the certified approach of the millennium nobody expects us said servadac that is very certain no indeed answered ben zoof with a sigh he was manifestly disappointed that his return to mos taganem was not welcomed with a triumphal re ception they reached the mascara gate the first per sons that servadac recognized were the two friends that he had invited to be his seconds in the duel two years ago the colonel of the nd fusiliers and the captain of the th artillery in return to his some what hesitating salutation the colonel greeted him heartily ah servadac old fellow is it you i myself said the captain where on earth have you been to all this time in the name of peace what have you been doing with yourself you would never believe me colonel answered servadac if i were to tell you so on that point i had better hold my tongue hang your mysteries said the colonel tell me where have you been no my friend excuse me replied servadac but shake hands with me in earnest that i may be sure i am not dreaming hector servadac had made up his mind and no amount of persuasion could induce him to divulge his incredible experi ences anxious to turn the subject servadac took the earliest opportunity of asking and what about madame de l madame de l exclaimed the colonel tak ing the words out of his mouth the lady is mar ried long ago you did not suppose that she was going to wait for you out of sight out of mind you know true replied servadac and turning to the count he said do you hear that we shall not have to fight our duel after all most happy to be excused rejoined the count the rivals took each other by the hand and were united henceforth in the bonds of a sincere and con fiding friendship an immense relief said servadac to himself that i have no occasion to finish that confounded rondo it was agreed between the captain and the count that it would be desirable in every way to maintain the most rigid silence upon the subject of the in explicable phenomena which had come within their
