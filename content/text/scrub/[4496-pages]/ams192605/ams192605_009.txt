 amazing stories peculiar humors very far from a pleasant com panion it is further necessary to observe that he lived in a very nice house in that very nice street the kรถnigstrasse in hamburg though lying in the center of a town it was perfectly rural in its aspect half wood half bricks with oldfashioned gables one of the few old houses spared by the great fire of when i say a nice house i mean a hand some houseold tottering and not exactly conform able to english notions a house a little off the perpendicular and inclined to fall into the neighbor ing canal exactly the house for a wandering artist to depict all the more that you could scarcely see it for ivy and a magnificent old tree which grew over the door my uncle was rich his house was his own prop erty and he had a considerable private income to my notion the best part of his possessions was his goddaughter gretchen who unfortunately was away upon a visit on that momentous day the old cook the young lady the professor and i were the only inmates of his home i loved mineralogy i loved geology to me there was nothing better than pebblesand if my uncle had been in a little less of a fury we should have been the happiest of families to prove the ex cellent hardwiggs impatience i solemnly declare that when the flowers in the drawingroom pots began to grow he rose every morning at four oclock to make them grow quicker by pulling the leaves having described my uncle i will now give an account of our interview he received me in his study a perfect museum containing every natural curiosity that can well be imaginedminerals how ever predominating every one was familiar to me having catalogued each by my own hand my uncle apparently oblivious of the fact that he had summoned me to his presence was absorbed in a book he was particularly fond of early editions tall copies and unique works wonderful he cried tapping his forehead wonderfulwonderful it was one of those yel lowleaved volumes now rarely found on stalls and to me it appeared to possess but little value my uncle however was in raptures he admired its binding the clearness of its characters the ease with which it opened in his hand and repeated aloud halfadozen times that it was very very old to my fancy he was making a great fuss about nothing but it was not my province to say so on the contrary i professed considerable interest in the subject and asked him what it was about it is the heimskringla of snorre sturlasson he said the celebrated icelandic author of the twelfth centuryit is a true and correct account of the nor wegian princes who reigned in iceland my next question related to the language in which it was written i hoped at all events it was translated into german my uncle was indignant at the very thought and declared he wouldnt give a penny for a translation his delight was to have found the original work in the icelandic tongue which he declared to be one of the most magnificent and yet simple idioms in the worldwhile at the same time its grammatical combinations were the most varied known to students about as easy as german was my insidious remark my uncle shrugged his shoulders the runic letters at all events i saidare rather difficult of comprehension it is a runic manuscript the language of the original population of iceland invented by odin himself cried my uncle angry at my ignorance i was about to venture upon some misplaced joke on the subject when a small scrap of parchment fell out of the leaves like a hungry man snatching at a morsel of bread the professor seized it it was about five inches by three and was scrawled over in the most extraordinary fashion the lines opening the next chapter are an exact facsimile of what was written on the venerable piece of parchmentand have wonderful importance as they induced my uncle to undertake the most won derful series of adventures which ever fell to the lot of human beings my uncle looked keenly at the document for some moments then declared that it was runic the letters were similar to those in the book but then what did they mean this was exactly what i wanted to know now as i had a strong conviction that the runic alphabet and dialect were simply an invention to mystify poor human nature i was delighted to find that my uncle knew as much about the matter as i didwhich was nothing at all events the tremulous motion of his fingers made me think so and yet he muttered to himself it is old icelandic i am sure of it my uncle ought to have known for he was a perfect polyglot dictionary in himself he did not pretend like a certain learned pundit to speak the two thousand languages and four thousand idioms made use of in different parts of the globe but he did know all the more important ones it is a matter of great doubt to me now to what violent measures my uncles impetuosity might have led him had not the clock struck two and our old french cook called out to let us know that dinner was on the table bother the dinner cried my uncle but i was hungry so i sallied forth to the diningroom where i took up my usual quarters out of politeness i waited three minutes but no sign of my uncle the professor i was surprised he was not usually so blind to the pleasure of a good dinner it was the acme of german luxuryparsley soup a ham omelette with sorrel trimmings veal stewed with prunes delicious fruit and sparkling moselle for the sake of poring over that musty old piece of parchment my uncle forbore to share our meal to satisfy my conscience i ate for both the old cook and housekeeper was nearly out of her mind after taking so much trouble to find that her master did not appear at dinner was a sad disappointmentwhich as she watched the havoc i was making on the viands became also alarm if my uncle were to come to table after all suddenly just as i had consumed the last apple and drunk the last glass of wine a terrible voice was heard at no great distance it was my uncle roaring for me to come to him i made it in very nearly one leapso loud so fierce was his tone
