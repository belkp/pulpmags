a trip to the center of the earth i bore it very well but my uncle to his great an noyance and even shame was remarkably seasick this mal de mer troubled him the more that it pre vented him from questioning captain bjarne as to the subject of sneffels as to the means of com munication and the facilities of transport all these explanations he had to adjourn to the period of his arrival his time meanwhile was spent lying in bed groaning and dwelling anxiously on the hopedfor termination of the voyage i did not pity him on the eleventh day we sighted cape portland over which towered mount myrdals yokul which the weather being clear we made out very readily the cape itself is nothing but a huge mount of granite standing naked and alone to meet the at lantic waves the valkyrie kept off the coast steer ing to the westward on all sides were to be seen whole schools of whales and sharks after some hours we came in sight of a solitary rock in the ocean forming a mighty vault around which the foaming waves poured with intense fury the islets of westman appeared to leap from the ocean being so low in the water as scarcely to be seen until you were right upon them from that moment the schooner was steered to the westward in order to round cape reykjaness the western point of iceland my uncle to his great disgust was unable even to crawl on deck so heavy a sea was on and thus lost the first view of the land of promise forty eight hours later after a storm which drove us far to sea under bare poles we came once more in sight of land and were boarded by a pilot who after three hours of dangerous navigation brought the schooner safely to an anchor in the bay of faxa before reykjawik my uncle came out of his cabin pale haggard thin but full of enthusiasm his eyes dilated with pleasure and satisfaction nearly the whole popula tion of the town was on foot to see us land the fact was that scarcely any one of them but ex pected some goods by the periodical vessel professor hardwigg was in haste to leave his prison or rather as he called it his hospital but before he attempted to do so he caught hold of my hand led me to the quarterdeck of the schooner took my arm with his left hand and pointed inland with his right over the northern part of the bay to where rose a high twopeaked mountaina double cone covered with eternal snow behold he whispered in an awestricken voice behold mount sneffels without further remark he put his finger to his lips frowned darkly and descended into the small boat which awaited us i followed and in a few minutes we stood upon the soil of mysterious iceland scarcely were we fairly on shore when there ap peared before us a man of excellent appearance wearing the costume of a military officer he was however but a civil servant a magistrate the gov ernor of the islandbaron trampe the professor knew whom he had to deal with he therefore handed him the letters from copenhagen and a brief conversation in danish followed to which i of course was a stranger and for a very good reason for i did not know the language in which they con versed i afterwards heard however that baron trampe placed himself entirely at the beck and call of professor hardwigg my uncle was also most graciously received by m finsen the mayor who as far as costume went was quite as military as the governor but also from character and occupation quite as pacific as for his coadjutor m pictursson he was absent on an episcopal visit to the northern portion of the diocese we were therefore compelled to defer the pleasure of being presented to him his absence however was compensated by the presence of m fridriksson professor of natural science in the college of reykjawik a man of invaluable ability this modest scholar spoke no languages save ice landic and latin when therefore he addressed himself to me in the language of horace we at once came to understand one another he was in fact the only person that i did thoroughly under stand during the whole period of my residence on this benighted island out of three rooms of which his house was com posed two were placed at our service and in a few hours we were installed with all our baggage the amount of which rather astonished the simple in habitants of reykjawik now harry said my uncle rubbing his hands all goes well the worst difficulty is now over how the worst difficulty over i cried in fresh amazement doubtless here we are in iceland nothing more remains but to descend into the bowels of the earth well sir to a certain extent you are right we have only to go downbut as far as i am con cerned that is not the question i want to know how we are to get up again that is the least part of the business and does not in any way trouble me in the meantime there is not an hour to lose i am about to visit the public library very likely i may find there some manuscripts from the hand of saknussem i shall be glad to consult them in the meanwhile i replied i will take a walk through the town will you not likewise do so i feel no interest in the subject said my uncle what for me is curious in this island is not what is above the surface but what is below i bowed by way of reply put on my hat and furred cloak and went out it was not an easy matter to lose onself in the two streets of reykjawik i had therefore no need to ask my way the town lies on a flat and marshy plain between two hills a vast field of lava skirts it on one side falling away in terraces towards the sea on the other hand is the large bay of faxa bordered on the north by the enormous glacier of sneffels in the bay the valkyrie was then the only vessel at anchor generally there were one or two english or french gunboats to watch and protect the fisheries in the offing however they were now absent on duty in three hours my tour was complete the gen eral impression upon my mind was sadness no trees no vegetation so to speakon all sides vol canic peaksthe huts of turf and earthmore like roofs than houses thanks to the heat of these residences grass grows on the roof which grass is carefully cut for hay i saw but few inhabitants during my excursion but i met a crowd on
