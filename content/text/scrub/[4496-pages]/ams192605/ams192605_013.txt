 amazing stories books about until at last utterly exhausted he fell into his armchair whats oclock he asked about three my dinner does not seem to have done me much good he observed let me have something to eat we can then start at once get my portmanteau ready what for and your own he continued we start at once my horror may be conceived i resolved how ever to show no fear scientific reasons were the only ones likely to influence my uncle and there were many against this terrible journey the very idea of going down to the center of the earth was simply absurd i determined therefore to argue the point after dinner my uncles rage was now directed against the cook for having no dinner ready my explanation however satisfied him and giving her the key she soon managed to get sufficient to satisfy our vora cious appetites during the repast my uncle was rather gay than otherwise he made some of those peculiar jokes which belong exclusively to the learned as soon however as dessert was over he called me to his study we each took a chair on opposite sides of the table henry he said in a soft and winning voice i have always believed you ingenious and you have rendered me a service never to be forgotten without you this great this wondrous discovery would never have been made it is my duty therefore to insist on your sharing the glory he is in a good humor thought i ill soon let him know my opinion of glory in the first place he continued you must keep the whole affair a profound secret there is no more envious race of men than scientific dis coverers many would start on the same journey at all events we will be the first in the field i doubt your having many competitors was my reply a man of real scientific acquirements would be delighted at the chance we should find a perfect stream of pilgrims on the traces of arne sak nussem if this document were once made public but my dear sir is not this paper very likely to be a hoax i urged the book in which we find it is sufficient proof of its authenticity he replied i thoroughly allow that the celebrated professor wrote the line but only i believe as a kind of mystification was my answer scarcely were the words out of my mouth when i was sorry i had uttered them my uncle looked at me with a dark and gloomy scowl and i began to be alarmed for the results of our conversation his mood soon changed however and a smile took the place of a frown we shall see he remarked with a decisive emphasis but see what is all this about yokul and sneffels and this scartaris i have never heard anything about them the very point to which i am coming i lately received from my friend augustus peterman of leipzig a map take down the third atlas from the second shelf series z plate i rose went to the shelf and presently returned with the volume indicated this said my uncle is one of the best maps of iceland i believe it will settle all your doubts difficulties and objections with a grim hope to the contrary i stooped over the map chapter iv we start on the journey you see the whole island is made up of volca noessaid the professor and note that they all bear the name of yokul the word is ice landic and means glacier in most of the lofty moun tains of that region the volcanic eruptions come forth from icebound caverns hence the name ap plied to every volcano on this extraordinary island but what does this word sneffels mean to this question i expected no rational answer i was mistaken follow my finger to the western coast of iceland there you see reykjawik its capital follow the direction of one of its innumer able fjords or arms of the sea and what do you see below the sixtyfifth degree of latitude a peninsulavery like a thighbone in shape and in the center of it a mountain well thats sneffels i had nothing to say that is sneffelsa mountain about five thou sand feet in height one of the most remarkable in the whole island and certainly doomed to be the most celebrated in the world for through its crater we shall reach the center of the earth impossible cried i startled and shocked at the thought why impossible said professor hardwigg in his severest tones because its crater is choked with lava by burn ing rocksby infinite dangers but if it be extinct that would make a difference of course it would there are about three hun dred volcanoes on the whole surface of the globe but the greater number are extinct of these sneffels is one no eruption has occurred since in fact it has ceased to be a volcano at all after this what more could i say yesi thought of another objection but what is all this about scartaris and the kalends of july my uncle reflected deeply presently he gave forth the result of his reflections in a sententious tone what appears obscure to you to me is light this very phrase shows how particular saknussem is in his directions the sneffels mountain has many craters he is careful therefore to point out the exact one which is the highway into the interior of the earth he lets us know for this purpose that about the end of the month of june the shadow of mount scartaris falls upon the one crater there can be no doubt about the matter my uncle had an answer for everything i ac cept all your explanations i said and saknussem is right he found out the entrance to the bowels of the earth he has indicated correctly but that he or anyone else ever followed up the discovery is madness to suppose why so young man
