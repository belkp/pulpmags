 amazing stories in the dark on another occasion a vast thing that mr cave thought at first was some gigantic insect appeared advancing along the causeway beside the canal with extraordinary rapidity as this drew nearer mr cave perceived that it was a mechanism of shining metals and of extraordinary complexity and when he looked again it had disappeared after a time mr wace aspired to attract the attention of the martians and the next time that the strange eyes of one of them appeared close to the crystal mr cave cried out and sprang away and they immediately turned on the light and began to gesticulate in a manner suggestive of signalling but when at last mr cave examined the crystal again the martian had departed these observations had progressed thus far in early november and then mr cave feeling that the suspicions of his family about the crystal were allayed began to take it to and fro with him in order that as occasion arose in the daytime or night he might comfort himself with what was fast becoming the most real thing in his existence in december mr waces work in connection with a forthcoming examination became heavy the sit tings were reluctantly suspended for a week and for ten or eleven dayshe is not quite sure which he saw nothing of cave he then grew anxious to resume these investigations and the stress of his seasonal labors being abated he went down to seven dials at the corner he noticed a shutter before a bird fanciers window and then another at a cobblers mr caves shop was closed he rapped and the door was opened by the step son in black he at once called mrs cave who was mr wace could not but observe in cheap but ample widows weeds of the most imposing pattern with out any very great surprise mr wace learned that cave was dead and already buried she was in tears and her voice was a little thick she had just re turned from highgate her mind seemed occupied with her own prospects and the honorable details of the obsequies but mr wace was at last able to learn the particulars of mr caves death he had been found dead in his shop in the early morning the day after his last visit to mr wace and the crystal had been clasped in his stonecold hands his face was smiling said mrs cave and the velvet cloth from the minerals lay on the floor at his feet he must have been dead five or six hours when he was found this came as a great shock to wace and he began to reproach himself bitterly for having neg lected the plain symptoms of the old mans illhealth but his chief thought was of the crystal he ap proached that topic in a gingerly manner because he knew mrs caves peculiarities he was dumb founded to learn that it was sold mrs caves first impulse directly caves body had been taken upstairs had been to write to the mad clergyman who had offered five pounds for the crystal informing him of its recovery but after a violent hunt in which her daughter joined her they were convinced of the loss of his address as they were without the means required to mourn and bury cave in the elaborate style the dignity of an old seven dials inhabitant demands they had ap pealed to a friendly fellowtradesman in great port land street he had very kindly taken over a por tion of the stock at a valuation the valuation was his own and the crystal egg was included in one of the lots mr wace after a few suitable consolatory observations a little offhandedly proffered perhaps hurried at once to great portland street but there he learned that the crystal egg had already been sold to a tall dark man in grey and there the material facts in this curious and to me at least very sug gestive story come abruptly to and end for a time mr wace remained in the shop trying the dealers patience with hopeless questions venting his own exasperation and at last realizing abruptly that the whole thing had passed out of his hands had vanished like a vision of the night he returned to his own rooms a little astonished to find the notes he had made still tangible and visible upon his un tidy table his annoyance and disappointment were naturally very great he made a second call equally ineffec tual upon the great portland street dealer and he resorted to advertisements in such periodicals as were likely to come into the hands of a bricabrac collector he also wrote letters to the daily chronicle and nature but both these periodicals suspecting a hoax asked him to reconsider his action before they printed and he was advised that such a strange story unfortunately so bare of sup porting evidence might imperil his reputation as an investigator moreover the calls of his proper work were urgent so that after a month or so save for an occasional reminder to certain dealers he had reluctantly to abandon the quest for the crystal egg and from that day to this it remains undiscovered occasionally however he tells me and i can quite believe him he has bursts of zeal in which he aban dons his more urgent occupation and resumes the search whether or not it will remain lost for ever with the material and origin of it are things equally speculative at the present time if the present pur chaser is a collector one would have expected the enquiries of mr wace to have reached him through the dealers he has been able to discover mr caves clergyman and orientalno other than the rev james parker and the young prince of bossokuni in java i am obliged to them for certain par ticulars the object of the prince was simply curi osityand extravagance he was so eager to buy because cave was so oddly reluctant to sell it is just possible that the buyer in the second instance was simply a casual purchaser and not a collector at all and the crystal egg for all i know may at the present moment be within a mile of me decorating a drawing room or serving as a paperweightits remarkable functions all unknown indeed it is partly with the idea of such a possibility that i have thrown this narrative into a form that will give it a chance of being read by the ordinary consumer of fiction my own ideas in the matter are practically identi cal with those of mr wace i believe the crystal on the mast in mars and the crystal egg of mr caves to be in some physical but at present quite inexplicable way en rapport and we both believed further that the terrestrial crystal must have been possibly at some remote datesent hither from that planet in order to give the martians a near view of our affairs possibly the fellows to the crystals in the other masts are also on our globe no theory of hallucination suffices for the facts
