 amazing stories leave that world perhaps if i had spent all those weeks in the open air and with vinda perhaps but there is no perhaps i can only know facts and it is a fact that i left her and that i loved herlove her yet we came to the fields upon which i had landed there i put on my suit with feverish haste as though afraid lest it melt away under my hands i adjusted the machine and the chronometer upon it with vindas aid and then isolated in a profound silence within my glass globe i stood waiting for the hour at which i must begin my journey it seemed to me that endless hours passed while i stood there in keen impatience with the two curious guards watching me at the last quarterhour vinda suddenly turned and went behind the ma chine where i could not see her but i was too busily watching the face of my wristwatch to see her in any case at last the moment came i smiled a homeric smile and waved my hand at the two guards as i pressed the top button while they gave me one last stolid glance and hurried to the machine i began with the usual dizziness to grow with closed eyes as the tingling electric flash shot through my veins when a moment later these sensations had passed away and i opened my eyes i had already grown to thirty feet or so as i looked down i saw vinda struggling between the two guards who evidently held her back from a dangerous proximity to my swiftly enlarging feet i wondered what she wanted and i felt a sudden regret that i had not been able to tell her goodbye i was half inclined to stop my growth for a few minutes but instead i knelt down far enough away from her for safety and i smiled waving my arm like some huge clumsy ridiculous giant she stiffened and ceased her struggles for a moment she stared at me with an expression nearer anger i thought than anything else then suddenly she turned and walked swiftly to the machine followed by her guards while i climbed unsteadily back upon my feet againal ready nearly eighty feet high a moment later the plane rose from the ground and darted away toward the sea for a long time i followed its flight until i had pushed up through the clouds and lost it it certainly is not necessary to detail my return for in every respect it was like the first journey for a long impatient monotonous time i grew larger and larger fortunately it was not neces sary to go beyond the limits of the nuclei as by now i was determined to call them there at a certain time i pressed the middle button and stopped then i pushed the bottom button and the last stage of my return was under way i came back to the earth without accident it was the twentythird day of may in the year that i arrived as vinda had foretold that year was quite correspondent with the year of the cycle during which i had left i came down un fortunately enough in the sahara desert but not far from a settlement i need not describe the difficulties i encountered in securing my passage back to new york i arrived of course without a cent and without even a stitch of clothing besides the suit which i discarded at the earliest oppor tunity in favor of a wretched tatter of rags which left me almost as naked as i would have been with out it had it not been for the generosity af a cer tain consul who fed and clothed me and bought me my passage i should no doubt be wandering around the sahara yet carrying on my back a machine with which one can overcome time and size and space on the day that i arrived in new york i went at once to martyns laboratory i was amazed to find it deserted i was absolutely at a loss for his name was not in the telephone directory in despera tion i called at the office of a newspaper you will all recall what happened to martyn of course but to me it was a most horrible and disgusting mis takeimprisoned for manslaughter they had ac cused him of murdering me the poor man had realized when i failed to return the hideous mis take he made in forgetting that size would affect the relative length of time he had explained this explained the whole story and it caused a terrible sensation it seems that laws were enacted all over the country for the restraint of scientists who were said to constitute the greatest menace to our country since the civil war needless to say my reappearance has created a far more terrible sensation this time however it is hoped that it will take the form of a reaction in favour of the scientists my dramatic clearing of martyns name from any suggestion of blame has fired the imaginationsuch as it isof the people of course i must remember difficult as it is some times that the kirby who left the world of this cycle is not the kirby who has returned i have to think of another person my double in appearance life and name who is now wandering about the universe watching with amazement the strange formations of the stars crashing about that huge beach far up there in the illimitable void or seeing with a sudden rush of despair all the terribly dis tinct details of his fate yes i can sympathize with that brother of mine the world has changed in many details since i knew it in the last cycle for instance the america i knew was a republic still whereas now you know that it is the monarchy which was declared by theo dore roosevelt during the great war of and which is now ruled by the emporer theodore ii in spite of this and many other things however the world is not materially different from the world i left those who are interested in the changes will do well to read the book which i am preparing in collaboration with martyn who at last has come into his own on the journey which i have recounted only generally here tomorrow morning i leave this earth perhaps for the last time you who have read this at tentively must realize by now the love which all unsuspectingly i felt for vinda after a few months here i soon realized the terrible mistake i had made for i am sure that she loved me as well during the last few years my longing for her has grown more unbearably great with every hour and i can not remain here any longer tomorrow martyn will accompany me for the last time to that laboratory in the country which was the beginning of all my fantastic adventures he will say goodbye again a final goodbye this time and he will adjust about me the suit the globe and the machines i will press the top button the top button and thenonly a few hours until i see vinda again
