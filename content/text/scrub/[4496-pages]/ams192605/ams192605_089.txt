 amazing stories a smooth and solid footing after a thaw should set in neither the yacht nor the tartan could be reck oned on for service and it would be inexpedient to make use of the steam launch for which only a few tons of coal had been reserved just sufficient to convey them to gourbi island when the occasion should arise as to the yawl which transformed into a sledge had performed so successful a trip to formentera the absence of wind would make that quite unavailable it was true that with the return of summer temperature there would be certain to be a derangement in the atmosphere of gallia which would result in wind but for the present the air was altogether too still for the yawl to have any prospects of making its way to gibraltar the only question remaining was the possibility of going on foot the distance was somewhere about miles captain servadac declared himself quite equal to the undertaking to skate sixty or seventy miles a day would be nothing he said to a practiced skater like himself the whole journey there and back might be performed in eight days provided with a compass a sufficient supply of cold meat and a spirit lamp by which he might boil his coffee he was perfectly sure he should without the least diffi culty accomplish an enterprise that chimed in so exactly with his adventurous spirit equally urgent were both the count and the lieu tenant to be allowed to accompany him nay they even offered to go instead but servadac expressing himself as most grateful for their consideration de clined their offer and avowed his resolution of tak ing no other companion than his own orderly highly delighted at his masters decision ben zoof expressed his satisfaction at the prospect of stretching his legs a bit declaring that nothing could induce him to permit the captain to go alone there was no delay the departure was fixed for the following morning the nd of november although it is not to be questioned that a genuine desire of doing an act of kindness to his fellow creatures was a leading motive of servadacs pro posed visit to gibraltar it must be owned that an other idea confided to nobody least of all to count timascheff had been conceived in the brain of the worthy gascon ben zoof had an inkling that his master was up to some other little game when just before starting he asked him privately whether there was a french tricolor among the stores i be lieve so said the orderly then dont say a word to anyone but fasten it up tight in your knapsack ben zoof found the flag and folded it up as he was directed before proceeding to explain this somewhat enigmatical conduct of servadac it is necessary to refer to a certain physiological fact coincident but unconnected with celestial pheno mena originating entirely in the frailty of human nature the nearer that gallia approached the earth the more a sort of reserve began to spring up be tween the captain and count timascheff though they could not be said to be conscious of it the remembrance of their former rivalry so completely buried in oblivion for the last year and ten months was insensibly recovering its hold upon their minds and the question was all but coming to the surface as to what would happen if on their return to earth the handsome madame de lshould still be free from companions in peril would they not again be avowed rivals conceal it as they would a coolness was undeniably stealing over an intimacy which though it could never be called affectionate had been uniformly friendly and courteous under these circumstances it was not surprising that hector servadac should not have confided to the count a project which wild as it was could scarcely have failed to widen the unacknowledged breach that was opening in their friendship the project was the annexation of ceuta to the french dominion the englishmen rightly enough had continued to occupy the fragment of gibraltar and their claim was indisputable but the island of ceuta which before the shock had commanded the opposite side of the strait and had been occupied by spaniards had since been abandoned and was therefore free to the first occupant who should lay claim to it to plant the tricolor upon it in the name of france was now the cherished wish of servadacs heart who knows he said to himself whether ceuta on its return to earth may not occupy a grand and commanding situation what a proud thing it would be to have secured its possesson to france next morning as soon as they had taken their brief farewell of their friends and were fairly out of sight of the shore servadac imparted his design to ben zoof who entered into the project with the greatest zest and expressed himself delighted not only at the prospect of adding to the dominions of his beloved country but of stealing a march upon england both travelers were warmly clad the orderlys knapsack containing all the necessary provisions the journey was accomplished without special in cident halts were made at regular intervals for the purpose of taking food and rest the temperature by night as well as by day was quite endurable and on the fourth afternoon after starting thanks to the straight course which their compass enabled them to maintain the adventurers found themselves within a few miles of ceuta as soon as ben zoof caught sight of the rock on the western horizon he was all excitement just as if he were in a regiment going into action he talked wildly about columns and squares and charges the captain although less demonstra tive was hardly less eager to reach the rock they both pushed forward with all possible speed till they were within a mile and a half of the shore when ben zoof who had a very keen vision stopped sud denly and said that he was sure he could see some thing moving on top of the island never mind let us hasten on said servadac a few minutes carried them over another mile when ben zoof stopped again what is it ben zoof asked the captain it looks to me like a man on a rock waving his arms in the air said the orderly plague on it muttered servadac i hope we are not too late again they went on but soon ben zoof stopped for the third time it is a semaphore sir i see it quite distinctly and he was not mistaken it had been a telegraph in motion that had caught his eye plague on it repeated the captain too late sir do you think said ben zoof yes ben zoof if thats a telegraphand there is no doubt of itsomebody has been before us and
