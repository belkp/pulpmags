 amazing stories having suffered so little from such a formidable concussion i account for it in this way answered rosette the earth was traveling at the rate of leagues an hour and gallia at the rate of leagues an hour therefore the result was the same as though a train rushing along at a speed of about leagues an hour had suddenly en countered some obstacle the nucleus of the comet being excessively hard has done exactly what a ball would do fired with that velocity close to a pane of glass it has crossed the earth without cracking it it is possible you may be right said servadac thoughtfully right of course i am right replied the snap pish professor soon recovering his equanimity however he continued it is fortunate that the earth was only touched obliquely if the comet had impinged perpendicularly it must have plowed its way deep below the surface and the disasters it might have caused are beyond reckoning per haps he added with a smile even montmartre might not have survived the calamity sir shouted ben zoof quite unable to bear the unprovoked attack quiet ben zoof said servadac sternly fortunately for the sake of peace isaac hakka but who at length was beginning to realize some thing of the true condition of things came forward at this moment and in a voice trembling with eager ness implored the professor to tell him when they would all be back again upon the earth are you in a great hurry asked the professor coolly the jew was about to speak again when captain servadac interposed allow me to say that in somewhat more scientific terms i was about to ask you the same question did i not understand you to say that as the consequence of the collision the character of the comets orbit has been changed you did sir did you imply that the orbit has ceased to be a parabola just so is it then an hyperbola and are we to be car ried on far and away into remote distance and never never return i did not say an hyperbola and is it not it is not then it must be an ellipse yes and does its plane coincide with the plane of the earth yes then it must be a periodic comet it is servadac involuntarily raised a ringing shout of joy that echoed again along the gallery yes continued the professor gallia is a peri odic comet and allowing for the perturbations to which it is liable from the attraction of mars and jupiter and saturn it will return to the earth again in two years precisely you mean that in two years after the first shock gallio will meet the earth at the same point at which they met before said lieutenant procope i am afraid so said rosette afraid so why afraid of such a meeting because we are doing exceedingly well as we are the professor stamped his foot upon the ground by way of emphasis and added if i had my will gallia should never return to the earth again chapter iv a revised calendar all previous hypotheses were now forgotten in the presence of the one great fact that gal lia was a comet and gravitating through re mote solar regions captain servadac became aware that the huge disc that had been looming through the clouds after the shock was the retreating earth to the proximity of which the one high tide they had experienced was also to be attributed as to the fulfillment of the professors predic tion of an ultimate return to the terrestrial sphere that was a point on which it must be owned that the captain after the first flush of his excitement was over was not without many misgivings the next day or two were spent in providing for the accommodation of the newcomer fortunately his desires were very moderate he seemed to live among the stars and as long as he was well provided with coffee he cared little for luxuries and paid little or no regard to the ingenuity with which all the internal arrangements of ninas hive had been devised anxious to show all proper respect to his former tutor servadac proposed to put the most comfortable apartment of the place at his disposal but the professor resolutely declined to occupy it saying that what he required was a small chamber no matter how small provided that it was elevated and secluded so that he could use it as an observa tory where he might continue his studies without disturbance a general search was instituted and before long they were lucky enough to find about a hundred feet above the central grotto a small re cess or cave hollowed as it were in the mountain side which would exactly answer their purpose it contained room enough for a bed a table an arm chair a chest of drawers and what was of still more consequence for the indispensable telescope one small stream of lava an offshoot of the great torrent sufficed to keep the apartment warm in these retired quarters the astronomer took up his abode it was on all hands acknowledged to be advisable to let him go on entirely in his own way his meals were taken to him at stated intervals he slept but little carried on his calculations by day his observations by night and very rarely made his appearance amongst the rest of the little com munity the cold now became very intense the thermome ter registering ì§¸ c below zero the mercury however never exhibited any of those fluctuations that are ever and again to be observed in variable climates but continued slowly and steadily to fall and in all probability would continue to do so un til it reached the normal temperature of the regions of outlying space this steady sinking of the mercury was accom panied by a complete stillness of the atmosphere the very air seemed to be congealed no particle of it stirred from zenith to horizon there was never a cloud neither were there any of the damp mists or
