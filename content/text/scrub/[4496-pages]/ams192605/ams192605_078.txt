off on a comet rotation and revolves at a distance of miles another most important contribution to the magnificence of the nights upon saturn is the triple ring with which as a brilliant setting the planet is encompassed to an observer at the equator this ring which has been estimated by sir william herschel as scarcely miles in thickness must have the appearance of a narrow band of light pass ing through the zenith miles above his head as the observer however increases his latitude either north or south the band will gradually widen out into three detached and concentric rings of which the innermost dark though transparent is miles in breadth the intermediate one which is brighter than the planet itself being miles broad and the outer of a dusky hue being miles broad such they read is the general outline of this strange appendage which revolves in its own plane in hours minutes of what matter it is com posed and how it resists disintegration is still an unsettled question but it might almost seem that the designer of the universe in permitting its ex istence had been willing to impart to his intelligent creatures the manner in which celestial bodies are evolved and that this remarkable ringsystem is a remnant of the nebula from which saturn was him self developed and which from some unknowm cause has become solidified if at any time it should disperse it would either fall into fragments upon the surface of saturn or the fragments mu tually coalescing would form additional satellites to circle round the planet in its path to an observer stationed on the planet between the extremes of lat 째 on either side of the equator these wonderful rings would present vari ous strange phenomena sometimes they would ap pear as an illuminated arch with the shadow of saturn passing over it like the hourhand over a dial at other times they would be like a semiaure ole of light very often too for periods of several years daily eclipses of the sun must occur through the interposition of this triple ring truly with the constant rising and setting of the satellites some with bright discs at their full others like silver crescents in quadrature as well as by the encircling rings the aspect of the heavens from the surface of saturn must be as impressive as it is gorgeous the gallians indeed were unable to realize all the marvels of this strange world after all they were practically a thousand times further off than the great astronomers were able to approach by means of their giant telescopes but they did not complain their little comet they knew was far safer where it was far better out of the reach of an attraction which by affecting their path might have annihilated their best hopes the distances of several of the brightest of the fixed stars have been estimated amongst others vega in the constellation lyra is millions of millions of miles away sirius in canis major millions of millions the pole star millions of millions and capella millions of millions of miles a figure represented by no less than fifteen digits the hard numerical statement of these enormous figures however fails altogether in any adequate way to convey a due impression of the magnitude of these distances astronomers in their ingenuity have endeavored to use some other basis and have found the velocity of light to be convenient for their purpose they have made their representa tions something in this way suppose they say an observer endowed with and infinite length of vision suppose him stationed on the surface of cappella looking thence towards the earth he would be a spectator of events that had happened seventy years previously transport him to a star ten times distant and he will be re viewing the terrestrial sphere of years back carry him away further still to a star so remote that it requires something less than nineteen cen turies for light to reach it and he would be a wit ness of the birth and death of christ convey him further again and he shall be looking upon the dread desolation of the deluge take him away further yet for space is infinite and he shall be a spectator of the creation of the spheres history is thus stereotyped in space nothing once accomplished can ever be effaced who can altogether be astonished that palmyrin rosette with his burning thirst for astronomical re search should have been conscious of a longing for yet wider travel through the sidereal universe with his comet now under the influence of one star now of another what various systems might he not have explored what undreamedof marvels might not have revealed themselves before his gaze the stars fixed and immovable in name are all of them in motion and gallia might have followed them in their untracked way but gallia had a narrow destiny she was not to be allowed to wander away into the range of at traction of another center nor to mingle with the star clusters some of which have been entirely others partially resolved nor was she to lose her self amongst the nebulae which have resisted hitherto the grasp of the most powerful reflectors no gallia was neither to pass beyond the limits of the solar system nor to travel out of sight of the terrestrial sphere her orbit was circumscribed to little over millions of miles and in comparison with the infinite space beyond this wras a mere nothing chapter xi a fete day the temperature
