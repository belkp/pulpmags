mesmeric revelation more sceptical than before i had been advised to study cousin i studied him in his own works as well as in those of his european and american echoes the charles elwood of mr brownson for example was placed in my hands i read it with profound attention throughout i found it logical but the portions which were not merely logical were unhappily the initial arguments of the dis believing hero of the book in his summing up it seemed evident to me that the reasoner had not even succeeded in convincing himself his end had plainly forgotten his beginning like the govern ment of trinculo in short i was not long in per ceiving that if man is to be intellectually convinced of his own immortality he will never be so con vinced by the mere abstractions which have been so long the fashion of the moralists of england of france and of germany abstractions may amuse and exercise but take no hold on his mind here upon earth at least philosophy i am persuaded will always in vain call upon us to look upon qualities as things the will may assentthe soulthe in tellect never i repeat then that i only half felt and never intellectually believed but latterly there has been a certain deepening of the feeling until it has come so nearly to resemble the acquiescence of reason that i find it difficult to distinguish between the two i am enabled too plainly to trace effect to the mesmeric influence i cannot better explain this my meaning than by the hypothesis that the mes meric exaltation enables me to perceive a train of ratiocination which in my abnormal existence con vinces but which in full accordance with the mes meric phenomena does not extend except through its effect into my normal condition in sleepwak ing the reasoning and its conclusionthe cause and its effectare present together in my natural state the cause vanishing the effect only and per haps only partially remains these considerations have led me to think that some good results might ensue from a series of welldirected questions propounded to me while mesmerized you have often observed the profound selfcognizance observed by the sleepwakerthe extensive knowledge he displays upon all points re lating to the mesmeric condition itself and from this selfcognizance may be deduced hints for the proper conduct of a catechism i consented of course to make this experiment a few passes threw mr van kirk into the mesmeric sleep his breathing became immediately more easy and he seemed to suffer no physical uneasi ness the following conversation then ensuedv in the dialogue representing the patient and p myself p are you asleep v yesno i would rather sleep more soundly p after a few more passes do you sleep now v yes p how do you think your present illness will result v after a long hesitation and speaking as if with effort i must die p does the idea of death afflict you p very quickly nono p are you pleased with the prospect v if i were awake i should like to die but now it is no matter the mesmeric condition is so near death as to content me p i wish you would explain yourself mr van kirk v i am willing to do so but it requires more effort than i feel able to make you do not question me properly p what then shall i ask v you must begin at the beginning p the beginning but where is the beginning v you know that the beginning is god this was said in a low fluctuating tone and with every sign of the most profound veneration p what then is god v hesitating for many minutes i cannot tell p is not god spirit v while i was awake i knew what you meant by spirit but now it seems only a wordsuch for instance as truth beautya quality i mean p is not god immaterial v there is no immaterialityit is a mere word that which is not matter is not at allunless quali ties are things p is god then material v no this reply startled me very much p what then is he v after a long pause and mutteringly i see but it is a thing difficult to tell another long pause he is not spirit for he exists nor is he matter as you understand it but there are grada tions of matter of which man knows nothing the grosser impelling the finer the finer pervading the grosser the atmosphere for example impels the electric principle while the electric principle per meates the atmosphere these gradations of mat ter increase in rarity of fineness until we arrive at a matter unparticled without particles undivi sibleone and here the law of impulsion and per meation is modified the ultimate or unparticled matter not only permeates all things but impels all thingsand thus is all things within itself this matter is god what men attempt to embody in the word thought is this matter in motion p the metaphysicians maintain that all action is reducible to motion and thinking and that the latter is the origin of the former v yes and i now see the confusion of idea mo tion is the action of mindnot of thinking the unparticled matter or god in quiescence is as nearly as we can conceive it what men call mind and the power of selfmovement equivalent in effect to human volition is in the unparticled mat ter the result of its unity and omniprevalence how i know not and now clearly see that i shall never know but the unparticled matter set in motion by law or quality existing within itself is thinking p can you give me no more precise idea of what you term the unparticled matter v the matters of which man is cognizant escape the senses in gradation we have for example a metal a piece of wood a drop of water the atmos phere a gas caloric electricity the luminiferous ether now we call all these things matter and embrace all matter in one general definition but in spite of this there can be no two ideas more essen tially distinct than that which we attach to a metal and that which we attach to the luminiferous ether when we reach the latter we feel an almost irre sistible inclination to class it with spirit or with
