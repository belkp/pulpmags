a trip to the center of the earth all scientific teaching theoretical and practical shows it to be impossible i care nothing for theories retorted my uncle but is it not wellknown that heat increases one degree for every seventy feet you descend into the earth which gives a fine idea of the central heat all the matters which compose the globe are in a state of incandescence even gold platinum and the hardest rocks are in a state of fusion what would become of us dont be alarmed at the heat my boy how so neither you nor anybody else knows anything about the real state of the earths interior all modern experiments tend to explode the older theories were any such heat to exist the upper crust of the earth would be shattered to atoms and the world would be at an end a long learned and not uninteresting discussion followed which ended in this i do not believe in the dangers and difficulties which you harry seem to multiply and the only way to learn is like arne saknussem to go and see well cried i overcome at last let us go and see though how we can do that in the dark is another mystery fear nothing we shall overcome these and many other difficulties besides as we approach the center i expect to find it luminous nothing is impossible and now that we have come to a thorough under standing not a word to any living soul our suc cess depends on secrecy and despatch thus ended our memorable conference which roused a perfect fever in me leaving my uncle i went forth like one possessed reaching the banks of the elbe i began to think was all i had heard really and truly possible was my uncle in his sober senses and could the interior of the earth be reached was i the victim of a madman or was he a discoverer of rare courage and grandeur of conception to a certain extent i was anxious to be off i was afraid my enthusiasm would cool i determined to pack up at once at the end of an hour how ever on my way home i found that my feelings had very much changed im all abroad i cried its a nightmarei must have dreamt it at this moment i came face to face with gretchen whom i warmly embraced so you have come to meet me she said how good of you but what is wrong with you well it was no use mincing the matter i told her all she listened with awe and for some minutes she could not speak well i at last asked rather anxiously what a magnificent journey if i were only a man a journey worthy of the nephew of pro fessor hardwigg i should look upon it as an honor to accompany him my dear gretchen i thought you would be the first to cry out against this mad enterprise no on the contrary i glory in it it is magnifi cent splendidan idea worthy of my father harry lawson i envy you this was as it were conclusive the final blow of all when we entered the house we found my uncle surrounded by workmen and porters who were packing up he was pulling and hauling at a bell where have you been wasting your time your portmanteau is not packedmy papers are not in orderthe precious tailor has not brought my clothes nor my gaitersthe key of my carpet bag is gone i looked at him stupefied and still he tugged away at the bell we are really off then i said yesof course and yet you go out for a stroll unfortunate boy and when do we go the day after tomorrow at daybreak i heard no more but darted off to my little bedchamber and locked myself in there was no doubt about it now my uncle had been hard at work all the afternoon the garden was full of ropes ropeladders torches iron clamps crowbars alpenstocks and pickaxesenough to load ten men i passed a terrible night i was called early the next day to learn that the resolution of my uncle was unchanged and irrevocable i also found my cousin and affianced wife as warm on the subject as was her father next day at five oclock in the morning the post chaise was at the door gretchen and the old cook received the keys of the house and scarcely paus ing to wish anyone goodbye we started on our adventurous journey into the center of the earth chapter v first lessons in climbing at altona a suburb of hamburg is the chief station of the kiel railway which was to take us to the shores of the belt and exactly at oclock we were seated opposite each other in a first class railway carriage my uncle said nothing he was too busy examining his papers among which of course was the famous parchment and some letters of introduction from the danish consul which were to pave the way to an introduction to the governor of iceland in three hours we reached kiel and our baggage was at once transferred to the steamer we had now a day before us a delay of about ten hours which fact put my uncle in a towering passion we had nothing to do but to walk about the pretty town and bay at last however we went on board and at half past ten were steaming down the great belt the next morning we reached copenhagen where scarcely taking time for re freshment my uncle hurried out to present one of his letters of introduction it was to the director of the museum of antiquities who having been in formed that we were tourists bound for iceland did all he could to assist us one wretched hope sus tained me now perhaps no vessel was bound for such distant parts alas a little danish schooner the valkyrie was to sail on the second of june for reykjawik the captain m bjarne was on board and was rather surprised at the energy and cordiality with which his future passenger shook him by the hand to him a voyage to iceland was merely a matter of course my uncle on the other hand considered the event of sublime importance the honest sailor took advantage of the professors enthusiasm to double the fare on tuesday morning at seven oclock be on
