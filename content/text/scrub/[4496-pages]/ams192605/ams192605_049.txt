 amazing stories which i lay i did not rise for a long while for i was thinking hopelessly of the futility of my life with my world gone of the new life i should have to build up here learning everything all over again as though i were a baby after a while knowing the madness such thoughts as these might lead me to i tried to dismiss them and i stood up i was amazed at first to discover the grain about a foot above my head now for it had been at least two feet below my head when i had gone to sleep surely it had not grown a yard during the night i soon realized however that it was i who had grown a little smaller as the machine continued to move with increasing slowness i now removed the tiny instrument which i had kept on after taking off the suit lest it should come to harm i was puzzled to know how i might reach civiliza tion if there was civilization but remembering the sea i set off in the direction i thought it lay carrying the suit and the machine both extra ordinarily light i walked for a large part of the night i did not realize just how far the ocean might be since i remembered it as no more than a few inches from my huge foot i was fairly certain after walking many miles that i must have taken the wrong direction but no a little while before the dawn i heard the faint sound of its breakers and i soon was able to see it from the top of a hill when i reached the beach i once more perceived the light of the city assuming that it was a city across the water of course i could not see the flash ing structures themselves but an intense golden radiance spread itself over the sky as though it might really have been the moon rising i walked along the beach until dawn and then i went on for a large part of the morning trying to reach a point upon the shore that would be directly opposite the city i should imagine it was a few hours before noon when the flying ma chines appeared they came out of the east from the direction of the city flying very low they flew together several hundred of them i should imagine until they reached a point on the shore probably ten miles below me then they seemed to disperse some into the country a few at intervals along the beach it was not long before one of them came shooting up toward me at a speed enormous beyond my imagination i began to wave my arms wildly and apparently i was seen for the plane im mediately decreased its speed a few minutes later after passing perhaps a mile beyond me the plane turned and glided along the beach until it stopped a hundred yards or so away it was a small machine of a most curious and delicate design but it did not differ very radi cally from those i had seen on the earth a man leaped out and came toward me he too was very like myself but about a foot taller and with an extremely high forehead his features were delicate his build very slight but quite graceful he was unclothed except for a belt of metal and several metal ornaments upon his arms and legs he carried a small straight instrument of metal in his hand apparently a weapon which was turned upon me i raised my arms and cried wait or something equally absurd which naturally he could not understand he did not trouble to reply realiz ing i suppose that our languages were different instead he motioned me to approach and backing away from me he allowed me to come up to the plane i was signalled to enter it there was no cockpit no enclosure it consisted only of a plat form some five feet wide and ten feet long with a rail of thin metal about it a small metal chair of severe design was affixed to the forward end be hind the controls i mounted the platform and sat down at his command in one corner still holding the tiny in strument toward my chest he then secured one of my wrists and one ankle to a couple of metal cuffs evidently for that purpose upon the rail he flung the suit after a contemptuous examination into the corner beside him i grinned at him several times during these operations in order to show that my intentions were of the best but he only stared at me with an expressionless face and turned away to the controls if any shadow of expression was in his eyes i fancied it was disgust a moment later he rose swiftly from the beach and turned toward the city leaving me to my own despondent reveries as we flew over the water with amazing swiftness he must have given some signal to the other planes by wireless for a short while later i saw them all falling in behind far back it was then that i suspected for the first time that they might all have been searching for me i had forgotten how conspicuous my giant body would have looked to them even from a distance if any one chanced to observe it at the risk of omitting details which the reader would find very interesting i am going to say noth ing of the city as yet i saw too little of it to draw any accurate conclusions and i have very little more than a vague impression of tall buildings flashing in the sunlight mile after mile extending far out over the horizon buildings of immense height standing each many hundreds of yards apart with parks between it was all roofed over and kept apparently at a uniform heat while i sus pect that in some way the clouds above were arti ficially dispelled to permit the huge sun to be seen we entered through great gates in the glass dome and joined a throng of other planes mostly very small ones and in a few minutes we had landed on the roof of a building near the limits of the city a number of the tall men then gathered about us they were all clean shaven and they were practically without hair they had an air of age and wisdom although their faces like that of the flyer were smooth delicate and impassive i was released still under the scrutiny of the little weapon and conveyed down through elevators and moving passages to a cell of white metal contain ing a low bed some small chairs a table and other mere necessities food was put before me and then i was left alone i never left that cell there after until the moment of my final departure from the planet the days i spent in there were a long and monotonous succession of lonely hours and tedious examinations on the day that i arrived after i had eaten my meal two of the men to whose care i was committed came with a guard to inspect me they said nothing during the whole time they were there i was motioned to explain myself half in credulously i began to talk and they nodded as though they understoodi cannot say how i never
