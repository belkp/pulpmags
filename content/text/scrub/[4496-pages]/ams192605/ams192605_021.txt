 amazing stories still traveling over those apparently interminable and sandy prairies we were compelled to go round the kollafjord then following a narrow strip of shore between high rocks and the sea we came to the aoalkirkja of brantar and after another mile to saurboer annexia a chapel of ease situ ated on the southern bank of the hvalfjord it was four oclock in the evening and we had traveled four danish miles about equal to twenty english the fjord was in this place about halfamile in width the sweeping and broken waves came roll ing in upon the pointed rocks the gulf was sur rounded by rocky wallsa mighty cliff three thou sand feet in height remarkable for its brown strata separated here and there by beds of tufa of a reddish hue now whatever may have been the intelligence of our horses i had not the slightest reliance upon them as a means of crossing a stormy arm of the sea to ride over salt water upon the back of a little horse seemed to me absurd if they are really intelligent i said to myself they will certainly not make the attempt in any case i shall trust rather to my own intelligence than theirs but my uncle was in no humor to wait he dug his heels into the sides of his steed and made for the shore his horse went to the very edge of the water sniffed at the approaching wave and re treated my uncle who sooth to say was quite an obsinate as the beast he bestrode insisted on his making the desired advance this attempt was followed by a new refusal on the part of the horse who quietly shook his head this demonstration of rebellion was followed by a volley of words and a stout applica tion of whipcord also followed by kicks on the part of the horse which threw its head and heels upwards and tried to throw his rider at length the sturdy little pony spreading out his legs in a stiff and ludicrous attitude got from under the professors legs and left him standing with both feet on a separate stone like the collossus of rhodes wretched animal cried my uncle suddenly transformed into a foot passengerand as angry and ashamed as a dismounted cavalry officer on the field of battle farja said the guide tapping him familiarly on the shoulder what a ferry boat der answered hans pointing to where lay the boat in questionthere well i cried much relieved by the informa tion so it is why did you not say so before cried my uncle why not start at once tidvatten said the guide what does he say i asked considerably puzzled by the delay and the dialogue he says tide replied my uncle translating the danish word for my information of course i understandwe must wait till the tide serves for bida asked my uncle ja replied hans my uncle frowned stamped his feet and then followed the horses to where the boat lay i thor oughly understood and appreciated the necessity for waiting before crossing the fjord for that moment when the seas at its highest point is in a state of slack water as neither the ebb nor flow can then be felt the ferry boat was in no danger of being carried out to sea or dashed upon the rocky coast the favorable moment did not come until six oclock in the evening then my uncle myself and guide two boatmen and the four horses got into a very awkward flatbottom boat accustomed as i had been to the steam ferryboats of the elbe i found the long oars of the boatmen but sorry means of locomotion we were more than an hour in crossing the fjord but at length the passage was concluded without accident halfanhour later we reached gardar chapter x traveling in iceland it ought one would have thought to have been night even in the sixtyfifth parallel of latitude but still the nocturnal illumination did not sur prise me for in iceland during the months of june and july the sun never sets the temperature however was very much lower than i expected i was cold but even that did not affect me so much as ravenous hunger welcome indeed therefore was the hut which hospitably opened its doors to us it was merely the house of a peasant but in the matter of hospitality it was worthy of being the palace of a king as we alighted at the door the master of the house came forward held out his hand and without any further ceremony signaled to us to follow him we followed him for to ac company him was impossible a long narrow gloomy passage led into the interior of this habita tion made from beams roughly squared by the ax this passage gave ingress to every room the chambers were four in numberthe kitchen the workshop where the weaving was carried on the general sleepingchamber of the family and the best room to which strangers were especially in vited my uncle whose lofty stature had not been taken into consideration when the house was built contrived to knock his head against the beams of the roof as soon as we had freed ourselves from our heavy traveling costume the voice of our host was heard calling to us to come into the kitchen the only room in which the icelanders ever make any fire no matter how cold it may be my uncle noth ing loath hastened to obey this hospitable and friendly invitation i followed on our entrance our worthy host as if he had not seen us before advanced ceremoniously uttered a word which means be happy and then kissed both of us on the cheek his wife followed pro nounced the same word with the same ceremonial then the husband and wife placing their right hands upon their hearts bowed profoundly this excellent icelandic woman was the mother of nineteen children who little and big rolled crawled and walked about in the midst of volumes of smoke arising from the angular fireplace in the middle of the room every now and then i could see a fresh white head with a slightly melancholy expression of countenance peering at me
