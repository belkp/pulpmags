 amazing stories the engine and the masts everything had been cleared out and conveyed to shore but in the event of a thaw it appeared that nothing short of a miracle could prevent the hull from being dashed to pieces and then all means of leaving the promontory would be gone the hansa of course would share a similar fate in fact it had already heeled over to such an extent as to render it quite dangerous for its obstinate owner who at the peril of his life resolved that he would stay where he could watch over his allprecious cargo though continually in voking curses on the illfate of which he deemed himself the victim there was however a stronger will than isaac hakkabuts although no one of all the community cared at all for the safety of the jew they cared very much for the security of his cargo and when servadac found that nothing would induce the old man to abandon his present quarters voluntarily he very soon adopted measures of coercion that were far more effectual than any representations of per sonal danger stop where you like hakkabut said the captain to him but understand that i consider it my duty to make sure that your cargo is taken care of i am going to have it carried across to land at once neither groans nor tears nor protestations on the part of the jew were of the slightest avail forthwith on the th of december the removal of the goods commenced both spaniards and russians were all occupied for several days in the work of unloading the tartan well muffled up as they were in furs they were able to endure the cold with impunity making it their special care to avoid actual contact with any article of metal which in the low state of the temperature would inevitably have taken all the skin off their hands as much as if it had been red hot the task however was brought to an end without accident of any kind and when the stores of the hansa were safely deposited in the galleries of the hive lieutenant procope avowed that he really felt that his mind had been unburdened from a great anxiety captain servadac gave old isaac full permission to take up his residence amongst the rest of the com munity promised him the entire control over his own property and altogether showed him so much consideration that but for his unbounded respect for his master ben zoof would have liked to repri mand him for his courtesy to a man whom he so cordially despised although hakkabut clamored most vehemently about his goods being carried off against his will in his heart he was more than satisfied to see his property transferred to a place of safety and de lighted moreover to know that the transport had been effected without a farthing of expense to him self as soon then as he found the tartan empty he was only too glad to accept the offer that had been made him and very soon made his way over to the quarters in the gallery where his merchandise had been stored here he lived day and night he sup plied himself with what little food he required from his own stock of provisions a small spiritlamp sufficing to perform all the operations of his meager cookery consequently all intercourse between him self and the rest of the inhabitants was entirely confined to business transactions when occasion re quired that some purchase should be made from his stock of commodities meanwhile all the silver and gold of the colony was gradually finding its way to a doublelocked drawer of which the jew most care fully guarded the key the st of january was drawing near the anni versary of the shock which had resulted in the sev erance of thirtysix human beings from the society of their fellowmen hitherto not one of them was missing the unvarying calmness of the climate notwithstanding the cold had tended to maintain them in good health and there seemed no reason to doubt that when gallia returned to the earth the total of its little population would still be com plete the st of january it is true was not properly new years day in gallia but captain servadac nevertheless was very anxious to have it observed as a holiday i do not think he said to count timascheff and lieutenant procope that we ought to allow our people to lose their interest in the world to which we are all hoping to return and how can we cement the bond that ought to unite us better than by celebrating in common with our fellowcreatures upon earth a day that awakens afresh the kindliest sentiments of all besides he added smiling i expect that gallia although invisible just at present to the naked eye is being closely watched by the telescopes of our terrestrial friends and i have no doubt that the newspapers and scientific journals of both hemispheres are full of accounts detailing the movements of the new comet true asserted the count i can quite imagine that we are occasioning no small excitement in all the chief observatories ay more than that said the lieutenant our gallia is certain to be far more than a mere object of scientific interest or curiosity why should we doubt that the elements of a comet which has once come into collision with the earth have by this time been accurately calculated what our friend the professor has done here has been done likewise on the earth where beyond a question all manner of expedients are being discussed as to the best way of mitigating the violence of a concussion that must occur the lieutenants conjectures were so reasonable that they commanded assent gallia could scarcely be otherwise than an object of terror to the in habitants of the earth who could by no means be certain that a second collision would be compara tively so harmless as the first even to the gallians themselves much as they looked forward to the event the prospect was not unmixed with alarm and they would rejoice in the invention of any de vice by which it was likely the impetus of the shock might be deadened christmas arrived and was marked by apropriate religious observance by everyone in the community with the exception of the jew who made a point of secluding himself more obstinately than ever in the gloomy recesses of his retreat to ben zoof the last week of the year was full of bustle the arrangements for the new year făşte were entrusted to him and he was anxious in spite of the resources of gallia being so limited to make the program for the great day as attractive as possible
