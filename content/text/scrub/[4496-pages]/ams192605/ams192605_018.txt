a trip to the center of the earth endeavor to climb to the summit of sneffels and if possible will descend into its crater i very much regret continued m fridriksson that my occupation will entirely preclude the pos sibility of my accompanying you it would have been both pleasurable and profitable if i could have spared the time no no a thousand times no cried my uncle i do not wish to disturb the serenity of any man i thank you however with all my heart the pres ence of one so learned as yourself would no doubt have been most useful but the duties of your office and profession before everything in the innocence of his simple heart our host did not perceive the irony of these remarks i en tirely approve your project he continued after some further remarks it is a good idea to begin by examining this volcano you will make a harvest of curious observations in the first place how do you propose to get to sneffels by sea i shall cross the bay of course that is the most rapid route of course but still it cannot be done why we have not an available boat in all reykjawik replied the other what is to be done you must go by land along the coast it is longer but much more interesting then i must have a guide of course and i have your very man somebody on whom i can depend yes an inhabitant of the peninsula on which sneffels is situated he is a very shrewd and worthy man with whom you will be pleased he speaks danish like a dane when can i see himtoday no tomorrow he will not be here before tomorrow be it replied my uncle with a deep sigh the conversation ended by compliments on both sides during the dinner my uncle had learned much as to the history of arne saknussem the rea sons for his mysterious and hieroglyphical docu ment he also became aware that his host would not accompany him on his adventurous expedition and that next day we should have a guide chapter viii the eiderdown hunteroff at last that evening i took a brief walk on the shore near reykjawik after which i returned to an early sleep on my bed of coarse planks where i slept the sleep of the just when i awoke i heard my uncle speaking loudly in the next room i rose hastily and joined him he was talking in danish with a man of tall stature and of perfectly hercu lean build this man appeared to be possessed of very great strength his eyes which started rather prominently from a very large head the face be longing to which was simple and naèª°ve appeared very quick and intelligent very long hair which even in england would have been accounted ex ceedingly red fell over his athletic shoulders this native of iceland was active and supple in appear ance though he scarcely moved his arms being in fact one of those men who despise the habit of gesticulation common to southern people everything in this mans manner revealed a calm and phlegmatic temperament there was nothing indolent about him but his appearance spoke of tranquility he was one of those who never seemed to expect anything from anybody who liked to work when he thought proper and whose philosophy nothing could astonish or trouble i began to comprehend his character simply from the way in which he listened to the wild and im passioned verbiage of my worthy uncle while the excellent professor spoke sentence after sentence he stood with folded arms utterly still motionless to all my uncles gesticulations when he wanted to say no he moved his head from left to right when he acquiesced he nodded so slightly that you could scarcely see the undulation of his head this economy of motion was carried to the length of avarice judging from his appearance it would have been a long time before i would suspect him to be what he was a mighty hunter certainly his manner was not likely to frighten the game how then did he contrive to get at his prey my surprise was slightly modified when i knew that this tranquil and solemn personage was only a hunter of the eiderduck the down of which is after all the greatest source of the icelanders wealth this grave sententious silent person as phleg matic as an englishman on the french stage was named hans bjelke he had called upon us in consequence of the recommendation of m fridriks son he was in fact our future guide it struck me that had i sought the world over i could not have found a greater contradiction to my impulsive uncle however they readily understood one an other neither of them had any thought about money one was ready to take all that was offered him the other ready to offer anything that was asked it may readily be conceived then that an understanding between them was soon reached the understanding was that he was to take us to the village of stapi situated on the southern slope of the peninsula of sneffels at the very foot of the volcano hans the guide told us the dis tance was about twentytwo miles a journey which my uncle supposed would take about two days but when my uncle realized that they were danish miles of eight thousand yards each he was obliged to be more moderate in his ideas and considering the horrible roads we had to follow to allow eight or ten days for the journey four horses were pre pared for us two to carry the baggage and two to bear the important weight of myself and uncle hans declared that nothing would ever make him climb on the back of any animal he knew every inch of that part of the coast and promised to take us the very shortest way his engagement with my uncle was by no means to cease with our arrival at stapi he was further to remain in his service during the whole time re quired for the completion of his scientific investiga tions at the fixed salary of three rixdollars a week being exactly fourteen shillings and twopence minus one farthing english currency one stipula tion however was made by the guidethe money was to be paid to him every saturday night failing which his engagement was at an end the day of our departure was fixed my uncle wished to hand the eiderdown hunter an advance
