a trip to the center of the earth he may make the discovery in which case we are both lost perish the fearful secretlet the flames forever bury it in oblivion i snatched up book and parchment and was about to cast them into the fire when the door opened and my uncle entered i had scarcely time to put down the wretched documents before my uncle was by my side he was profoundly absorbed his thoughts were evidently bent on the terrible parchment some new combination had probably struck him while taking his walk he seated himself in his armchair and with a pen began to make an alge braical calculation i watched him with anxious eyes my flesh crawled as his discovery of the se cret became probable i having discovered the only clue i knew his combinations were useless for three mortal hours he continued without speaking a word without raising his head scratching re writing calculating over and over again i knew that in time he must hit upon the right phrase the letters of every alphabet have only a certain number of combinations but then years might elapse be fore he would arrive at the correct solution still time went on night came the sounds in the streets ceasedand still my uncle went on not even answering our worthy cook when she called us to supper i did not dare to leave him so waved her away and at last fell asleep on the sofa when i awoke my uncle was still at work his red eyes his pallid countenance his matted hair his feverish hands his hecticly flushed cheeks showed how terrible had been his struggle with the impossible and what fearful fatigue he had under gone during that long sleepless night it made me quite ill to look at him though he was rather se vere with me i loved him and my heart ached at his sufferings he was so overcome by one idea that he could not even get into a passion all his ener gies were focussed on one point and i knew that by speaking one little word all this suffering would cease i could not speak it my heart was nevertheless inclining towards him why then did i remain silent in the in terest of my uncle himself nothing shall make me speak i muttered he will want to follow in the footsteps of the other i know him well his imagination is a perfect volcano and to make dis coveries in the interests of geology he would sacri fice his life i will therefore be silent and strictly keep the secret i have discovered to reveal it would be suicidal he would not only himself rush to de struction but drag me with him i crossed my arms looked another way and smokedresolved never to speak when our cook wanted to go out to market or on any other errand she found the front door locked and the key taken away was this done purposely or not surely professor hardwigg did not in tend the old woman and myself to become martyrs to his obstinate will were we to be starved to death a frightful recollection came to my mind once we had fed on bits and scraps for a week while he sorted some curiosities it gave me the cramp even to think of it i wanted my breakfast and i saw no way of getting it still my resolution held good i would starve rather than yield but the cook began to take me seriously to task what was to be done she could not go out and i dared not my uncle continued counting and writing his imagination seemed to have transported him to the skies he thought neither of eating nor drinking in this way twelve oclock came around i was hungry and there was nothing in the house the cook had eaten the last bit of bread this could not go on at two oclock my sensations were terrible after all i began to think the document is very ab surd perhaps it is only a gigantic hoax besides some means could surely be found to keep my uncle back from attempting any such absurd expedition on the other hand if he should attempt anything so quixotic i could not be compelled to accompany him another line of reasoning partially decided me very likely he would make the discovery himself when i should have suffered starvation for nothing under the influence of hunger this reasoning ap peared admirable i determined to tell all the question now arose as to how it was to be done i was still dwelling on the thought when he rose and put on his hat what go out and lock us in never uncle i began he did not appear even to hear me professor hardwigg i cried what he retorted did you speak how about the key what keythe key of the door noof these horrible hieroglyphics he looked at me from under his spectacles and started at the odd expression of my face rushing forward he clutched me by the arm and keenly ex amined my countenance his very look was an in terrogation i simply nodded with an incredulous shrug of the shoulders he turned upon his heel undoubtedly he thought i had gone mad i have made a very important discovery his eyes flashed with excitement his hand was lifted in a menacing attitude for a moment neither of us spoke it is hard to say which was most excited you dont mean to say that you have any idea of the meaning of the scrawl i do was my desperate reply look at the sentence as dictated by you well but it means nothing was the angry answer nothing if you read from left to right but mark if from right to left backwards cried my uncle in wild amazement oh most cunning saknussem and i to be such a blockhead he snatched up the document gazed at it with haggard eye and read it out as i had done it read as follows in sneffels ioculis craterem kem delebat umbra scartaris julii intra calendas descende audas viator et terrestre centrum attinges kod feci arne saknussem which doglatin being translated read as fol lows descend into the crater of yokul of sneffels which the shade of scartaris covers before the kalends of july audacious traveler and you will reach the center of the earth i did it arne saknussem my uncle leaped three feet from the ground with joy he looked radiant and handsome he rushed about the room wild with delight and satisfaction he knocked over tables and chairs he threw his
