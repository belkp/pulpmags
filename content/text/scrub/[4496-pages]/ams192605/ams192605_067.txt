 amazing stories of sardinia they had now a home in which they had nothing to desire have you no father or mother asked pablo one day no she answered no more have i said the boy i used to run along by the side of the diligences when i was in spain i used to look after goats at madalena said nina but it is much nicer herei am so happy here i have you for a brother and everybody is so kind i am afraid they will spoil us pablo she added smiling oh no nina you are too good to be spoiled and when i am with you you make me good too said pablo gravely july had now arrived during the month gallias advance along its orbit would be reduced to leagues the distance from the sun at the end being leagues about four and a half times as great as the average distance of the earth from the sun it was traveling now at about the same speed as the earth which traverses the ecliptic at a rate of leagues a month or leagues an hour in due time the d of april according to the revised gallian calendar dawned and in punctual fulfillment of the professors appointment a note was delivered to servadac to say that he was ready and hoped that day to commence operations for calculating the mass and density of his comet as well as the force of gravity at its surface a point of far greater interest to captain serva dac and his friends would have been to ascertain the nature of the substance of which the comet was composed but they felt pledged to render the pro fessor any aid they could in the researches upon which he had set his heart without delay there fore they assembled in the central hall where they were soon joined by rosette who seemed to be in fairly good temper gentlemen he began i propose today to en deavor to complete our observations of the elements of my comet three matters of investigation are before us first the measure of gravity at its sur face this attractive force we know by the increase of our own muscular force must of course be con siderably less than that at the surface of the earth secondly its mass that is the quality of its matter and thirdly its density or quantity of matter in a unit of its volume we will proceed gentlemen if you please to weigh gallia ben zoof who had just entered the hall caught the professors last sentence and without saying a word went out again and was absent for some minutes when he returned he said if you want to weigh this comet of yours i suppose you want a pair of scales but i have been to look and i cannot find a pair anywhere and whats more he added mischievously you wont get them any where a frown came over the professors countenance servadac saw it and gave his orderly a sign that he should desist entirely from his bantering i require gentlemen resumed rosette first of all to know by how much the weight of a kilo gram here differs from its weight upon the earth the attraction as we have said being less the weight will proportionately be less also then an ordinary pair of scales being under the influence of attraction i suppose would not answer your purpose submitted the lieutenant and the very kilogram weight you used would have become lighter put in the count deferentially pray gentlemen do not interrupt me said the professor authoritatively as if ex cathedrì°½ i need no instruction on these points procope and timascheff demurely bowed their heads the professor resumed upon a springbalance dependent upon mere tension or flexibility the at traction will have no influence if i suspend a weight upon it equivalent to the weight of a kilo gram the index will register the proper weight on the surface of gallia thus i shall arrive at the difference i want the difference between the earths attraction and the comets will you therefore have the goodness to provide me at once with a spring balance and a tested kilogram the audience looked at one another and then at ben zoof who was thoroughly acquainted with all their resources we have neither one nor the other said the orderly the professor stamped with vexation i believe old hakkabut has a springbalance on board his tartan said ben zoof presently then why didnt you say so before you idiot roared the excitable little man anxious to pacify him servadac assured him that every exertion should be made to procure the instrument and directed ben zoof to go to the jew and borrow it no stop a moment he said as ben zoof was moving away on his errand perhaps i had better go with you myself the old jew may make a diffi culty about lending us any of his property why should we not all go asked the count we should see what kind of a life the misanthrope leads on board the hansa the proposal met with general approbation be fore they started professor rosette requested that one of the men might be ordered to cut him a cubic decimeter out of the solid substance of gallia my engineer is the man for that said the count he will do it well for you if you will give him the pre cise measurement what you dont mean exclaimed the professor again going off into a passion that you havent a proper measure of length ben zoof was sent off to ransack the stores for the article in question but no measure was forth coming most likely we shall find one on the tar tan said the orderly then let us lose no time in trying answered the professor as he bustled with hasty strides into the gallery the rest of the party followed and were soon in the open air upon the rocks that overhung the shore they descended to the level of the frozen water and made their way towards the little creek where the dobryna and the hansa lay firmly im prisoned in their icy bonds the temperature was low beyond previous ex perience but well muffled up in fur they all en dured it without much actual suffering their breath issued in vapor which was at once congealed into little crystals upon their whiskers beards eye brows and eyelashes until their faces covered with
