a trip to the center of the earth chapter i my uncle makes a great discovery looking back to all that has occurred to me since that eventful day i am scarce ly able to believe in the reality of my adventures they were truly so won derful that even now i am bewildered when i think of them my uncle was a german though i am english he having married my mothers sister being very much attached to his fatherless nephew he invited me to study under him in his home in the father land this home was in a large town and my uncle was a professor of philosophy chemistry geology mineralogy and many other ologies one day after passing some hours in the labora torymy uncle being absent at the timei sud denly felt the necessity of renovating the tissues i e i was hungry and was about to rouse up our old french cook when my uncle professor von hardwigg suddenly opened the street door and came rushing upstairs now professor hardwigg my worthy uncle is by no means a bad sort of man he is however choleric and original to hear with him means to obey and scarcely had his heavy feet resounded within our joint domicile than he shouted for me to attend upon him harryharryharry i hastened to obey but before i could reach his room jumping three steps at a time he was stamp ing his right foot upon the landing harry he cried in a frantic tone are you coming up to tell the truth at that moment i was far more interested in the question as to what was to con stitute our dinner than in any problem of science to me soup was more inter esting than sodium an omelette more tempting than arithmetic and an artichoke of ten times more value than any amount of asbestos but my uncle was not a man to be kept waiting so ad journing all minor ques tions i presented myself before him he was a very learned man now most persons in this category supply themselves with informa tion as peddlers do with goods for the benefit of others and lay up stores in order to diffuse them abroad for the benefit of society in general not so my excellent uncle professor hardwigg he studied he consumed the midnight oil he pored over heavy tomes and digested huge quartos and folios and kept the knowledge he acquired to himself there was a reason and it may be regained as a good one why my uncle objected to display his learning more than was absolutely necessary he stammered and when intent upon explaining the phenomena of the heavens was apt to find himself at fault and allude in such a vague way to sun moon and stars that few were able to comprehend his meaning to tell the honest truth when the right word would not come it was generally re placed by a very powerful adjective in connection with the sciences there are many almost unpronounceable namesnames very much resembling those of welsh villages and my uncle being very fond of using them his habit of stam mering was not thereby improved in fact there were periods in his discourse when he would finally give up and swallow his discomfiturein a glass of water as i said my uncle professor hardwigg was a very learned man and i now add a most kind relative i was bound to him by the double ties of affection and interest i took deep interest in all his doings and hoped some day to be almost as learned myself it was a rare thing for me to be absent from his lectures like him i preferred mineralogy to all the other sciences my anxiety was to gain real knowl edge of the earth geology and mineralogy were to us the main objects of life and in connection with these studies many a fair specimen of stone chalk or ore did we break with our ham mers but before i state the subject on which my uncle wished to confer with me i must say a word about his personal appearance alas my readers will see a very different portrait of him at a future time after he has gone through the fearful adventures yet to be related my uncle was fifty years old tall thin and wiry large spectacles hid to a certain extent his vast round and goggle eyes while his nose was ir reverently compared to a thin file so much in deed did it resemble that useful article that a compass was said in his pres ence to have made considerable deviation the truth being told however the only article really attracted to my uncles nose was tobacco another peculiarity of his was that he always stepped a yard at a time clenched his fists as if he were going to hit you and was when in one of his in his immortal story a trip to the center of the earth jules verne has quite outdone himself not only was jules verne a master of the imaginative type of fiction but he was a scientist of high calibre besides this his intimate knowledge of geography the customs and peculiarities of the various races made it possible for him to write with authority on any of these subjects so when he takes us to the center of the earth via the route through iceland we get the feeling that somehow the story is real and this after all is the test of any good story instead of boring a hole into the bowels of the earth jules verne was probably the first to think of taking the reader to unexplored depths through the orifice of an ex tinct volcano he argues correctly that a dead crater would prove not only the safest but perhaps the best route for such exploration no one has as yet explored the very center of the earth for at no time have we descend ed deeper than about a mile below the surface of the planet who knows therefore but that there may be tremendous discoveries ahead of the human race once we penetrate into the great depths of the globe we have no right to assume that life in the interior of the earth is an impossibility when our deep sea expedi tions come home with specimens of fish that live at the bottom of the ocean and under what appear to be unen durable pressures where logic would assume there could be no life we should not judge harshly that there can be no life in the depths of the earth if there is an entrance to a great unexplored cavity within our planet you are free to believe that some form of life exists there living beings can get along without light and it is possible that some sort of light of the phosphorescent order can be found there and besides nature has a trick all its own of circumventing impossibilities as is well witnessed in many deep sea fish in depths where no light ever pene trates where many of them are equipped with luminous eyes and other lightgiving organs
