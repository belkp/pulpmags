off on a comet what has gone before the story opens in africain algerianear the capital an officer in the french army captain servadacand a russian nobleman count timascheffare preparing to fight a duel about a lady servadac occupies part of the time be fore the encounter in an attempt to write a poem to the lady just when he was getting to an end of his attempt a sudden convulsion occurred and a great change in the universe was noted the sun rose in the west the day was onehalf its former duration gravity was reduced so that they could jump to a height of or feet with hardly any effort there was a change in the contour of the country and an atmosphere of utter mystery prevailed the line of the shore was changed everything was altered the hero servadac is alone in his explorations with his servant ben zoof an unknown satellite is seen in the sky the heat is extreme the russian nobleman owned a yacht the do bryna and now captain servadac and his servant see this on the distant ocean she reaches the shore and finds a safe harbor her owner leaves her and meets captain servadac the duel under these strange circumstances is forgotten the dobryna is put to work to explore the surroundings and to try to find france a light is seen and on a little island is discovered the tomb of louis ix on tak ing soundings a strange mineral is always brought up by the greasecup on the bottom of the lead nothing else can be found as forming the ocean bed some english officers are found on an isolated spot which was supposed to be all that was left of the rock of gibraltar presently a sealed tube is found floating on the wateran old leather tele scope casewith a message from some student of astronomy now apprehensions rise that the temperature which has been very high may fall to that of interstellar space later in the midst of these fears some more inhabitants are found one a charming little girl then another message from the supposed astronomer is found floating on the oceanthis time in a meatcan the next ar rival is a trading jew in his tartanas this medi terranean craft is called as the weather gets colder and colder they betake themselves to a cave in the side of a volcano where the temperature is kept warm by a lava flow next a carrier pigeon brings them a third message from the astronomer the ocean now is frozen over they put metal sleigh runners under the boat and go off with almost ice boat speed and find an island on which there is a monumenta surveyors pylonand there they also find a man apparently dead but who proves to have some vestage of life in him still thirtysix hours later the iceboat brings them all back to their volcanohome off on a comet or hector servadac by jules verne book ii chapter i the astronomer by the return of the expedition con veying its contribution from formen tera the known population of gallia was raised to a total of thirtysix on learning the details of his friends discoveries count timascheff did not hesitate in believing that the exhausted individual who was lying before him was the author alike of the two un signed documents picked up at sea and of the third statement so recently brought to hand by the carrierpigeon manifestly he had arrived at some knowl edge of gallias movements he had estimated her distance from the sun he had calculated the diminution of her tangen tial speed but there was noth ing to show that he had arrived at the conclusions which were of the most paramount interest to them all had he ascertained the true character of her orbit had he established any data from which it would be possible to reckon what time must elapse before she would again approach the earth the only intelligible words which the astronomer had uttered had been my comet to what could the exclamation refer was it to be conjectured that a fragment of the earth had been chipped off by the collision of a comet and if so was it implied that the name of the comet itself was gallia and were they mistaken in sup posing that such was the name given by the savant to the little world that had been so suddenly launched into space again and again they discussed these questions but no satisfactory answer could be found the only man who was able to throw any light upon the subject was lying amongst them in an unconscious and halfdying condition apart from motives of hu manity motives of selfinterest made it a matter of the deepest concern to restore animation to that senseless form ben zoof after making the encouraging remark that savants have as many lives as a cat proceeded with negretes assistance to give the body such a vigorous rubbing as would have threat ened serious injury to any ordinary mortal whilst they administered cordials and restoratives from in the first book jules verne told us what happened to one specific part of the earth and gave hypo thetical reasons for these astounding conclusions and their natural conse quences but into this book the author brings the astronomera scien tific genius in his particular field it is he who explains scientifically though temperamentally to be sure just what happened how it happened and why it happened by exact calculation he predicts with correctness the very minute in which their return to earth could be effected though this story is the product of a fantastic imagine tion it is not without the realms of possibility that similar calculations may sometime be made for actual practical purposes
