 amazing stories hans now began to haul upon the cord on one side only the other going as quietly upward as the other came down it fell at last bringing with it a shower of small stones lava and dust a disagreeable kind of rain or hail while we were seated on this extraordinary bench i ventured once more to look downwards with a sigh i discovered that the bottom was still wholly in visible were we then going direct to the interior of the earth the performance with the cord recommenced and a quarter of an hour later we had descended an other two hundred feet i have very strong doubts if the most determined geologist would during that descent have studied the nature of the different layers of earth around him i did not trouble my head much about the matter whether we were among the combustible carbon silurian or primitive soils i neither knew nor cared to know not so the inveterate professor he must have taken notes all the way down for at one of our halts he began a brief lecture the farther we advance said he the greater is my confidence in the result the disposition of these volcana strata absolutely confirms the theories of sir humphrey davy we are still within the region of the primor dial soil the soil in which took place the chemical oxidation of metals becoming inflamed by coming in contact with air and water i at once regret the old and now for ever exploded theory of a central fire at all events we shall soon know the truth such was the conclusion to which he came i was very far from being in humor to discuss the matter i had something else to think of my silence was taken for consent and still we continued to go down at the expiration of three hours we were to all appearance as far off as ever from the bottom of the well when i looked upwards however i could see that the upper orifice was every minute decreasing in size the sides of the shaft were getting closer and closer together we were ap proaching the regions of eternal night and still we continued to descend at length i noticed that when pieces of stone were detached from the sides of this stupendous precipice they were swallowed up with less noise than before the final sound was sooner heard we were approaching the bottom of the abyss as i had been very careful to keep account of all the changes of cord which took place i was able to tell exactly what was the depth we had reached as well as the time it had taken we had shifted the rope twentyeight times each operation taking a quarter of an hour which in all made seven hours to this had to be added twentyeight pauses in all ten hours and a half we had started at one it was now therefore about eleven oclock at night it does not require great knowledge of arithmetic to know that twentyeight times two hundred feet makes five thousand six hundred feet in all more than an english mile while i was making this mental calculation a voice broke the silence it was the voice of hans halt he cried i checked myself very suddenly just at the moment when i was about to kick my uncle on the head we have reached the end of our journey said the worthy professor in a satisfied tone what the interior of the earth said i slip ping down to his side no you stupid fellow but we have reached the bottom of the well and i suppose there is no farther progress to be made i hopefully exclaimed oh yes i can dimly see a sort of tunnel which turns off obliquely to the right at all events we must see about that tomorrow let us sup now and seek slumber as best we may i thought it time but made no observations on that point i was fairly launched on a desperate course and all i had to do was to go forward hope fully and trustingly it was not quite dark even now the light filtering down in a most extraordinary manner we opened the provision bag ate a frugal supper and each did his best to find a bed amid the pile of stones dirt and lava which had accumulated for ages at the bottom of the shaft i happened to grope out the pile of ropes ladders and clothes which we had thrown down and upon them i stretched myself after such a days labor my rough bed seemed as soft as down for a while i lay in a sort of pleasant trance presently after lying quietly for some minutes i opened my eyes and looked upwards as i did so i made out a brilliant little dot at the extremity of this long gigantic telescope it was a star without scintillating rays ac cording to my calculation it must be in the con stellation of the little bear after this little bit of astronomical recreation i dropped into a sound sleep chapter xv we continue our descent at eight oclock the next morning a faint kind of dawn awoke us the thousand and one prisms of the lava collected the light as it passed and brought it to us like a shower of sparks we were able with ease to see objects around us well harry my boy cried the delighted pro fessor rubbing his hands together what say you now did you ever pass a more tranquil night in our house in the kรถnig strasse no deafening sounds of cartwheels no cries of hawkers no bad language from boatmen or watermen well uncle we are quiet at the bottom of this wellbut to me there is something terrible in this calm why said the professor hotly one would say you were already beginning to be afraid how will you get on presently do you know that as yet we have not penetrated one inch into the bowels of the earth what can you mean sir was my bewildered and astonished reply i mean to say that we have only just reached the soil of the island itself this long vertical tube which ends at the bottom of the crater of sneffels ceases here just about on a level with the sea are you sure sir quite sure consult the barometer it was quite true that the mercury after rising gradually in the instrument as long as our descent
