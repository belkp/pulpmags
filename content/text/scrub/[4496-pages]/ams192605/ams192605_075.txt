 amazing stories chapter ix market prices in gallia all right said servadac convinced by the professors ill humor that the danger was past no doubt we are in for a two years excursion but fifteen months more will take us back to the earth and we shall see montmartre again exclaimed ben zoof in excited tones that betrayed his delight in the anticipation to use a nautical expression they had safely rounded the point and they had to be congratulat ed on their successful navigation for if under the influence of jupiters attraction the comet had been retarded for a single hour in that hour the earth would have already traveled miles from the point where contact would ensue and many cen turies would elapse before such a coincidence would possibly again occur on the st of november gallia and jupiter were miles apart it was little more than ten weeks to the th of january when the comet would begin to reapproach the sun though light and heat were now reduced to a twentyfifth part of their terrestrial intensity so that a perpetual twi light seemed to have settled over gallia yet the population felt cheered even by the little that was left and buoyed up by the hope that they should

hakkabut had known nothing since the day he had done his lucky stroke of business he had never left the tartan and after ben zoof on the following day had returned the steelyard and borrowed cash receiving back the paper roubles deposited all communication between the jew and ninas hive had ceased in the course of the few minutes conversation which ben zoof had held with him he had mentioned that he knew the whole soil of gallia was made of gold but the old man guess ing that the orderly was only laughing at him as usual paid no attention to the remark and only meditated upon the means he

proposing to follow the practice of the gauls of old who ad vanced money on bills for payment in a future life hakkabuts future life however was not many months in advance of the present still hakkabut hesitated to make the first ad vance and it was accordingly with much satisfac tion that he hailed captain servadacs appearance on board the hansa hakkabut said the captain plunging without further preface into business we want some coffee some tobacco and other things i have come today to order them to settle the price and tomorrow ben zoof shall fetch the goods away merciful heavens
