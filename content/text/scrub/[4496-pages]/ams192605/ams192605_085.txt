 amazing stories the surface of the soil and had it not been for the necessity of obtaining fresh water it seemed almost probable that no one would ever have made an ef fort to leave the cavern at all a few excursions were made in the downward direction the three leaders with ben zoof made their way to the lower depths of the crater not with the design of making any further examination as to the nature of the rockfor although it might be true enough that it contained thirty per cent of gold it was as valueless to them as granitebut with the intention of ascertaining whether the sub terranean fire still retained its activity satisfied upon this point they came to the conclusion that the eruption which had so suddenly ceased in one spot had certainly broken out in another february march april may passed wearily by but day succeeded to day with such gloomy same ness that it was little wonder that no notice was taken of the lapse of time the people seemed rather to vegetate than to live and their want of vigor be came at times almost alarming the readings around the long table ceased to be attractive and the de bates sustained by few became utterly wanting in animation the spaniards could hardly be roused to quit their beds and seemed to have scarcely energy enough to eat the russians constitutionally of more enduring temperament did not give way to the same extent but the long and drear confinement was beginning to tell upon them all servadac the count and the lieutenant all knew well enough that it was the want of air and exercise that was the cause of much of this mental depression but what could they do the most serious remonstrances on their part were entirely in vain in fact they themselves oc casionally fell a prey to the same lassitude both of body and mind long fits of drowsiness combined with an utter aversion to food would come over them it almost seemed as if their entire nature had become degenerate and that like tortoises they could sleep and fast till the return of summer strange to say little nina bore her hardships more bravely than any of them flitting about coax ing one to eat another to drink rousing pablo as often as he seemed yielding to the common languor the child became the life of the party her merry prattle enlivened the gloom of the grim cavern like the sweet notes of a bird her gay italian songs broke the monotony of the depressing silence and almost unconscious as the halfdormant population of gallia were of her influence they would have missed her bright presence sorely the months glided on how it seemed impossible for the inhabitants of the liv ing tomb to say there was a dead level of dullness at the beginning of june the general torpor ap peared slightly to relax its hold upon its victims this partial revival was probably due to the some what increased influence of the sun still far far away during the first half of the gallian year lieu tenant procope had taken careful note of rosettes monthly announcements of the comets progress and he was able now without reference to the professor to calculate the rate of advance on its way back to wards the sun he found that gallia had recrossed the orbit of jupiter but was still at the enormous distance of leagues from the sun and he reckoned that in about four months it would have entered the zone of the telescopic planets gradually but uninterruptedly life and spirits continued to revive and by the end of the month servadac and his little colony had regained most of their ordinary physical and mental energies ben zoof in particular roused himself with redoubled vigor like a giant refreshed from his slumbers the visits consequently to the longneglected galleries of ninas hive became more and more frequent one day an excursion was made to the shore it was still bitterly cold but the atmosphere had lost nothing of its former stillness and not a cloud was visible from horizon to zenith the old footmarks were all as distinct as on the day in which they had been imprinted and the only portion of the shore where any change was apparent was in the little creek here the elevation of the ice had gone on in creasing until the schooner and the tarton had been uplifted to a height of feet not only rendering them quite inaccessible but exposing them to all but certain destruction in the event of a thaw isaac hakkabut immovable from the personal oversight of his property in the cavern had not ac companied the party and consequently was in bliss ful ignorance of the fate that threatened his vessel a good thing the

months of july and august gallia ad vanced leagues along her orbit at night the cold was still intense but in the daytime the sun here full upon the equator caused an appreciable difference of ì§¸ in the temperature like birds the population spent whole days exposed to its grateful warmth rarely returning till nightfall to the shade of their gloomy home this springtime if such it may be called had a most enlivening influence upon all hope and cour age revived as day by day the suns disc expanded in the sky and every evening the earth assumed a greater magnitude among the fixed stars it was distant yet but the goal was cheeringly in view i cant believe that yonder little speck of light contains my mountain of montmartre said ben zoof one night after he had been gazing long and steadily at the faroff world you will i hope some day find out that it does answered his master i hope so said the orderly without moving his eye from the distant sphere after meditating a while he spoke again i suppose professor rosette couldnt make his comet go straight back could he hush cried servadac ben zoof understood the correction no continued the captain it is not for man to disturb the order of the universe that belongs to a higher power than ours chapter xiv the professor perplexed another month passed away and it was now september but it was still impossible to leave the warmth of the
