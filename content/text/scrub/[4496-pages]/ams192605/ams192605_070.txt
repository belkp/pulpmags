off on a comet palmyrin rosette scratched his head in per plexity glaring round upon his companions as if they were personally responsible for his annoyance he muttered something about finding a way out of his difficulty and hastily mounted the cabinladder the rest followed but they had hardly reached the deck when the chink of money was heard in the room below hakkabut was locking away the gold in one of the drawers back again down the ladder scrambled the little professor and before the jew was aware of his presence he had seized him by the tail of his slouchy overcoat some of your money i must have money he said money gasped hakkabut i have no money he was pale with fright and hardly knew what he was saying falsehood roared rosette do you think i cannot see and peering down into the drawer which the jew was vainly trying to close he cried heaps of money french money fivefranc pieces the very thing i want i must have them the captain and his friends who had returned to the cabin looked on with mingled amusement and bewilderment they are mine shrieked hakkabut i will have them shouted the professor you shall kill me first bellowed the jew no but i must persisted the professor again it was manifestly time for servadac to interefere my dear professor he said smiling allow me to settle this little matter for you ah your excellency moaned the agitated jew protect me i am but a poor man none of that hakkabut hold your tongue and turning to rosette the captain said if sir i understand right you require some silver fivefranc pieces for your operation forty said rosette surily two hundred francs whined hakkabut silence cried the captain i must have more than that the professor con tinued i want ten twofranc pieces and twenty halffrancs let me see said servadac how much is that in all two hundred and thirty francs is it not i dare say it is answered the professor count may i ask you continued servadac to be security to the jew for this loan to the pro fessor loan cried the jew do you mean only a loan silence again shouted the captain count timascheff expressing his regret that his purse contained only paper money begged to place it at captain servadacs disposal no paper no paper exclaimed isaac paper has no currency in gallia about as much as silver coolly retorted the count i am a poor man began the jew now hakkabut stop these miserable lamenta tions of yours once for all hand us over two hun dred and thirty francs in silver money or we will proceed to help ourselves isaac began to yell with all his might thieves thieves in a moment ben zoofs hand was clasped tightly over his mouth stop that howling belshazzar let him alone ben zoof he will soon come to his senses said servadac quietly when the old jew had again recovered himself the captain addressed him now tell us what in terest do you expect nothing could overcome the jews anxiety to make another good bargain he began money is scarce very scarce you know no more of this shouted servadac what in terest i say what interest do you ask faltering and undecided still the jew went on very scarce you know ten francs a day i think would not be unreasonable considering the count had no patience to allow him to finish what he was about to say he flung down notes to the value of several rubles with a greediness that could not be concealed hakkabut grasped them all paper indeed they were but the cunning israelite knew that they would in any case be security far beyond the value of his cash he was making some eighteen hundred per cent interest and accordingly chuckled within
