lost love that curtis was giving me kept me to him mercenary i know but i was living on my own and when i played a big game like this one i had to toss for high stakes well that night curtis came into town and we went on the same old kind of a wild party that we had been used to i flirted with most and drank with the rest the only difference was that it was more exciting for the other men because i was married and more bor ing for me because i knew where the evening would end curtis was a new man though he was a much different person from the one i had picked up on that memorable day in the country he was sophisti cated now and talked wines women and war as though he had been at such parties ever since his fingers were large enough to handle a wine glass but he was still as lightheaded as ever one cocktail to him was worth three in any one else i didnt know that i cared for him the way i did until i saw one of the other women in the party talking to him in an undertone she was murmuring about something which was evidently serious to her though he laughed i leaned over to him and pulled at his sleeve you know a thing like that will clear my head in a second curt i said go way wont you listen im busy cant you see im busy well im your wife and i want you to talk to me run along dearie later so that evening we had our first row on the way home i was all in the wrong but in the morning he came and apologized it was so like himi mean like the boy i had known in the beginningthat i began to care even more i was not only his wife but he treated me at times like a sister the next night we were to go on another party this one larger than any we had both been on together as usual we had cocktails before leaving the apartment i forgot to tell you didnt i that we kept my place in town as well as his country house that was one of his ideas well this night i suddenly got afraid and i didnt want to go curtis was getting to be too much for me lets not go this evening i said what lets not go why not dearie im tired tired yes it isnt any wonder either of course we wont go then do you mind no i dont mind but it would have been good fun he was keenly disappointed and i knew it i knew too that i couldnt keep him away from that sort of thing long he had started fast living and was making up for all the years he had missed you can see my position and it was a curious one for a bride wasnt it i was beginning to feel that i was living a nightmare you see the trou ble was that i loved him well i finally made up my mind and planned accordingly one night about two weeks after that we went into the country again for saturday and sunday i had bro ken my contract with the manager of the company and he had been nice about it but i didnt expect curtis to see the best side he was standing at a cabinet examining a bottle when i spoke to him remember that this was less than a month after the night he proposed to me jack i said i have given up my part what do you mean he didnt move his eyes from the bottle i mean i resignedbroke my con tract why because i am going to have a baby crash went the precious stuff all over a new red carpet and my husband was on his knees beside me suzanne had by accident as she was talking knocked a glass off the table
