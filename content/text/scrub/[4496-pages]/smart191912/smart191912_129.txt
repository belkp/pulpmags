 the octogenarian ated there was no solution that he could devise hours seemed to have passed he stirred in the chair and his legs his arms his back felt intensely weary he stood upthe former giddiness re turned he clutched the bed until it passed and then undressing slowly lay down at last to fall into an uncon sciousness that went from waking to sleeping in imperceptible stages but the next morning when he opened his eyes he discovered that something had happened to him in the night he tried to sit up in bed but his body would not obey the command of his will he repeated his effort sev eral times with no success then for a time he lay very quiet wondering puzzled at last he endea voured to call out his lips moved un evenly and only a strange incompre hensible sound passed between them now he understood in a way what had happened he made no further efforts to rise or speak he waited pa tiently for mabel to come in and find him the time passed very slowly but she entered his room at last she stared at him a moment an irritable question shaping itself for utteranceand then pausing her eyes widened a little and a flush of alarm coloured her cheeks whats the matter she asked he tried to answer the curious re pulsive noise was the only result she hurried across the room and stood by the side of his bed are you in pain she asked with a supreme effort he slowly shook his head from side to side i must go and get the doctor she said can you be alone a little while longer again concentrating his will he made the attempt of physical action this time his head nodded faintly up and down she stared a second longer and then ran out of the room another period of waiting passed during which time seemed suspended he had no measure of it he closed his eyes and when he opened them the doctor was leaning over him counting his pulse beats presently the doctor and mabel left the room together and he could hear them whispering in the hall the doc tors step then receded down the stairs mabel returned he closed his eyes and a benignant calm came over his spirits his mind was growing clearer now and it seemed to him that an immediate relief from all the vague discomforts if his later years was being vouchsafed in these moments he no longer felt useless and helpless nor experienced the urge and necessity of a difficult cunning in order to avoid mabels dis pleasure these terms and conditions had passed he believed he was at the end his spirit was very calm like a longtroubled sea at a truce in the end with the winds time as before was suspended sometimes mabel was in the room sometimes jim he was indifferent they gave him food and he did his best to swallow it their anxieties their ef forts seemed very silly but he did not want to trouble them he was conscious of a number of dawns a number of nightfalls but most of the time he slept then one morning opening his eyes he was surprised to find the old sensa tions in his fingers his arms his legs as an experimental effort he raised his hand he moved the fingers about the old response to his will had returned it was astonishing and for a time al though repeating the evidence he could scarcely bring himself to credit his eyes then at last with a sigh he accept ed the new fact he was going to get well his surprise went from him one who had lived so long had come to know the sardonic waggeries of life for several hours as mabel went in and out he hesitated in revealing the evidence of his progressing recovery he knew it would disappoint her as usual he strank from displeasing her but at last trying some whispered words in private he spoke as she brought in a tray set with his luncheon
