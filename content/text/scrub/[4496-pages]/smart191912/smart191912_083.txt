 lost love i knew youand him and ive lived several years of glorious life but you dont know the reason no her eyes almost closed and she bit her lip no i saw that the subject was not open for discussion just yet so i bided my time and thanked godwho was cer tainly the wrong personfor the extra gin i had expected that the meat course would result in a story but it was not until the waiter was pouring russian dressing over hearts of lettuce that suzanne remarked i have the baby oh i answered vaguely wonder ing why i hadnt instinctively known that there had been a baby i am going to tell you the story becausei dont know why to tell you the truth i suppose it is because you are the sort of person one usually does tell stories to i leaned over the table in anticipa tion look at your cuff it was in the salad you knew curtis she went on i answered that i did well then it will be more inter esting to you she stopped for a moment and seemed to be thinking i am going back to the time i met him but before that i want to tell you that i am inherently good bad ness is a cultivated attraction with me i accepted suzannes statement with some reservation and she knew it you dont know i did know a good deal three years before we had played around together and i had gleaned her history from her own lips but her past was not the main part of her life the present was the play and the past was merely the incidental music lending atmosphere she had been born in lancaster pennsylvania and had gone to school there for nine years up to the age of sixteen when she became a waitress in a restaurant she had been a good girl a backward shy slip of a thing with no manners or anything else of evident importance to the world but from in cidental diners who took her on auto mobile rides and said things she learned that she was of importance most of her friends already knew that one of the momentary travelers was a man connected with the theatrical profession and he promised suzanne that when he reached new york he would find her a position in a chorus she had listened to other promises be fore so when a letter arrived from a prominent producerof whom she later saw a great dealshe was sur prised of course it was the chance of her life she took it her friends who would become local shopgirls envied her andfor such is the way of womensaid very nasty things be hind her back but that didnt feaze suzanne her career was startedand in new york holy of holies a chorus girl who wanted to keep alive devoted most of her energies in those days of a few years ago to en terprise offstage living cost a lot and to get a really substantial meal from an ordinary afterthetheatre party was something which required more than ordinary sagacity but suzanne was apt and she learned to do it to do it well her reputaion how ever rose in indirect proporion to her success the memories of broad country meadows and dew on wet grass often troubled her and at such times she felt that a breath of fresh air was impera tive it was absolutely necessary to get away from square city blocks and high hats and waldorf lunches to ask a young friend to motor her out wouldnt bring the desired freedom it only meant dinner in a roadhouse sandwiched in between thick slices of unsavory bread in the guise of auto mobiling so suzanne had taken to dressing in simple sincere little frocks each sun day and after escaping the city by train wandering out and through the countryside she loved dusty roads
