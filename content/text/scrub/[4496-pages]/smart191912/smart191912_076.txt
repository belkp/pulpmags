repetition generale down his abstract conclusions some years ago in the london saturday review but platitude though it is it still remains for some professor to offer up the concrete proofs at least one such proof occurs to me and this proof is to be found unless i am great ly mistaken in the way life has imi tated the drama in the matter of wo mans confession of sin fifteen years ago when a woman confessed the stain on her past to a man she imitated the maneuvers of the leading woman char acter in the then already long popular henry arthur james drama there were sniffles a la rachel neve tears a la mrs dane tremulous allusions to innocence taken off guard to betrayed trust to moonlight chopin and other such sentimental knockout drops id been brought up in a vil lage i was a child in knowledge i knew nothing of life nothing of the world he was very kind to me he was rich and distinguished and flattered me by his notice and ioh why didnt somebody warn me why did they keep me ignorant i didnt even love him not in that waynot as i love you i tell you i knew nothing nothing nothing till it was too late etc etc but today when a woman confesses an indiscretion of her past to a man does she follow the henry arthur jones model she does not she fol lows the manchester school modelas typified for example by some such dramatist as the late stanley houghton no longer the sniffles tears and apologies it was my fault as much as it was his i was in love with him he was in love with me and thats all there is to it so far so good but god help us poor men if some years hence life in this particular department sees fit to change its latest imitation and proceeds drolly to mimic instead the panto mime america as infantin practically all discussions of american history ideals and character the notion that americans constitute the youngest of great peoples is employed as a rubber stamp the phrase in fact turns up incessantly the average editorial writer would be hamstrung if he were deprived of it what lies behind it is the plain fact that the american re public compared to certain other exist ing governments is relatively young but the american republic is surely not identical with the american people they might overturn it tomorrow and set up a monarchy and still remain the same american people the truth is that as a people they go back fully three hundred years and that even their government is older than those of most other nations e g france ger many england italy moreover it is absurd to say that there is anything properly describable as youthfulness in the american stock americans in the overwhelming main are not young but old they are either wornout individuals detached from other nations or the descendants of such wornout individuals and they show all the signs of senescence what appears to be youth in them is rather second childhood one of the main in dications of that second childhood is their singular timorousness they do not embrace ideas eagerly like such young peoples as the slavs they dis trust all ideas instinctively and have to be brought to accept them by an elabor ate process of suggestion most of what passes for thinking in america is done abroad and chiefly in england if the english once ceased telling americans what to think about every thing from politics to literature and from social amenity to jurisprudence the united states would fall into in tellectual chaos more on the old subjectmost alluring to men is that woman whose wickedness has to it a touch of the angelic and whose virtue a touch of the devil
