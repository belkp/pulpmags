a jest in the household docility would permeate the house anew so too could carrie divine the hid den sources of his laughter his smiles were even more reticent than his cen sure their causes he guarded appre hensively in part in patriarchial vigi lance but more because he feared that here in the household a breath of workaday rabelaisianism would cloud the glass through which the women viewed him he looked upon them at times as beings defenseless and infe rior again as exalted but always out side the human latitude permitted to himself only his wife emerged from these limitations of chivalric pretence brought nearer to him by the unspoken significances of long companionship she was younger in spirit than he and perhaps under this belief in his dignity he felt through her an authen tication of mirth a proof more real than any met outside the house on occasion he permitted her a glimpse into the origins of his merriment there was a feeling of security in the plump comfort of his house coat which as she offered it embraced carrie in the sense of safety in the implicitness of his trust in her comprehension and her reticence he felt no need to caution after all what harm he would ask himself contemplating the jovial lib erality of his expansiveness carrie was a woman of sense his proffers of temptation had the invariability of a ritual he quaked amply in his chair hoping to tantalize her into petition and his mustache would set provokingly like a seal car rie paid no heed till in time the titilla tion of memory and the need of pass ing a good jest along wrung chuckles from him and then carrie would ask what is so funny william would tell her a trifle unctuously as if explaining a technicality to a child and while he guided his laughter into the limit of propriety carrie would pretend to be put out would look at him with the corners of her mouth re pressed and say i dont think thats at all nice and as she took herself off william subsided swaggeringly less certain now chastened beneath his jus tifying expostulation while in his in nermost heart dwelt the grateful cer tainty of her discretion there was a vitality in carrie that imposed the need to share the qual ity of youth allied her more closely to his sister than to her own as william drew from her a sense of validity so she in turn found in aunt may a nexus with youth with the free realms of hope life was not yet stagnant for may to her enjoyment of these stories she brought a candor that renewed their relish for carrie she laughed frank ly with zest for the humanness of the anecdotes carrie could not have re peated them to her own sister myrtle was too refined she said too unsophis ticated but in truth she feared the prim cold intensity of myrtle shrank from the thought of her laughter as from an unsheathed claw mays laughter came low but unfet tered like a girls carrie censorious ness still in her gait would go straight to may giving the tale with williams very pauses and inflections and her eyes would shine at the appreciation that brought light to mays eyes may was careful not to let william hear her yet her wholehearted mirth lingered with carrie giving flavor to the eve ning a warm youngness in whose re flection william himself had a share on such occasions some occult scent drew myrtle to them she loitered chattering of neighborhood doings of the church social and all the while her curiosity lay like a reproach upon aunt may poor myrtle but she shouldnt be so priggish the younger woman set her will and felt it wave under the silent querulous insistence which only spite would deny for beneath the pet tiness of perseverance there was hun ger the pathos of desire for the world
