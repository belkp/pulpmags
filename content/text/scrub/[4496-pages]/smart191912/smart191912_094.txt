the beanstalk the girl singing i sang a song and they laughed at me three hills and a tree five birds and a bee they laughed at me i sang the song ohi sang the song jack jubilantly i sang the song he catches the book firmly under his arm and turns to climb as he does so he pauses a moment to run his hand caressingly about the great stalk suddenly stopping short that was not there before that rift ing in the stalk he looks out over the sky those clouds move swiftly toward the sun from far below the girls voice comes up to him the girl i sang the song jack what have i to fear nowi sang the song he takes the first step of the leaves with a vault and runs up the stair way gaily balancing the book on his shoulder but the clouds were mov ing more swiftly than he thought and a darkness spreads all at once about the vine and the heavy stalk trembles in the storm sounding still clearly through the darkness come the voices of the boy and the girl jack from above sing little girl sing the girl from below i am singingsinging all the way jack only a little while and then it will be light again the girl i can hear you boy down here i can hear you jack and your song comes even here to me the girl at last i have reached your world my boy where are you now jack a moment later your song gave me a new swiftness it has brought me too to your world the girl only a little while jack yesonly a little while and then we shall come back again a great gust of wind drowns their voices then passes carrying with it the storm clouds again there is light but the storm has worked its will and through the very center a great rift cuts in half the beanstalk all women have a secret hope that people regard them as just a bit dangerous a friend is an acquaintance who is on the way to being an enemy
