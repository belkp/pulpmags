what is isnt taurant with a highclass italian clien tle outwardly unpretentious snug gled cozily between taller brownstone fronts on a crossstreet off broadway in the vicinity of lincoln square it is of another world from that of park avenue and its nabobs which is but little less than a mile to the eastward yet rarely does the italian ambassador forego at least one dinner at giros on the occasions of his metropolitan visits and the prince of operatic tenors is a regular patron as a rendezvous for young calvert and bianca holland it very nearly ap proached the ideal while near enough to their homes to be convenient of ac cess detection was the most remote of possibilities yet it provided invariably a variedly delicious menu and the serv ice was as enticingly perfect as that of the smartest restaurant in the city on the day following his indiscreet visit to the holland home calvert ar rived at giros some minutes in advance of the appointed hour of one as was his habit he avoided the larger front room preferring to reach the smaller one in the rear by means of the con necting sidepassage rather than risk the thousandth chance of recognition their tablethe one to which they had been directed on their initial visit more than a year ago and which on sub sequent occasions he had invariably re served by telephonewas located in a partially curtained alcove and not un til he was under the alcove arch did he see that it was unoccupied in his impatience overestimating the time involved in the journey from his wall street office he imagined himself late and the absence of bianca in its first effect was a sickening letdown if nothing happens she had said and there recurred to him too that phrase of hers we are on the knees of the gods but consulting his watch he was re assured she had still six minutes he sat down and of the hovering waiter ordered a cocktail when it was brought and he had drunk it and lighted a cigarette he heard a clock in the front room strike one from that moment he began counting the minutes the fact that she was rarely punctual somehow gave him little con solation today was not like other days if you are not there at one he had told her ill come here he had meant that he still meant it but he must he supposed give her some grace it would only mess things up to goand miss her the question was how long should he wait he contented himself for five min utes his eyes fastened on the edge of the curtain in constant expectation then he gave her five minutes more when it was half gone he resolved that he would not wait beyond the quarter hour he began tapping on the table with the edge of the menucard estimating each tap as a second in this way he counted two minutes more he had begun on the third minute when she came curiously enough he was actually surprised to see her his hope had be come attenuated to that degree he rose but he had no words im awfully sorry she was saying but i couldnt get here a second soon er at the last minute cecile insisted on another fitting of one of my frocks and i was late getting to her because but you must know yourself lee how it is there are always a hundred things to do the last day so long as youre here its all right he smiled but i nearly had the wil lies waiting he had forestalled the waiter by tak ing her wrap and drawing out her chair for her and now when she was seat ed he availed himself of the opportu nity still standing behind her to touch with appreciatively caressing hand the velvet of her throat and cheek by neither a jot nor tittle had he re ceded from his determination of the previous day to follow her abroad whether or no but he had no inten tion to mar their luncheon hour by in troducing the subject before dessert
