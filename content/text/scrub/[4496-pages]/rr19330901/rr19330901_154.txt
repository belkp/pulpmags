fire frenzy sooner or later so theres no point in making a mystery about it also i want to know all you can tell me about this gaynor guywhere you met him and how long youve known him and so forth but how did you come by the gun kay insisted you must tell me that first the sheriff took the gun back from seth and gravely weighed it in his hand as he eyed it critically there aint much doubt he said slowly but what this gun has killed a man kay put her hand up to her throat yesyesgo on one of the fire patrol was coming back over the divide yesterday and there by the headwaters he found a dead man shot through the temple and not thirty feet away he came on this gun lying where the murderer had left it the dead man was a mile or so over on the idaho side of the state line but this guy was headed this way so he brought the gun down to me i called up the sheriff at clear water basin but he was off after a bunch of rustlers and his deputy asked me to help out on the job until he could join me who was the man kay got the question out through parched lips a fellow named scrap johnson who was one of the flying six outfit he he got no further for kay with a cry of mingled relief and dismay sud denly crashed down on the chair near her nono im all right she pushed seth and the sheriff away as they reached out to steady her its just the horrible thought of dads gun being involved in a murder that but how do you know it was murder she demanded with renewed energy there might have been a perfectly fair fight wheres this gaynor bird then why didnt he report it a horrible fear clutched hold of kay perhaps hes killed too she fal tered weve searched all around there the sheriff answered of course this twoday storm has washed out any tracks or clues we could go by but my hunch is that he made a getaway right after the killing and that he has va moosed but why would he have left his gun behind kay protested hed never have done such a stupid thing as that if hed murdered a man search me but weve no time for guessing the sheriff answered impa tiently tell me all you know about him he looked from kay to seth all i know seth broke in is that he turned up here the night of the fire kay had been having him look over some timberland for her and then de cided to have him join the outfit whered you get hold of him in the first place zeke farley turned to kay who braced herself for this ques tion she had been dreading in the midst of her confused horror at this terrible news one thing was clear nothing would make her give the real version of her meeting with ted why i wanted to get hold of some more timberland she began and it seemed a good idea to get someone to go over it so i yesyes never mind all that the sheriff cut her short what i want to know is how did you come to choose gaynor why not someone from around here i dont know just why kay sud denly decided the only line to take was a helpless illogical feminine one i just thought id try him out and then if i liked him he could join the out fit you thought he was a good addi tion didnt you seth she appealed to seth with an attempt to defeat the sheriffs direct questions by irrele vance sure i did seth answered he seemed like an a hand to me but ive been kind of wondering about him
