 ranch romances a mile up the next slope on the trail toward town the mare picked up her ears and whinnied connies heart seemed to stop beating now she told herself do your stuff hes coming icy terror gripped her her throat felt harsh and dry always before this in time of trouble she had need ed to act quickly without much time for thought or fear now she would know if she had the kind of courage needed to sustain her for long drag ging minutesperhaps connie tossed back her head and tried to sing the first few measures of cielito lindo her voice was a husky whispering monotone she swallowed the lump in her throat wet her lips and tried again the result was bizarre and star tling her voice usually so sweet and true was high now and almost shrill neither was she able always to hit the note she aimed at but it was singing of a sort at least she kept doggedly on until she fin ished the song she untied from the saddle the little camp hatchet she al ways carried with her and casually carelessly as she rode beneath an aspen tree chopped off a limb that was hanging over the trail a hun dred yards farther on she chopped off another next she paused to slash a great white blaze upon the trunk of a trailside fir so she rode on up to the hamilton mesa always aware of that lurking stalking rider behind her yet never daring to give sign of that awareness on top of the mesa she tried an other song still riding easily hatchet swinging from limber right wrist this time it was the red river val ley her new effort was a little more successful when she aimed at c she didnt often miss it any farther than b she thought of buck mindon and her voice quivered if this man should shoot her from behindnowmaybe buck would think she was the guile less little fool she looked just a girl without sense enough to realize her own danger now she was down the trail off the hamilton mesa to the mora pecos river still singing intermittently still nicking off limbs and blazing occasional trees at the mora pecos she stopped to eat her lunch and rest and water dolly connie threw herself down by the creek cowboy fashion and tried to drink but the water choked her now she thought if hes going to do it this is the time im in the open an easy shot for two long minutes she lay per fectly still in the grip of the most utter and complete terror she had ever known if she had just had a gun could just do something that would put an end to this endless watching waitingwaiting for she knew not what at last trembling in every muscle she arose took her lunch cut of the saddle bag and made a pretense of eating as the expected shot still did not come connie grew a little more confident as she swung back into the saddle she played with the idea of making a break for it now as soon as i get under cover of the green timber she told herself im going to put my foot on the gas up on the mesa trail a lean dark haired bearded man watched her intently slowly his body relaxed and he drew a breath of something like relief he looked down at his horses feet lay a freshly hewnoff limb of an aspen tree he glanced across the canyon again to where a tiny rider on a tall bay mare was just going into the green timber there was the flash of sun on steel as the riders right arm swung up and down from where he watched he could see a small sprig of some thing green fall to the ground
