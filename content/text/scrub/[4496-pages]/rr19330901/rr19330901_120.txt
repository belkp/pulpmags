show em cowboy before he could hit the trail with a months pay in his pocket oppressed by this thought he moved to the doorway throwing back his head to inhale a revivifying breath of the fresh morning air but he stopped mouth open his entire body stiffening as if from the impact of a sudden blow the doorway of the ranch house kitchen opposite framed a vision of radiant loveliness but brady wilson would rather have faced an array of fortyfives than the girl whose vivid blue eyes flashed a glance across the open space straight into his amazed ones he believed there was a flash of surprise over her face then her red lips formed a slight smile a tantalizing elusive smile and she turned back into the house damn brady exclaimed aloud re treating hastily from sight how did she get here oh suddenly he understood oliver had mentioned a niecedoreen landis of course she lived at the ranchit was her home he experienced no thrill of delight that he would be able to see her every day instead not an inch of his six feet of muscular slenderness but blushed with the ignominy of his posi tion the bunkhouse cook could the pride of a tophand suffer keener humiliation and was a cowboy ever in a more exasperating predicament sight of the cook stove now pro duced positive nausea he would go away at once but nohe couldnt to leave now would be to cover himself with greater indignity than to stick it out for the month he originally in tended but even brady wilsons humor could find no amusement in the situation fear of encountering the girl kept him within the shelter of the cook house none of the men would be in for dinner and he delayed until long past the noon hour to go to the store room not until he no longer heard sounds of activity around the ranch kitchen did he venture across the yard then he moved quickly with furtive glances over his shoulder as he slipped the key into the padlock he heard feminine voices issuing from an upstairs window in the big house one he recognized as belonging to doreen shes safe up there he thought with a sigh of relief from the wellstocked shelves he selected supplies to last a couple of days glances at doreen from safe con cealment were preferable to personal encounters while he labored under the stigma of bunkhouse cook as he emerged from the storeroom the afternoon breeze bore words from that upstairs window straight to his ears i thought he was a cowboy when x saw him in baxter that morning came in the girls clear sweet tones lots of fellows that arent any good at cowpunching fall back on cooking an older rather whining voice said we had one once before that was a fine cook but he was too lazy to be any good on the range damn brady muttered his ears reddening he quickened his steps too he didnt want to hear doreens reply to those comments no matter what she said right then it would be unendurable for some moments he cherished the idea that he would set a supper before the crew which would give every man in the outfit indigestion in his present mood their sufferings would bring brady wilson positive enjoyment but he repudiated that plan no lasting balm for his pride could come from such a course the only trail for him to take was the one that led through thirty days of cooking for the oliver outfit after that hed show folks it was a relief when the men came to supper they talked of range mat ters of the experiences of a hard day working cattle on the rimrocks of a hundred subjects that interested brady momentarily he was able to forget that his had been the ignominious task of peeling the vegetables they ate with such gusto
