you could find a small space for an eng lish girl to appeal for pen pals i have replied to numerous requests printed in ranch romances but up to date i have not had any replies i expect it is because the magazines from which i have taken them have been back numbers i am afraid we experience great difficulty over here to procure recent editions i have therefore arrived at the conclusion that it is pehaps much better to make a personal appeal so here goes as it seems customary to give a description of one self and ones favorite pastime here are mine i am nineteen years of age have blue eyes brown wavy hair and a fair complexion i expect i could pass as good looking on a dark night i am very fond of dancing and i play tennis every day during the season i am a pretty strong swimmer and i
