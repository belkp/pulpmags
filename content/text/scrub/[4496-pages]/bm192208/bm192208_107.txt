 the mistaken sacrifice through the door or a window would have brought them both to safety then the police found out why they had died and they turned to hanley who stared at them in return and gaped at the charred bodies in stunned amaze ment buried in the breast of the audi tor was a long chinese knife through the lungs of ah fu a fortyfour bullet had passed a policeman relieved hanley of his weapon and carefully noted its calibre not a vestige of furniture remained in the place the little office with its books and papers and records of twenty years was completely wiped out at the same time the life of the man who had come to examine them had been takennot by the flames which charred his body but by the steel which still stuck into his breast ah fu who also knew a great deal about the business had passed on to the terrace of perpetual sleep iv of course they arrested hanley and clapped him into jail the examining magistrate smiled at the story of the dog although moy su confirmed the visit of hanley to his little shop moy su however made no mention of the reason why he had telephoned and only when opportunity came did he slip a note for hanley into the hands of his lawyer that note raised the hopes of the man who was going to defend the accused even though it told hanley that his case was hopeless the communication was from ah fu and it was done on the typewriter hanley knew of course that the chinaman had written itbut there was nothing to prove this fact to a jury even the signature could not be confirmed none had ever seen it the chinaman had never thought of thatnor had he planned as shrewdly as his devotion had prompted for a moment hanley looked at the typewritten text and then tossed it away with a contemptuous laugh as its worthlessness and the grim humor of the situation fully dawned upon him to honorable police shanghai china from ah fu now intending to make himself quite dead honorable mr hanley know noth ing about killing the auditing pig ah fu have plenty cause hate him man claybume why so nobody business ah fu stab audit ing pig and then take poison to go join little lotus flower because why he kill clay burne it was crude fiction not even han ley even pretended to believe it yet he saw in an instant what the chinaman had done and why he had done it he told the lawyer and the attorney under stood but he also realized the utter impossibility of convincing the court figuring that clayburne would find something wrong with hanleys books the devoted servant had planned to not only kill the auditor but to destroy the evidence of his masters supposed guilt the pretended reason for his commit ting the crime was of course absurd invention hanley did not even know whether ah fu possessed a sister or a sweetheart if the chinaman had either hanley knew that clayburne had never even seen such a girl any more than had he evidently however ah fu had gone first to kindle the fire and had then intended to finish clayburne and later still attend to the taking of his own life perhaps he feared that if he lived to be questioned he might break down under the examining of the magistrate and recant his confession thus at least compromising his master by dying himself he had evidently decided everything would be well all hanley had to do ah fu thought was to hold his tongue and no one would be the wiser and indeed such might have been the case had it not been for two things
