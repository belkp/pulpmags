a weapon of the law by george w breuker it was very still in the library where judge lathrop sat reading the lamp on the table at his elbow shed a soft circle of light in the centre of the room leaving the outer edges dim and shadowy the house was quiet a small clock in the room had already struck one the judges wife and daughter had been in bed for some hours at last the judge put down the legal tome and sat thinking over what he had read he became so lost in meditation that the door at his left was quietly opened and closed without his hearing it then a low cough brought him out of his abstraction he turned and gazed at the intruder the man he saw standing near the door in the semidarkness was about his own agethat is to say somewhat over forty years he was dressed in shabby clothes that seemed a trifle too large for him a slouch hat was pulled down over his eyes his right hand was thrust in the side pocket of his coat even in that subdued light the gleam of triumph in his eyes was only too ap parent judge lathrop stared at him blankly without moving a muscle well judge said the man with a short hard laugh can you place me weve met before then asked the judge calmly met before thats good the man chuckled evilly you bet your life we met before then i beg your pardon you see youre standing in the shadow if youd be good enough to turn that switch the man eyed him distrustfully none of your tricks now the switch is directly behind you you can find it without turning the judge went on in an even voice without removing his eyes from judge lathrop the man groped for the switch found it and flooded the room with light then he pushed his hat back and planted himself brazenly be fore the judge a sneering smile on his lips maybe you remember me now the judge looked him over carefully and coolly and as he turned away his eyes a look of contempt spread over his face humph jack dodd i believe you call yourself a cheap crook a low down thiefscum of the earth sudden anger flared up in the mans eyes you be damned careful what you say he said between clenched teeth five years ago i sentenced you to ten years imprisonment continued the judge as if be had not heard yes hissed the man and i swore then if i ever got the chance id get youand get you good i suppose you escaped from jail you suppose right and i got these dudswell never mind where i got them hell were wastin time i come here to get even with you you dog the judge folded his hands and smiled i hope you brought a revolver he spoke anxiously the man stared at him a moment and then brought an automatic out of his coat pocket
