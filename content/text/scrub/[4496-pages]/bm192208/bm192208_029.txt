 the phantom check up till the noon hour nothing out of the ordinary happened an assistant one dykes relieved hackett for the coming hour and to him cheever re peated the instructions already given to his predecessor president wines de cided to imitate the detective as to luncheon that day and presently joined him in the directors room anything of importance he asked not yet mr wines cheever an swered but remember that the day is still young soon after dykes knocked at the door and passed in a dozen or so checks cheever with methodical exactness be gan lining the bits of paper across the table but paused abruptly at the fifth check there was nothing about it to attract attention aside from the amount five thousand dollars and even that was not unusual for teller number one to handle every day but the moment the detec tive read the name appended to the check wines who was watching his every move attentively noted that he suddenly gripped the table with his free hand until the knuckles showed white through the brown skin what is it mr cheever he asked quickly but the detective instead of answering countered with another ques tion know him he shot back oh yes wines answered somewhat puzzled by the abrupt interrogation what do you find but again cheever cut him off what do you know about him mr wines he demanded give me facts not fancies remember the president somewhat ruffled an swered just a little stiffly he is one of our largest individual depositors and deals in real estate largely though i believe in a modest way buys and sells stocks and bonds know him long three months possibly mr cheever though i fail to see you will presently the detective grunted see what the other queried the end of a perfect day cheever answered shortly then he handed the check to the now thoroughly perplexed president with this surprising injunction put that away in your desk mr wines in a very private drawer and lock it up also dont let anybody see you put it away as the dazed banker started to obey the detective stopped him to add and i want to see the bank detective at once hes in the lobby i think wines replied ill send him in when teller number one returned from lunch cheever met him at the door of his cage im going to work in the back of your little shop this afternoon hackett he informed the teller ill be pretending to check over some figures or other but in reality hackett ill be listening to your chatter at the window get me i dont know that i do entirely hackett admitted frankly you will presently at any rate the detective assured him grimly and now hackett one thing more talk loud enough for me to hear everything and dont let any customer leave the window without pronouncing his name loud enough so that i can hear it distinctly cheever busied himself in the back of the cage while the mystified teller turned to his duties at the counter but while the detective checked and re checked phantom errors he was listen ing with alert intentness to the bits of conversation that floated back to him whats my balance mr hackett a man inquired presently im going over to prescott this afternoon to pick up a block of city improvement bonds
