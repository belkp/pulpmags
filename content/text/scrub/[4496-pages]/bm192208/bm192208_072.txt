exterior to the evidence he whose first crooked job this prob ably was had forgotten to destroy the results of his practice the unexpected muttered mar rows will come inmany an in stance of it i was certain i was on the right track then weathershaw went on and the next thing to do was to find out all i could about madgwick it would never have done to do this my selfi couldnt go openly or indeed in any way about lithersdale so i telephoned to my office in manchester for an assistant of mine mr hartley whos very clever at making himself up as a working man i told hartley to join me in hallithwaite at once and in the meantime while i waited for him in the town i went round the locksmiths thereworking locksmiths you know some nine or ten of themto try to find out if madgwick had had a key made by one of their number i hit on the man at the end of my round a man named nicholson in back lane i had to tell him who i was and what i was after before i could get any informa tion from him but he gave it freely in the end weathershaw held up the key which etherton had handed over and profess ing to look at it glanced at the man on the lounge sir johns cigar had gone out but as yet weathershaw saw no sign of fear or of anxiety in his face nicholson continued weather shaw made a duplicate of this key for madgwick not so very long ago madg wick went to him with a pencil sketch of a key and asked him if he could make a key from it he said it was for mr etherton nicholson made a key from the drawing madgwick took that key back twice to be filed at one or two points he called again said the key was then all right and paid for it bless me said etherton couldnt have believed it i but now weathershaw went on i had to think out the probable course of events id no doubt that madgwick had looked over your machine carefully but i know that a man cant get at the secret of a machine by seeing a model and madwick wanted morehe wanted the papersthe drawings the specifications now i had a theory it occurred to me that possibly madgwick was in collusion with pike now pike as i had learned had been present hid den behind a curtain at the interview between you mr etherton and sir cheville stanbury and had probably heard your talk about the machine and further had heard you say that you would give your papers to sir cheville to look through i figured that pike had told madgwick of this and that the two knowing sir chevilles habits very intimately had agreed to waylay him on his way home and to take the papers from him that was my theory up to a certain time this evening weathershaw paused for a moment to take a mouthful from the glass which etherton had placed before him on his first entrance his movement seemed to remind sir john arncliffe that he too had a glass near him as if mechanically he took it up drained its contents and then sat empty glass in hand staring at weathershaw as the agent resumed his story at that point continued weather shaw my man hartley arrived dressed like a respectable artisan i gave him certain information and in structions and sent him on to lithers dale where in the role of a man seek ing lodgings he was to go to marriners fold and see if he could find out any thing at all about madgwicks move ments in company with mr sindal i followed hartley to the village later he came to me at the stanbury arms and told me that hed had the best of luck already hed gone to mrs bee
