the phantom check wait a moment he protested a careful and thorough search proved conclusively that it was not in the room now the door being in plain sight i discarded it as a probable means of entrance but i did find that this window here which leads into the directors room was unlatched some employee then wines ex claimed but the detective again cut him off i think that is the conclusion the average man would come to he said enigmatically and there was but one bit of evidence a tiny rift of ashes on the spot left vacant by the removal of the check abruptly he turned to hackett ever notice any ashes mixed up in your checks he asked sharply noyes i have too the teller fairly stuttered in his excitement mr cheever wines said with finality the employees of the bank are not allowed to smoke in the building so where theres ashes theres fire the detective assured him dryly now that little drift of ashes on the table inter ested me i collected it carefully and sunday spent some anxious moments over it of course a novice can tell pipe ashes from cigarette ashes which was it wines cut in eagerly mr wines it was neither neither the banker echoed cheever leaned nearer not tobacco ashes at all mr wines but the ash left when paper is eaten up with certain chemicals you see it now of course esseltine cashed with you among his others some checks treated with powerful chemicals whose mutual reaction was so timed that in a brief while at least within an hour the check literally disappeared hayes and i tried the mixture at his office just before i came back this afternoon and its odor less and colorless with absolutely no sensation of heat or cold it was cer tainly uncanny to sit there and watch a piece of paper disappear before your eyes that explains the losses at hacketts window esseltine cashed checks that were converted into ghosts of checks in short order but dykes and i by comparing notes likely would have remembered an amount as large as five thousand dol lars hackett remarked he could hardly have got away my guess is that he would cheever replied his flivver was at the office and also a grip well packed with dis guises and clothes mostly workingmens stuff we found that his hair was false in reality hes as bald as a cook and hes not as fat as he pretends a lot of thats padding and of course hed have treated himself first of all to a shave at the least hed have been out of here three hours before youd have fixed on him as guilty and three hours is a long time for a man of his shrewdness i think not many smalltown marshals would have picked up a smoothfaced baldheaded not overfat man in greasy overalls and denominated him as gabriel esseltine no mr hackett give him an hours start even and gabriel would have been on his way cheever glanced at his watch and knocking the ashes from his pipe got leisurely to his feet ive got about half an hour to pack my collarbox and hit a train for chi cago he remarked at the office door he paused a dealer in phantoms id call esseltine he chuckled the old boy is certainly there with bells so long
