 the catspaw for two hours i sat at the big library table and went over the case from every angle there were a number of things that puzzled me more than i was willing to admit in the first place who and what had killed michael lannagan i had proved to my own satisfaction and to that of peck that the second man had not been absent from the house an instant from the time that he like the rest of us went into seclusion eight trained detectiveseach an expolice manmen with years of service behind themwere ready to swear that no one had entered the mansion these men had taken turns in watching the place and grounds in shifts of two hours on and two hours off during the entire time since we had been in a state of siege on the other hand i realized that bixby had money and that money will buy almost anything yet i was not ready to con demn these men on mere conjecture then too there was the matter of the special delivery letter who was in such close touch with the moneymaster that they were able to find out to the minute when he had been driven into se clusion outside of our own party only his closest friends knew of our plans and had it been a mere coincidence that the telephone call from the pay station at the pennsylvania depot had come in just after the arrival of the coroner was there someone in the house who was signaling the happenings inside to our enemies on the outside was one of our own number the murderer would he when the time came strike down peck as he had struck down lannagan i reached for the list of those who made up our party and checked it over in the hope that through it i might arrive at the truth in addition to peck his niece and myself there was doctor maxwell an old frienda man im mensely wealthy in his own name and who had been the millionaires private physician for thirty years all of the servants had been in the old mans em ploy for periods ranging from over a quarter of a century of service on the part of mrs langtry the housekeeper to ten years on the part of lannagan the murdered second man peck had hired them all and vouched for them the detectives as i have stated were all men with years of service behind them no on the face of it it seemed like an impossibility yet there was the murder of lannagan to prove the falsity of my reasoning it was shortly after noon when peck and i smoking in the library were brought to our feet by a shriek for help from the servants quarters at the rear of the house drawing my revolver and shoving the millionaire who would have taken the lead behind me i rushed in the direction from which the sound came fred deets who acted as chauffeur and valet for peck was lying on his back in the middle of the kitchen in con vulsions beside him stood mrs mul cahey the cook from whose voluminous lungs the shouts for help were ema nating coincident with my arrival came the others with the exception of the two men stationed at the doors they like the veterans they were re mained at their posts in response to my orders jenkins summoned doctor maxwell who was asleep in his room inside of a minute the physician his emergency kit in his hand made his appearance he shook his head as he bent over the stricken man and felt his pulse for a second there was silence then the physician straightened up with a shrug of his shoulders hes dying he said quietly while mrs mulcahey let out a wail of despair i turned to the physician do you think
