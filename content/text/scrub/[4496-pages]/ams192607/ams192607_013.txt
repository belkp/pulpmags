 amazing stories of the state of physical exhaustion to which i had reduced myself while i waited i fell asleep my head must have dropped forward on the signal table at which i sat and with the headpiece still attached sleep suddenly overcame me on waking i seemed to come suddenly to ray full senses and it immediately struck me with a shock of surprise that it was no longer night it did not take me a moment to realize the fearful neglect of duty of which i had been guilty recall ing as i did the fact that it could not have been much more than an hour after sunset when i fell asleep my first act was to look at the chronometer it marked four oclock this was absolutely be wildering for at four oclock it would not be al ready light hastily removing the headpiece i walked out of the stationhouse the sun was ap proaching the west there could only be one ex planationi had slept over twenty hours remembering that as yet no account of the tragedy of yesterday had been despatched and the urgent need of bringing the facts to the knowledge of the admiralty so that relief might be sent i hastened back to the instrument here another sur prise awaited me to make you understand which a little explanation is necessary it is part of our instructions that when telephoning every word as spoken must be written down in shorthand and every word spoken at the other end must be taken down as received this gives the admiralty two records of everything that passes one at each sta tion which should exactly correspond on opening the record book imagine my surprise to find written down in my own shorthand the re port of a long conversation with the queensland station in which i had apparently given a full ac count of everything that had happened and received replies and instructions i tried to recollect some thing of this but in vain my memory was as it still is and no doubt always will be a complete blank respecting it the only explanation that seemed possible was that i had done this in my sleep or in some state resembling sleep brought on by the abnormal condition in which i had been the evening before a change in physical condition it now occurred to me for the first time what a great change there was in me as compared with the day previous incredible as this unremem bered signalling appeared and nothing but the evi dence of my own notes staring me in the face would have convinced me of it it seemed almost as strange that such a disturbed sleep as it evidently must have been could have restored me in the way it had my nervous condition had quite vanished for i found myself as collected as ever before in my life it might therefore be said i was more than re stored for i could scarcely recognize myself as the same individual that had spent the last few weeks and especially the last days in torturing worry and foreboding it seemed as though the very catastrophe i had apprehended had by its occurrence relieved my mind from the strain if any one had told me some months ago say when last we saw each other that under such circumstances as theseof horror iso lation responsibilityi should be able to take it so calmly i should have been the last to believe it it next occurred to me that i was fearfully hungry as well might be the case and the need suddenly appeared so pressing that it had to be at once attended to never had food tasted so good and yet before i had proceeded far a mouthful seemed to turn to ashes the record book cer tainly contained an account of messages in my hand writing but what evidence was there that it was other than an acted dream dropping my food hunger forgotten i went to the instrument and in less than a minute was talking with queensland my relief was great as i found my account fully confirmed they had received my report and now renewed the instruction to keep as constantly on duty as i am physically capable of since finishing my interrupted meal i have writr ten you this account while keeping within sound of the callsignal it is almost the hour at which i yesterday fell asleep at the instrument that will not happen again but i shall put on the headpiece it is not necessary but somehow i feel as though called to the instrument so goodbye dear may for the present chapter iii what the sagitta discovered it was the afternoon of the th of october the cruiser sagitta was taking a wireless telegragh staff men whose leave had expired from new zealand where their last duty had been to the relief of the station at weihaiwei about six bells a radio message was received in code from a station on the eastern extension cable take staff on board with all dispatch to relief of sta tion x all communication ceased report on ar rival when captain evered received this communica tion he was already well north of the bismarck archipelago as he read it his face could not have become graver had he seen an approaching typhoon on the horizon in a figurative sense that is what he did see promptly the nose of his thirty knotter was de flected to the northeast and she was sent racing at her best pace on the new route which lay through the countless islands of the caroline and marshall groups to where the bottom of the pacific falls into the ammen deep near which his goal was situated he knew that something unusual must have hap pened but the secrecy of the service precluded the possibility of his asking questions it was very possible he thought that whitehall knew no more than he all communication ceased was what lent color to the natural thought that had instantly oc curred to him two young and healthy men are not likely to be totally incapacitated from duty at the same momentfrom natural causes thinking of the two young men concerned in the present case his thoughts took another turn and judging by his expression it did not seem a partic ularly pleasant one encountering the ships doctor on deck soon after the change of course he said what do you think of this message anderson have you any theory illness probably was the reply perhaps said captain evered in a tone of doubt or worse
