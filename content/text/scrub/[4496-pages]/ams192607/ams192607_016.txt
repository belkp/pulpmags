station x ary delusion one could imagine what do you make of him now absolutely no change in my opinion if it is trance it must end in death with probably nothing to show the precise moment of the change do these writings of his throw any light on how he came in the position in which we found him so far as it is written out no but half of it is still in the original shorthand this i cant read myself and i rather hesitate about putting it in the hands of any one on board who can well as you propose to hand the papers to me ill see what i can make of it if its pitmans and fairly well written i think i may be able to make it out and if you wish ill write it out for you thanks if its anything like the record of the day previous i confess i should like to see it wild delusion though it be but take it and read it its very existence from beginning to end shows how unfit he was for the secret service of one of these stations where his madness began i leave you to decide at all events he seems mad enough towards the finish what do you suppose caused him to lose his rea son i dont feel the least doubt about that said captain evered he was a young fellow of con siderable ability but of the nervous imaginative sort unsuited in any case to the life incidental to such a post and when the event happened that left him there alone under circumstances that would have been trying to any one he simply went all to pieces however read the first part of this that is already written out and tell me what you think of it brain and nerve disorders had always been the branch of his profession that had special attraction for dr anderson and the vagaries of unhinged and abnormal minds had been a particular study of his it was therefore with scientific interest that he took macraes writings for perusal after read ing the part that has already been repeated here he came to the point where macrae in the signal room finished his daily entry or letter with the avowed intention of going to the instrument and putting on the receiver or headpiece to quote his own words as though called upon to do so chapter iv the mysterious voice wiat dr anderson began to read in his cabin ran as follows it is not very agreeable my dear may to write what i feel must inevitably make you to be lieve me tobe perfectly mad and will you be far wrong that is the question i am constantly asking myself at all events here are what appear to me to be the exact particulars of my experience after finishing my letter to you yesterday i went and put on the headpiece without knowing myself quite why i did so almost immediately after the receivers were covering my ears i heard a voice and it at once struck me as a very peculiar voice very pleasant and musical but quite different somehow from any i had ever heard it said ma crae are you there having answered i was surprised after a short interval to hear the voice repeat the same ques tion as though i had not been heard but then it occurred to me that i had replied in a very low tone instead of the rather loud and distinct manner of speaking we are instructed to use so i endeavored this time to reply louder but found that i seemed to have almost entirely lost my voice i could only answer in the same manner as before there was a minutes silence and then the same question re peated my inability to reply otherwise than as be fore was most disconcerting for i reflected while that state of things continued i was for the purpose of radio telephony absolutely useless as the only one at the station this would be serious using my best effort but without any extra result from it i answered yes i am attending who are you once more the same question came through the receiver while i sat still wondering what i should do about it the voice spoke again i had been heard and now dear may try to believe me however difficult think should i choose such a terrible time as this for romancing no either this great mar vel has really happened or else i ambut no i must must keep away that terrible thought the strange message from an unknown source the voice said you attend now listen and do not be induced to leave the instrument or fail in the closest attention by the surprise of what you hear also understand that six minutes will elapse before any answer can reach you in reply to any question or remark of yours i am not speaking to you from any point on your planet but from your nearest neighboring world which you call venus but i interrupted you called me by name this went on the voice is an event in the history of your world the immense importance of which others of your fellowbeings will be much better able to realize than you of greater im portance to your world than ours in view of the fact that we are more advanced in intellect and knowledge than yourselves and have therefore less to learn from you than you from us having gleaned all we can from yourself i will pending ar rangements that must be made for your savants to converse with us give you some information re specting ourselves and the world from which i speak to you yes i called you by name you do not remember but we have been in conversation already for twenty hoursas long as your nature could hold out this i will at once explain to you what you call radio telegraphy is the launching through space of etheric impulses which travel outward from the generating centre indefinitely in all directions the medium in which these impulses are propagated is universal unlike sound signals which propagated in the air must be bounded by the atmosphere these etheric signals have no defin ite bounds they are easily detectable here and much further consequently your radio conversations have been eagerly listened to on my world and have aroused an interest that you will scarcely under stand from a time thousands of years before your recorded history commences we have desired to converse with you during all these ages we have been able to see you but not to speak to you this
