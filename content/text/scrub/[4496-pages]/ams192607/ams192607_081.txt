 amazing stories reason our judgment our human ingenuity had nothing to do with the course of events we were about to become the playthings of the great pheno mena of the earth at six oclock we were all up and ready the dreaded moment was arriving when we were about to seek an opening into the interior of the earth by means of gunpowder what would be the conse quences of breaking through the crust of the earth i begged that it might be my duty to set fire to the mine i looked upon it as an honor this task once performed i could rejoin my friends upon the raft which had not been unloaded as soon as we were all ready we were to sail away to some dis tance to avoid the consequences of the explosion the effects of which would certainly not be concen trated in the interior of the earth the slow match we calculated to burn for about ten minutes more or less before it reached the chamber in which the great body of powder was confined i should there fore have plenty of time to reach the raft and put off to a safe distance after a hearty repast my uncle and the hunter guide embarked on board the raft while i remained alone upon the desolate shore i was provided with a lantern which was to enable me to set fire to the wick of the infernal machine go my boy said my uncle and heaven be with you but come back as soon as you can i shall be all impatience be easy on that matter i replied there is no fear of my delaying on the road having said this i advanced toward the opening of the sombre gal lery my heart beat wildly i opened my lantern and seized the extremity of the wick the professor who was looking on held his chronometer in his hand are you ready cried he quite ready well then fire away i hastened to put the light to the wick which crackled and sparkled hiss ing and spitting like a serpent then running as fast as i could i returned to the shore get on board my lad and you hans shove off cried my uncle by a vigorous application of his pole hans sent us flying over the water the raft was quite twenty fathoms distant it was a moment of palpitating interest of deep anxiety my uncle the professor never took his eyes off the chronometer only five minutes more he said in a low tone only four only three my pulse went a hundred to the minute i could hear my heart beating only two one now then mountains of gran ite crumble beneath the power of man the explosion what happened after that as to the ter rific roar of the explosion i do not think i heard it but the form of the rocks com pletely changed in my eyesthey seemed to be drawn aside like a curtain i saw fathomless a bottomless abyss which yawned beneath the turgid waves the sea which seemed suddenly to have gone mad then became one great mountainous mass upon the top of which the raft rose perpendicularly we were all thrown down the light gave place to the most profound obscurity then i felt all solid support give way not to my feet but to the raft itself i thought it was going bodily down a tremendous well i tried to speak to question my uncle nothing could be heard but the roaring of the mighty waves wo clung together in utter silence despite the awful darkness despite the noise the surprise the emotion i thoroughly understood what had happened beyond the rock which had been blown up there existed a mighty abyss the ex plosion had caused a kind of earthquake in this soil broken by fissures and rents the gulf thus suddenly thrown open was about to swallow the inland sea which transformed into a mighty tor rent was dragging us with it one only idea filled my mind we were utterly and completely lost one hour two hourswhat more i cannot say passed in this manner we sat close together el bow touching elbow knee touching knee we held one anothers hands not to be thrown off the raft we were subjected to the most violent shocks whenever our sole dependence a frail wooden raft struck against the rocky sides of the channel fortunately for us these concussions became less and less frequent which made me fancy that the gallery was getting wider and wider there could be no doubt that we had chanced upon the road once followed by saknussem but instead of going down in a proper manner we had through our own im prudence drawn a whole sea with us these ideas presented themselves to my mind in a very vague and obscure manner i felt rather than reasoned i put my ideas together only confusedly while spinning along like a man going down a waterfall to judge by the air which as it were whipped my face we must have been rushing at a perfectly lightning rate to attempt under these circumstancse to light a torch was simply impossible and the last remains of our electric machine of our ruhmkorfs coil had been destroyed during the fearful explosion i was therefore very much confused to see at last a bright light shining close to me the calm coun tenance of the guide seemed to gleam upon me the clever and patient hunter had succeeded in lighting the lantern and though in the keen and thorough draught the flame flickered and vacillated and was very nearly put out it served partially to dissipate the awful obscurity the gallery into which we had entered was very wide i was therefore quite right in that part of my conjecture the insufficient light did not allow us to see both of the walls at the same time the slope of waters which was carrying us away was far greater than that of the most rapid river the whole surface of the stream seemed to be composed of liquid arrows darted forward with extreme vio lence and power i can give no idea of the impres sion it made upon me all instruments lost except the compass and chronometer the raft at times caught in certain whirl pools and rushed forward yet turned on it self all the time how it did not upset i shall never be able to understand when it approached the sides of the gallery i took care to throw upon them the light of the lantern and i was able to
