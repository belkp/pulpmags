 amazing stories chapter xxxviii no outletblasting the rock ever since the commencement of our marvel ous journey i had experienced many sur prises had suffered from many illusions i thought that i was casehardened against all sur prises and could neither see nor hear anything to amaze me again however when i saw these two letters which had been engraved three hundred years before i stood fixed in an attitude of mute surprise not only was there the signature of the learned and enterprising alchemist written in the rock but i held in my hand the identical instrument with which he had laboriously engraved it it was im possible without showing an amount of incredulity scarcely becoming a sane man to deny the existence of the traveler and the reality of that voyage which i believed all along to have been a myththe mysti fication of some fertile brain while these reflections were passing through my mind my uncle the professor gave way to an ac cess of feverish and poetical excitement wonder ful and glorious genius great saknussem he cried you have omitted no resourse to show to other mortals the way into the interior of our mighty globe and your fellowcreatures can find the trail left by your illustrious footsteps three hundred years ago you have been careful to secure for others the contemplation of these wonders and marvels of creation your name engraved at every important stage of your glorious journey leads the hopeful traveler direct to the mighty discovery to which you devoted such energy and courage the audacious traveler who shall follow your footsteps to the last will doubtless find your initials engraved with your own hand upon the center of the earth i will be that audacious traveleri too will sign my name upon the very same spot upon the central granite stone of this wondrous work of the creator but in justice to your devotion and to your being the first to indicate the road let this cape seen by you upon the shores of this sea discovered by you be called for all time cape saknussem this is what i heard and i began to be roused to the pitch of enthusiasm indicated by those words a fierce excitement roused me i forgot everything the dangers of the voyage and the perils of the re turn journey were now as nothing what another man had done in ages past could i felt be done again i was determined to do it myself and now nothing that man had accomplished appeared to me impossible forwardforward i cried in a burst of genuine and hearty enthusiasm where the raft brought them i had already started in the direction of the somber and gloomy gallery when the profes sor stopped me he the man so rash and hasty he the man so easily roused to the highest pitch of anthusiasm checked me and asked me to be patient and show more calm let us return to our good friend hans he said we will then bring the raft down to this place i must say that though i at once yielded to my uncles request it was not without dissatisfaction and i hastened along the rocks of that wonderful coast do you know my dear uncle i said as we walked along that we have been singularly helped by a concurrence of circumstances right up to this very moment so you begin to see it do you harry said the professor with a smile doubtless i responded and strangely enough even the tempest has been the means of putting us on the right road blessings on the tempest it brought us safely back to the very spot from which fine weather would have driven us forever sup posing we had succeeded in reaching the southern and distant shores of this extraordinary sea what would have become of us the name of saknussem would never have appeared to us and at this mo ment we should have been cast away upon an in hospitable coast probably without an outlet yes harry my boy there is certainly some thing providential in that wandering at the mercy of wind and waves towards the south we have come back exactly north and what is better still we fall upon this great discovery there is something in it which is far beyond my comprehension the coincidence is unheardof marvelous what matter it is not our duty to explain facts but to make the best possible use of them doubtless my boy but if you will allow me said the reallydelighted professor a discussion of geography excuse me sir but i see exactly how it will be we shall take the northern route we shall pass under the northern regions of europe under sweden under russia under siberia and who knows hereinstead of burying ourselves under the burning plains and deserts of africa or beneath the mighty waves of the ocean and that is all at this stage of our journey that i care to know let us advance and heaven will be our guide yes harry you are right quite right all is for the best let us abandon this horizontal sea which could never have led to anything satisfactory we shall descend descend and everlastingly de scend do you know my dear boy that to reach the interior of the earth we have only five thousand miles to travel bah i cried carried away by a burst of en thusiasm the distance is scarcely worth speaking about the thing is to make a start my wild mad and incoherent speeches continued until we rejoined our patient and phlegmatic guide all was we found prepared for an immediate de parture there was not a single parcel out of its proper place we all took up our posts on the raft and the sail being hoisted hans received his direc tions and guided the frail barque towards cape saknussem as we had definitely named it the wind was very unfavorable to a craft that was unable to sail close to the wind we were con tinually reduced to pushing ourselves forward by means of poles on several occasions the rocks ran far out into deep water and we were compelled to make a long round at last after three long and weary hours of navigation that is to say about six oclock in the evening we found a place at which we could land i jumped on shore first in my present state of excitement and enthusiasm i was always first my
