a trip to the center of the earth judge of the rapidity of motion by looking at the projecting masses of rock which as soon as seen were again invisible i believe we were going at a rate of not less than a hundred miles an hour my uncle and i looked at one another with wild and haggard eyes we clung convulsively to the stump of the mast which at the moment when the catastrophe took place had snapped short off we turned our backs as much as possible to the wind in order not to be stifled by a rapidity of motion which nothing human could face and live and still the long monotonous hours went on the situation did not change in the least though a dis covery i suddenly made seemed to complicate it very much when we had slightly recovered our equili brium i proceeded to examine our cargo i then made the unsatisfactory discovery that the greater part of it had utterly disappeared i became alarmed and determined to discover what were our resources my heart beat at the idea but it was absolutely necessary to know on what we had to depend with this in view i took the lantern and looked around of all our former collection of nautical and phil osophical instruments there remained only the chronometer and the compass the ladders and ropes were reduced to a small piece of rope fastened to the stump of the mast not a pickax not a crow bar not a hammer and far worse than all no food not enough for one day i this discovery was a prelude to a certain and horrible death seated gloomily on the raft clasp ing the stump of the mast mechanically i thought of all i had read as to sufferings from starvation i remembered everything that history had taught me on the subject and i shuddered at the remem brance of the agonies to be endured maddened at the prospect i persuaded myself that i must be mis taken i examined the cracks in the raft i poked between the joints and beams i examined every possible hole and corner the result wassimply nothing our stock of provisions consisted of noth ing but a piece of dry meat and some soaked and halfmouldy biscuits i gazed around me scared and frightened i could not understand the awful truth and yet of what consequence wras it in regard to any new danger supposing that we had had provisions for months and even for years how could we ever get out of the awful abyss into which we were being hurled by the irresistible torrent we had let loose why should we trouble ourselves about the sufferings and tor tures to be endured from hunger when death stared us in the face under so many other swifter and perhaps even more horrid forms an alarming ascent through a great shaft i had the greatest mind to reveal all to my uncle to explain to him the extraordinary and wretched position to which we were re duced and in order that between the two we might make a calculation as to the exact space of time which remained for us to live it was it appeared to me the only thing to be done but i had the courage to hold my tongue to gnaw at my entrails like the spartan boy i wished to leave him all his coolness at this moment the light of the lantern slowly fell and at last went out the wick had wholly burnt to an end the obscurity became absolute it was no longer possible to see through the impene trable darkness there was one torch left but it was impossible to keep it alight then like a child i shut my eyes that i might not see the darkness after a great lapse of time the rapidity of our journey increased i could feel it by the rush of air upon my face the slope of the waters was ex cessive i began to feel that we were no longer go ing down a slope we were falling i felt as one does in a dream going down bodilyfalling falling falling i felt that the hands of my uncle and hans were vigorously clasping my arms suddenly after a lapse of time scarcely appreciable i felt something like a shock the raft had not struck a hard body but had suddenly been checked in its course a water spout a liquid column of water fell upon us i was suffocating i was being drowned still the sud den inundation did not last in a few seconds i felt myself once more able to breathe my uncle and hans pressed my arms and the raft carried us all three away chapter xl the ape gigans it is difficult for me to determine what was the the real time but i should suppose by after calculation that it must have been ten at night i lay in a stupor a half dream during which i saw visions of astounding character monsters of the deep were side by side with the mighty elephan tine shepherd gigantic fish and animals formed strange conjunctions it seemed in my vision that the raft took a sudden turn whirled round entered another tunnel this time illumined in a most sing ular manner the roof was formed of porous stal actite through which a moonlit vapor appeared to pass casting its brilliant light upon our gaunt and haggard figures the light increased as we ad vanced while the roof ascended until at last we were once more in a kind of water cavern the lofty dome of which disappeared in a luminous cloud my uncle and the guide moved as men in a dream i was afraid to waken them knowing the danger of such a sudden start i seated myself beside them to watch as i did so i became aware of something moving in the distance which at once fascinated my eyes it was floating apparently upon the surface of the water advancing by means of what at first appeared paddles i looked with glaring eyes one glance told me that it was something monstrous but what it was the great shark crocodile of the early writers on geology about the size of an ordinary whale with hideous jaws and two gigantic eyes it advanced its eyes fixed on me with terrible sternness some indefinite warning told me that it had marked me for its own i attempted to riseto escape no matter where but my knees shook under me my limbs trembled violently i almost lost my senses and still the mighty monster advanced my uncle and the guide made no effort to save themselves with a strange noise like none other i had ever heard the beast came on his jaws were at least seven feet apart
