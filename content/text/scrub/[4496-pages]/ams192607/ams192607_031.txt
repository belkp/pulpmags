 amazing stories flowers he said nothing presently he ventured to lean over the table and smell the violets they were freshpicked and very fine ones then he stared at mr fotheringay again how did you do that he asked mr fotheringay pulled his moustache just told itand there you are is that a miracle or is it black art or what is it and what do you thinks the matter with me thats what i want to ask its a most extraordinary occurrence and this day last week i knew no more that i could do things like that than you did it came quite sudden its something odd about my will i suppose and thats as far as i can see is thatthe only thing could you do other things besides that lord yes said mr fotheringay just any thing he thought and suddenly recalled a conjur ing entertainment he had seen here he point ed change into a bowl of fishnot not that change into a glass bowl full of water with gold fish swimming in it thats better you see that mr maydig its astonishing its incredible you are either a most extraordinary but no i could change it into anything said mr foth eringay just anything here be a pigeon will you in another moment a blue pigeon was fluttering round the room and making mr maydig duck every time it came near him stop there will you said mr fotheringay and the pigeon hung motionless in the air i could change it back to a bowl of flowers he said and after replacing the pigeon on the table worked that miracle i expect you will want your pipe in a bit he said and restored the tobaccojar mr maydig very much interested mr maydig had followed all these later changes in a sort of ejaculatory silence he stared at mr fotheringay and in a very gingerly manner picked up the tobaccojar ex amined it replaced it on the table well was the only expression of his feelings now after that its easier to explain what i came about said mr fotheringay and proceeded to a lengthy and involved narrative of his strange experiences beginning with the affair of the lamp in the long dragon and complicated by persistent allusions to winch as he went on the transient pride of mr maydigs consternation had caused passed away he became the very ordinary mr fotheringay of everyday intercourse again mr maydig listened intently the tobaccojar in his hand and his bearing changed also with the course of the narrative presently while mr fotheringay was dealing with the miracle of the third egg the minister interrupted with a fluttering extended hand it is possible he said it is credible it is amazing of course but it reconciles a number of amazing difficulties the power to work miracles is a gifta peculiar quality like genius or second sight hitherto it has come very rarely and to ex ceptional people but in this case i have al ways wondered at the miracles of mahomet and at yogis miracles and the miracles of madame bla vatsky but of course yes it is simply a gift it carries out so beautifully the arguments of that great thinker mr maydigs voice sankhis grace the duke of argyll here we plumb some profounder lawdeeper than the ordinary laws of nature yesyes go on go on chapter vi a long talk with the clergyman about miracles mr fotheringay proceeded to tell of his misadventure with winch and mr maydig no longer overawed or scared began to jerk his limbs about and interject astonishment its this what troubled me most proceeded mr fotheringay its this im most mijitly in want of advice for of course hes at san francisco wherever san francisco may bebut of course its awkward for both of us as youll see mr maydig i dont see how he can understand what has hap pened and i dare say hes scared and exasperated something tremendous and trying to get at me i dare say he keeps on starting off to come here i send him back by a miracle every few hours when i think of it and of course thats a thing he wont be able to understand and its bound to annoy him and of course if he takes a ticket every time it will cost him a lot of money i done the best i could for him but of course itss difficult for him to put himself in my place i thought afterwards that his clothes might have got scorched you know if hades is all its supposed to bebefore i shift ed him in that case i suppose theyd have locked him up in san francisco of course i willed him a new suit of clothes on him directly i thought of it but you see im already in a deuce of a tangle mr maydig looked serious i see you are in a tangle yes its a difficult position how you are to end it he became diffused and inconclusive however well leave winch for a little and dis cuss the larger question i dont think this is a case of the black art or anything of the sort i dont think there is any taint of criminality about it at all mr fotheringaynone whatever unless you are suppressing material facts no its miraclespure miraclesmiracles if i may say so of the very highest class he began to pace the hearthrug and gesticulate while mr fotheringay sat with his arm on the table and his head on his arm looking worried i dont see how im to manage about winch he said a gift of working miraclesapparently a very powerful gift said mr maydig will find a way about winchnever fear my dear sir you are a most important mana man of the most astonishing possibilities as evidence for example and in other ways the things you may do yes ive thought of a thing or two said mr fotheringay butsome of the things came a bit twisty you saw that fish at first wrong sort of bowl and wrong sort of fish and i thought id ask some one a proper course said mr maydig a very proper coursealtogether the proper course he stopped and looked at mr fotheringay its prac tically an unlimited gift let us test your powers
