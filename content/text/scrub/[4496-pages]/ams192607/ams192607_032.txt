the man who could work miracles for instanceif they really are if they really are all they seem to be the clergyman calls for more miracles and so incredible as it may seem in the study of the little house behind the con gregational chapel on the evening of sunday nov mr fotheringay egged on and inspired by mr maydig began to work miracles the readers attention is specially and definitely called to the date he will ob ject probably has objected that certain points in this story are improbable that if any things of the sort already described had indeed occurred they would have been in all the papers at that time the details immediately following he will find par ticularly hard to accept because among other things they involve the conclusion that he or she the reader in question must have been killed in a violent and unprecedented manner more than a year ago now a miracle is nothing if not improbable and as a matter of fact the reader was killed in a violent and unprecedented manner in in the subse quent course of this story that will become perfectly clear and credible as every rightminded and reas onable reader will admit but this is not the place for the end of the story being but little beyond the hither side of the middle and at first the miracles worked by mr fotheringay were timid little mir acleslittle things with the cups and parlour fit ments as feeble as the miracles of theosophists and feeble as they were they were received with awe by his collaborator he would have preferred to settle the winch business out of hand but mr maydig would not let him but after they had worked a dozen of these domestic trivialities their sense of power grew their imagination began to show signs of stimulation and their ambition en larged their first larger enterprise was due to hunger and negligence of mrs minchin mr maydigs housekeeper the meal to which the min ister conducted mr fotheringay was certainly ill laid and uninviting as refreshment for two indus trious miracleworkers but they were seated and mr maydig was descanting in sorrow rather than in anger upon his housekeepers shortcomings be fore it occurred to mr fotheringay that an oppor tunity lay before him dont you think mr maydig he said if it isnt a liberty i my dear mr fotheringay of course no i dont think chapter vii a miraculous meal and many reforms mr fotheringay waved his hand what shall we have he said in a large inclusive spirit and at mr maydigs or der revised the supper very thoughtfully as for me he said eyeing mr maydigs selection i am always particularly fond of a tankard of stout and a nice welsh rarebit and ill order that i aint much given to burgundy and forthwith stout and welsh rarebit promptly appeared at his command they sat long at their supper talking like equals as mr fotheringay presently perceived with a glow of surprise and gratification of all the miracles they would presently do and bytheby mr maydig said mr fotheringay i might perhaps be able to help youin a domestic way dont quite follow said mr maydig pouring out a glass of miraculous old burgundy mr fotheringay helped himself to a second welsh rarebit out of vacancy and took a mouthful i was thinking he said i might be able chum chum to work chum chum a miracle with mrs minchin chum chummake her a better woman mr maydig put down the glass and looked doubt ful shesshe strongly objects to interference you know mr fotheringay andas a matter of factits well past eleven and shes probably ip bed and asleep do you think on the whole mr fotheringay considered these objections i dont see that it shouldnt be done in her sleep for a time mr maydig opposed the idea and then he yielded mr fotheringay issued his orders and a little less at their ease perhaps the two gentle men proceeded with their repast mr maydig was enlarging on the changes he might expect in his housekeeper next day with an optimism that seemed even to mr fotheringays supper sense a little forced and hectic when a series of confused noises from upstairs began their eyes exchanged inter rogations and mr maydig left the room hastily mr fotheringay heard him calling up to his house keeper and then his footsteps going softly up to her in a minute or so the minister returned his step light his face radiant wonderful he said and touching most touching he began pacing the hearthrug a repentance a most touching repentancethrough the crack of the door poor woman a most wonderful change she had got up she must have got up at once she had got up out of her sleep to smash a private bottle of brandy in her box and to confess it too but this gives usit opensa most amazing vista of possibilities if we can work this miracu lous change in her the things unlimited seemingly said mr foth eringay and about mr winch altogether unlimited and from the hearthrug mr maydig waving the winch difficulty aside un folded a series of wonderful proposalsproposals he invented as he went along now what those proposals were does not concern the essentials of this story suffice it that they were designed in a spirit of infinite benevolence the sort of benevolence that used to be called postprandial suffice it too that the problem of winch remained unsolved nor is it necessary to describe how far that series got to its fulfilment there were as tonishing changes the small hours found mr may dig and mr fotheringay careering across the chilly market square under the still moon in a sort of ecstasy of thurmaturgy mr maydig all flap and gesture mr fotheringay short and bristling and no longer abashed at his greatness they had re formed every drunkard in the parliamentary divi sion changed all the beer and alcohol to water mr maydig had overruled mr fotheringay on this point they had further greatly improved the railroad communication of the place drained flin ders swamp improved the soil of one tree hill and cured the vicars wart and they were going to see what could be done with the injured pier at
