amazing stories the scientific adventures of mr fosdick by jacque morgan the feline light and power company is organized concluded mendous electrical pressure with which he was charged a bolt of sheet rubber was passed in the next morning however and fosdick set to work fashioning some insuulating shoes for john l these were immpleted by noon and the fifty thousand morbid spectators that had come in by special trains breathlessly watched the experiment rubber shod the cat was dropped to the groundand it survived a great cheer went up from the crowd this had no sooner subsided than prof snooks realized that a terrible mistake had been made hastily grabbing a megaphone from a barker of one of the numerous side shows that had set up their tents everywhere he addres sed the crowd he told them that john l was at liberty charged with perhaps a hundred million volts of elec tricity and that contact with him could mean but one thingdeath in stantly there was a wild commotion in the terrorized crowd and then a wild flight from the awful peril by night fall the railroads had deported thirty nine train loads of people and save for the few that could find rubber boots the streets of whiffleville were as lifeless as the shady paths of the neighboring cemetery rubber and rubber alone could pro tect them against the deadly menace of john l this all realized a thoughtless humanitarian bill hitch cock by the name made rubber boots for his three dogs one of the dogs that very afternoon spying john l set sail for him and although he man aged only to touch the tail of the cat ha became charged with the deadly electrical pressure and worse the dog coming home rubbed noses with hitchcocks other two dogs charging them with three electrical dogs and one electrical cat at large only the foolhardy ventured abroad casualties multiplied and the two charged subjects are still in captivity within the next twentyfour hours there were a number of casualties about nine in the evening old tige the largest of the dogs came in contact with a lamp post the post was instantly fused off even with the ground and the gas became ignited making a geyser of flame that shot a hundred feet heaven ward the dog died later in the night another one of the dogs ran against a barbwire fence killing ten head of stock four miles away that dog also died at daybreak there was a loud explosion in the outskirts of the town it is thought that this came from a cat fight in which john l par ticipated at any rate he has never been seen since and today only a pa thetic hole in the ground marks his probable last battlefield the remaining dog was captured at great peril to life and turned over to prof snooks for experimental pur poses by gradually drawing off the electrical charge by means of a con denser the professor in a weeks time reduced the dogs pressure to approxi mately five thousand volts and then the animal was further discharged by hooking him up to the town arc light system of fifty lamps which he main tained in the splendid effulgence of over two thousand candle power for a period of nine hours and eleven min utes before his power ran down mr fosdick and mr stetzle are now living on two insulated stools in the laboratory of doolittle college their potential is dropping at the rate of ten volts a day and prof snooks has calculated that they must remain there for the next years three months and two days before being fully dis charged it seems a great pity the end in preparation these stories will soon appear in amazing stories a columbus of
