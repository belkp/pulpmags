station x most exactly a threeminute journey so that ma craes six minutes for replies is quite correct again there are the remarks of the supposed venerian as to the backward state socially of us terrestrials ill not adopting a universal language and on other social questions can you imagine them as emanat ing from macrae speaking of languages does this writing strike you where the venerian is sup posed to be speaking as being in macraes style by jove anderson you are right now this really is interesting perhaps this shorthand that follows will throw light on it as well as on his present condition by the by i hope it wont last much longer it becomes increasingly difficult to keep it from the crew i am glad to see you are at last interested but there is a task before me here it is so long since i used pitman that i have almost forgotten the signs it proved quite as difficult as the doctor expected and it was far into the night before he had finished but he was too absorbed in the contents to leave it before it was done chapter v captain evered gets the transcription the next morning dr anderson handed to captain evered his transcription of macraes shorthand what do you make of it was the question as they walked towards the captains cabin id rather not say until youve read it sir was the response lest you think me mad as you think macrae now im going to turn in ive not long finished it in order to keep macraes condition from the crew and for the doctors better private observa tion of him anderson had given up his cabin and was for the time accommodated in a screenedoff corner of the barbette transcription of the mysterious communication captain evered shut himself in his cabin and unfolded the manuscript which ran are you there macrae yes i am here although on thinking it over after our talk yesterday i decided not to be why i decided i would prefer to leave it until there were others here with me since you told me i was not listening to a human voice i seem somehow to shrink from it it is uncanny also some time after i left the instrument the doubt came back that it might be all a delusion so you decided not to come to the instrument for this appointment but as the time approached you altered your mind or rather your mind altered and you felt inclined to attend is that so well yes that is exactly how it was quite so that is as it should be while you are talking with me do you entertain any doubt of my existence not at the time i can distinctly feel that you are somewhere that there is some one besides myself exactly across the abyss you feel my personal influence i think macrae you must be exception ally adapted even among your impressionable spe cies for the role you are filling be quite convinced of my objective reality from this time onward dis miss any idea to the contrary from your mind let no such doubt occur to you again with respect to the other point you raise although you do not know anything of bodily forms here do not let that trouble you the curiosity that will doubtless exist among your fellowbeings respecting us shall be fully satisfied later for the present try to realize that the body is but the raiment it is the being who is clothed with it that alone signifies in view of what i am about to say to you it is essential that you should keep that fixed in your mind as it will help you to understand for the rest look upon us here as the friends of your kind how urgently you are in need of our assistance you are about to learn for it has been decided here that in view of this wonderful opportunity which accident might interfere with not another day should be lost in acquainting you with the particu lars as the message is not for you alone be very careful in your written report of it now listen attentively a warning from a friendly planet a terrible danger threatens from which nothing but the fortunate accident of your getting in communication first with me may save you if saved you are to be that you should the better understand what you are about to hear it is necessary to begin by recounting to you some long past events relating to life in other worlds than yours or mine the mystery of the origin of life like that of matter is an ocean depth where no plummet of the finite mind can find a bottom it is sufficient illus tration of the crudity of your ideas on the subject that there should be any doubt among you as to the other planetary members of our system being in habited you now have proof that one other is so and must take my word for it that there is good reason why no planet under such temperature and other conditions as render life possible can remain barren of organic development but there have been times in the past when such conditions have not obtained when the various members of our system have been too heated for life to be possible in consequence of the more rapid cooling of the smaller planets the first to be the scene of life was your satellite the moon this was millions of years ago and the climatic conditions on it then were very different from now it then had abundant atmosphere and humidity and afforded a site for life development long ages before your world or ours was so suited the inevitable result under these conditions fol lowed it became covered with a myriad forms of living creatures out of which finally emerged one by virtue of its mental superiority combined with sufficient bodily fitness to dominate all in obedi ence to the laws of development this race advanced to higher and higher powers attaining a position similar to that held by you in your world and by us in ours now you must conceive the lapse of a vast period of time before the great tragedy of which i am about to speak took place
