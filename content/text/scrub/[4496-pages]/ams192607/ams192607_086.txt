a trip to the center of the earth ometer was wanting and no summary estimation could take the place of it the temperature risesthey are floating on lava as we progressed the temperature increased in the most extraordinary degree and i be gan to feel as if i were bathed in a hot and burning atmosphere never before had i felt any thing like it i could only compare it to the hot vapor from an iron foundry when the liquid iron is in a state of ebullition and runs over by degrees and one after the other hans my uncle and myself had taken off our coats and waistcoats they were unbearable even the slightest garment was the cause of extreme suffering are we ascending to a living fire i cried when to my horror and astonishment the heat be came greater than before no no said by uncle it is simply impossible quite impossible and yet said i touching the side of the shaft with my naked hand this wall is literally burn ing at this moment feeling as i did that the sides of this extraordinary wall were red hot i plunged my hands into the water to cool them i drew them back with a cry of despair the water is boiling i cried my uncle the professor made no reply other than a gesture of rage and despair something very like the truth had probably struck his imagination an invincible dread took possession of my brain and soul i could only look forward to an immedi ate catastrophe such a catastrophe as not even the most vivid imagination could have thought of an idea at first vague and uncertain was gradually being changed into certainty it was so terrible an idea that i scarcely dared to whisper it to myself yet all the while certain and as it were involun tary observations determined my convictions by the doubtful glare of the torch i could make out some singular changes in the granitic strata a strange and terrible phenomenon was about to be produced in which electricity played a part then this boiling water this terrible and excessive heat i determined as a last resource to examine the com pass the compass had gone mad yes wholly stark staring mad the needle jumped from pole to pole with sudden and surprising jerks ran round or as it is said boxed the compass and then ran suddenly back again as if it he had the vertigo terrible detonations like heavens artillery be gan to multiply themselves with fearful intensity i could only compare them with the noise made by hundreds of heavilyladen chariots being madly driven over a stone pavement it was a continuous roll of heavy thunder they are in the volcanic shaft of a crater in full action and then the mad compass shaken by the wild electric phenomena confirmed me in my rap idly formed opinion the mineral crust was about to burst the heavy granite masses were about to rejoin the fissure was about to close the void was about to be filled up and we poor atoms to be crushed in its awful embrace uncle uncle i cried we are wholly irretrievably lost what then my young friend is your new cause of terror and alarm he said in his calmest man ner what fear you now what do i fear now i cried in fierce and angry tones do you not see that the walls of the shaft are in motion do you not see that the solid granite masses are cracking do you not feel the terrible torrid heat do you not observe the awful boiling water on which we float do you not remark this mad needle every sign and portent of an aw ful earthquake my uncle coolly shook his head an earth quake he questioned in the most calm and pro voking tone yes my nephew i tell you that you are utterly mis taken he continued do you not can you not recognize all the well known symptoms of an earthquake by no means i am expect ing something far more important my brain is strained beyond endurancewhat what do you mean i cried an eruption harry an eruption i gasped we are then in the volcanic shaft of a crater in full action and vigor i have every reason to think so said the pro fessor in a smiling tone and i beg to tell you that it is the most fortunate thing that could hap pen to us the most fortunate thing had my uncle really and truly gone mad what did he mean by these awful wordswhat did he mean by this terrible calm this solemn smile what cried i in the height of my exasperation we are on the way to an eruption are we fatality has cast us into a well of burning and boiling lava of rocks on fire of boiling water in a word filled with every kind of eruptive matter we are about to be expelled thrown up vomited spit out of the interior of the earth in common with huge blocks of granite with showers of cinders and scoria in a wild whirlwind of flame and you saythe most fortunate thing which could happen to us yes replied the professor looking at me calm ly from under his spectacles it is the only chance which remains to us of ever escaping from the in terior of the earth to the light of day it is quite impossible that i can put on paper the thousand strange wild thoughts which followed this extraordinary announcement but my uncle was right quite right and never had he appeared to me so audacious and so convinced as when he looked me calmly in the face and spoke of the chances of an eruptionof our being cast upon mother earth once more through the gaping crater of a volcano it is not a shaft of sneffels while we were speaking we were still as cending we passed the whole night going up or to speak more scientifically in an ascensional motion the fearful noise redoubled i was ready to suffocate i seriously believed that my last hour was approaching and yet so strange is imagination all i thought of was some childish hy pothesis or other in such circumstances you do not choose your own thoughts they overcome you
