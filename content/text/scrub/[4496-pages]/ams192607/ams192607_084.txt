a trip to the center of the earth air or dashed to atoms against the top i fancy already that the air is beginning to be close and condensed i have a difficulty in breathing this might have been fancy or it might have been the effect of our rapid motion but i certainly felt a great oppression of the chest harry said the professor i do believe that the situation is to a certain extent desperate there remain however many chances of ultimate safety and i have in my own mind been revolving them during your heavy but agitated sleep i have come to this logical conclusionwhereas we may at any moment perish so at any moment we may be saved we need therefore to prepare ourselves for what ever may turn up in the great chapter of accidents but what would you have us do i cried are we not utterly helpless no while there is life there is hope at all events there is one thing we can doeat and thus obtain strength to face victory or death as he spoke i looked at my uncle with a haggard glance i had put off the fatal communication as long as possible it was now forced upon me and i must tell him the truth still i hesitated eat i said in a deprecating tone as if there were no hurry yes and at once i feel like a starving pris oner he said rubbing his yellow and shivering hands together and turning round to the guide he spoke some hearty cheering words as i judged from his tone in danish hans shook his head in a terribly significant manner i tried to look uncon cerned the provisions gone what cried the professor do you mean to say that all our provisions are lost yes was my lowly spoken reply as i held out something in my hand this morsel of dried meat is all that remains for us three my uncle gazed at me as if he could not fully appreciate the meaning of my words the blow seemed to stun him by its severity i allowed him to reflect for some moments well said i after a short pause what do you think now is there any chance of our escaping from our horrible subterranean dangers are we not doomed to perish in the great hollows of the center of the earth but my pertinent questions brought no answer my uncle either heard me not or appeared not to do so and in this way a whole hour passed neither of us cared to speak for myself i began to feel the most fearful and devouring hunger my companions doubtless felt the same horrible tor tures but neither of them would touch the wretched morsel of meat that remained it lay there a last remnant of all our great preparations for the mad and senseless journey i looked back with wonderment to my own folly fully was i aware that despite his enthusiasm and the evertobe hated scroll of saknussem my uncle should never have started on his perilous voyage what memories of the happy past what previsions of the horrible future now filled my brain chapter xli hunger hunger prolonged is temporary madness the brain is at work without its required food and the most fantastic notions fill the mind hitherto i had never known what hunger really meant i was likely to understand it now only too well after dreaming for some time and thinking of this and other matters i once more looked around me we were still ascending with fearful rapidity every now and then the air appeared to check our respiration as it does that of aeronauts when the ascension of the balloon is too rapid but if they feel a degree of cold in proportion to the elevation they attain in the atmosphere we experienced quite a contrary effect the heat began to increase in a most threatening and exceptional manner i can not tell exactly the mean but i think it must have reached degrees of fahrenheit what was the meaning of this extraordinary change in the temperature as far as we had hitherto gone facts had proved the theories of davy and of lidenbrock to be correct until now all the peculiar conditions of refractory rocks of electric ity of magnetism had modified the general laws of nature and had created for us a moderate tempera ture for the theory of the central fire remained in my eyes the only explainable one were we then going to reach a position in which these phenomena were to be carried out in all their rigor and in which the heat would reduce the rocks to a state of fusion such was my not unnat ural fear and i did not conceal the fact from my uncle my way of doing so might be cold and heart less but i could not help it if we are not drowned or smashed into pancakes and if we do not die of starvation we have the satisfaction of knowing that we must be burned alive my uncle in presence of this brusque attack simply shrugged his shoulders and resumed his re flectionswhatever they might be an hour passed away and except that there was a slight increase in the temperature no incident modified the situation my uncle at last of his own accord broke silence well harry my boy he said in a cheerful way we must make up our minds make up our minds to what i asked in consid erable surprise wellto something we must at whatever risk recruit our physical strength if we make the fatal mistake of husbanding our little remnant of food we may probably prolong our wretched existence a few hoursbut we shall remain weak to the end yes i growled to the end that however will not keep us long waiting well only let a chance of safety present itself only allow that a moment of action be necessary where shall we find the means of aetion if we allow ourselves to be reduced to physical weakness by in anition when this piece of meat is devoured uncle what hope will there remain unto us none my dear harry none but will it do you any good to devour it with your eyes you appear
