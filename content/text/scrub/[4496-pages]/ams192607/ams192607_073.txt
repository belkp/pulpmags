 amazing stories i had been reading these books without his knowl edge and thus he was often at a loss to account for the forcible impression which had been made upon my fancy the popular belief in omens discussed a favorite topic with me was the popular belief in omens a belief which at this one epoch of my life i was almost seriously disposed to defend on this subject we had long and animated discussions he maintaining the utter groundlessness of faith in such matters i contending that a popular sentiment arising with absolute spontaneitythat is to say without apparent traces of suggestionshad in itself the unmistakable elements of truth and was entitled to much respect the fact is that soon after my arrival at the cottage there had occurred to myself an incident so entirely inexplicable and which had in it so much of the portentous character that i might well have been excused for regarding it an omen it appalled and at the same time so confounded and bewildered me that many days elapsed before i could make up my mind to communicate the circumstances to my friend an awful apparition near the close of an exceedingly warm day i was sitting book in hand at an open window commanding through a long vista of the river banks a view of a distant hill the face of which nearest my posi tion had been denuded by what is termed a land slide of the principal portion of its trees my thoughts had been long wandering from the volume before me to the gloom and desolation of the neigh boring city uplifting my eyes from the page they fell upon the naked face of the hill and upon an objectupon some living monster of hideous con formationwhich very rapidly made its way from the summit to the bottom disappearing finally in the dense forest below as this creature first came in sight i doubted my own sanity or at least the evidence of my own eyes and many minutes passed before i succeeded in convincing myself that i was neither mad nor in a dream yet when i describe the monster which i distinctly saw and calmly sur veyed through the whole period of its progress my readers i fear will feel more difficulty in being convinced of these points than even i did myself estimating the size of the creature by compari son with the diameter of the large trees near which it passedthe few giants of the forest which had escaped the fury of the landslidei concluded it to be far larger than any ship of the line in existence i say ship of the line because the shape of the monster suggested the idea the hull of one of our seventyfours might convey a very tolerable con ception of the general outline the mouth of the animal was situated at the extremity of a proboscis some sixty or seventy feet in length and about as thick as the body of an ordinary elephant near the root of this trunk was an immense quantity of black shaggy hairmore than could have been sup plied by the coats of a score of buffaloes and pro jecting from his hair downwardly and laterally sprang two gleaming tusks not unlike those of the wild boar but of infinitely greater dimension ex tending forward parallel with the proboscis and on each side of it was a gigantic staff thirty or forty feet in length formed seemingly of pure crystal and in shape a perfect prismit reflected in the most gorgeous manner the rays of the declining sun the trunk was fashioned like a wedge with the apex to the earth from it there were outspread two pairs of wingseach wing nearly one hundred yards in lengthone pair being placed above the other and all thickly covered with metal scales each scale apparently some ten or twelve feet in diameter i observed that the upper and lower tiers of wings were connected by a strong chain but the chief peculiarity of this horrible thing was the repre sentation of a deaths head which covered nearly the whole surface of its breast and which was as accurately traced in glaring white upon the dark ground of the body as if it had been there carefully designed by an artist while i regarded this ani mal and more especially the appearance on its breast with a feeling of horror and awewith a sentiment of forthcoming evil which i found it im possible to quell by any effort of the reasoni per cieved the huge jaws at the extremity of the pro boscis suddenly expand themselves and from them there proceeded a sound so loud and so expressive of woe that it struck upon my nerves like a knell and as the monster disappeared at the foot of the hill i fell at once fainting to the floor upon recovering my first impulse of course was to inform my friend of what i had seen and heard and i can scarcely explain what feeling of repug nance it was which in the end operated to pre vent me again terrorized by the apparition reappearing at length one evening some three or four days after the occurrence we were sitting to gether in the room in which i had seen the apparitioni occupying the same seat at the same window and he lounging on a sofa near at hand the association of the place and time impelled me to give him an account of the phenomenon he heard me to the endat first laughed heartily and then lapsed into an excessively grave demeanor as if my insanity was a thing beyond suspicion at this instant i again had a distinct view of the mon ster to which with a shout of absolute terror i now directed his attention he looked eagerly but main tained that he saw nothing although i designated minutely the course of the creature as it made its way down the naked face of the hill i was now immeasurably alarmed for i consid ered the vision either as an omen of my death or worse as the forerunner of an attack of mania i threw myself passionately back in my chair and for some moments buried my face in my hands when i uncovered my eyes the apparition was no longer visible my host however had in some degree resumed the calmness of his demeanor and questioned me very rigorously in respect to the conformation of the visionary creature when i had fully satisfied him on this head he sighed deeply as if relieved of some intolerable burden and went on to talk with what i thought a cruel calmness of various points of speculative philosophy which had heretofore formed a subject of discussion between us i re
