 amazing stories south bridge the place gasped mr maydig wont be the same place tomorrow how surpris ed and thankful every one will be and just at that moment the church clock struck three chapter viii the rotation of the earth stopped i say said mr fotheringay thats three i oclock i must be getting back ive got to be at business by eight and besides mrs wimms were only beginning said mr maydig full of the sweetness of unlimited power were only be ginning think of all the good were doing when people wake but said mr fotheringay mr maydig gripped his arm suddenly his eyes were bright and wild my dear chap he said theres no hurry look he pointed to the moon at the zenithjoshua joshua said mr maydig why not stop it mr fotheringay looked at the moon thats a bit tall he said after a pause why not said mr maydig of course it doesnt stop you stop the rotation of the earth you know time stops it isnt as if we were doing harm hm said mr fotheringay well he sighed ill try here he buttoned up his jacket and addressed himself to the habitable globe with as good an assumption of confidence as lay in his power jest stop ro tating will you said mr fotheringay incontinently he was flying head over heels through the air at the rate of dozens of miles a minute in spite of the innumerable circles he was describing per second he thought for thought is wonderfulsometimes as sluggish as flowing pitch sometimes as instantaneous as light he thought in a second and willed let me come down safe and sound whatever else happens let me down safe and sound mr fotheringay starts a terrific storm he willed it only just in time for his clothes heated by his rapid flight through the air were already beginning to singe he came down with a forcible but by no means injurious bump in what appeared to be a mound of freshturned earth a large mass of metal and masonry extraordinarily like the ciocktower in the middle of the market square hit the earth near him ricochetted over him and flew into stonework bricks and cement like a bursting bomb a hurtling cow hit one of the larger blocks and smashed like an egg there was a crash that made all the most violent crashes of his past seem like the sound of falling dust and this was followed by a descending series of lesser crashes a vast wind roared throughout earth and heaven so that he could scarcely lift his head to look for a while he was too breathless and as tonished even to see where he was or what had hap pened and this movement was to feel his head and reassure himself that his streaming hair was still his own lord gasped mr fotheringay scarce able to speak for the gale ive had a squeak whats gone wrong storms and thunder and only a minute ago a fine night its maydig set me on to this sort of thing what a wind if i go on fooling in this way im bound to have a thundering accident wheres maydig what a confounded mess everythings in he looked about him so far as his flapping jacket would permit the appearance of things was really extremely strange the skys all right anyhow said mr fotheringay and thats about all that is all right and even there it looks like a terrific gale coming up and even theres the moon over head just as it was just now bright as midday but as for the restwheres the village wheres wheres any thing and what on earth set this wind ablowing i didnt order no wind chapter ix a strenuous life mr fotheringay struggled to get to his feet in vain and after one failure remain ed on all fours holding on he surveyed the moonlit world to leeward with the tails of his jacket streaming over his head theres something seriously wrong said mr fotheringay and what it isgoodness knows far and wide nothing was visible in the white glare through the haze of dust that drove before a screaming gale but tumbled masses of earth and heaps of inchoate ruins no trees no houses no familiar shapes only a wilderness of disorder van ishing at last into the darkness beneath the whirling columns and streamers the lightnings and thunder ings of a swiftly rising storm near him in the livid glare was something that might once have been an elmtree a smashed mass of splinters shivered from boughs to base and further a twisted mass of iron girdersonly too evidently the viaductrose out of the piled confusion you see when mr fotheringay had arrested the rotation of the solid globe he had made no stipu lation concerning the trifling movables upon its sur face and the earth spins so fast that the surface at its equator is travelling at rather more than a thousand miles an hour and in these latitudes at more than half that pace so that the village and mr maydig and mr fotheringay and everybody and everything had been jerked violently forward at about nine miles per secondthat is to say much more violently than if they had been fired out of a cannon and every human being every living creature every house and every treeall the world as we know it had been so jerked and smashed and utterly de stroyed that was all getting rid of the power of performing miracles these things mr fotheringay did not of course fully appreciate but he perceived that his miracle had miscarried and with that a great disgust of miracles came upon him he was in darkness now for the clouds had swept to gether and blotted out his momentary glimpse of the moon and the air was full of fitful struggling tortured wraiths of hail a great roaring of wind continued on page
