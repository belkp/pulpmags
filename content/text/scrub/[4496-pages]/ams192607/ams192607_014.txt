station x what do you mean sir was the startled re tort do you think that germany my first thought was that the storm had burst said captain evered but if such an idea had been entertained at home the message would have been worded differently we live in such ticklish times that every precaution must be taken but i dont think that is the explanation no communication with station x then have you some other theory i dont like to call it a theory but i brought those two fellows out from eng land and i cant forget what an illpaired couple they were captain evered lit a cigarette in other words you think it possible there has been trouble queried the doctor you were not with us on the outward voyage and so have not met them wilson showed every sign of being a martinet and a surly one at that macrae the engineer and operator is more difficult to describe he is wellmeaning but with little edu cation very nervous and of weak will no vice but no ballast so we have the undisciplined temper of one the peculiar unstable character of the other and extremely trying conditionshow trying they can be is known only to those who have been boxed up together for months in that way i hope there has been no row between them very likely not but nothing would surprise me very much the one thing certain is that neither of them is on duty and the more i think of it the less i believe in outside interference such a thing would be an overt act of war of which there would be other signs by now station x was thoroughly fitted for radio tele graphy as well as with the incomparably larger plant for longdistance telephony as the distance between herself and the island diminished the sagitta made repeated efforts to call up the station but received no reply on the morning of the th the island was raised a tiny speck on the oceans rim when near enough for the glass to show every detail on cliff and shore the cruiser made the tour of it as a measure of precaution but no sign of life was visible either on land or water she then fired a rocket to attract attention and waited but in vain captain evereds face was the picture of aston ishment what had happened to the chinaman even assuming the worst in regard to macrae and wil son turning to his first lieutenant he said mr fletcher take the cutter and go and investi gate anderson will go with you let the men stay by the boat while you and anderson land if you see no sign of any one signal me to that effect and proceed to the stationhouse take your revolvers be careful to disturb nothing that has any bearing on what has happened and return as soon as you can landing from the sagitta the boats crew were piped away and were soon pulling for the shelving beach the two officers landed and proceeded to climb the cliff they stood for a moment the whole in terior of the island lying like a map before them they were watched with much curiosity from the sagitta in order to preserve the secret of station x every precaution had been taken to hide from the noncommissioned ranks the fact that there was any secret connected with it or anything different from the other various stations periodically visited as it is always the unusual that is most like to be talked about captain evered intended to take every means to hide any discovery of a remarkable na ture in connection with the present visit that there was something out of the usual routine could not be hidden but he hoped that the statement that there was a case of sickness on the island would be sufficient explanation whatever the full facts of the case might be this was why the doctor had been made one of the landingparty the agreed sign that nothing was visible was made and the two men disappeared over the cliff the station looks all right at all events said the doctor but no sign of anybody where the dickens can the fellows have got to they pressed on for the stationhouse and pushed open the door which was closed but not latched on the floor on its back lay the body of macrae with an overturned chair beside him the appear ance irresistibly suggested that the poor fellow had been sitting at the table in front of the instrument when from some unexplained cause he had fallen backward chair and all striking the floor with the back of his head there was no sign that he had made any subsequent effort dead said the doctor after a brief examina tion but where are the others catalepsy or death the various rooms of the bungalowbuilt sta tionhouse were thoroughly searched but there was nothing to throw any light on their absence can you tell the cause of the operators death anderson inquired lieutenant fletcher no replied the doctor there is no sign of violence its very strange possibly the papers will show something of what has happened suggested fletcher but i think wed better not interfere with them ill go back and report no doubt the chief will then come ashore rightoh said the doctor who had turned his attention again to the body in the signalroom lieutenant fletcher accordingly returned to the sagitta and made his report with the result that captain evered immediately decided to go ashore himself and make a personal examination of the island on arriving at the stationhouse he went straight to the signalroom where he found dr anderson kneeling by the body of macrae fletcher and i thought you had better see the place before anything was touched sir said an derson looking up hes dead questioned captain evered indicat ing macrae i thought so at first was the reply captain evered looked sharply at the speaker for both in the words and tone there was a significance answering the look anderson proceeded i have made a further examination and im not now
