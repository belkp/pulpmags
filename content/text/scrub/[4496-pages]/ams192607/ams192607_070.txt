the magnetic storm entire western front this is not such a foolish nor such a big undertaking as you might think my calculations show that if we were to string highly insulated copper wires onequarter inch thick on telegraph poles behind the front the problem would become a simple one ordinary telegraph poles can be used and each pole is to carry twenty wires begin ning three feet above the ground each wire is spaced two feet distant from the next one these wires run continuous from the sea to switzerland moreover every ten miles or so we place a huge kilowatt generating plant with its necessary spark gaps condensers etc the feed wires from these generating plants then run into the thick wires strung along the telegraph poles forming the gigantic tesla primary coil of course you realize that in a scheme of this kind it is not necessary to run the telegraph poles actually parallel with every curve of the actual front that would be a waste of material but we will build our line along a huge flat curve which will sometimes come to within one half mile of the front and sometimes it will be as much as fifteen miles behind it the total length of the line i estimate to be about miles that gives us generating plants or a total power of kilowatts a similar line is built along the italian front which is roughly one hundred miles long at present that gives us another kilowatts bringing the total up to now the import ant part is to project the resultant force from this huge tesla primary coil in one direction only namely that facing the enemy this i find can be readily accomplished by screening the wires on the telegraph poles at the side facing our way as well as by using certain impedance coils the screen is nothing else but ordinary thin wire netting fastened on a support wire between the telegraph poles this screen will then act as a sort of electric reflector so sparks demonstrated by means of one of his sketches everything completed we turn on the highfre quency current into our line from the sea to little switzerland immediately we shoot billions of volts over germany and austria penetrating every cor ner of the central empires every closed coil of wire throughout germany and austria be it a dynamo armature or a telephone receiver coil will be burnt out due to the terrific electromotive force set up inductively to our primary current in other words every piece of electrical apparatus or mach inery will become the secondary of our tesla coil no matter where located moreover the current is to be turned on in the day time only it is switched off during the night the night is made use of to ad vance the telegraph poles over the recaptured land new ones can be used with their huge primary coil wires for i anticipate that the enemy must fall back turning off the power does not work to our disadvantage for it is unreasonable to suppose that the teutons will be able to wind and install new coils and armatures to replace all the millions that were burnt out during the day such a thing is im possible besides once we get the germans moving it ought to be a simple matter to follow up our ad vantage for you must not forget that we will de stroy all their electrical communications with one stroke no aeroplane no automobile will move throughout the central states in other words we will create a titanic artificial magnetic storm such as the world has never seen but its effect will be vastly greater and more disastrous than any natural magnetic storm that ever visited this earth nor can the germans safeguard themselves against this electric storm any more than our telegraph com panies can when a real magnetic storm sweeps over the earth also every german telegraph or tele graph line in occupied france and belgium will be our ally these insulated metallic lines actually help us to guide our energy into the very heart of the enemys countries the more lines the better for us because all lines act as feed wires for our high frequency electrical torrents at nomeny near the frontier a few kilometers north of nancy in the de partment of meurthe et moselle there is a little town by the name of nomeny it is a progressive thrifty little french town of chief im portance principally for the reason that here for four years during the great war the french army has been nearer to the german frontier than at any other point with the exception of that small por tion of alsace actually in the hands of the french nomeny in the military sense is in the toul sec tor which sector early in was taken over by the americans if you happened to go up in a captive balloon near nomeny you could see the spires of the metz cathedral and the great german fortress but kilometers away always presuming that the air was clear and you had a good glass on a superb warm summer morning there were queer doings at a certain point in the outskirts of nomeny all of a sudden this point seemed to have become the center of interest of the entire french british and american armies since dawn the mili tary autos of numerous high allied officers had been arriving while the grayblue uniforms of the french officers were forever mixing with the businesslike khaki of the british and americans the visitors first gave their attention to the camouflaged oddlooking telegraph poles which resembled huge harps with the difference that the wires were running horizontally the telegraph line stretching from one end of the horizon to the other a few hundred yards back of this line there was an old brewery from which ran twenty thick wires connecting the brewery with the telegraph poles to this brewery the high officers next strolled an inspection here revealed a ponderous kilowatt generator purring almost silently on its shining brass plate was the legend made in u s a there was also a huge wheel with large queer round zinc pieces attached to the axis of this wheel was a big electric motor but it was not running now there were also dozens of huge glass jars on wooden racks lined against the wall pon derous copper cables connected the jars with the huge wheel one of the french officers who previous to the war had been an enthusiastic wireless amateur was much interested in the huge wheel and the large glass bottles aha said he turning to his ques tioning american confrere l eclateur rotatif et les bouteilles de leyde there was little satisfaction in this but just then
