 amazing stories dr anderson leaned back with the air of a man who challenges confutation quite so said captain evered i see your point ill go through this again and we will have a further talk about it what is your theory so far i have none sir replied anderson none whatever im completely at fault a theory searched for to solve the mystery in the course of the day captain evered read macraes story again looking out for the dif ferent points indicated by the doctor and he realized the force of his observations anderson is right he muttered macrae no more wrote this out of his own head than i did couldnt have done it who the devil did it captain evered had arrived at the same point previously reached by dr anderson the doctor was meanwhile curious as to the re sult of evereds further study of the document to wards evening he was sent for queer thing this radio telegraphy and telephony anderson said captain evered as the doctor en tered his cabin do you believe in the planets be ing inhabited professor rudge is firmly convinced that one at least is he considers schiaparellis discoveries to have absolutely proved it so far as mars is con cerned he wants in fact to try and signal to them in some way other scientists are convinced that if that planet is not inhabited it shows many signs that it is not uninhabitable so rudge wants to get into communication with them does he a possibly dangerous proceeding according to this said captain evered tapping the manuscript their eyes met for a moment the doctor re mained silent look here anderson i believe were both agreed that this yarn of macraes is quite the tallest weve ever heard and also that there is some mystery about it that wants clearing up the infernal thing has been running through my head all day and i am no forwarder are you your case sir is mine exactly im stuck an derson confessed then what ought i to do if you really wish to know what i should do were i in your place sir i should ask the admiralty to trust some eminent scientist such as professor rudge whom we just mentioned with the secret of the station and place macraes writings in his handsand so wash yours of all responsibility capital thats what ill do there is a further point in its favor professor rudge as the inven tor of the method of this new system of telephony without which these long distance installations would have been impossible was called into con sultation when they were contemplated and their sites chosen he already knows of the existence of station x then there can be no difficulty i only wish in addition to placing the papers in his hands we could place there macrae also poor fellow you still see no chance of his recovery if he is not actually dead it cannot be quite hopeless can it im quite convinced he will rnot recover but in sensibly merge from his trance into death said anderson with conviction here their conversation was interrupted by some one knocking at the door come in said captain evered and a sailor put in his head if you please sir mr macrae has got out of his bunk and is walking about the ship in his blanket asking for you sir he seems a bit dazed like ye gods muttered anderson as he and cap tain evered left the cabin chapter vi professor rudge investigates never was a medical man more pleased at a wrong diagnosis than dr anderson in re gard to the mysterious case of alan macrae to the natural satisfaction of seeing the return to life of a patient of whom he had despaired was added the anticipation of probing further the inter esting problem that now engrossed their thoughts there was now a chance that he would be able to investigate for himself not only into the mental state of macrae but also into his character and at tainments and so definitely satisfy himself as to whether this alleged communication had taken place he had already convinced himself that a belief in its possibility was far from scientifically absurd and he knew that in this he was backed by some of the most eminent scientists of the day on taking charge of his patient he at once saw that the poor fellow was not so much dazed as excited and it was some time before he could be soothednot iri fact until it had been explained to him how he came to be on board the sagitta dr anderson answered his questions while getting him as quickly as possible back to his cabin macrae then gradually calmed down took nourishment and slept thereby relieving dr anderson from the fears he was beginning to entertain a quick recovery of the operator from his catalyptic state after this he made a quick recovery showing that there was nothing organically wrong and that the elasticity of youth had not been permanently impaired two days elapsed before dr anderson would allow his patient to be ques tioned as to what had happened to him in the sig nalroom of station x macrae on his part showed no disposition to discuss the subject it was partly on account of this tacit avoidance of it on the in valids part that dr anderson deprecated the sub ject being forced on him too soon the blow he said whatever it was was struck on the nervous system and if there is any danger for him it is there we must look for it toward the close of the second day macrae seemed so fully hiinself again apart from some physical weakness that the doctor decided that there would be no harm in a little judicious ques tioning he had already convinced himself that there was no trace of insanity in his patient he therefore determined to ascertain if macrae were really averse to entering on the topic and if not to prepare him for a visit from captain evered
