a trip to the center of the earth phenomenon without being able to find for it any satisfactory explanation nevertheless it appeared quite clear to me that we were not in the principal chimney of the volcano but in an accessory conduit where we felt the countershock of the great and principal tunnel filled by burning lava it is impossible for me to say how many times this maneuver was repeated all that i can remember is that on every ascensional motion we were hoisted up with everincreasing velocity as if we had been launched from a huge projectile during the sudden halts we were nearly stifled during the moments of projection the hot air took away our breath i thought for a moment of the voluptuous joy of suddenly finding myself in the hyperborean regions with the cold degrees below zero my exalted im agination pictured to itself the vast snowy plains of the arctic regions and i was impatient to roll myself on the icy carpet of the north pole by de grees my head utterly overcome by a series of vio lent emotions began to give way to hallucination i was delirious had it not been for the powerful arms of hans the guide i should have broken my head against the granite masses of the shaft i have in consequence kept no account of what followed for many hours i have a vague and con fused remembrance of continual detonations of the shaking of the huge granitic mass and of the raft going round like a spinning top it floated on the stream of hot lava amidst a falling cloud of cinders the huge flames roaring wrapped us around a storm of wind which appeared to be cast forth from an immense ventilator roused up the interior fires of the earth it was a hot incandescent blast at last i saw the figure of hans as if enveloped in the huge halo of burning blaze and no other sense remained to me but that sinister dread which the condemned victim may be supposed to feel when led to the mouth of a cannon at the supreme mo ment when the shot is fired and his limbs are dis persed into empty space chapter xliii daylight at last when i opened my eyes i felt the hand of the guide clutching me firmly by the belt with his other hand he supported my uncle i was not grievously wounded but bruised all over in the most remarkable manner after a moment i looked around and found that i was lying down on the slope of a mountain not two yards from a yawn ing gulf into which i should have fallen had i made the slightest false step hans had saved me from death while i rolled insensible on the flanks of the crater where are we dreamily asked my uncle who literally appeared to be disgusted at having re turned to earth the eiderdown hunter simply shrugged his shoulders as a mark of total ignor ance in iceland i replied not positively but inter rogatively nej said hans how do you mean cried the professor no what are your reasons hans is wrong said i rising after all the innumerable surprises of this jour ney a yet more singular one was reserved to us i expected to see a cone covered by snow by exten sive and widespread glaciers in the midst of the arid deserts of the extreme northern regions be neath the full rays of a polar sky beyond the high est latitudes but contrary to all our expectations i my uncle and the icelander were cast upon the slope of a mountain calcined by the burning rays of a sun which was literally baking us with its fires i could not believe my eyes but the actual heat which affected my body allowed me no chance of doubting we came out of the crater half naked and the radiant star from which we had asked noth ing for two months was good enough to be prodi gal to us of light and warmtha light and warmth we could easily have dispensed with when our eyes were accustomed to the light we had lost sight of so long i used them to rectify the errors of my imagination whatever happened we should have been at spitzbergen and i was in no humor to yield to anything but the most absolute proof after some delay the professor spoke hem he said in a hesitating kind of way it really does not look like iceland but supposing it were the island of jean may en i ventured to observe not in the least my boy this is not one of the volcanoes of the north with its hills of granite and its crown of snow nevertheless on the surface of the earth at last look look my boy said the professor as dogmatically as usual right above our heads at a great height opened the crater of a volcano from which escaped from one quarter of an hour to the other with a very loud explosion a lofty jet of flame mingled with pumice stone cin ders and lava i could feel the convulsions of na ture in the mountain which breathed like a huge whale throwing up from time to time fire and air through its enormous vents below and floating along a slope of considerable angularity the stream of eruptive matter spread away to a depth which did not give the volcano a height of three hundred fathoms its base disap peared in a perfect forest of green trees among which i perceived olives fig trees and vines loaded with rich grapes certainly this was not the ordin ary aspect of the arctic regions about that there could not be the slightest doubt when the eye was satisfied at its glimpse of this verdant expanse it fell upon the waters of a lovely sea or beautiful lake which made of this enchanted land an island of not many leagues in extent to wards the setting sun some distant shores were to be made out on the edge of the horizon in one place appeared a prodigiously lofty cone above the sum mit of which hung dark and heavy clouds where can we be i asked speaking in a low and solemn voice hans shut his eyes with an air of indifference and my uncle looked on without clearly understand ing whatever this mountain may be he said at last i must confess it is rather warm the ex plosions do not leave off and i do not think it is
