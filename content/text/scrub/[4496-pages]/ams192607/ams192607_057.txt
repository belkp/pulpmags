 amazing stories stopped and with its stoppage the light faded and soon disappeared the next day dr syx gave it out that on starting up his engine in the night something had caught fire which compelled him im mediately to shut down again the few who had seen the light with the exception of your humble servant accepted the doctors explanation without a question but i knew there had been no fire and syxs anxiety to spread the lie led me to believe that he had narrowly escaped giving away a vital secret i said nothing about my suspicions but upon inquiry i found out that an extra and pressing order for metal had arrived from the austrian government the very day of the pretended fire and i drew the inference that syx in his haste to fill the orderhis supply having been drawn lowhad started to work contrary to his custom at night and had immediately found reason to repent his rashness of course i connected the strange light with this sudden change of mind my suspicions having been thus stimulated and having been directed in a certain way i began from that moment to notice closely the hours dur ing which the engine labored at night it was always quiet except on that one brief occasion sometimes it began early in the morning and stop ped about noon at other times the work was done entirely in the afternoon beginning sometimes as late as three or four oclock and ceasing invariably at sundown then again it would start at sunrise and continue the whole day through for a long time i was unable to account for these eccentricities and the problem was not rend ered much clearer although a startling suggestive ness was added to it when at length i noticed that the periods of activity of the engine had a definite relation to the age of the moon then i discovered with the aid of an almanac that i could predict the hours when the engine would be busy at the time of new moon it worked all day at full moon it was idle between full moon and last quarter it labored in the forenoon the length of its working hours in creasing as the quarter was approached between last quarter and new moon the hours of work lengthened until as i have said at new moon they lasted all day between new moon and first quar ter work began later and later in the forenoon as the quarter was approached and between first quarter and full moon the laboring hours rapidly shortened being confined to the latter part of the afternoon until at full moon complete silence reigned in the mill the moon is concerned in dr syxs mystery well well i broke in greatly astonished by halls singular recital you must have thought dr syx was a cross between an alchemist and an astrologer note this said hall disregarding my interrup tion the hours when the engine worked were in variably the hours during which the moon was above the horizon what did you infer from that of course i inferred that the moon was directly concerned in the mystery but how that bothered me for a long time but a little light broke into my mind when i picked up on the mountainside a dead bird whose scorched feathers were bronzed with artemisium and sometime later another simi lar victim of a mysterious form of death then came the attack on the mine and its tragic finish i have already told you what i observed on that occasion but instead of helping to clear up the mystery it rather complicated it for a time at length however i reasoned my way partly out of the difficulty certain things which i had noticed in the syx mill convinced me that there was a part of the building whose existence no visitor suspected and putting one thing with another i inferred that the roof must be open above that secret part of the structure and that if i could get upon a suffi ciently elevated place i could see something of what was hidden there at this point in the investigation i proposed to you the trip to the top of the teton the result of which you remember i had calculated the angles with great care and i felt certain that from the apex of the mountain i should be able to get a view into the concealed chamber and into just that side of it which i wished particularly to inspect you remember that i called your attention to a shining object underneath the circular opening in the roof you could not make out what it was but i saw enough to convince me that it was a gigan tic parabolic mirror ill show you a smaller one of the same kind presently now at last i began to perceive the real truth but it was so wildly incredible so infinitely remote from all human experience that i hardly ventured to formulate it even in my own secret mind but i was bound to see the thing through to the end it occurred to me that i could prove the accuracy of my theory with the aid of a kite you were kind enough to lend your assistance in that experiment and it gave me irrefragable evidence of the exist ence of a shaft of flying atoms extending in a direct line between dr syxs preted mine and the moon hall i exclaimed you are mad my friend smiled goodnaturedly and went on with his story why the kite was burned the instant the kite shrivelled and disap peared i understood why the works were idle when the moon was not above the hori zon why birds flying across that fatal beam fell dead upon the rocks and whence the terrible master of that mystery mill derived the power of destruc tion that could wither an army as the assyrian host in byrons poem melted like snow in the glance of the lord but how did dr syx turn the flying atoms against his enemies i asked in a very simple manner he had a mirror mounted so that it could be turned in any direction and would shunt the stream of metallic atoms heated by their friction with the air towards any desired point when the attack came he raised this machine above the level of the roof and swept the mob to a lustrous if expensive death and the light at night was the shining of the heated atoms not lumin ous enough to be visible in broad day for which reason the engine never worked at night and the
