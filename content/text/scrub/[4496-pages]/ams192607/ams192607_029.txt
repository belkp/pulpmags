 amazing stories plex mind or he might have stuck for a time at that inadvertently willed embracing as it does the abstrusest problems of voluntary action but as it was the idea came to him with a quite acceptable haziness and from that following as i must ad mit no clear logical path he came to the test of ex periment he pointed resolutely to his candle and collected his mind though he felt he did a foolish thing be raised up he said but in a second that feeling vanished the candle was raised hung in the air one giddy moment and as mr fotheringay gasped fell with a smash on his toilettable leaving him in darkness save for the expiring glow of its wick for a time mr fotheringay sat in the darkness perfectly still it did happen after all he said and ow im to explain it i dont know he sighed heavily and began feeling in his pockets for a match he could find none and he rose and groped about the toilettable i wish i had a match he said he resorted to his coat and there was none there and then it dawned upon him that miracles were possible even with matches he extended a hand and scowled at it in the dark let there be a match in that hand he said he felt some light object fall across his palm and his fingers closed upon a match after several ineffectual attempts to light this he discovered it was a safety match he threw it down and then it occurred to him that he might have willed it lit he did and perceived it burning in the midst of his toilettable mat he caught it up hastily and it went out his perception of pos sibilities enlarged and he felt for and replaced the candle in its candlestick here you be lit said mr fotheringay and forthwith the candle was flai ing and he saw a little black hole in the toiletcover with a wisp of smoke rising from it for a time he stared from this to the little flame and back and then looked up and met his own gaze in the looking glass by this help he communed with himself in silence for a time how about miracles now said mr fotheringay at last addressing his reflection mr fotheringay practices miracles upon himself with great success the subsequent meditations of mr fother ingay were of a severe but confused descrip tion so far he could see it was a case of pure willing with him the nature of his experiences so far disinclined him for any further experi ments at least until he had reconsidered them but he lifted a sheet of paper and turned a glass of water pink and then green and he created a snail which he miraculously annihilated and got him self a miraculous new toothbrush somewhere in the small hours he had reached the fact that his willpower must be of a particularly rare and pungent quality a fact of which he had indeed had inklings before but no certain assurance the scare and perplexity of his first discov ery was now qualified by pride in this evidence of singularity and by vague intimations of advant age he became aware that the church clock was striking one and as it did not occur to him that his daily duties at gomshotts might be miraculously dispensed with he resumed undressing in order to get to bed without further delay as he struggled to get his shirt over his head he was struck with a brilliant idea let me be in bed he said and found himself so undressed he stipulated and finding the sheets cold added hastily and in my nightshirtno in a nice soft woolen nightshirt ah he said with immense enjoyment and now let me be comfortably asleep he awoke at his usual hour and was psrisive all through brealcfasttime wondering whether his overnight experience might not be a particularly vivid dream at length his mind turned again to cautious experiments for instance he had three eggs for breakfast two his landlady had supplied good but shoppy and one was a delicious fresh goose egg laid cooked and served by his extra ordinary will he hurried off to gomshotts in a state of profound but carefuliy concealed excite ment and only remembered the shell of the third egg when his landlady spoke of it that night all day he could do no work because of this astonishing new selfknowledge but this caused him no incon venience because he made up for it miracuously in his last ten minutes chapter iii more miracles astonishing the natives as the day wore on his state of mind passed from wonder to elation albeit the circum stances of his dismissal from the long dra gon were still disagreeable to recall and a garbled account of the matter that had reached his col leagues led to some baridinage it was evident he must be careful how he lifted frangible articles but in other ways his gift promised more and more as he turned it over in his mind he intended among other things to increase his personal prop erty by unostentatious acts of creation he called into existence a pair of very splendid diamond studs and hastily annihilated them again as young gomshott came across the countinghouse to his desk he was afraid young gomshott might won der how he had come by them he saw quite clear ly the gift required caution and watchfulness in its exercise but so far as he could judge the difficulties attending its mastery would be no greater than those he had already faced in the study of cycling it was that analogy perhaps quite as much as the feeling that he would be unwelcome in the long dragon that drove him out after supper into the lane beyond the gasworks to rehearse a few mir acles in private there was possibly a certain want of originality in his attempts for apart from his willpower mr fotheringay was not a very exceptional man the miracle of moses rod came to his mind but the night was dark and unfavourable to the proper con trol of large miraculous snakes then he recol lected the story of tannhauser that he had read on the back of the philharmonic programme that seemed to him singularly attractive and harmless he stuck his walkingsticka very nice poona penang lawyerinto the turf that edged the foot path and commanded the dry wood to blossom the air was immediately full of the scent of roses and by means of a match he saw for himself that this beautiful miracle was indeed accomplished his satisfaction was ended by advancing footsteps
