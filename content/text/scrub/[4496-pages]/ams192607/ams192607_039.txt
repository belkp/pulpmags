 amazing stories to america and europe soon became enormousso enormous that the metal was no longer precious the price of gold dropped like a falling stone with accelerated velocity and within a year every money centre in the world had been swept by a panic gold was more common than iron every government was compelled to demonetize it for when once gold had fallen into contempt it was less valuable in the eyes of the public than stamped paper for once the world had thoroughly learned the lesson that too much of a good thing is worse than none of it gold is brought into economic use then somebody found a hew use for gold by inventing a process by which it could be hardened and tempered assuming a wonder ful toughness and elasticity without losing its non corrosive property and in this form it rapidly took the place of steel in the mean time every effort was made to bolster up credit endless were the attempts to find a sub stitute for gold the chemists sought it in their laboratories and the mineralogists in the mountains and deserts platinum might have served but it too had become a drug in the market through the discovery of immense deposits out of the twenty odd elements which had been rarer and more valu able than gold such as uranium gallium etc not one was found to answer the purpose in short it was evident that since both gold and silver had be come too abundant to serve any longer for a money standard the planet held no metal suitable to take their place the entire monetary system of the world must be readjusted but in the readjustment it was cer tain to fall to pieces in fact it had already fallen to pieces the only recourse was to paper money but whether this was based upon agriculture or mining or manufacture it gave varying standards not

verb and suddenly dropped into his seat very red in the face and wearing a most injured expression but president boon paid no attention except to the singular card which he continued to turn over and over balancing it on his fingers and holding it now at armslength and then near his nose with one eye squinted as if he were trying to look through a hole in the card at length this odd conduct of the
