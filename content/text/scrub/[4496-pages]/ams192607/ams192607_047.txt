 amazing stories that rose to his lips he remained staring through the hole for several minutes without uttering a word presently i noticed that the lenses of his eye were illuminated by a ray of light coming through the hole but he did not stir after a long inspection he suddenly applied his ear to the hole and listened intently for at least five minutes not a sound was audible to me but by an occasional pressure of the hand hall signified that some important disclosure was reaching his sense of hearing at length he removed his ear pardon me he whispered for keeping you so long in waiting but what i have just seen and over heard was of a nature to admit of no interruption he is still talking and by pressing your ear against the hole you may be able to catch what he says who is he look for yourself i placed my eye at the aperture and almost re coiled with the violence of my surprise the tun nel before me was brilliantly illuminated and with in three feet of the wall of rock behind which we crouched stood dr syx his dark profile looking al most satanic in the sharp contrast of light and shadow he was talking to one of his foremen and the two were the only visible occupants of the tun nel putting my ear to the little opening i heard his words distinctly end of their rope well theyve spent a pretty lot of money for their experience and i rather think we shall not be troubled again by artemisium seekers for some time to come spying on dr syx the doctors voice ceased and instantly i clap ped my eye to the hole he had changed his position so that his black eyes now looked straight at the aperture my heart was in my mouth for at first i believed from his expression that he had detected the gleam of my eyeball but if so he probably mistook it for a bit of mica in the rock and paid no further attention then his lips moved and i put my ear again to the hole he seemed to be replying to a question that the fore man had asked if they do he said they will never guess the real secret thereupon he turned on his heel kicked a bit of rock off the track and strode away towards the en trance the foreman paused long enough to turn out the electric lamp and then followed the doctor well asked hall what have you heard i told him everything it fully corroborates the evidence of my own eyes and ears he remarked and we may count ourselves extremely lucky it is not likely that dr syx will be heard a second time proclaiming his de ception with his own lips it is plain that he was led to talk as he did to the foreman on account of the latters having informed him of the sudden dis charge of my men this morning their presence within earshot of our hidingplace during their conversation was of course pure accident and so you can see how kind fortune has been to us i expected to have to watch and listen and form de ductions for a week at least before getting the in formation which five lucky minutes have placed in our hands while he was speaking my companion busied himself in carefully plugging up the hole in the rock when it was closed to his satisfaction he turned on the light in our tunnel did you observe he asked that there was a second tunnel what do you say when the light was on in there i saw the mouth of a small tunnel entering the main one behind the cars on the right did you notice it oh yes i replied i did observe some kind of a dark hole there but i paid no attention to it be cause i was so absorbed in the doctor well rejoined hall smiling it was worth considerably more than a glance as a subject of thought i find it even more absorbing than dr syx did you see the track in it no i had to acknowledge i did not notice that but i continued a little piqued by his manner being a branch of the main tunnel i dont see any thing remarkable in its having a track also it was rather dim in that hole said hall still smiling in a somewhat provoking way but the railroad track was there plain enough and whether you think it remarkable or not i should like to lay you a wager that that track leads to a secret worth a dozen of the one we have just overheard my good friend i retorted still smarting a little i shall not presume to match my stupidity against your perspicacity i havent cats eyes in the dark hall immediately broke out laughing and slap ping me goodnaturedly on the shoulder exclaimed come come now if you go to kicking back at a fellow like that i shall be sorry i ever undertook this adventure chapter vi a mystery indeed when president boon had heard our story he promptly approved halls dismissal of the men he expressed great surprise that dr syx should have resorted to a deception which had been so disastrous to innocent people and at first he talked of legal proceedings but after thinking the matter over he concluded that syx was too powerful to be attacked with success especially when the only evidence against him was that he had claimed to find artemisium in his mine at a time when as everybody knew artemisium actually was found outside the mine there was no appar ent motive for the deception and no proof of ma licious intent in short mr boon decided that the best thing for him and his stockholders to do was to keep silent about their losses and await events and at halls suggestion he also determined to say nothing to anybody about the discovery he had made it could do no good said hall in making the suggestion and it might spoil a plan i have in mind what plan asked the president i prefer not to tell just yet was the reply i observed that in our interview with mr boon hall made no reference to the side tunnel to which he had appeared to attach so much importance and i concluded that he now regarded it as lacking sig nificance in this i was mistaken
