the crime destroyer ments for his uncles funeral et cetera and when i saw that he was handling matters in a businesslike way i pleaded my patients and left them together i did have some calls to make and kept my appointments before return ing to park avenue there i found a telegram from bloomhe could come a week earlier than we had at first ar rangedand a uniformed messenger awaiting me from mr bernstein he said as he handed me a sealed envelope he told me to hand it to you sir and no one else i gave him a dollar bill i was thinking of a man i had seen on the sidewalk outside my house he had moved off while the car was still two blocks away but i recognized him having seen him acting the part of sleuth the night before of course if you are asked any questions you will answer the lad winked profoundly i never do doctor he said least wise not when mr bernstein sends me out he touched his cap and withdrew his answer had given me a complete sense of security as i reflected that there seemed to be no branch of public service wherein humphrey steene lacked picked agents that were abso lutely to be trusted nevertheless humphrey steenes message was startling to say the least as i read it the icy hand of fear clutched at my heart once more the message was this you are now minus be wary after thursday you should be safe after thursday as yet it was only friday that left six and a half days in which i was to be exposed to the danger of sudden death hundreds of agents of the order of the white bear might be waiting a favorable opportu nity to strikeor perhaps only one spe cially chosen for the task i had been considered a neutral one to be watched constantly why was my sign now a minussignifying death then i recalled the incident of the fallen jardiniÄƒre and the words i had uttered immediately before it crashed to the floor if i didnt happen to know exactly what caused your uncles death i felt that i needed a bracer just thenand i took it chapter xii a midnight transfer it was a nightmare week i passed be fore the sailing of the eutopia i went about my business as a physician to the last but i took certain obvious precautions for instance i slept for the first time in my lifewith door locked and windows fastened and kept a loaded revolver under my pillow three times i received calls in the night from people unknown to me and while i consider it the first duty of a physician to answer the call of hu manity in each case i advised the caller to get another doctor as i could not come doctors are plentiful enough in new york and i would take no chances till i was assured of the permanent safety of mildred brittain knowing what i do now of the meth ods of the order of the white bear and the bold determination of its members of the intermediate degree i am in clined to believe that it was the fact that i reserved a stateroom on the eu topia the same day i received hum phrey steenes warning that saved me my simple precautions could not have frustrated their plans but they were not given to committing crimes that prom ised neither advantage nor profit and i think my apparent purpose to leave america for a time led them to give me the benefit of the doubt doctor bloom arrived the day before
