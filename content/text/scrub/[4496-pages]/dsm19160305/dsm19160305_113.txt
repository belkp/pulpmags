 detective story magazine when the representative of the district attorney produced two samples of poi son one of which had been obtained by drying the powder found in the bowl which had held the beef broth while the other was taken from the little pack age found in mrs torreys room these two are identical he said they are both white arsenic a well known deadly poison unfortunately too common and too easily obtained at this point carson sharpe who occupied a seat beside the coroner on the bench desired to know whether the package found in mrs torreys room could be proven to be that which the maid had bought he was informed that the wrapper bore the druggists stamp druggist dunning crestfallen nodded despondently on the witness bench druggist seabrook scowled tri umphantly will you permit me to make a brief experiment asked sharpe and no body objected for they all stood in con siderable awe of the detective thereupon sharpe took the two packages of poison and poured a small quantity of powder from one of them into a glass tube and an equal amount from the other package into another tube then producing a small vial of colorless liquid he poured some of it into the tube which held the powder taken from mrs torrey s room there was no visible result and coro ner jury lawyers and spectators looked very much disappointed then sharpe poured some of the same liquid into the other tube which contained the powder taken from the broth instantly there was a lively effer vescence the tube was as full of bub bles as a glass of soda water the jurymen opened their eyes the specta tors rose to their feet and craned their necks to see mr sharpe said the coroner i do not quite understand the meaning of the experiment you have performed but i perceive that it is important it seems to show that the poison found in the broth is not the same as that found in mrs torreys room on the contrary said sharpe the poison is exactly the same yet i tell you that i have proved that the drug bought by mrs torreys maid was not used to poison mr torrey let me explain white arsenic in the form of powder as it is sold in drug stores is rarely pure it is adulterated with various cheap substances similar in appearance as i have said the poison which the maid bought is the same as that found in the broth but the substance used in adulterating the two was not the same that bought by the maid was adul terated with sulphate of calcium that which killed mr torrey was mixed with carbonate of calciumin other words with chalk dust i prove this by adding acid to both powders it produces no effect upon the sulphate of calcium but it breaks up the chalk setting free carbonic acid gasthe ordinary sodawater gas the chemists who have analyzed these two samples paid no attention to the adulterant they took it for granted if the same chemist had pre pared both analyses he would have no ticed the difference but the two reports mention only the white arsenic since the other substances were harmless now what does this prove why it proves that the fatal dose was not bought at dunnings store he gets his white arsenic of abel hanniford amp co of new york who use sulphate of calcium as an adulterant on the other hand doctor seabrook buys his white arsenic of seamen wil bur amp co of baltimore and they use powdered chalk i learned these facts yesterday afternoon mr coroner if you will permit me to do so i will suggest that you call doctor seabrook to the stand
