death in life ployer agreed he must have got in by way of the loft for the doors down here havent been tampered with but how the mischief were his suspicions roused i havent the slightest idea white head replied glancing down again at chicks pallid face i know him by sight of course but i never ran up against him like this before and im pretty certain he doesnt know me it looks though as if he must have wit nessed something queer back there on the avenue and trailed us here it certainly does curse you the playwright retorted hotly a man is an ass to intrust any part of such a job to another you and oliver have bungled this thing and i do wish id never so do i with all my heart white head put in storm away if it will do any good wilbur im not afraid of you and i dont much care what happens i weakly allowed myself to be drawn into this affair and ive done my best everything seemed to go off without a hitchmuch easier than i had expected in fact if the beans are spilled in spite of that it cant be helped and i dont see how it could have been avoided as for the rest ill soon be out of their reach anyway and if it s different with you thats your own lookout and your own fault leigh blustered for a while longer but soon quieted down his conceit assured him that had he been in his accomplices place chick would never have followed the trail of the stolen ambulance but he realized that the ar rangement had been his and was quite willing to believe that whitehead had indeed done the best he could wrhile the dramatists anger was ex pending itself whitehead made sure that chick was not yet dead what are you going to do with him he asked at length i havent fully determined yet was the reply but hes quite safe and will remain so until i find a means of disposing of him its safer to handle dynamite you know the consumptive reminded him than it is to meddle with any of nick carters assistants chapter xxiv chick is sentenced wilbur leigh would have done well to heed whiteheads warn ing but he was not in a mood to give it any consideration on the contrary it caused his rage to flare up anew nonsense he cried youre wel come to your sickly fears but dont try to infect me with them i wouldnt deliberately have crossed nick carters trail or that of any of his bunch but im not afraid of them in the least theyre clever of course and theres no doubt about their obstinate courage but if they force me to it i think i can teach them a trick or two i ac cept this as a challenge and im not going to make the mistake of resorting to half measures im afraid youre the one whos playing the fool this time whitehead replied if anything happens to chick carter if nothing happens to him where will we be just tell me that leigh broke in i tell you you cant afford to have scruples where those fellows are concerned if you give them an inch theyll take a mile every time this chap is in my power and im not going to risk my liberty by letting him go again everything depends on that and theres only one thing to do with him im afraid id do it now if i didnt want to find out whether hes alone in this or was sent out by carter himself that might make a difference and for that reason im going to delay matters temporarily the consumptives keen eyes were
