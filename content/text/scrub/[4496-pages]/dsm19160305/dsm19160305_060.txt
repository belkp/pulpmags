the crime destroyer credited to man but how seldom do we find the same precision applied to the problems that face us every day as near as possible i am applying it to the science of crime detection i do not jump to conclusions and call it deduction i build up from the known and reach the unknown not by a process of logic which depends on premises as uncertain as the results at tained but by putting every wheel and cog in place then reading the figures on the dial to which the hands unerr ingly point but i was becoming impatient where do we stand now in regard to the problem that faces us i asked to use your own metaphor what oclock is it he smiled my clock is not yet completed but we are nearing a crisis i had ivan ivanovitch traced to a house not far from here so i moved uptown i took this place because it is near the roof and provides an excellent view we will go up there presentlyafter sun set mildred brittain is still safe the order does not commit murder unnec essarily bob brittain is the one to watch you must gain his entire con fidence i think you had better induce him to introduce you into membership of the while bear i shrank from the suggestion but he went on to explain very soon he will be asked to take the intermediate degree if you can be sufficiently convincing as an advo cate of anarchy you may succeed in attaining a like honor then you will be in the camp of the enemy and in a position to supply some of the cogs i need to make my clock perfect but that would be to forswear my self to take oaths i have no intention of fulfilling to act the part of a spy i protested for i must confess the idea was repugnant to me yes and the penalty of discovery is certain death he grimly rejoined is there no other way listen the day bob brittain be comes a member of the intermediate degree of the order of the white bear the danger to mildred brittain will begin i felt my cheeks blanch as i got to my feet but i answered sternly and without hesitation i will join the order you hint at things i dare not even think but i shall join i myself will take a hand in a murder if it is necessary to save her but the hounds responsible for her fathers death and the outrage to which she has been subjected will be my victims bob brittain has been my best friend but if i find he has had a hand in these crimes illill easy easy doctor there is no evi dence against him he interrupted me indeed i will vouch for his innocence up to the present to the present what do you mean i thought you had grasped the situ ation long ago let me make it clear young brittain has been foolish he is in debt heavily in debt he is a member of the order of the while bear but he is only a cub hundreds of young men in this city are cubs thousands of them they are as igno rant of the real purposes of the organi zation as you were six weeks ago they are fortunate all they are asked to do is provide funds for the schemes of ivan ivanovitch and the enrichment of his bolder lieutenants in the form of annual dues and special assessments but take brittains case he is in line for a huge fortune only two stood between him and riches beyond his powers to squander in a lifetime one of these has already been removed despite his evident affection for his cousin he cannot be oblivious to the fact that if she is never seen again
