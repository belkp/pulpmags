the sultana crescent away out on the lawn where a small rural seat entwined with creepers stood beside a towering black thatch the crisp dewladen bahama grass crunched musically beneath their feet and the fragrance of jasmine filled the air they breathed and added its intox icating stimulus to their already over flowing hearts the most serious moments are the moments when men find it hardest to put their thoughts into words and so it was that these two young lovers lovers of nature lovers of life lovers of each otherwith their bubbling hearts had to fence for an opening i hope you had a lovely time was the inane remark he first made delightful she replied why it is altogether different from the old ball days is it something in the climate or in the place or the strangeness of it all that makes the difference for you it may be all that he an swered sentimentally but for me it is something in herehe laid his hand upon his bosomthat causes the change can you guess what it is she looked up to him and a fire of comprehension lighted her eyes no no she cried do not tempt me it is not fair heaven forbid that i should take any unfair advantage of circum stances he answered is it dishonor able to tell you that you have bewitched me that i see you in all my dreams sleeping or waking that i can think only of you if i am cruel i will un say the words from behind the distant long moun tains rising like a verdant island from the rolling plain that surrounded it a sweet breath of rich sea breeze kissed her rosy cheeks and left them tingling from the cold moon that shone over head in all her splendor or from the thousand brilliant stars around a shower as if of powdered glory fell upon her countenance and left her a radiant enchanted being as she turned the tender young face up to his as she laid one arm on his shoulder and whis pered in the pure innocence of her no ble young soul no it is not fair it is not manly becausebecause you know richard that i love you because you know i have fought against this for all these days because you saw that the music tonight maddened me and i had to fill up my program had to give myself up to the wild abandon of recklessness in the hope of mastering myself there she added vehemently you have tempted me and i have fallen you have allowed me to say what no self respecting woman should ever say you have made me ashamed of myself i wish i were dead de launcey raised the delicate shapely head that sobbed on his bosom and kissed the drawn lips lightly my darling he said you have only said the words that any noble woman should say who desires to make a man happy but i have said them before i am asked she said with a sigh no no he hurried my heart asked yours long long ago and only now it has answered when my lips too had asked for a long time the two sat silent and dreamed on then suddenly de launcey roused himself and spoke will you go up now dear or would you like to sit here longer i admit the spot seems chawmed and yet i feel that i must tear myself from you but if you care to remain and drink in a little more of this sweet moonlight to take in a few more mouthfuls of this invigorating sea breeze to commune with nature and your own dear heart i am sure there is no danger the grounds are surrounded and watched and the hotel is near what will you do i will go up she said simply
