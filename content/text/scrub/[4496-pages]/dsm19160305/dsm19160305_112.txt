may and december why did not mrs torrey get it because she did not know exactly where it was did you not take a risk in passing through the halls at that time asked sharpe you did not wish any one to know that you were in the house that was not important answered harley if i had been seen i should simply have gone to torreys door and rapped we quarreled once you know but of late our relations had been more cordial i had to take care when it came to the matter of a long private conversation with agnes what time was it when you left that room about half past twelve do you suppose that broth was standing outside torreys door at that time i know it was said harley for i saw it well upon my word said sharpe this is one of the most peculiar situ ations that i ever saw you can clear your client if you go upon the stand as a witness but in so doing you will cast the gravest suspicion upon yourself that is the point that ive been working up to said harley calmly who poisoned norton torrey i dont know but one thing is sure sooner than see agnes bear the blame i will go on the stand whether she is willing or not and if the worst comes and she is sure to be convicted i will not only tell the truth i will go farther i will lie upon my oath and say that i put that poison into the broth myself let us hope it will not come to that said sharpe my only hope is in you replied harley one more question and i am done could mrs torrey have left that room and you not know it impossible she must have passed me in the halls or on the stairs while i was getting that paper the library door was open and i could see the bowl of broth standing outside the door this concluded sharpes talk with harley from his office the detective went to the drug store of doctor sea brook the old druggist had assisted in some of the analyses that had been made and had seen all the chemists reports so that sharpe expected to get accurate data from him in this he was not disappointed doctor sea brook made it clear to the detective that the case was a genuine one of arsenical poisoning and that it must be futile to attempt to shake the chemical expert testimony the veteran druggist was very bitter against his young rival in business for having sold poison so recklessly as to the actual crime he stoutly defended mrs torrey and asserted his belief that the case was one of accident or that the missing maid had done the deed as to this missing woman sharpe was much perplexed it was impossible that she should have done the deed yet it was admitted that she had bought the poison and her flight was highly sus picious she had had a quarrel with her mistress a few days before but it had not been serious enough to war rant a desperate revenge or even a sud den quitting of the house the detective had very little time in which to work for he was very desir ous of clearing mrs torreyif in deed she was innocentat the inquest which was called for the day after that on which sharpe reached holliston it is however no new thing for the de tective to be in a hurry and he used his scanty time to so good advantage that when he appeared at the inquest the next morning he felt in the highest degree satisfied with the status of the case it will not be necessary to enter upon any detailed account of that somewhat remarkable inquiry the climax came
