 detective story magazine mrs torreys room she doesnt know how it came there and i dont pretend to understand that feature of the case where is alice holden asked sharpe she has not been found was the reply of course it is natural to sus pect her but that theory will not work it is positively proved that she left this town early in the morning she has been traced to new york it is utterly impossible that she could have put the poison into that broth for she was a hundred miles away when it was done to proceed every servant in the house has been examined and every one can clear himself or herself as the case may be there is no doubt what ever that the poison was put into the broth while it was on the little stand outside the door of torreys room during that time not one of the serv ants was alone in short though i naturally want to take a contrary view i am forced to admit that they are all innocent how about mrs ward the house keeper asked sharpe i understand that she made the broth and carried it upstairs she had no motive was the reply and her character will clear her she is one of the best of women and every body in this town knows it i havent the faintest suspicion that she did the deed and in any case as a lawyer i know that it will be perfectly useless to try to throw suspicion upon her you are perfectly right in that view said sharpe such an attempt would only injure your client now let us return to mrs torrey where was she at the critical moment harley twisted about in his seat and seemed afraid to answer though it was evident that he had made up his mind beforehand to do so she was in the house said he at last how did it happen that she was not summoned when her husband was taken ill demanded the detective the servants did not find her re plied harley she was in an unused room which is always locked no one thought of going there was she alone again harley hesitated no he said finally i was with her then why do you not come for ward and clear her for several reasons was the an swer first it would damage her rep utation scarcely so much as an accusation of murder suggested sharpe a woman has strange preferences said harley agnes commands me to be silent as a matter of fact i ought not to have been there but the case was getting to be desperate life in that house was becoming unbearable for her we were discussing the means of end ing her captivity an elopement suggested sharpe heaven knows cried harley it might have come to that i urged it for i was mad with love for her she refused though she admitted her love for me ah her behavior was noble her words might be shouted in the street and they would do good to all who heard them only the secrecy of our meeting was wrong but in a little town like this what can one do she couldnt come to my office for legal ad vice all the gossips were watching were you with her all the time asked sharpe all but a moment replied the young man she left you in that room no i left her there why i went to get a document which was in a writing table in the library what was that document a deed of some property executed by torrey in favor of his wife
