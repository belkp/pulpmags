 weird tales manager was struck dead just as he said something about the roulette wheel yes said gest it was as though this doctor satan were right there with us and killed him with a soundless bullet just before he could talk keanes eyes glittered id like to look over the roulette room the police are here said grays turning from his phone keane stared at gest keep them out of the roulette room for a few minutes he strode out to the elevators his first concern after locking himself into the room where nine people had been stricken with something which if it persisted was worse than any death was the thing the assistant manager had mentioned before death hit him the roulette wheel he bent over this with a frown of concentration on his face and his quick eyes caught at once a thing another per son might have overlooked for quite a while the wheel was dishshaped as all rou lette wheels are in its rounded bottom were numbered slots where the little ivory ball was to end its journey and pro claim gamblers luck but the little ball was not in one of the bottom slots the tiny ivory sphere was half up the rounded side of the wheel like a pea dinging alone high up on the slant of a dish an exclamation came from keanes lips he stared at the bail what in heavens name kept it from rolling down the steep slant and into the rounded bot tom why would a sphere stay on a slant it was as if a bowl of water had been tiltedand the waters surface had taken and retained the tilt of the vessel it was in instead of remaining level he lifted the ball from the sloping side of the wheel it came away freely but with an almost intangible resistance as if an unseen rubber band held it when he released it it went back to the slope he rolled it down to the bottom of the wheel released it rolled back up to its former position like water run ning uphill keane felt a chill touch him the laws of physics broken a ball clinging to a slant instead of rolling down it what dark secret of nature had doctor satan mastered now but the query was not entirely un answered in his mind already he was getting a vague hint of it and a little later the hint was broadened the phone rang he answered it mr keane this is doctor grays the autopsy on wilson has been begun and already a queer thing has been dis closed its about his heart yes said keane gripping the phone his heart is ruptured in a hundred placesas though a little bomb had ex ploded in it dont ask me why because i cant even give a theory its unique in medical history i wont ask you why keane said slowly i thinkin a little whileill tell you why he hung up and strode toward the door but at the roulette table he paused and stared at die wheel with his gray eyes idly blazing it seemed to him the wheel had moved a little he had unconsciously lined up the weirdly clinging ball with the knob on the outer door as he examined it awhile ago now as he stood in the same place the ball was not quite in that line as if the wheel had rotated a fraction of an inch
