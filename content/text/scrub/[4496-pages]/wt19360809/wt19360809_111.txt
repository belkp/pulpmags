in the dark by ronal kayser it was a tale of sheer horror that old asa gregg poured into the dictaphone the watchmans flashlight printed a white circle on the frostedglass blacklettered door gregg chemical co mfrs asa gregg pres private the watchmans hand dosed on the knob rattled the door in its frame queer but tonight the sound had seemed to come from in there but that couldnt be he knew that mr gregg and miss car ruthers carried the only keys to the office so any intruder would have been forced to smash the lock maybe the sound came from the stor age room the watchman clumped along the rubbermatted corridor flung his weight against that door it opened hard being of ponderous metal fitted into a cork casing the room was an airtight fireproof vault really his shoes gritted on the concrete floor as he prowled among the big porcelain vats the flashlight bored through bluish haze to the concrete walls acid fumes escaping under the vat lids made the haze and seared the mans throat he hurried out coughing and wiping his eyes it was damn funny every night lately he heard the same peculiar noise somewhere in this wing of the building like a body groaning and turning in restless sleep it was it scared him he didnt mention the mystery to anyone though he was an old man and he didnt want mr gregg to think he was getting too old for the job asad think i was crazy if i told him about it he mumbled inside the office asa gregg heard the muttered words plainly he sat very still in die big leathercushioned chair hardly breathing until the scrape of the watchmans feet had thinned away down the hall there was no light in the room to betray him only the cherrycolored tip of his cigar which couldnt be visible through the frosted glass door anyway itd be an hour before the watchmans round brought him past the office again asa gregg had that hour if he could screw up his nerve to use it he took the frayed end of the cigar from his mouth his hand which had wasted to mere skin and bone these past few months groped through the dark ness slid over the polished coolness of the dictaphone hood and snapped the switch machinery faintly whirred his fingers found the tube lifted it miss carruthers he snapped then he hesitated surely he could trust mary carruthers hed never wondered about her before shed been his secretary for a dozen yearslately since he couldnt look after affairs himself as he used to she had practically run the business she was forty sensible unbeautiful and tightlipped hell he had to trust her his voice plunged into the darkness what i have to say now is intended for mrs greggs ears only she will take the first boat home of course meet that boat and bring her to the office since my wife knows nothing about a dictaphone it will be necessary for you to set this record running as soon as you have done so leave her alone in the room make
