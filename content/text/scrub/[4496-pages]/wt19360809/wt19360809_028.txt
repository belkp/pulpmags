the door into infinity of it into pure air they were in the darkness floating in the tunnel beyond the block the current carrying them swiftly onward the walls were shaking and roaring frightfully about them as they were borne round the turns of the tunnel then they saw ahead of them a circle of dim light pricked with white stars the current bore them out into that starlight into the open sea before them in the water floated sturt and they swam with him out from the shaking grinding cliffs the girl stirred a little in ennis grasp and he saw in the starlight that her face was no longer dazed paul she muttered clinging close to ennis in the water shes coming back to consciousness the water must have revived her from that drug he cried but he was cut short by campbells cry look look cried the inspector pointing back at the black cliffs in the starlight the whole cliff was col lapsing with a prolonged terrible roar as of grinding planets its face breaking and buckling the waters around them boiled furiously whirling them this way and that then the waters quieted they found they had been flung near a sandy spit beyond the shattered cliffs and they swam toward it the whole underground honeycomb of caverns and tunnels gave way and the sea poured in campbell cried the door and the brotherhood of the door are ended for ever lycanthropus by c edgar bolen the jellied night has oozed its miry black from out the hills to fill the valley floor atop the ragged hills the torn cloudwrack is lightninglimned into a hellish door a gust of wind across the sky is hurled the gods of old are loosed upon the world ageold the bloodlust wells within my throat tensely i wait and feel my body shrink my hairless hide becomes a furry coat bloodhungry through the opened door i slink i raise my head and howl in horrid glee and from the plain a howl comes back to me
