 weird tales tias lifeless lips had been almost more than he could bear but the following realization that the sound was actual and coming from the damned creature he had inadvertently locked in with the corpsehad been almost as unnerving he moved his hands so that they covered his distorted mouth and gnawed at his knuckles the catin therewith the doubledup bundle oh god he whispered what was he to do he couldnt drive along all day passing through towns stopping for gas and oil with that halfdead animal mewling and whimpering in the trunk the tinkle of the trunk key as it fell down the sewer grating rang mockingly in his ears hed thought he had been so clever when he threw the key away in some totally unforeseen emergency in which he might be stopped and a demand made that he open the trunk he could say and a search would prove that he had lost the key that had been his idea he would throw the trunk still locked and with the key unrecoverable into the swamp muck but now in the trunk was that hor rible halfdead thing whining and whimpering locked in and with the key thrown away what was he to do drawing a long uncertain breath opper got out of the car and lifted the front seat to get at his tool kit there was only one thing he could think of to do that was to break the trunk open free the cat and then flee along his way to the concealing swamp the bottomless muck thought of it was like a tonic if only he were be side it now the tools in the kit were ridiculously inadequate as are tools in most auto mobile kits nowadays there was a screwdriver with a cracked wooden handle a pair of pliers some wrenches too light to be used as hammers and a jack with a separate round of wood for a handle he took the meager array to the back of the car he listened the whimper was not sounding at the mo ment maybe the cat was dead but he couldnt entertain that com forting hope much as hed have liked to enough air filtered into the trunk to keep the animal from smothering it could live in there for days opper gripped the screwdriver till his knuckles showed white he inserted the flat edge under the lock and pried up the screwdriver bent a little that was all under a harder tug the handle cracked entirely apart under his strain ing fingers he cursed wildly as the wooden bits fell to the ground lock and trunk were scarcely marred by the pressure he had paid especial attention to the strength of this trunk when he bought the car the lock hed had put on it was more impregnable than the metal panels of the trunk itself well hed gotten the thing strong enough all right but he had to get in there he had to free that cat before it betrayed him he set his jaws hard as he thought of the animal by god it would be a pleasure to kill the thing hed have had to kill it in any event couldnt have it roaming loose hed have to kill it and hide it a pleasure he attacked the heavy lock with the pliers the whimper was sounding again half animal half human in its anguish like a faint echo of all humanitys cries of terror so like martias whimper be
