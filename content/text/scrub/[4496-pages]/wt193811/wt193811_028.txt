i found cleopatra later i had clambered aboard the wreck age and was examining my find it required some time before i suc ceeded in dragging her on to the wreck age to my surprise the boat proved quite sound and a moment later floated upright in the water by this time the sun had risen to show another welcome discovery in the east a light blue sky rose from a dark blue sea and far away at the point where they met lay the faint marks of a long black line the african coast it was the sight of this that renewed my confidence the boat had no oars to be sure but among the wreckage were several pieces that might answer as paddles i selected two of the stout est of these and presently was making headway toward the distant shore all that long day i plowed my craft through the waves it was just dusk when the prow of the boat touched the beach and i sprang to the shore of a wild and desolate land as far as the eye could see there was nought but a waste of sand that stretched away to the sky no light shone in the gather ing darkness nor was there anything to denote any nearby habitation a mile or so down the beach a cluster of palm trees towered above the waters edge i was hopelessly lost of course i knew the location to be somewhere north of dakar but as to my exact whereaboutswithin the radius of a hundred milesi could only guess were i to take up a journey southward i knew that in time i would reach my port but what of the miles that lay be tween weeks it might take during which manuel de costa could easily find and claim the treasures of the tomb for two days i continued along the beach that led to the south living off the occasional fruits and coconuts and twice finding water at a tiny brook tt was sundown on the third day when hungry and tired i came to a little cabin on the beach here i found a savage old negress i could neither understand nor pacify my ragged unshaven appearance must have added to her suspicion an ancient musket had been pointed at my head even as i ap proached the doorway while the shout ing and gesticulating together with a wild flow of words told that the curses of a hundred pagan gods were being called down upon me in a corner a small black boy of ten or so looked at me wonderingly the bare walls within the hut fairly shouted filth and poverty but before the small fireplace a simmering pot wafted its grand aroma yet it might have been on the moon for all the good it did me even my few pieces of silver were unable to impress the old crons or obtain the food i sought her voice rose higher so loud was our united jabber we both failed to notice the rapid advance of a score of whiterobed horsemen riding silendy over the sands toward us the first warning that danger was within a hundred miles of me was the terror that sprang to the face of the old woman whose gaze suddenly raised be yond where i stood in the doorway at the same instant a wave of swarthy arabs swept over me and i was thrown backward to the sand no words were spoken nor was there any sound other than the heavy breathing of the arabs and the noise of the struggle their very number held me helpless in a moment i was bound my hands behind my back and my feet trussed up to meet them and in another they had carried and tied me to the
