i found cleopatra crushed to mine but it did not take this to inform me that the tall whiteshirted thing with which i battled was not a man but a beast in the gloom i was unable to make out the featuresonly the shaggy out lines of a head and weird green eyes that glared unblinkingly into mine but now our bodies were whirling at such a speed as to make any close scrutiny impossible with the tenacity of a bulldog those great arms sought to press the life from me but not a whit less savage was my own response as two trained fists sent a series of short choppy jolts to the body wicked blows that caused the thing to gasp with pain and its grip to weaken a wild surge spun the great form from me together we rose to con tinue our struggle but i knew my foe was weakening a left hook had my two hundred pounds behind it and al though strong teeth and a fetid breath flew to my throat a smashing right sent the beastthing flying to the wall an other minute was all i needed what ever fate it was that ordained other wise i shall never know but as we fought and strained in the darkness the sharp trill of a whistle reached us from without at the same instant i lunged for ward to stumble over an overturned table and fall heavily to the floor only a moment i lay there dazed but in that brief interval the creature had sprung through the doorway and dis appeared with a curse at my clumsi ness i followed just in time to see a flying form round the prow end of the ship up the moonlit deck i tore at a speed i have never equaled before or since to find at its far end the trem bling little steward who stared at me with the wild glare of a maniac the man i shouted the man who just went bywhich way did he go oh gawd sir screamed the stew ard did you see it oh did you see it a giant black dog the size of a small horse it had on pants and a white shirt youre mad it was running on its hind legs with eyes like balls of are i tried to scream butbutoh gawd the weak little fool gave a sobbing cry and fell forward into my arms in a faint at the same instant a ships officer emerged from a nearby stairway look after him i yelled to that startled official and pushing the uncon scious steward into his arms took up the chase once more already innumerable lights were be ing flashed around us as the sleepy murmurs and startled voices of the awakening passengers came from the gloom the wild shouting and the struggle had aroused them as surely as a gunshot soon they would be pour ing from their cabins with a thousand questions but directly ahead the still deserted deck was in semidarkness with objects barely discernible behind me i could hear the shouts of the ships officer who must have jumped to the conclusion that i was an escaping murderer who had callously tossed my victim into his own arms but there was no time for explanations up to ward the stern i ran passing the nu merous cabins and stairways but seeing no one at last to halt panting in the shadows of an overhanging lifeboat leaning against the ships rail and knowing the pangs of failure that last act was to prove my un doing what i did not know was that
