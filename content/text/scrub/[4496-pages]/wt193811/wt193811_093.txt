 weird tales wrist and dragged me through the doorway leading to a flatfaced house it was dark as moonless midnight in the place but my guide knew the way we could hear the shouting and the tumult in the street outside but it faded every second as he led me down a zig zag passage choked with utter black ness through a door that creaked and whined on rusty hinges and out into a narrow lane between high walls that reeked with dreadful smells and was paved with better left unguessedat debris we stumbled through the muck a dozen feet or so then brought up at a deadend whats this i cried theres no way out were trapped for the first time i had a good look at my conductor he was a giant ne gro and no eunuch a brown burnoose of camels hair was wrapped about him and from its updrawn hood his broad face with its startlingly white teeth and livercolored lips grinned at me like a fiend fresh out of erebus in one wide shortfingered hand he held a square cut length of rhinoceros hide and i saw the blow descending even as i saw the weapon this is the ending of thy pathway o eaterup of helpless maidens o murderer o infidel it seemed to me i heard the slapping im pact of the rawhide on my temple but i cant be sure for when it struck i ceased remembering anything i woke up in a big room windowless and vaulted like a tomb two brass lamps lighted it and from a pair of censers incense spiraled lazily i was lying on a cotton mattress upon the floor beside the wall by the other wall upon a similar pallet lay the body of a young girl wrapped in a white wind ingsheet she had been a pretty thing with curling russet hair white creamy skin and small cleanly cut features across her temple was a gash which might have been a sword cut or a cut from splintered glass and another half closed wound showed in her throat facing me between the body and the mattress where i lay an old man squatted crosslegged he was dressed in a white cotton djebba and on his head he wore a tur ban wound with green which marked him as a pilgrim to the holy places and mecca his face was pale lined as cetic the beard that hung down to his waist was almost white as his bleached robe and seemed to have a silky almost iridescent texture as i whimpered with the pain of waking he looked at me he did not turn his head but just moved his eyes and i quailed before his glance as from a physical attack yet there seemed no anger in his look rather it was reproachful infi nitely sad and it seemed to me a little puzzled they were strange violet blue eyes he had and i wondered at their lightness until i recalled many egyptians have turkish blood and turks are often blonds behold thy handiwork o guelbi he commanded gesturing toward the body with a mo tion of his eyes she was my sole remaining child my soul my heart my eyes and thou hast brought her to the grave is it not enough for thee to drive thy devilwagons through the streets where women walk unveiled and men are drunk on the forbidden wine must thou also come into our quarter scattering death and misfortune i got up on my elbow rather weakly for the knockout blow had left me faint and dizzy im terribly sorry i apol ogized but it was not all my fault your coachman turned the carriage right before my car and it was impossi ble to stop
