the nameless city toms of the nameless city many things were peculiar and inexplicable the civilization which included a written alphabet had seemingly risen to a higher order than those immeasurably later civilizations of egypt and chal dea yet there were curious omissions i could for example find no pictures to represent deaths or funeral customs save such as were related to wars vio lence and plagues and i wondered at the reticence shown concerning natural death it was as though an ideal of immortality had been fostered as a cheering illusion still nearer the end of the passage were painted scenes of the utmost picturesqueness and extravagance con trasted views of the nameless city in its desertion and growing ruin and of the strange new realm of paradise to which the race had hewed its way through the stone in these views the city and the desert valley were shown always by moonlight a golden nimbus hovering over the fallen walls and half revealing the splendid perfection of former times shown spectrally and elusively by the artist the paradisal scenes were al most too extravagant to be believed portraying a hidden world of eternal day filled with glorious cities and ethereal hills and valleys at the very last i thought i saw signs of an artistic anticlimax the paintings were less skilful and much more bizarre than even the wildest of the earlier scenes they seemed to record a slow decadence of the ancient stock coupled with a growing ferocity toward the outside world from which it was driven by the desert the forms of the peoplealways represented by the sacred reptilesappeared to be gradually wasting away though their spirits as shown hovering above the ruins by moonlight gained in propor tion emaciated priests displayed as reptiles in ornate robes cursed the upper air and all who breathed it and one terrible final scene showed a primi tivelooking man perhaps a pioneer of ancient irem the city of pillars torn to pieces by members of the older race i remembered how the arabs fear the nameless city and was glad that beyond this place the gray walls and ceiling were bare as i viewed the pageant of mural history i had approached very closely the end of the lowceiled hall and was aware of a gate through which cams all of the illuminating phosphorescence creeping up to it i cried aloud in transcendent amazement at what lay beyond for instead of other and brighter chambers there was only an illimitable void of uniform radiance such as one might fancy when gazing down from the peak of mount everest upon a sea of sunlit mist behind me was a passage so cramped that i could not stand upright in it before me was an infinity of subterranean effulgence reaching down from the passage into the abyss was the head of a steep flight of stepssmall numerous steps like those of the black passages i had trav ersedbut after a few feet the glow ing vapors concealed everything swung back open against the lefthand wall of the passage was a massive door of brass incredibly thick and decorated with fantastic basreliefs which could if closed shut the whole inner world of light away from the vaults and pas sages of rock i looked at the steps and for the nonce dared not try them i touched the open brass door and could not move it then i sank prone to the stone floor my mind aflame with prodigious reflections which not even a deathlike exhaustion could banish
