 weird tales we drove fast over strange roads so closely was my attention cen tered upon my companion that i did not concern myself with the way we went later i was to become uneasy over the distance we had traversed but when i did he reassured me and i be lieved that we were then on our way home and nearly there i thought he meant by home my fathers house and had i not thought that my wildest nightmare could not have whispered to me what it was that he called home he was very silent i spoke little and he seldom answered me that did not alarm me as it might have done be cause of my everpresent conviction of my childishness my crudeness i blamed myself because my remarks were so stupid that they were not worth a reply and the taciturnity that so em barrassed me yet added to the fascina tion that made me sit motionless hour after hour longing more than anything else in the world to get a good look at the face beside me to arouse more in terest in my companion once only he spoke of his own ac cord he asked me why i was called leonora i asked him if he did not think it was a pretty name remembering how he had said at our first meeting that it was music in his ears but i was disap pointed for he did not compliment my name again some would say it was an illstarred name but luckily people are not su perstitious as they used to be if that is lucky you can not call it illstarred i wanted to provoke him into talk ing more to me i wanted his atten tion but he did not answer me i can not go on i can not finish my story as i intended to do telling things as they happened in their right order there are things i must explain things that people have said about me that i must deny and the night is growing late and the rapping i hear all night long upon my windowpane between the bars that shut me in but that will soon protect me no longer is growing louderas the dawn approaches the pain in my heart of which the doctor has said i would die soon is growing unendurable and when i come to the end of my storyto the end which i will set downi do not know what will happen then but that which i am to write of is so dreadful that i have never dared to think of it not of that itself but of the horrible ending to the story i am telling i must finish before the dawn for it is at the dawn that they must go and it is then that they would take me where he waits for me always at dawn but to explain firstpeople say i am mad you who will read this will doubtless believe them but tell me this where was i from the time i disap peared from my fathers house until i was found mad as they say and clutching in my frenzied graspthe finger of a skeleton in what dread struggle did i tear that finger loose and from what dreadful hand and although i a living woman could not remain in the abode of death if i have not been touched by the very finger of death then tell me this why is my flesh like the flesh of the dead so that the doctors say it is like leprous flesh although it is not lep rous would god it were nowr let me go on our silent drive continued through the flying hours flying hours for i was unconscious of the lapse of time excepting for the once when i vaguely
