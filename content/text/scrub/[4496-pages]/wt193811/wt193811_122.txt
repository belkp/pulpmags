leonora and new life my last attack of un reasoning terror had passed away again and again it seemed as though it left behind it a reaction that urged me more strongly than ever toward adven ture had he been at the crossroad in the bitter storms of january and on the sparkling white night which i spent close indoors would he be there on the night of the next full moon the march moon there was still no breath of spring in the air on that night the winters snow lay in the hollows no longer whitely sparkling but spoiled by the cold rains that had come since it had fallen the night sky was wild with wind torn clouds and the moonlight was now clear and brilliant now weirdly dim and again swept away by great black sweeping shadows the air was full of the smell of damp earth and rotted leaves i did not go to margarets i sat by the fire dreaming strange dreams while the clock ticked the hours slowly by and the fire sank low at my father yawned and went up to his roam at a quarter before i took my heavy cloak and wrapped it around me a little later i went out i knew that i would find him wait ing there was no doubt of that to night it was not curiosity that drove me but some deeper urge some urge i know no name for i was like a swimmer in a dangerous current caught at last by the undertow the car stood in the crossroad low and dark although it was a finely made machine i was sure it seemed to me for the first time to be in some way very peculiar but at that moment a cloud swept across the face of the moon and i lost interest in the matter with a last vague thought that it must be of foreign make then suddenly i was aware that for the first time the stranger had opened the door of the car before me indeed this was the first time i had approached on the side of the vacant seat beside the driver we ride tonight leonora why not and what else did you come out for that was true for the first time i now met him not on my way home not on my way anywhere i had met him only to meet him and he ex pected me to ride he had never forced or tried to urge me but tonight he expected me to ride wouldnt it seem silly to have come out only to ex change two or three words and go back and wouldnt it be better to go with him a less inexperienced girl might take the trouble to leave her house on a stormy march night for the sake of a real adventureonly a very green country girl would have come out at all for less i would go i had entered the car i sat beside him and when the moon shone out brightly i tried to study his face as he started the car down the narrow road i met with no success i had become conscious of a burning anxiety to see more clearly what was the manner of this man who had been the subject of so much speculation the reason of so many dreams but here beside him i could see no more clearly than i had seen him from the road the side of his face which was turned toward me and which was partly exposed between the deepbrimmed hat and the turned up collar of his cloak was still deeply shaded by the car itself so that i had the same elusive impression as before of strong sharp features a deepset gaze a smiling expression
