lynne foster is dead eunuch sat upon the box beside the coachman a slave sat in the carriage with her and the enveloping faradje and charsaf made her look as sexless as a sack of meal writh a flowerpot on top of it thus enveloped i could have smuggled almost anything smaller than a rollsroyce out with me and bit by bit i took my jewels from the treasure chests and handed them to reshad as he helped me from the coach after praying i was always in a state of near collapse so i had an excellent excuse to be driven through the streets for some time before returning to the haremlik reshad found it convenient to direct our route past the counting house of himor kimirian who in ad dition to being a fellow armenian was one of cairos shrewdest bankers and jewel brokers when most of my jewels were dis posed of we were ready for our break a jewish friend of kimirians leased a small shop and to this i was driven on my way back from the mosque of course the slave accompanied me into the place but she saw nothing amiss when a woman assistant handed coffee to us i dont know what the stuff con tained but it must have been most potent for the girl had hardly swal lowed it when she fell over in a stupor the rest was almost shamelessly easy i left the shop by the back door met reshad in the alley and got into another carriage in a short time we were at kimirians where i changed my clothes and within an hour i was on my way to alexandria with nearly a million francs to my account at the credit lyonnais and a most artistically forged british passport in my reticule i knew just how a prisoner reprieved from life incarceration feels when i stepped from the marseillesparis train de grande vitesse i was a comtesse de monte cristo and the world was mine i was youngat least it seemed the body they had given me was scarcely past its adolescence beautiful and rich and absolutely at a loose end i reveled in my freedom going on long shopping tours at libertys and the galeries lafayette or the smaller more exclusive shops consulting skilled coiffeurs and couturieres riding dining going to the theater and the opera i was catching up on all id missed of life during five years spent behind the harems lattices and loving every in stant of it then gradually but surely i became tired of myself i still admired my womans body and took pleasure in adorning it but it and ithe real i had not fused when i was with men i felt like a man and to come in contact with them roused purely masculine re actions i could shake hands with them or touch them casually but to be made love to by them outraged me as much as if i still wore a mans body when i was with women i felt like a woman there was pleasure but no thrill in kiss ing them or being kissed by them also i soon discovered men were much the same in europe as in northern africa the principal distinction being that the moslems were more frank about their attitude finally i decided to come back to america there would be a sort of bittersweet solace in visiting the scenes i knew so well and seeing all the friends id known yet passing them unrecog nized like a ghost who haunts the scenes hed known in life and watches his old friends while he remains in visible one of the first things that i did on my arrival was to visit the museum and make them a contribution my gift
