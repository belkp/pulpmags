leonora the end of my strength and any night with its horrors may be the end i must control myself and think of the things i am writing down as they seemed to me at the time i was just turned sixteen and this was romance and so i stopped and talked to him although we exchanged few words that night he did not ask me to ride with him and so i was less afraid for with the romance was fear but i answered his questions what is your name he asked and i answered leonora it is music in my ears he said softly and again i felt that this was romance i felt it again when he added i have been looking for you for a long time of course i did not dreami did not think that he meant that i had read novels and love stories i knew how to take a compliment do you often pass this way as late as this something made me hesitate but something about him something about our meeting alone in the moonlight fascinated me if i said no perhaps i would never see him again very often when the moon is full i said and moved to go around the car in a moment the gloved hand that rested on the wheel had touched the broad brim of his hat another move ment and the car shot silently ahead and was gone i ran home with a beating heart my last words had almost made a ren dezvous of the night of the next full moon if i desired there might be another encounter yet it was two months later when we met again the very next full moon had been clear cloudless frostily cold and a lovely november night but that night i was so afraid that i even avoided the full light of the moon when i crossed our yard in the early evening to bring in a book i had left lying out side at the thought of traversing the road that led to margarets house every instinct within me rebelled at midnight i was lying in my bed with the covers drawn close around me and my wideopen eyes turned resolutely away from the patch of moonlight that lay deathly white beneath my open window i was like a person in a ner vous fiti who had never known the meaning of nerves but the second month it was dif ferent after all it was a fine thing to have mystery and romance for the taking mine or were they mine for the tak ing perhaps the man in the long low car had never come again would never come again but his voice had promised something different would he be there tonight had he been there a month ago curiosity began to drive me be fore it after all he had made no move to harm me and there had been something about him something that drew and drew me surely my childish fears were the height of follythe product of my loneliness i went to margarets and stayed latealmost as on that other night until the clock struck at last with a selfconsciousness that was noticeable only to me i wrapped my heavy coat around me and went out into the night the night had changed it was bit terly cold and there was a heavy freezing mist in the air which lay thickly in the hollows the shadows of the bare trees struck through the dis mal vapors like dangling limbs of skeletons what am i writing thinking of the scream that pierced the night i
