lynne foster is dead from me i should have retched for the cloths were wet with thick redbrown liquid i feared it was blood and the torment of the sickness which i felt but which i could not give way to al most made me faint the man reached underneath his ragged filthy burnoose and fished out a palmful of coarse powder reddish gray and flaked like bran which he threw upon the orangeglowing char coal instantly the room was filled with a thick penetrating vapor sweet as musk and acrid as peatsmoke which eddied to the vaulted ceiling then seemed to pour back down again al most like a liquid i did my best to hold my breath but presently i had to inhale and the incenseif it could be called sostung and cut my throat like acid i was slipping off into a state of anesthesia my eyes were watering my nose seemed plugged with cotton my throat was clogged with phlegm my heart was beating wildly and i could not breathe yet somehow i retained con sciousness the withered hag produced a leather sack about the size of a tobacco pouch and thrust her hands in it they came out greasy dripping fat she took the mans hands between hers and rubbed them till they glistened with the rancid unguent then round and round the room they marched with an awkward goosestep sort of pace clapping their hands with a sliding motion as if they had been cymbals and reciting some strange gibberish in a kind of synco pated singsong they marched so many times around me and the body that i lost count of their circlings and it was something of a shock when they abruptly halted the man before the dead girl the old crone at my feet then with a leaping pounce they jumped and landed full astride us the man upon the dead girls chest the old witch straddling mine she ran her greasy hands across my brow in the same place that the girl was wounded and i felt a searing pain as if shed scored me with a redhot iron from the corner of my eye i saw her male companion follow suit and as his greasesmeared fingers touched the dead girls wound it seemed miracu lously to heal leaving smooth white skin where there had been a livid gap ing wound a moment before in an other instant she had marked my throat in the same spot where the girl was wounded again i felt that burning tor ment and once more saw the girls wound close beneath the greasy fingers of the man now they both fell chanting in a slow but everquickening tune and the old witch drew a needlebladed dagger from her girdle a sort of phosphor escence seemed to shine upon her hands where she had smeared the fat on them and this was transferred to the knife for i saw blue sparks fly from it like frictionstars thrown off by an emery wheel she began to stab me not deeply but with a quick pecking motion so her fiery dagger seemed to dart as if it were a sewingmachine needle or the tool of a tattooist deliberately as though she found the task pleasant and meant to savor every possible delight in it she drove her dagger through my earlobes pierced my left nostril then speeding up her strokes traced a swirl ing line of arabesques across my cheeks over my chest up and down my arms and legs and stomach the pain was almost past endurance for the dagger burned as if it had been heated to a white glow but i was powerless to move or even flinch beneath the tor
