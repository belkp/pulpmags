fothergills jug commissary and i made a little im pression with that but i had no vise in my tent and i was afraid id shat ter the thing so i gave that up im damned glad now that i did bowen that plug is some sort of wax some sort of plastic you can see how it was put in there it was poured in there hot so i decided to try to melt it out i made a little oven out of bricks and took the top off my gasoline lamp and set the lamp in side then i lit her up and put the jug on top bottomside up that brought results but not the results id anticipated listen the plug didnt melt any my flame wasnt hot enough but whatevers inside didnt like that heat treatment a little bit about two min utes after id set that jug on the fire it began to jump around like a tea kettle on a stove i couldnt hold it still and i tell you i didnt try very hard to hold it still either when i saw that i took it off the fire quick and put my lamp back together again and in about five minutes it stopped jiggling and thats the gospel truth so help me i thought that over for a minute you havent necessarily proved that whatevers in there is alive i pointed out there have been chemists of a sort since time immemorial havent there maybe youve dug up some ancient alchemists pet brew its a wonder you werent blown to blazes he shook his head the things alive he reiterated stubbornly ill show you he walked out into the hall and i could hear him prying the boards off one of the crates after a moment he came back with a halfdozen half inch boards and a bundle of excelsior he arranged those combustiles in the fireplace put the ancient vessel on top lit a match and touched off the excelsior a bright hot flame that quickly singed our faces and drove us back from the fireplace sprang up at once watch the jug fothergill grunted i watched all right the vessel lay on its side in a bed of fire as the excelsior burned away from beneath it sank down between two blazing boards it was certainly getting hot then that jug began to move it moved in violent jerksas though whatever was imprisoned inside was hurling itself again and again against the stonelike seal and it moved purposefullyin one direction jerkjerkjerkinch by inch it shifted along the trough between the blazing boards until it slid with a thump down to the hot tiles then it began to roll on its circumference quite swiftly tooout toward the center of the room when it was about ten feet from the fire it stopped abruptly and decisively as though the whole of its enigmatic contents had suddenly thrown their mass into one quick braking movement my god bowen you never saw water boiling in a pot or a mess of chemicals either act like that foth ergill groaned you want a drink ive got practically a full quart in my bag i did want a drink desperately but i didnt want fothergill to see how severely his demonstration had shaken meand i wanted one of us at least to retain some semblance of sanity the hardwood floor was be ginning to scorch so i quickly called fothergills attention to that the things burning your floor
