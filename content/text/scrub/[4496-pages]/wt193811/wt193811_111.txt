 weird tales had seen and heard before at sunrise and sunset and judged it was a normal thing i decided it came from some rock fissure leading to a cave and watched the troubled sand to trace it to its source soon perceiving that it came from the black orifice of a temple a long distance south of me almost out of sight against the choking sand cloud i plodded toward this temple which as i neared it loomed larger than the rest and showed a doorway far less clogged with caked sand i would have entered had not the ter rific force of the icy wind almost quenched my torch it poured madly out of the dark door sighing uncan nily as it ruffled the sand and spread among the weird ruins soon it grew fainter and the sand grew more and more still till finally all was at rest again but a presence seemed stalking among the spectral stones of the city and when i glanced at the moon it seemed to quiver as though mirrored in unquiet waters i was more afraid than i could explain but not enough to dull my thirst for wonder so as soon as the wind was quite gone i crossed into the dark chamber from which it had come this temple as i had fancied from the outside was larger than either of those i had visited before and was presumably a natural cavern since it bore winds from some region beyond here i could stand quite upright but saw that the stones and altars were as low as those in the other temples on the walls and roof i beheld for the first time some traces of the pictorial art of the ancient race curious curling streaks of paint that had almost faded or crumbled away and on two of the altars i saw with rising excitement a maze of wellfashioned curvilinear carvings as i held my torch aloft it seemed to me that the shape of the roof was too regular to be natural and i wondered what the prehistoric cut ters of stone had first worked upon their engineering skill must have been vast then a bright flare of the fantastic flame showed me that for which i had been seeking the opening to those re moter abysses whence the sudden wind had blown and i grew faint when i saw that it was a small and plainly artificial door chiselled in the solid rock i thrust my torch within be holding a black tunnel with the roof arching low over a rough flight of very small numerous and steeply descend ing steps i shall always see those steps in my dreams for i came to learn what they meant at the time i hardly knew whether to call them steps or mere footholds in a precipitous descent my mind was whirling with mad thoughts and the words and warnings of arab prophets seemed to float across the desert from the lands that men know to the nameless city that men dare not know yet i hesitated only a moment before advancing through the portal and commencing to climb cau tiously down the steep passage feet first as though on a ladder it is only in the terrible phantasms of drugs or delirium that any other man can have such a descent as mine the narrow passage led infinitely down like some hideous haunted well and the torch i held above my head could not light the unknown depths toward which i was crawling i lost track of the hours and forgot to consult my watch though i was frightened when i thought of the distance i must be traversing there were changes of di rection and of steepness and once i came to a long low level passage
