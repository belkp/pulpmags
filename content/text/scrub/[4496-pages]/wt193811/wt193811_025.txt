 weird tales with dinner so near i laughed to con ceal my own excitement some day i may tell it to you and i promise you will find it unusual however you have shown me one thing that a ring of such importance should not remain hidden in the pockets of ones clothing but displayed where all can see it and i slipped the heavy band on my end finger inwardly i had not felt the calmness i displayed there was i knew at least one person who could have told the history of the ring as well as sev eral other matters that had been puz zling me for days i made a mental note to question the midnight lady at the first opportune moment we had left our deck chairs en route to the smokingroom when my compan ion whose stateroom was next to mine asked a strange and sudden question tell me mr ohara he spoke with the awkward manner of one who begins an embarrassing subject have have you been hearing any strange noises during the past two nights his gray eyes looked quizzically into mine strange noises then you have heard nothing to disturb you at my somewhat surprised and nega tive answer he shrugged his shoulders with a puzzled smile it must be nerves he admitted yet i could have sworn that during the dead of night i heard soft whining and the scratching of claws before our doorslike that of some wild animal seeking entrance it was late that night before i en tered my cabin in the morning we would dock and there was much that was before me but the beauty of a tropical moon had kept me on deck till nearly midnight even then i did not seek my berth but sitting in a corner in the darkness of the room i meditatively fingered the ring that was to be my one creden tial in a strange unknown land for a while my thoughts were many but presently all grew hazy heavy eyelids gradually closed the cigarette went cold and unlighted at last to fall to the carpet as my head sank forward on my chest the hours passed and the moon rose till its white beams poured through the porthole but still i slept it was close on to four in the morning when with a quick intake of breath i came to my self i looked sleepily around but in the dim light of the room its contents were barely discernible for a moment i was puzzled as to the reason of my sudden awakening and then in an in stant i was conscious of its cause it was a soundthe sound of a soft whining as my cabin door was being slowly opened amid the rumbling of the ships en gines and splashing of the waves i could hear ita soft impatient whine together with a heavy breathing si lently my eyes glued to the doorway i gathered myself together as a tall fig ure in a white shirt appeared in the opening and the cool night air came whistling into the room as i tensed myself to attack with the stealth of a cat the intruder glided into the cabin and closed the door behind him but at the same instant i sprang from my chair and hurtled toward him even as i launched myself a foul almost suffocating odor rose up to meet me like that of some wild animals cage gone uncleaned for weeks i crashed against the unknown and together we fell to the floor two arms of almost superhuman strength sought to encircle me as a hairy body was
