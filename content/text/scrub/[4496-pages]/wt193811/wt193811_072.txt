the thing in the trunk fore the bullet struck her that opper could hardly stand it frantically he gripped the lock with the pliers and wrenched back the rusted jaws slipped off the lock and he fell to his knees he jumped up and bent over the lock it was scratched a little that was all opper hammered at the lock with the pliers and with the wooden jack handle it was like the effort of a child to open a bank vault after a few minutes of it with the sound of his blows ringing over the empty fields around him he stopped the whimpering of the trapped thing in the trunk was sounding louder the hammering had frightened it opper snatched up the metal shank of the screwdriver and reached across the trunk to its hinges he caught up the heavy unwieldy jack the hinges were almost concealed by the rear trunk panel but he located them he placed the shank of the screwdriver against one of them and pounded with the jack a long jagged dent leaped into be ing next to the hinge the hinge itself bent a little but was not noticeably in jured he lost his head a little and ham mered wildly frenziedly at it with the whimper maddening his ears be tween blows the hinge didnt bend any more hysterically he raised the jack and brought it down with all his strength on top of the trunk the top sagged inward in a deep dent with a slight hole appearing where the corner of the jacks base had struck my god no opper chattered aloud staring at the tiny hole not that way somebody could see in panicstricken he battered at the metal around the little hole trying to force the jagged edges together then he stopped abruptly as the sound of a slowing motor came to his ears he stared back along the road and saw a battered small car coasting to ward him a leatheryfaced man at the wheel was staring first at him and then at the trunk the man got out of the car and walked toward the sedan opper saw a star pinned to his vest glinting as the lapel of his coat twitched with his walking with death in his heart opper faced the man and forced a smile let my temper get the best of me he said loudly the whimper had stopped for the moment but it might sound faintly again at any time ive lost the key to this trunk and i was trying to break into it so i see said the man his leath ery face expressionless his level eyes went again from op per to the trunk kind of funny you stopping way out here on the road and trying to ham mer a trunk open he said theres nothing funny about it opper retorted he wrenched his eyes from the tiny hole in the trunks top if you got right over that hole and looked down hard you might see ive lost the key and i want to get into it thats all ii have some route maps in there and i need them for my days drive route maps you can get those at any fillingstation i know opper nodded smiling till his jaws ached i thought of that after id started to break open the trunk but then as i said i rather lost my temper and gave it a bang on the lid i should think youd stop at some
