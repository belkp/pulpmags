                         SALVATIA BERTOVI stood 
                         just under the flap of her 
                         tent watching the droves of 
                         people as they thronged in 
                         through the gates. Every foot of the 
                         circus grounds was crowded now. 
                         Lions roared for the customers' bene- 
                         fit, the merry-go-round churned with 
                         shrill American melodies, men on 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         platforms bellowed about "the great- 
                         est wonders of creation -- fire-eaters, 
                         wild men from Borneo, bearded wo- 
                         men and tattooed men!" 
                     
                     
                         Salvatia watched the opening day 
                         of the Benoit Circus: a girl of nine- 
                         teen in a white tulle ballet skirt with 
                         a glittering rhinestone brassiere 
                         around her high-peaked, jutting 
                         bosom. Always the Benoit Circus 
                         opened on the grounds just a kilo-

                         meter from Versailles; always her 
                         heart pumped like mad and her big 
                         black eyes widened and her small red 
                         tongue came out to moisten soft red 
                         lips. 
                     
                     
                         And so Salvatia watched and her 
                         heart beat like mad. She did not hear 
                         Pietro come in through the rear of 
                         the tent; she did not know that her 
                         fiance was there until she felt his 
                         arms go around her waist. 
                     
                     
                         He whispered, "Salvatia ! Salvatia !" 
                         And, his mouth touched her cheek, 
                         pressing her head back, seeking her 
                         lips. 
                     
                     
                         Despite herself Salvatia went a lit- 
                         tle stiff. She thought to herself: 
                     
                     
                         "Sometime, when Pietro takes me 
                         in his arms like this, I shall go limp 
                         with joy; I shall go out of my head 
                         with loving him. It will come in time. 
                         I have not made a mistake in promis- 
                         ing to marry him." 
                     
                     
                         But so far it had not come. Nor 
                         could she understand why her blood 
                         stayed so cool when Pietro kissed her 
                         and caressed her lovingly. Pietro was 
                         very handsome and young and gypsy- 
                         dark. His tent, where he managed the 
                         rifle shooting, was always crowded 
                         with women asking to be taught how 
                         to shoot. 
                     
                     
                         For Pietro had fire in his eyes. She, 
                         Salvatia Bertovi, was very lucky in- 
                         deed to have won the love of this 
                         great dark man whom so many wo- 
                         men wanted. 
                     
                     
                         She thought all this as Pietro's 
                         arms drew her closer, as his mouth 
                         closed over her own and as his hands 
                         slid around her waist, pressing her to 
                         him tightly. 
                     
                     
                         Pietro looked down into her slim, 
                         dark face, his black eyes burning over 
                         that soft beauty. He said, 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "I shouldn't have come. There is so 
                         little time before your act is on, be- 
                         fore I'm needed at the rifles. Once I 
                         hold you like this I can't let you go." 
                     
                     
                         She understood. She tried to pull 
                         out of his embrace but Pietro held 
                         her, firmly. He said, evenly, 
                     
                     
                         "Salvatia, do you love me? When 
                         I'm with you I think YES. When I'm 
                         away and can see things clearly I 
                         think NO." 
                     
                     
                         Salvatia said coolly, "I love you, 
                         Pietro." But her voice lacked 
                         warmth; her eyes did not glow as 
                         Rosalie Benoit's blue eyes glowed 
                         when she looked upon Pietro. And 
                         Salvatia thought: 
                     
                     
                         "Rosalie really loves Pietro even 
                         though she is ashamed of loving a 
                         gypsy" And Salvatia knew as Pietro 
                         gazed at her that he was mentally 
                         comparing her coolness with Rosalie's 
                         warm emotions; that he was weigh- 
                         ing them both, one against the other, 
                         and that he was finding her, Salvatia, 
                         lacking. 
                     
                     
                         "There's time for a few kisses, 
                         Pietro," she whispered, huskily. 
                     
                     
                         Pietro crushed her to him, put his 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 4 NIGHT LIFE TALES 
                 
                     
                     
                         mouth on hers with such force that 
                         her lips parted. She was not surprised 
                         then that her heart did thump, that 
                         her knees trembled and that a pulse 
                         throbbed unmercifully in her throat. 
                         The flame of his love swept her up 
                         into a moment where she was blind. 
                     
                     
                         Later, Pietro put Salvatia out of 
                         his arms and hurried back to his con- 
                         cession. His thoughts were of busi- 
                         ness now; not of love. 
                     
                     
                         "Why doesnt' love come to me? I 
                         was made for love !" 
                     
                     
                         But there was no time to wonder. 
                         She hurried out of the tent into the 
                         late summer afternoon. The fair 
                         grounds were as hot as all oven, 
                         steaming with people. The men 
                         stopped short with a clatter of their 
                         wooden shoes as Salvatia sped toward 
                         the main tent and the little groups of 
                         waiting performers behind it. She 
                         felt those masculine eyes upon her 
                         and wondered if, among the peasants 
                         or the Paris gentlemen, there was 
                         one man who could touch off the 
                         spark of her lambent love. 
                     
                     
                         And then suddenly Salvatia stopped 
                         short, her black eyes wide, her mouth 
                         apart and her bosom swelling sud- 
                         denly with an emotion that was 
                         strangely akin to love--for it was 
                         hate. She stood there, tense and stiff, 
                         staring straight in front of her. 
                     
                     
                         At a raised platform facing a tent 
                         where a tall, slim, yellow-haired 
                         giant, in an American cow-boy cos- 
                         tume -- chaps, blue polka-dot shirt, 
                         handkerchief knotted at the throat-- 
                         was calling to the passer-by, waving 
                         his ten gallon hat at them: 
                     
                     
                         "See the greatest wild bear in the 
                         world! Watch me wrestle with the 
                         wildest bear in captivity. A Rocky 
                         Mountain grizzly! Only ten centimes! 
                         The show begins at once, monsieurs 
                         et mesdames! Only ten centimes!" 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         The tall blond man on the platform 
                         was Sammy Richards, the American. 
                         And Salvatia hated him. Four years 
                         ago he had been with the Benoit Cir- 
                         cus as a barker; four years ago she 
                         had thought that she loved him. She 
                         had stayed awake nights wondering 
                         how it would feel to be in his arms, 
                         to have him crushing her gypsy lov- 
                         eliness close to him. She had even 
                         gone so far as to make up a pretext 
                         that would take them walking in the 
                         woods in the moonlight. 
                     
                     
                         But even though Sammy's blue eyes 
                         had blazed, even though his breath 
                         had gone short in his throat that love- 
                         ly dance had not made him forget that 
                         she was, after all, a gypsy girl and 
                         therefore a social caste beneath the 
                         other members of the circus. He had 
                         gone away after the season, to 
                         America, his home--to some strange 
                         place called Hollywood where he said 
                         a fortune awaited him. 
                     
                     
                         But before he had gone he had done 
                         the one thing that made Salvatia hate 
                         him. She had gone to his tent that 
                         last night, she had stood there in the 
                         semi-darkness with hunger in her 
                         black eyes, with love trembling on 
                         her full lips. She was his woman. He 
                         had only to reach out and take her 
                         in his arms. Instead, he had looked at 
                         her closely ... at the inward curve 
                         of her waist, her slim perfect legs, 
                         and he had said, unmoved: 
                     
                     
                         "Salvatia, I saw you edging 
                         through the crowd today. Don't pick 
                         pockets. Be content with what Benoit 
                         pays you." 
                     
                     
                         She had stiffened, with hurt pride, 
                         with resentment. 
                     
                     
                         "All the gypsies pick pockets," she 
                         had said, evenly. "There's no harm 
                         in it." 
                     
                     
                         "But there is, Salvatia. One of these 
                         dumb Frenchmen will catch you at it

                         one of these days and you'll find your- 
                         self in prison . . . you and your father 
                         and Pietro. Just because all the gyp- 
                         sies pick pockets you don't have to. 
                         Promise me that you'll cut it out, 
                         Salvatia.' 
                     
                     
                         And then, without giving her a 
                         chance to answer he had practically 
                         pushed her out of his tent, had said, 
                         "Run along to bed now, Salvatia. Like 
                         a good little girl!" 
                     
                     
                         Because she was too furious to 
                         trust words in her mouth she had 
                         flung herself into a dance . . . wildly, 
                         . . . her hips swaying, her whole body 
                         swaying rhythmically with her agi- 
                         tated steps. Pietro had thrown aside 
                         his accordion. He had come to her 
                         through the moonlight. 
                     
                     
                         "You are my woman," he had said, 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         huskily. "I did not know it before." 
                         He had slipped his neck beads about her throat, 
                         had kissed them in place in gypsy bethrothal 
                         fashion and had crushed her in his arms. 
                     
                     
                         The next morning Sammy left and as if to 
                         prove to herself how much she hated him, 
                         Salvatia moved 
                     
                     
                         through the circus crowd and picked 
                         every pocket she saw. She had been 
                         picking pockets all the four years of 
                         Sammy's absence, getting satisfaction 
                         out of her nimble fingers and her 
                         defiance of his advice. She hadn't been 
                         caught nor would she be, even though 
                         her father and her mother had been 
                         and were in jail in Paris now. Pietro 
                         had just missed being caught. But 
                         Pietro was too slick . . . slick with 
                         his own cunning technique.

                         And at night when they emptied 
                         purses and laughed over some of the 
                         contents, Salvatia found a wild satis- 
                         faction in it. 
                     
                     
                         "We're gypsies, Pietro. There is no 
                         law for us. We do what we wish to 
                         do, don't we? We defy whom we 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         choose!" she would whisper. And 
                         there would be such a fire of hatred 
                         in her eyes that Pietro, seeing that 
                         strange flame, would confuse it with 
                         love and would crush her to him. 
                     
                     
                         And now Salvatia looked at Sammy 
                         Richards who was back after four 
                         years. There was sawdust flecked on 
                         his breeches and on his polka-dot 
                         blouse from the floor of the cage in 
                         which he had wrestled the bear. 
                         There was sawdust in his blonde hair 
                         and on the side of his face. In that 
                         moment he looked over the heads of 
                         the, people and saw her. He nodded 
                         to her, coolly, looking down upon her 
                         . . . a gypsy ... as if from a mountain 
                         top. 
                     
                     
                         Salvatia bit her lip and she seemed 
                         to gasp with indignation. She tossed 
                         her glossy head up, proudly, swung 
                         around on her heel and edged her 
                         way through the crowd picking pock- 
                         ets as she went. Out of the tail of 
                         one dark eye she could see Sammy 
                         watching her, disapproving. Her 
                         heart began to pound and her knees 
                         trembled beneath her as she hurried 
                         on to the big tent. She hated Sammy. 
                         It was fun doing something he 
                         loathed. 
                     
                     
                         That night after her last perform- 
                         ance in the tan bark ring, Salvatia 
                         got into her gypsy costume and min- 
                         gled with the crowd, her nimble fin- 
                         gers busy with pockets. She delighted 
                         in Sammy watching her from his 
                         platform, scowling down at her from 
                         his six-foot-three. And it came to her 
                         as she stood there, even as he yelled 
                         out for customers to watch him wres- 
                         tle with the bear, that she could hurt 
                         him. Not with love--but with hate. 
                         She went quickly over to Sammy's 
                         platform, leaned negligently against 
                         a cypress trunk, and with deep mal- 
                         ice in her eyes, she consistently

                         laughed at everything he said to the 
                         crowd; she said, derisively, loud 
                         enough for Sammy to hear, 
                     
                     
                         "I've seen that man do his act. It 
                         looks real, almost as if he were act- 
                         ually tussling with that grizzly. It's 
                         a nice act . . . but only an act! That 
                         old bear is as tame as any cat that 
                         ever curled up on a hearth!" 
                     
                     
                         People began to laugh. They looked 
                         up at Sammy and laughed in his face, 
                         and moved to other side-shows. 
                         Sammy climbed down off his plat- 
                         form and came up to Salvatia. His 
                         jaw was grim, his blue eyes furious. 
                     
                     
                         "What sort of a lousy gypsy trick 
                         was that, Salvatia Bertovi?" he de- 
                         manded, evenly. And he stood there 
                         in front of her, tall and blond and 
                         whitely American in his anger. 
                     
                     
                         Salvatia's heart began to pound 
                         beneath the tight blouse of her gypsy 
                         dress, her knees shook one against 
                         the other. Hatred was delicious. She 
                         hadn't felt as alive as this since she 
                         could remember. She threw back her 
                         dark head, her black eyes burned their 
                         hatred against his face. 
                     
                     
                         "You are a fake, Sammy Richards !" 
                         she said, coldly. "Four years ago you 
                         were a barker for Benoit. Now you 
                         come back wrestling a bear! You 
                         have but to look at that old grizzly 
                         to know that he is as tame as any 
                         kitten. You have but to look at YOU 
                         to know that you couldn't even wres- 
                         tle ME!" 
                     
                     
                         Somehow, even hating him as she 
                         did, she couldn't endure him looking 
                         at her like that. He had never looked 
                         at her like that before and so she 
                         said, "Fake! Go back to your cage 
                         and wrestle with that tired old bear! 
                         I think you have two customers wait- 
                         ing!" And then she spun around on 
                         her heel and left him. 
                     
                     
                         With quick little steps she hurried 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         across the circus lot. She headed 
                         straight for Poetro's rifle range 
                          which was closed now. She thought 
                          wildly, 
                     
                     
                         "I'll go into Pietro's arms. I'll stay 
                         in them for a long while and tomor- 
                         row Pietro and I will be married. 
                         There is no need to wait any longer!" 
                     
                     
                         She slipped around behind Pietro's 
                         tent and would have gone straight 
                         through the opening. But the sound 
                         of whispers inside stopped her, made 
                         her stand there in the moonlight lis- 
                         tening despite herself. 
                     
                     
                         Pietro was saying, softly, in a hurt 
                         voice, "Salvatia does not love me, 
                         Rosalie. For four years I have never 
                         been sure of her. But now I know. 
                         She doesn't care. Perhaps it's be- 
                         cause your yellow hair dazzles my 
                         eyes when I'm with her. Perhaps its 
                         because I've offered her only a part 
                         of my heart since most of it belongs 
                         only to you. Rosalie . . . 
                     
                     
                         Then Salvatia heard Pietro say, in 
                         that throbbing voice, "Rosalie are we 
                         always to hide our love like this?" 
                     
                     
                         Salvatia listened no longer. With 
                         a little sigh she struck out toward 
                         the woods where she could sit in soli- 
                         tude and think; where she could stare 
                         up at the moon and try to puzzle out 
                         why hatred had become so much 
                         more important in her life than love. 
                         Hating Sammy was more important 
                         to her than loving Pietro . . . and so 
                         she had lost Pietro. 
                     
                     
                         She was clear across the circus 
                         . grounds, walking slowly, when she 
                         heard footsteps behind her, when she 
                         heard Sammy Richards say, in a furi- 
                         ous voice, "Salvatia!" 
                     
                     
                         He came up behind her, caught her 
                         slim, bare shoulders in his hands and 
                         swung her around to face him. He 
                         shook her until her teeth rattled in 
                         her head and until her eyes felt as if 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 8 NIGHT LIFE TALES 
                 
                     
                     
                         they were being wrung from their 
                         sockets. He stormed out. 
                     
                     
                         "You stay away from my platform 
                         tomorrow, do you hear? If you don't 
                         I'll call the gendarmes the first time 
                         I see you slip a finger into a pocket 
                         . . . you or your beloved Pietro. I'm 
                         going to be with Benoit all this sea- 
                         son and I'm not going to have you 
                         starting this fake business on the 
                         road. Do you understand that?" 
                     
                     
                         Salvatia tossed her dark head up- 
                         ward, gypsy chieftain blood stirring 
                         in her veins, proud and hot. 
                     
                     
                         "Fake! Fake!" and her strong 
                         young arms locked themselves be- 
                         hind his back. When he broke that 
                         hold she slid another upon him, back 
                         of his neck. "Wrestle!" she spat at 
                         him. "If you can wrestle wild bears 
                         you can wrestle Salvatia who is only 
                         a woman . . . . " 
                     
                     
                         "Woman?" Sammy cried. "Not a 
                         woman ! A gypsy hell-cat!" 
                     
                     
                         Salvatia gritted her teeth and 
                         tightened her hold. They wrestled 
                         furiously. They tumbled to the 
                         ground, rolled on top of one another, 
                         their legs thrashing in the air. Their 
                         breaths mingled. Their arms locked. 
                         When Salvatia realized that he had 
                         indeed been wrestling that huge bear 
                         in the cage, that he was a far cry 
                         from a fake . . . and when she realized 
                         that the man held on to her even 
                         when he could have easily broken her 
                         hold . . . she went limp in his arms. 
                     
                     
                         Sammy bent nearer her, not speak- 
                         ing. His hand came out from his side 
                         and caressed her thick dark hair. He 
                         moved his palm over her face, feeling 
                         her slim straight nose, her lips, the 
                         soft line of her chin and looked into 
                         Salvatia's wide, burning eyes. He 
                         said, 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "I did not want to love you, Sal- 
                         vatia. That is why I went away. 
                         You're a gypsy. Men can not trust 
                         gypsies. Only another gypsy would 
                         know how to manage you ... to tame 
                         you!" 
                     
                     
                         Salvatia whispered, "You manage 
                         and tame that bear, Sammy. I'm not 
                         so strong as he." 
                     
                     
                         "It seems that neither of us knew 
                         our own minds," said Sammy. "For 
                         I went to California to forget you 
                         Salvatia. I made lots of money there, 
                         not with my bear, but with singing. 
                         I trapped that bear in the Rockies. 
                         I wrestled him because I knew that 
                         one day, despite myself, I would come 
                         back to you . . . that I would have to 
                         be strong to be worthy of you . . . . " 
                     
                     
                         Salvatia's lips turned up in a slow 
                         smile. "You understand women, 
                         Sammy . . . especially gypsy women !" 
                     
                     
                         And then she didn't say anything 
                         more. She even ceased to think. For 
                         Sammy had her in his strong young 
                         arms. Sammy's mouth was crushing 
                         down on her own in an endless kiss. 
                         She didn't even think of Pietro in 
                         that exquisite moment; Pietro who 
                         was thinking of her . . . Pietro who 
                         was holding Rosalie in his arms, who 
                         was threading his fingers through 
                         her golden hair and who was listen- 
                         ing to Rosalie saying, softly, breath- 
                         lessly, 
                     
                     
                         "Pietro, we'll run away tonight. 
                         Salvatia won't care. Earlier this even- 
                         ing I saw her hanging around that 
                         American gorgio, telling people what 
                         a fake he is and all the time love 
                         burned in her eyes. Just as I saw it 
                         burning once four years ago when he 
                         was a barker for mon pere. Pietro, 
                         you want me, too, don't you . . . oh, 
                         Pietro, darling, what does it matter 
                         if mon pere will be furious with me

                         A LITTLE Frenchman at the 
                         office of the Bal de Legion 
                         d' Honeur was adamant. 
                         His waxed black mous- 
                         tache danced excitedly on his upper 
                         lip. Indigo eyes sparkled. 
                     
                     
                         "I am sorry, Monsieur," he re- 
                         peated. "I cannot do nossing for

                         Eddie Quince gave vent to a labial 
                         noise closely approximating the fa- 
                         miliar Bronx cheer. "Nuts !" he mut- 
                         tered. 
                     
                     
                         "I beg your pardon, Monsieur," the 
                         little Frenchman said. 
                     
                     
                         "Forget it, Froggie. You're sure

                         A pained expresson floated over the 
                         Frenchman's face. "If I could, Mon-

                         Eddie scratched his head. "How 
                         about letting me see the admission 
                         list so I'll know who's going to be 
                         there? I've got to send some sort of 
                         a story back to my paper." 
                     
                     
                         The "gentleman of the press" label 
                         Eddie had assumed was nothing more 
                         than a label. He had been a news- 
                         paper reporter back in Kansas City, 
                         but it was so long ago he had forgot- 
                         ten what it was all about. His main 
                         purpose in posing as a newspaperman 
                     
                     
                         was to gain admission to the ex- 
                         clusive Bal de Legion d'Honeur. 
                     
                     
                         The little Frenchman brightened. 
                         "Oui, Monsieur, of course! Zat I can 
                         do!" He scuttled off, returning with 
                         counties sheets of typewritten names. 
                         Nine out of ten were prefixed 
                         "Chevalier". Eddie ran his eyes down 
                         the list. They stopped at the impres- 
                         sive cognomen: His Highness Victor 
                         San Remo Vallento et entourage 
                         d'Allsia. 
                     
                     
                         "Who's he?" Eddie queried. 
                     
                     
                         "Zee Crown Prince of Alesia, Mon- 
                         sieur." 
                     
                     
                         "And where is Alesia?" 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         The Frenchman shrugged. "Zat I 
                         do not know, Monsieur. His Highness 
                         is now at zee Vendome Hotel." 
                         There was a strange glint in 
                         Eddie's eyes. He copies down the 
                         royal dignitary's name. "Thanks a 
                         lot," he said. 
                     
                     
                         The Vendome was one of Paris' 
                         most expensive rococo hostelries. 
                         Bold as brass, Eddie walked up to 
                         the desk, asked for the Crown Prince. 
                     
                     
                         The clerk eyed him. "Who shall I 
                         say is calling, Monsieur?" 
                     
                     
                         "A representative of the Paris edi- 
                         tion of the New York Bulletin." 
                     
                     
                         Ten minutes later, Eddie was ad- 
                         mitted to a suite of rooms on the 
                         sixth floor of the hotel. As he entered 
                         the drawing room, he stopped short, 
                         stared straight ahead of him. There, 
                         reclining on a low, damask-covered 
                         divan, was a gorgeous dark-haired 
                         female! She was wearing a thin, 
                         spun-silver negligee, draped loosely 
                         about her body. 
                     
                     
                         "I--I beg your pardon," he mur- 
                         mured. 
                     
                     
                         The girl looked up from her mag- 
                         azine. Her black eyes flashed from 
                         long curled lashes. Her mouth, car- 
                         mine red and moist, smiled a greeting. 
                     
                     
                         "Bon jour, Monsieur. You have 
                         come to see zee Crown Prince?" She 
                         sat up. Eddie's heart thumped like a 
                         trip-hammer. 
                     
                     
                         A month in France had given Eddie 
                         a pretty fair idea of the local crop of 
                         beauties. They were plenty spiffy, all 
                         things considered. But this gorgeous 
                         creature, French or Alesian (what- 
                         ever that was!) had the Parisian 
                         cuties backed off the map for class. 
                     
                     
                         "Er--yes," Eddie Mumbled. "I -- 
                         I'd like to see His Highness." 
                     
                     
                         The girl swung her shapely legs off 
                         the divan. 
                     
                     
                         "Your name, Monsieur?" she

                         queried, rising. 
                     
                     
                         For a long moment Eddie found it 
                         difficult to reply. 
                     
                     
                         "Your name, Monsieur?" she re- 
                         peated, a faint smile playing about 
                         her voluptuously encarnadined lips. 
                     
                     
                         "Edward Quince," Eddie managed. 
                     
                     
                         She undulated out of the room, 
                         svelt hips swinging. Eddie felt the 
                         palms of his hands beginning to mois- 
                         ten. If, a bare half hour before, some- 
                         one had told him he was going to 
                         rest his eyes on a brunette Venus he 
                         would have laughed in that someone's 
                         face. 
                     
                     
                         Anxious moments went by. Eddie, 
                         possessed of a swell plan for getting 
                         into the Bal, almost forgot the pur- 
                         pose of his visit. Now, with the Stun- 
                         ning femme out of sight, it returned 
                         to mind. Everything would depend on 
                         whether this high-mucky-muck from 
                         Alesia was anywhere near Eddie's 
                         size and build. If he happened to be 
                         short, fat and roly-poly or tall, gaunt 
                         and angular, it would be just too 
                         bad. 
                     
                     
                         The curtains separating the draw- 
                         ing room of the suite from the one 
                         adjoining parted and the beautiful 
                         brunette returned. 
                     
                     
                         "I am sorry, Monsieur," she said, 
                         "but His Highness cannot be dis- 
                         turbed. He is resting in preparation 
                         for zee ball tonight. I am his sister. 
                         Can I help?" 
                     
                     
                         Eddie licked his lips. He made a 
                         mental note to find out where in hell 
                         Alesia was. If this beauty was any 
                         sample of the feminine Alesians, that 
                         was the place for Eddie Quince! 
                     
                     
                         "Er--yes, it's about the Bal," Eddie 
                         gulped. "I just wanted to ask him 
                         about his costume and--well--and 
                         get his viewpoint on things in gen- 
                         eral. You know, we do that with 
                         visiting celebrities."

                         She nodded. "Oui, I am aware of 
                         zat, Monsieur. I am sorry I cannot 
                         help you. Zee costume is zee secret. 
                         As for anything else, I do not know." 
                     
                     
                         Eddie backed to the door. He was 
                         reluctant to leave, but in a case like 
                         this it paid to be prudent. If luck was 
                         with him he would have ample oppor- 
                         tunity to meet this Venus on an equal 
                         footing. 
                     
                     
                         "Thank you very much," he gasped. 
                         "Goodbye." 
                     
                     
                         She followed him to the door. 
                     
                     
                         Out on the street, Eddie glanced at 
                         his watch. Five o'clock. If anything 
                         was to be accomplished he had very 
                         little time in which to accomplish it. 
                         He looked into his wallet. Almost two 
                         thousand francs. That was $120. in 
                         American money. A hell of a lot to 
                         pay for admission to a masked ball, 
                         but he was determined to crash the 
                         gates of the exclusive shindig, no 
                         matter what the price. And now, too, 
                         there was an added incentive. A dark- 
                         haired incentive. 
                     
                     
                         Eddie doffed his thinking cap for 
                         the time being, stepped into a cafe 
                         for an absinthe frappe.[#]It was six- 
                         thirty when he returned to the lobby 
                         of the Vendome, slumped down in a 
                         chair behind a potted palm, kept his 
                         eyes glued on the elevators. An hour 
                         of watchful waiting brought reward. 
                         The gorgeous brunette, swathed in an 
                         ermine wrap, came out of the elevator 
                         on the arm of a man approximately 
                         Eddie's height and build. He, too, was 
                         wearing a voluminous opera cloak, 
                         but Eddie could see the striped trous- 
                         ers of a colorful uniform and a gold 
                         braided military collar. Both the girl 
                         and the man had black dominoes over 
                         their eyes. 
                     
                     
                         Eddie quivered with excitement. He 
                         was certain this was His Highness, 
                         the Crown Prince of Alesia. He mem-

                         patent leather peaked hat. It had an 
                         old rose crown and was festooned 
                         with garlands of braid. A second man 
                         in uniform, not as gaudy as the Crown 
                         Prince's, followed the royal couple 
                         through the lobby. 
                     
                     
                         Eddie watched them all get into a 
                         cab and drive off. He grinned and 
                         rubbed his hands in gleeful anticipa- 
                         tion. Now it was all up to him! 
                     
                     
                         It is too well known a fact to war- 
                         rant undue explanation. The Parisian 
                         taxi driver will sell his soul and the 
                         soul of each member of his family 
                         for the almighty franc. Acting on this 
                         truism, Eddie sallied forth from the 
                         hotel, picked a likely-looking driver 
                         and engaged him in conversation. 
                     
                     
                         "For how much will you rent me 
                         your uniform and your cab?" he ques- 
                         tioned. 
                     
                     
                         The driver's bushy eyebrows 
                         arched. "For how long, Monsieur?" 
                     
                     
                         "All night." 
                     
                     
                         "Five hundred francs.' 
                     
                     
                         Eddie computed rapidly. That 
                         would be $30. "No, too much. I'll give 
                         you 300 francs." 
                     
                     
                         "Ah, but, Monsieur, it is against 
                         zee law! Supposing I am caught, eh 
                         What zen?" 
                     
                     
                         "I'll get you out. Three hundred 
                         francs. What do you say. 
                     
                     
                         It was five times what the cabbie 
                         would earn. He knew it and Eddie 
                         knew it. A little more bantering, back 
                         and forth, and the deal was closed. A 
                         bare half-hour later, Eddie, in the 
                         driver's gray uniform, slipped behind 
                         the wheel of the cab. 
                     
                     
                         "You will return it to 22 Rue Sabien 
                         by dawn, Monsieur?" the cabbie 
                         questioned anxiously. 
                     
                     
                         "Maybe before then, Frenchie. 
                         Toodle-oo." With a great clatter of 
                         meshing gears, the ancient, squeaking

                         vehicle rolled away. 
                     
                     
                         Narrowly missing a traffic police- 
                         man and a lumbering omnibus, Eddie 
                         reached the Maison of the Legion of 
                         Honor, drew up before the canopy 
                         stretching to the curb. An epauletted 
                         doorman hurried to the cab. Eddie 
                         leaned out. He pressed a folded hun- 
                         dred franc note into the doorman's 
                         hand. Speaking low and rapidly, he 
                         described the Crown Prince of Ale- 
                         sia's uniform, height, weight and gen- 
                         eral appearance as best he could. 
                     
                     
                         "Tell the gentleman there is some- 
                         one to see him. Make it clear that it 
                         is important. If you succeed in bring- 
                         ing him out I will give you another 
                         hundred francs." 
                     
                     
                         The doorman, blood brother to all 
                         other doormen in every part of the 
                         world, knew his onions. For cash in 
                         hand he would perform miracles. He 
                         nodded and vanished into the maison. 
                     
                     
                         Eddie stepped out of the driver's 
                         seat, put the collar of his coatup 
                         around his face. He opened the back 
                         door of the cab, waited anxiously. 
                     
                     
                         Sure enough, out came the Crown 
                         Prince in full, glittering regalia, three 
                         rows of medals shimmering on his 
                         chest. He paused uncertainly under 
                         the canopy. 
                     
                     
                         "Zis way, Monsieur," Eddie said. 
                         His heart was in his throat. 
                     
                     
                         The Crown Prince stepped forward. 
                         He looked around, puzzled. "Who 
                         wishes to see me?" he questioned. 
                     
                     
                         "A gentleman inside zee cab, Mon- 
                         sieur," Eddie blurted. 
                     
                     
                         The Crown Prince stooped, entered 
                         the open door. Eddie, using his body 
                         as a shield against the doorman, 
                         jerked a leather-covered black-jack 
                         from his pocket swung it, tapped the 
                         unsuspecting Crown Prince on the 
                         back of the head. He slumped into the 
                         seat without a sound. Eddie[t] slammed 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         the door shut, hurriedly gave the 
                         'doorman his second tip, wrove off. 
                     
                     
                         He stopped the cab on a dark 
                         street. Ten minutes of work and the 
                         Crown Prince was bound hand and 
                         foot with stout rope, his mouth ef- 
                     
                     
                         fectively gagged. Eddie stripped him 
                         of his resplendent uniform, ran the 
                         cab to the bank of the Seine, rolled 
                         the still unconscious Crown Prince 
                         into the grass behind a thick bush. It 
                         was a warm night and he was certain

                         the royal visitor would suffer no ill effects. 
                     
                     
                         That done, he raced to 22 Rue Sa- 
                         bien and routed out the cabbie who 
                         had rented him the hack. Before the 
                         astounded eyes of the man, he re- 
                         moved the driver's uniform and sub- 
                         stituted the outlt of old rose and 
                         braid, even to the black dominoe over 
                         his eyes. 
                     
                     
                         "Now, drive me to the Maison de 
                         Legion d'Honeur and I will be 
                         through with the cab." 
                         The unsuspecting doorman bowed 
                         Eddie in to the exclusive Bal. No 
                         sooner had he stepped into a room 
                         thronged with brilliantly costumed 
                         people and alive with the rhythmic 
                         strains of music, than a hand fell on 
                         his arm. He turned to look into the 
                         bright masked eyes of the gorgeous 
                         brunette. She was wearing the cos- 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         tume of a ballet dancer, tight and 
                         scant. 
                     
                     
                         "Where have you been, Hugo?" 
                         she whispered. "I was worried." 
                     
                     
                         Eddie's lips smiled. He made no 
                         reply, preferring to take no chances 
                         of detection. He eased her into his 
                         arms and danced her away. 
                     
                     
                         Suddenly a chilling thought came 
                         to him. She was the Crown Prince's 
                         sister! If he attempted to make love 
                         to her she would know something 
                         was wrong! 
                     
                     
                         "Hugo." She placed her lips close 
                         to his ear. "Francois will be ready 
                         soon. Had we not better go to zee 
                         lounge?" 
                     
                     
                         Eddie nodded. The girl slipped her 
                         arm in his. Together they walked off 
                         the dance floor into the palm-strewn 
                         lounge, seated themselves in an over- 
                         stuffed love seat. 
                     
                     
                         She leaned towards him, offered 
                         her parted red lips. 
                     
                     
                         Eddie had always been taught to 
                         act first and ask questions after. He 
                         acted, kissing her. 
                     
                     
                         "You still care for Marie, don't 
                         you, Hugo, darling?" she murmured. 
                     
                     
                         So that was her name--Marie. Ed- 
                         die disguised his voice and managed 
                         a faint "oui." He was about to con- 
                         tinue where he had left off when an- 
                         other man in uniform hurried up, 
                         dropped something in Marie's lap and 
                         beat a hasty departure. 
                     
                     
                         The girl tensed. "Come! We must 
                         go!" She pulled the bodice of her 
                         costume away, slid something into 
                         the aperture, and rose hurriedly. Ed- 
                         die caught a gleam of white; the 
                         sheen of which looked like pearls. 
                         Why was she secreting pearls. 
                     
                     
                         There was no time to ask questions. 
                         Marie fairly dragged him out to the 
                         coatroom. Before Eddie knew it he 
                         was alone with her in a taxicab and

                         she had ordered the driver to go to 
                         the Vendome. 
                     
                     
                         Once the cab moved away from the 
                         Maison de Legion d'Honeur Marie 
                         breathed a deep sigh of relief. "Ah, 
                         sucre, I am glad zat is over. I was 
                         so nervous, Hugo." 
                     
                     
                         Before Eddit's gaping eyes, she 
                         shrugged off her wrap, lowered the"\ 
                         straps of her costume. Eddie got-1 
                         goggle-eyed when he saw what was 
                         nestling in her bosom. Marie held it 
                         up. It was a stunning pearl necklace, 
                         shimmering with all the pure fire of 
                         its dozens of big pearls. 
                     
                     
                         "Not bad, Hugo eh?" she ques- 
                         tioned. "Is it not worth at least one 
                         million francs?" 
                     
                     
                         Eddie's mind whirled. He hadn't 
                         the faintest idea what this was all 
                         about, but he had a premonition he 
                         was getting himself into plenty of 
                         hot water. 
                     
                     
                         "Francois will meet us at zee 
                         train," Marie said. "We must get rid 
                         of zese costumes immediately. It will 
                         not be long before zee gendarmes will 
                         be looking for us." 
                     
                     
                         Jewel thieves! It hit Eddie smack 
                         in the nose! Jewel thieves! They 
                         weren't members of royalty at all! 
                         They were crooks, posing as mem- 
                         bers of royalty. Right now some weal- 
                         thy dowager was missing that neck- 
                         lace at the Bal! 
                     
                     
                         Eddie had half a mind to stop the 
                         cab and get out. Another look at 
                         Marie's voluptuous beauty changed 
                         his mind. And anyway, the cab was 
                         drawing up before the Vendome. Still 
                         masked, they both walked through 
                         the lobby, took the elevator to the 
                         phony Crown Prince's suite. 
                     
                     
                         "We must hurry, cheri," Marie 
                         said, once they were behind locked 
                         doors. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Eddie caught her in his arms. If 
                         he was taking the chance of being 
                         nabbed as a jewel thief he had to get 
                         something out of it. He bent her back, 
                         kissing her full on the lips. 
                     
                     
                         Timeless minutes later, Eddie re- 
                         moved his mask. The girl's face 
                         drained of color. She sat and stared 
                         like one transfixed. 
                     
                     
                         "I'm a detective," Eddie lied. "It's 
                         too bad you had to get mixed up with 
                         that gang of yeggs." 
                     
                     
                         Open-mouthed, Marie gaped. She 
                         could not utter a sound. Eddie crossed 
                         to a phone. He called police head- 
                         quarters, reported the recovery of 
                         the pearl necklace, told them where 
                         they could find the fake Crown Prince 
                         and his henchman. That done, he 
                         turned to Marie. 
                     
                     
                         "As for you--" 
                     
                     
                         She threw herself at him, pleading. 
                         "Please, Monsieur! Do not have me 
                         arrested! Hugo forced me to do it!" 
                         Eddie held her close. "Shut up," he 
                         said quietly. "There's only one way I 
                         can save you." 
                     
                     
                         "How, Monsieur?" 
                     
                     
                         'By marrying you. Then we can tell 
                         the police that we worked together 
                         to capture those thieves. Other- 
                         wise--" 
                     
                     
                         Marie said nothing, but her actions 
                         shouted her answer!
