                     Science Finds New Way to Remove Germ Cause and Activate Dormant Roots to Grow New Hair. 
                     (Read Free Offer) 
                     A germ called "Flask Bacilla of Unna" gets deep into the scalp skin in many cases of abnormal hair deficiency, causing a most
                        dangerous type of dandruff. It clogs up pores and hair follicles, causing itchy scalp, falling hair and prevents dormant hair
                        roots (papilla) from growing new hair. The germ is seldom suspected. Washing and shampooing and use of tonics, ointments and
                        lotions don't remove the cause. They merely cleanse and treat the surface and roll off the outer skin like water rolls off the
                        back of duck. No wonder baldness is increasing. 
                     Now a new discovery enables people who have dandruff, falling hair, thin hair and baldness to harmlessly romove the congested,
                        thin outer layer of scalp skin. This permits opened pores to breathe in air, sunshine and absorb a penetrating, stimulating
                        scalp-food to activate the smothered, dormant hair roots and grow new hair. It is the most sensational discovery in the
                        history of falling hair and baldness. It is all explained in a new treatise called "GROW HAIR," showing "anatomy of your hair"
                        and tells what to do. This treatise is now being mailed FREE to all who write for it. Send no money, just name and address to

                        carry- you fill your orders from my big factory stock. You have entire charge of everything.

                     "Had stomach trouble for years. When I take Kelp-a-Malt I have a hearty appe- tite for everything and suffer no distress.
                        Kelp-a-.Malt has banished constipation, which I have had all my life." -W.D.C. 
                     . . . "Gained 8 pounds with one package of Kelp-a-Malt and feel 100% better." Mrs. W. J. S. 
                     Just a few of the thousands of actual testimonials that are flooding in from all over the country telling us how this newer
                        form of food iodine is building firm flesh, strengthening the nerves, enriching the blood- nourishing vital glands and making
                        weak, pale, careworn, underweight men and women look and feel years younger. 
                     Scientists have recently discovered that the blood, liver and vital glands of the body contain definite quantities of iodine
                        which heretofore has been difficult to ob-tain. 
                     Modern foodstuffs, even fresh vegetables and similarly so-called "good" foods, have recently been discovered to be often
                        lacking not only in food iodine but in all the other essential organic minerals without which strength and health are
                        impossible. 
                     Kelp-a-Malt, only recently discovered, is an amazingly rich source of food iodine, along with practically every mineral
                        essential to normal well-being. It is a sea vegeta-ble concentrate taken from the Pacific Ocean and made available in
                        palatable, pleasant-to-take tablet form. Six Kelp-a-Malt tab- lets provide more food iodine than 486 pounds of spinach, 1,600
                        pounds of beef, 1,387 pounds of lettuce. Three Kelp-a-Malt tablets contain more iron and copper for rich blood, vitality and
                        strength than a pound of spinach, 7 1/2 pounds of fresh to- matoes more calcium than 6 eggs, more phosphorous than a pound and
                        a half of car- rots sulphur, sodium, potassium and other essential minerals. 
                     Only when you get an adequate amount of these minerals can your food do you any good- can you nourish glands, add weight,
                        strengthen your nerves, increase your vigor, vitality and endurance. 
                     Try Kelp-a-Malt for a single week. Watch your appetite improve, firm flesh ap-pear instead of scrawny hollows. Feel the
                        tireless vigor and vitality it brings you. It not only improves your looks, but your health as well. It corrects sour, acid
                        stomach, Gas, indigestion and all the usual distress commonly experienced by the undernourished and the underweight disappear.

                     ~ By  Knight Jessee  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         FRAN dusted all the wax figures 
                         twice. Still, Bill didn't come. 
                         The waiting began to get on 
                         her nerves. This was the fourth 
                         time she had had to wait for him 
                         this week. She bit her lip angrily. 
                     
                     
                         The bell tinkled as the door 
                         opened. Fran whirled about. Then: 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, Mr. van Erp!" she said. 
                     
                     
                         Derek van Erp looked at her. His 
                         blue eyes were very intent. She 
                         always had the feeling that he could 
                         read exactly what'she was thinking. 
                     
                     
                         "You were expecting some one else, 
                         weren't you? Sorry I'm not the 
                         person. But won't I do?" 
                     
                     
                         Fran adored the fit of his suit, 
                         and his spats and his cane, and the  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         gray gloves he held so nonchalantly 
                         in his left hand. If Bill would only 
                         dress like that! But Bill was the 
                         sort of fellow who thought putting 
                         on a clean collar more than once a 
                         week was effeminate. 
                     
                     
                         "It's really after hours, Mr. van 
                         Erp," Fran said primly. "But since 
                         I'm here, is there anything I can 
                         get for you?" 
                     
                     
                         He smiled. "You could get me a 
                         million dollars, perhaps. Or happi- 
                         ness. Or love." He said the last 
                         word very low. 
                     
                     
                         Fran s cheeks went pink. She al- 
                         most forgot she was in love with Bill 
                         whenever Mr. van Erp came into 
                         the store. Mr. van Erp made her 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 6 Street &amp; Smith's Love Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         feel queer and breathless; as though 
                         she had been running a long race 
                         and was just in sight of the goal. 
                     
                     
                         Impulsively, she spoke: "Why 
                         you don't have to wish for things. 
                         You have everything money, posi- 
                         tion." Her voice trailed away. 
                     
                     
                         The smile died out of Mr. van 
                         Erp's eyes. "I have nothing!" he 
                         exclaimed bitterly. "My wealth 
                         consists of forty dollars in cash. I 
                         got that by selling my entire ward- 
                         robe. The clothes I have on are all 
                         I have left. Material possessions, 
                         that is. Of course I possess a 
                         broken heart if that could be 
                         classed as an asset! And I'mustn't 
                         forget cranky old Uncle Laurence! 
                         He's despised me all my life. If he 
                         knew I was going in for carnival life, 
                         what a laugh he'd get!" 
                     
                     
                         Fran gripped the edge of the 
                         counter. "You mean you're broke, 
                         Mr. van Erp? Really broke? A 
                         rich, important man like you?" 
                     
                     
                         Derek looked ill at ease. "Sorry 
                         I flared out. I didn't mean to. But 
                         I've been pretending so long, that 
                         it was a relief to tell the truth for 
                         a change." 
                     
                     
                         Fran felt a queer, constricted sen- 
                         sation around her heart. "The wax- 
                         works figures you've been buying. 
                         you don't mean- Oh, Mr. van 
                         Erp! I thought of course you were 
                         joking! You couldn't intend to have 
                         a wax-works show at Coney! A a 
                         social-register fellow like you!" Her 
                         eyes were swimming with tears. 
                     
                     
                         Derek didn't notice. He was 
                         touching the tip of his well-polished 
                         shoe with the ferrule of his cane. 
                     
                     
                         "I could cadge from my friends, I 
                         suppose, or depend on invitations at 
                         house parties to see me through. Or 
                         go down on my knees to Uncle Lau- 
                         rence. But that sort of thing never 
                         appealed, somehow. No. This is 
                         better. The Van Erps bequeathed 
                         me just one legacy. A wax-works  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         show! Those dusty, broken figures 
                         have been stacked for years in the 
                         Van Erp attic. Now, I'm going to 
                         make them support me!" 
                     
                     
                         "I never would have fixed those 
                         figures, if I'd thought you were in 
                         earnest!" cried Fran. "I imagined, 
                         of course, that you were going to 
                         have some sort of party, using the 
                         wax figures." 
                     
                     
                         Derek looked straight into her 
                         eyes. "Nice of you to be so wor- 
                         ried about me, little golden-haired 
                         girl! I love it. I eat it up! Espe- 
                         cially since another blonde sent me 
                         back my ring the minute she knew 
                         the market had wiped me out. Now, 
                         I want to ask a favor of you. I've 
                         just two things left in this world. 
                         The wax works and my pride! To- 
                         night, I'm dropping out of my old 
                         world. Disappearing. None of my 
                         friends are ever going to know that 
                         Derek van Erp is a wax-works pro- 
                         prietor! Silly of me, of course. But 
                         I'd go to any lengths to keep any- 
                         body from knowing. So will you 
                         keep my secret for me, golden girl?"  
                     
                         Confusedly, Fran murmured: "Of 
                         course I'll never tell, Mr. van Erp. 
                         Cross my heart! But you don't 
                         know anything about Coney Island! 
                         Why, I'll bet you ve never even been 
                         out there!" 
                     
                     
                         Don't bet, or you'll lose! I've 
                         haunted the place for weeks. Three 
                         days ago I bought my location and 
                         moved the figures out. Last night 
                         I opened." He frowned. "Not 
                         much business yet." 
                     
                     
                         Fran thought back. "You bought 
                         an Abraham Lincoln and a Napo- 
                         leon, didn't you? From us, I 
                         mean?" 
                     
                     
                         He nodded. "And you fixed 
                         Marie Antoinette's face and Mc- 
                         Kinley's leg and Julius Cassar's neck. 
                         They look as good as new." 
                     
                     
                         Fran looked away. "Mr. Krause 
                         charged you top price. Because he 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Extra Sheer 7 
                 
                     
                     
                         thought you were rich. I'm so 
                         sorry. If we'd known!" 
                     
                     
                         Mr. van Erp seemed to grow 
                         taller. "I'm not yet accepting char- 
                         ity! he said stiffly. What I buy, 
                         I pay for." 
                     
                     
                         Hastily, Fran asked: "What is it 
                         you want to-day, Mr. van Erp?" 
                     
                     
                         He drew a small package out of 
                         his coat pocket. "I came for ad- 
                         vice. I didn't like the cotton stock- 
                         ings Marie Antoinette was wearing, 
                         so I got these. But I wasn't at all 
                         sure of the size, and the clerk said 
                         they could' t be returned if they 
                         were tried on even by a wax figure. 
                         So will you see if they're correct?"  
                     
                         Fran took out a pair of extra- 
                         sheer pearl-gray stockings. She 
                         caught her breath. "They're lovely!" 
                         she cried. Unconsciously, her tone 
                         was wistful. And I'm sure they'll 
                         fit." She caressed the stockings 
                         gently with the tips of her fingers. 
                         Fran wore service hose. They lasted 
                         longer. 
                     
                     
                         Suddenly she looked at Derek. 
                         Mr. Krause said that if you came 
                         into the store, you were to have a 
                         Chinese mandarin we have in the 
                         basement," she said recklessly, mak- 
                         ing up the story as she went along. 
                         "We-we give a sort of bonus to 
                         our best patrons. It- it's on the 
                         house!" 
                     
                     
                         "Oh!" Derek exclaimed. "That 
                         that's rather liberal, isn't it?" 
                     
                     
                         "The Chinese mandarin had been 
                         in the basement for two years. Mr. 
                         Krause had taken it on consign- 
                         ment. and the owner had never re- 
                         turned for the figure. Mr. Krause 
                         had forgotten it was even there. 
                         The gift of the figure might make 
                         up in some measure for the over- 
                         charging Mr. Krause had done, Fran 
                         thought. 
                     
                     
                         "The figure is in the storeroom. 
                         I'll get it," Fran added. 
                     
                     
                         Derek insisted on following her  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         down into the cluttered, dusty stor- 
                         age basement. The one dust-cov- 
                         ered light in the place went out, just 
                         as they reached the bottom step. 
                         Fran gave a little startled scream. 
                         Instantly, Derek s hand was on her 
                         wrist, steadying her. "I've a flash 
                         in my pocket. Just a moment." He 
                         was fumbling for the flashlight with 
                         his other hand. 
                     
                     
                         Fran stood quite still. His touch 
                         was like fire on her wrist. Fire that 
                         went straight to her heart and made 
                         it thud wildly. Unconsciously, she 
                         swayed toward Derek. The top of 
                         her head brushed his chin. Soft 
                         strands of hair caressed his cheek. 
                     
                     
                         She heard the swift intake of his 
                         breath. Then he caught her close 
                         in his arms. He held her for a pul- 
                         sating, palpitating second. Fran 
                         gasped. Like a child, she lifted her 
                         lips to his. Derek's mouth closed 
                         down swiftly. His kiss was like a 
                         brand, binding her to him forever. 
                         Fran hadn't known a kiss could be 
                         like that. Bill's kisses stirred her. 
                         But never like this. Her lips grew 
                         warm. Her breath caught in her 
                         throat with a little sobbing sound. 
                         Instantly Derek released her. 
                     
                     
                         "I had no right to do that," He 
                         said slowly. 
                     
                     
                         Fran couldn't reply. She stood 
                         motionless, while her lips kept on 
                         thrilling to the magic of a kiss such 
                         as she had never known before. 
                     
                     
                         Derek found his flashlight. The 
                         round glow showed a jumble of 
                         waxen arms and legs and old cos- 
                         tumes. Mr. Krause wasn't noted 
                         for his neatness. In the center of 
                         the mêlée was the mandarin. 
                     
                     
                         He stood, with his arms proudly 
                         folded. He was incrusted with dust 
                         and cobwebs formed a gray veil over 
                         his face; but he was an imposing 
                         figure, none the less. 
                     
                     
                         "There!" said Fran huskily. 
                     
                     
                         "That's the mandarin." 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 8 Street &amp; Smith's Love Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         The mandarin wasn't very big. 
                         He reached only to Derek's shoul- 
                         der. But it was rather difficult to 
                         get the figure up the narrow, steep 
                         stairs. Derek backed up the stairs, 
                         carrying the figure, while Fran held 
                         the flashlight. Fran wasn't paying 
                         any attention to where she was go- 
                         ing, and the first thing she knew, 
                         there was a disheartening sound of 
                         a rip, and she knew her right stock- 
                         ing had caught on a projecting nail. 
                         With difficulty, she bit back the an- 
                         gry ejaculation which welled to her 
                         lips. 
                     
                     
                         Once upstairs in the store again, 
                         they cleaned off the mandarin and 
                         found that the figure was in perfect 
                         condition. Derek's delight was 
                         boundless. 
                     
                     
                         "Thirteen is my lucky number!" 
                         he exulted. "And this makes the 
                         thirteenth figure for my collection. 
                         I can't help but succeed, with this." 
                     
                     
                         He had evidently forgotten all 
                         about the kiss. But Fran hadn't. 
                         Her lips kept tingling treacherously. 
                     
                     
                         "You'd better go wash your hands 
                         in the back of the shop," Fran said 
                         in a matter-of-fact tone. 
                     
                     
                         It was when Derek came back, 
                         debonair as ever, that he saw the 
                         rip in Fran's stocking. Fran assured 
                         him that it didn't matter at all. But 
                         Derek was abject. "If you hadn't 
                         gone down to get the mandarin for 
                         me, this never would have hap- 
                         pened! I've got to make it up to 
                         you, somehow." His eyes stared at 
                         the cobweb-sheer stockings destined 
                         for Marie Antoinette. 
                     
                     
                         "The very thing!" he cried. 
                     
                     
                         "Marie can get along with her cot- 
                         ton hose. Who cares? But these 
                         were intended for you!" He 
                         crammed the stockings into Fran's 
                         protesting hands. 
                     
                     
                         Bill came into the store just then! 
                     
                     
                         Fran took one look at his gloomy 
                         face, and her cheeks flamed red. She  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         put the stockings behind her with a 
                         betraying gesture. Bill went on 
                         glaring. Fran explained that Derek 
                         was a customer. She explained too 
                         vehemently, in her agitation. Bill s 
                         mouth dragged down farther at the 
                         corners, the way it always did when 
                         Bill got jealous. 
                     
                     
                         Fran looked appealingly at Derek 
                         van Erp. 
                     
                     
                         Derek drew on his gloves. He 
                         went to the door and hailed a taxi, 
                         motioning for the fellow to come in. 
                     
                     
                         "Thank you more than I can say, 
                         for the mandarin, Miss Fran," he 
                         said gently. Then, with his cane he 
                         gestured toward the small, belliger- 
                         ent figure of the Chinese. "Put that 
                         in the cab, if you please." 
                     
                     
                         "Gee!" muttered the taximan, but 
                         he gingerly approached the man- 
                         darin just the same. 
                     
                     
                         "I shall let you know if the man- 
                         darin brings me luck," said Derek, 
                         going out the door. 
                     
                     
                         "I shall give myself the pleasure 
                         of giving you a punch in the nose!" 
                         growled Bill when he was quite sure 
                         the taxi was gone. Then he jerked 
                         Fran's hands forward and looked 
                         at the stockings. Before Fran 
                         guessed what he was about, he 
                         struck her across the face with the 
                         flat of his hand. 
                     
                     
                         "That'll teach you not to be a 
                         little flirt and take presents from 
                         men like him!" 
                     
                     
                         Fran put her hand to her face. 
                         She stared at Bill, who had suddenly 
                         become a stranger. A terrifying 
                         stranger. "You- you didn't wait 
                         for me to explain, did you?" she said 
                         very slowly. 
                     
                     
                         "What explanation is there? 
                         When a fellow like him gives stock- 
                         ings to a girl like you, there s just 
                         one answer!" 
                     
                     
                         Fran's eyes were misted with an- 
                         gry tears. "And just what kind of 
                         girl am I, Bill?" she demanded. 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Extra Sheer 9 
                 
                     
                         "You never set the day for our wedding! All the crowd we go with, know that we re engaged. So I'm poison to all the
                            men! You ve put your brand on me, Bill. Yet you never talk about our getting married." 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Bill didn't look so angry now. He 
                         had the grace to seem ashamed. "I'm 
                         sorry, Fran. But you know what a 
                         temper I've got! I can't help flaring 
                         out sometimes." 
                     
                     
                         Was there a smug hint of satis- 
                         faction that his temper was so bad? 
                         Fran, listening with ears that criti- 
                         cized, thought there was. 
                     
                     
                         Bill took Fran into his arms. "A 
                         girl as pretty as you, has to be care-  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         ful what kind of presents she takes 
                         from men," he mumbled. Then his 
                         lips closed down over hers. 
                     
                     
                         Always before, Fran had liked 
                         Bill's kisses. She had been afraid 
                         when he kissed her. But still she 
                         liked being kissed. Now, something 
                         had made a difference. Impatiently, 
                         she drew away. 
                     
                     
                         "Aw, don't be like that, Fran! 
                         I'm sorry. I've begged your pardon.

                         And you'll admit I had plenty of 
                         provocation! Come on. Give us a 
                         kiss. Then we'll go out and eat. 
                         I've found a swell place where they 
                         only charge forty cents for a whole 
                         dinner!" 
                     
                     
                         Fran shut her eyes and let him 
                         kiss her. 
                     
                     
                         "That's more like my girl!" said 
                         Bill when he let her go. "Come on. 
                         Let's go. I'm starved." 
                     
                     
                         Fran exhibited the tear in her 
                         stocking. "I can't go like this. I 
                         got this rip in my stocking, going 
                         downstairs for that figure for Mr. 
                         van Erp. That's why he gave me 
                         this pair. Go out and get me some 
                         stockings, Bill, so I can change." 
                     
                     
                         Bill looked uncomfortable. O"h, 
                         come along. Nobody'll notice if 
                         you've got a run! We're not going 
                         anywhere except to eat, anyway." 
                         Stubbornly, Fran shook her head. 
                     
                     
                         "I won't go out in the street looking 
                         like this! Either you get me a new 
                         pair of stockings, or else-" 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, put those on, if you're going 
                         to be so fussy!" Bill exclaimed test- 
                         ily. "But for the love of Pete, let's 
                         get going!" 
                     
                     
                         So, after all, Fran wore Marie 
                         Antoinette's stockings. When she 
                         came out of the little back room, 
                         where she had donned the stockings, 
                         her cheeks were flying danger signals 
                         of red. But Bill didn't notice. 
                     
                     
                         "The restaurant's just around the 
                         next corner," he said. "Funny we 
                         never noticed it before." 
                     
                     
                         "I don't think it's queer," Fran 
                         retorted when they got there. "I 
                         won't go in! I hate stuffy, smoky, 
                         dirty places like that, and you know 
                         it!" 
                     
                     
                         "All right. Buy your own dinner 
                         then. If you're too ritzy to come in 
                         here with me!" 
                     
                     
                         Deliberately he went into the res- 
                         taurant, leaving Fran on the pave- 
                         ment outside. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Fran bit her lip. Tears stung her 
                         eyes. 
                     
                     
                         Bill and she were always having 
                         quarrels like this. Sordid affairs 
                         that made her feel cheap and 
                         ashamed. Slowly she walked along 
                         the street. There was a tea shop at 
                         the corner. A quiet place with 
                         black-painted tables and orange can- 
                         dles that gave a romantic atmos- 
                         phere. 
                     
                     
                         Fran went in and sat at a table 
                         near the door. She stared at the 
                         menu with eyes that did not see. 
                         The waitress did not come for some 
                         time. While Fran waited, the door 
                         opened noisily. Bill came in. 
                     
                     
                         He slammed the door behind him 
                         and stamped over to Fran's table. 
                         He sat down opposite her. "You're 
                         a nice one! Walking out on me, like 
                         this!" he growled. 
                     
                     
                         Fran drew a deep breath. 
                     
                     
                         "Bill, I can't stand this sort of 
                         thing any longer," she gasped. 
                     
                     
                         "We've been engaged for six months 
                         and we fight all the time! There 
                         isn't a day that we don't quarrel 
                         about something. Bill, it's cheap 
                         and common to fight the way we do. 
                         What's the matter with us?" 
                     
                     
                         Bill said: "Honey, I love you so!" 
                     
                     
                         Usually when he said that, Fran 
                         thrilled, way down to her toes. This 
                         time, she shook her head. 
                     
                     
                         "You've shut me up, often 
                         enough, saying things like that. 
                         This time, love-making won't do. 
                         We've got to talk matters over." 
                     
                     
                         Just then, the waitress came. 
                         Without consulting Fran, Bill gave 
                         the order. That was his usual cus- 
                         tom. Fran paid no heed. 
                     
                     
                         "You never set the day for our 
                         wedding!" she persisted. "I'm en- 
                         gaged to you. All the crowd we go 
                         with, know that. So I'm poison to 
                         all the men! You've put your brand 
                         on me, Bill. Yet you never talk 
                         about our getting married!" 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Extra Sheer 11 
                 
                     
                     
                         His eyes smoldered. "So that's it! 
                         You're sore because folks know 
                         you're engaged to me, so you can't 
                         flirt. Well, I'd call that pretty low, 
                         if you ask me." 
                     
                     
                         Fran shook her head. "you don't 
                         understand, Bill. If you and I got 
                         along all right, I'd stay engaged to 
                         you forever, and not even want to 
                         look at another man. But we fight!" 
                         And she hesitated, summoning 
                         her courage "I'm not sure, but I 
                         don't think I love you any more, 
                         Bill. Maybe I did love you once. 
                         But now-" Her voice died away, 
                         before the fury in his face. 
                     
                     
                         "So that's it, is it? Giving me the 
                         run-around, because a swell pays 
                         you a little attention? don't you 
                         know that his sort considers you on 
                         a par with a doormat? Something 
                         to wipe his feet on!" 
                     
                     
                         "That isn't so!" Fran said in a 
                         choked voice. 
                     
                     
                         "Oh! Then you do like him! So 
                         that is it! All right. Take him then. 
                         I'm through." 
                     
                     
                         The food came and they ate. At 
                         least Fran supposed she ate. There 
                         was a big lump in her thoat and her 
                         heart felt frozen. 
                     
                     
                         "Sorry I can't give you back your 
                         engagement ring," she jerked out. 
                         "But since you never gave me one, 
                         I can't, very well!" 
                     
                     
                         "How could I give you a ring? 
                         I'm not a millionaire like your pre- 
                         cious Van Erp!" 
                     
                     
                         "He's no millionaire, either! He's 
                         broke. Poorer than you or me. But 
                         he's not whining. Not much. He's 
                         going to run a side show at Coney 
                         Island. That s the kind of fellow 
                         he is!" 
                     
                     
                         The minute Fran had spoken, she 
                         would have given anything to call 
                         back the sentences. But it was too 
                         late. 
                     
                     
                         Bill's eyes looked intent. Inter- 
                         ested. "So! He's going to run a  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         side show is he? A wax works, I 
                         suppose, or he wouldn't have been 
                         hanging around the store." 
                     
                     
                         "I don't know what'sort of a 
                         show," lied Fran. But it was too 
                         late. 
                     
                     
                         "I wonder what'sam Krause 
                         would say if he knew you were get- 
                         ting so thick with this Van Erp and 
                         turning down his own nephew! Or 
                         maybe you ve forgotten that it was 
                         Sam Krause that introduced you 
                         and me? My uncle, Sam Krause!" 
                         He looked at her intently. 
                     
                     
                         Fran had a scared feeling that 
                         seemed to be all over her body. "I 
                         suppose you mean my job?" she 
                         whispered slowly. 
                     
                     
                         "Just that." Bill leaned across 
                         the table. "Don't be a little fool, 
                         Fran!" 
                     
                     
                         Fran laid down her fork. 
                         "Funny!" she laughed jerkily. "It's 
                         taken a lot for me to see what you 
                         really are, Bill Krause! An awful 
                         lot! All week I've known that you 
                         were meeting Sadie Small on the 
                         quiet while I waited for you. But I 
                         wouldn't let myself know that. Be- 
                         cause I didn't want to. I thought I 
                         loved you, you see? To-night, for 
                         the first time in my life, I see you 
                         as you'really are. Common, jealous, 
                         cheap, two-timing, stingy, low! So 
                         we re through, Bill. Through for 
                         good. And if you want to take my 
                         job away, go ahead. I'll get an- 
                         other." 
                     
                     
                         Blindly, Fran went to the door 
                         and tugged it open. Blindly, she 
                         hurried along the street. She walked 
                         until she was weary. Then she saw 
                         a subway kiosk. She dived down 
                         the stairs and fumbled in her purse 
                         for a nickel. Once inside the turn- 
                         stile, she took the train bound for 
                         Coney Island. 
                     
                     
                         All the long, jolting way out there, 
                         she thought about Bill. A curtain 
                         of tears was on her lashes. She was 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 12 Street &amp; Smith's Love Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         weeping for the love that had never 
                         really existed. 
                     
                     
                         It took quite a while to find the 
                         tiny place labeled: "The Wax 
                         Works of History." A man was 
                         feebly speiling outside in a lacka- 
                         daisical manner. No one was near. 
                         Fran tendered her dime to him and 
                         went inside. 
                     
                     
                         Derek van Erp was sitting on a 
                         box, his face buried in his hands. At 
                         her step, he jumped up. "Oh," he 
                         said. "You!" His face was alight 
                         with pleasure. 
                     
                     
                         Shyly, Fran said: "I thought I'd 
                         come out and see how the mandarin 
                         stood the trip." 
                     
                     
                         Derek smiled. "He's the best ex- 
                         hibit I have. Miss Fran, I'm be- 
                         ginning to think that a man has to 
                         be born to this side-show business. 
                         I don't seem to have quite the hang 
                         of it, yet. You see, not a soul has 
                         come in, since we opened!" 
                     
                     
                         "I came in!" said Fran. 
                     
                     
                         There was a queer little electric 
                         silence. "Yes. You came!" re- 
                         peated Derek. "That's the very 
                         nicest thing that's happened to me 
                         since everything went to smash." 
                     
                     
                         "Do you'really feel like that?" 
                         asked Fran. She was gripping one 
                         hand with the other, tightly. "I'm 
                         glad. Because I've come out to 
                         to take a job with you!" 
                     
                     
                         "A job!" gasped Derek. "But 
                         but I haven't any money. I can't 
                         pay you enough." 
                     
                     
                         "I have some money saved up," 
                         said Fran stoutly. 
                     
                     
                         She looked around. 
                     
                     
                         The long, narrow room was par- 
                         titioned off into twelve compart- 
                         ments. In the twelve spaces were 
                         set wax figures, faintly reminiscent 
                         of a fancy-dress ball. Cassar, wear- 
                         ing a toga. Morgan, in a pirate's 
                         doublet and hose. Cleopatra, re- 
                         clining on a divan. Daniel in the  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         lions' den. George Washington, 
                         about to chop down a cherry tree. 
                         William Tell, with an apple in his 
                         hand. Florence Nightingale in a 
                         nurse's garb. Marie Antoinette, co- 
                         quettishly displaying her cotton 
                         stockings. Abraham Lincoln, Poca- 
                         hontas, King George, President Mc- 
                         Kinley, and the mandarin. 
                     
                     
                         "They look quite all right, don't 
                         they?" Derek asked, following the 
                         line of her gaze. His tone was anx- 
                         ious. 
                     
                     
                         "They- they're hopeless!" Fran 
                         exclaimed. "Absolutely hopeless. 
                         Of course no one would come in here. 
                         Not a chance. People only come to 
                         a wax works to get the blue jim- 
                         mies!" 
                     
                     
                         "Blue jimmies?" 
                     
                     
                         "Yes. Nightmares! Horrors! 
                         They want to see blood all over 
                         everything! Famous characters who 
                         have murdered folks with axes and 
                         things!" Fran was almost tearful. 
                     
                     
                         "George Washington murdered a 
                         cherry tree with a hatchet." Derek s 
                         smile was wry. Wouldn't that do? 
                     
                     
                         Fran struck her hands together 
                         lightly. "I've an idea! Derek, 
                         we're going to make a success of 
                         this thing!" She was so excited she 
                         didn't notice she had called him by 
                         his first name. 
                     
                     
                         "We'll call this place 'The Cham- 
                         ber of Horrors'! And when people 
                         get inside, they'll shudder with ter- 
                         ror! Go out and rustle up a couple 
                         of cans of good bright-red paint! 
                         After that, get me a needle and 
                         thread, and a pair of scissors. And 
                         tell that half-dead individual out 
                         there to stop barking. He's through 
                         for the night!" 
                     
                     
                         Then, as Derek blinked in sur- 
                         prise: "Hurry! We have so little 
                         time." 
                     
                     
                         Fran awoke the next morning 
                         to a feeling of pleasant anticipation. 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Extra Sheer 13 
                 
                     
                     
                         She lay in bed, too lazily content to 
                         move. Presently, the unfamiliarity 
                         of her surroundings shocked her into 
                         complete wakefulness. 
                     
                     
                         She was in a tiny room, Spartan- 
                         like in its severity. She lay on a 
                         hard cot, scrupulously clean. Near 
                         her was a kitchen chair. A mirror 
                         was tacked to the wall. Beneath, 
                         was a shelf with a basin containing 
                         water. 
                     
                     
                         Fran sat up with a jerk, clasping 
                         her knees with her interlaced fingers. 
                         What under heaven had happened 
                         to her own room? 
                     
                     
                         Some one knocked at the door. A 
                         masculine voice called, "Fran! Do 
                         hurry and dress. I'm afraid to stay 
                         alone any longer with these horrors. 
                         They make my blood run cold!" 
                     
                     
                         Then Fran remembered. She 
                         laughed aloud. "Coming!" she cried. 
                     
                     
                         It had been a task, transforming 
                         Derek's stiff galaxy of figures into a 
                         chamber of horrors. She and Derek 
                         had worked till three o'clock in the 
                         morning. Time raced by. 
                     
                     
                         Fran hurried into her clothes, 
                         washing in the small tin basin. 
                         Combing the tangles out of her hair 
                         with her pocket comb. 
                     
                     
                         Derek had wanted to taxi her 
                         home at three in the morning! She 
                         wouldn't hear of that, and Derek 
                         wouldn't let her go home alone. 
                         There was a deadlock. Finally, 
                         Derek suggested diffidently that she 
                         could stay in the back room of the 
                         museum while he bunked with the 
                         Living Skeleton in the Freak 
                         Museum next door. 
                     
                     
                         Gladly, Fran consented. So weary 
                         was she, that she fairly fell into bed. 
                         But she couldn't sleep for a while. 
                         She kept thinking about two men. 
                         Bill and Derek. Derek and Bill. 
                         When she finally slept, she dreamed 
                         of the two. 
                     
                     
                         "Good morning!" she said shyly, 
                         coming into the museum. Some-  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         how she hadn't remembered how tall 
                         and good-looking Derek was. 
                     
                     
                         He bent and took both her hands 
                         in his. "I never can'thank, you 
                         enough for taking my dead wax 
                         works and turning the place into a 
                         shambles!" His mouth laughed, but 
                         his eyes were very earnest. 
                     
                     
                         Fran blushed. 
                     
                     
                         "But of course I can't let you quit 
                         your job and come out to work for 
                         me. That would be an imposition 
                         on my part. Besides, there's that 
                         boy friend of yours. 
                     
                     
                         Fran said quickly: "Things do 
                         look grand, don't they?" 
                     
                     
                         She walked around, examining the 
                         different exhibits. President Mc- 
                         Kinley was now a bartender in a sa- 
                         loon scene. They had put an apron 
                         around his middle, clad him in a 
                         workingman's shirt, and smudged 
                         his face with charcoal. Caesar, 
                         dressed in modern attire, was a gun- 
                         man, with a revolver in his hand, 
                         menacing Florence Nightingale, now 
                         an entertainer in the place. 
                     
                     
                         Next to this was a Chinese scene. 
                         The mandarin pointed a long fin- 
                         ger nail at an unfortunate coolie 
                         whose head was on the block. Over 
                         him bent a bloodthirsty figure with 
                         a hatchet in his upraised hand. They 
                         had turned the executioner's face 
                         away, lest his resemblance to one 
                         George Washington be too marked! 
                         In Derek's room lay the powdered 
                         wig and the blue satin suit previ- 
                         ously worn by the figure. 
                     
                     
                         Marie Antoinette was walking 
                         through streets running with blood. 
                         Daniel was having a gory time in 
                         the lions' den. 
                     
                     
                         That was as far as Fran got, in 
                         her examination of the museum. 
                     
                     
                         Derek stepped in front of her. He 
                         tilted her chin with his forefinger 
                         and looked deep into her eyes. "I 
                         want to tell you something," he said. 
                     
                     
                         "you're the grandest girl I've ever 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 14 Street &amp; Smith's Love Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         known and the most beautiful!" 
                         They stood quite still, gazing at 
                         each other. Fran felt a tingling of 
                         her spine. She trembled. 
                     
                     
                         Suddenly, the moment was gone. 
                     
                     
                         "Come on, let's eat!" said Derek 
                         briskly. 
                     
                     
                         Over their bacon and eggs, 
                         Derek said something else 
                         that Fran was to remember 
                         always. "Funny how some 
                         people are friends, the minute 
                         you first meet them! It was 
                         like that with me. When I 
                         first saw you." 
                     
                     
                         Fran tried to reply, but the 
                         words stuck in her throat. 
                         She just sat looking at him. 
                     
                     
                         "Pretty swell, I'must say!" 
                     
                     
                         Fran's head went up with a 
                         jerk. "Bill!" she gasped. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Bill Krause was standing next to 
                         the little white-topped table. So 
                         engrossed were they, that neither 
                         she nor Derek had noticed Bill as 
                         he came into the restaurant. 
                     
                     
                         Bill's face was horrible. He 
                         looked as if he hadn't slept. His 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Extra Sheer 15 
                 
                     
                     
                         eyes glowered hatefully, and his 
                         mouth was a thin, white line. 
                     
                     
                         "So! You spent the night with 
                         this side-show punk, did you? After 
                         all your touch-me-not ways with 
                         me!" He hurled the words at Fran 
                         like so many handfuls of mud. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         out here last night. I watched out- 
                         side the place. Neither of you came 
                         out! And here you are, having 
                         breakfast together. What more 
                         proof do you want?" 
                     
                     
                         Derek moved so swiftly that 
                         afterward, Fran couldn't believe  
                 
                 
                     
                         Bill's face was horrible. His eyes glowered hatefully. "So! You spent the night with this side-show punk, did you?
                            After all your touch-me-not ways with me!" He hurled the words at Fran like so many handfuls of mud. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "Bill!" gasped Fran. She felt 
                         faint and sick. 
                     
                     
                         Derek's eyes narrowed. He got 
                         up leisurely. "One more word and 
                         I'll knock you down," he said 
                         slowly. 
                     
                     
                         Bill took a step backward. "You 
                         can't shut me up! I followed Fran  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         that she had 
                         seen right. Bill 
                         sprawled on the 
                         floor with a sur- 
                         prised expression 
                         on his good-look- 
                         ing, sulky face. 
                         Derek looked at 
                         the knuckles of 
                         his right hand. 
                     
                     
                         You'd better 
                         apologize to Miss Fran for this 
                         brawl!" he said quietly. 
                     
                     
                         Fran's eyes were glazed with 
                         tears. "Please go, Derek." She 
                         touched his sleeve with her finger 
                         tips. "Let me talk to him alone." 
                     
                     
                         "But-" began Derek, gazing 
                         down at Bill. 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 16 Street &amp; Smith's Love Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         "Please!" she repeated tremu- 
                         lously. 
                     
                     
                         "I'll be right outside!" said Derek 
                         grimly. "Call if you want me!" He 
                         paid the check for the breakfast and 
                         stalked out. He walked up and 
                         down, like a sentry, outside the win- 
                         dow. 
                     
                     
                         Fran noticed that Bill took 
                         plenty of time about getting to his 
                         feet. Derek was outside by the time 
                         Bill faced her. 
                     
                     
                         Bill laughed hysterically. "So 
                         you're the girl I thought was 
                         straight!" 
                     
                     
                         Fran sighed wearily. 
                     
                     
                         "Bill, are you crazy? I stayed all 
                         night in the back room at the mu- 
                         seum. Derek bunked with the Liv- 
                         ing Skeleton, next door." 
                     
                     
                         Bill glared at her from bloodshot 
                         eyes. "That's a new one! The Liv- 
                         ing Skeleton! What do you take me 
                         for, anyhow? Haven't I been 
                         through enough? I tramped back 
                         and forth in front of that cursed side 
                         show all night long. I'm about 
                         crazy!" His voice broke. 
                     
                     
                         Fran looked at the man polishing 
                         glasses in the back of the restaurant. 
                         No one else was around. "Bill, 
                         you've got this all wrong!" 
                     
                     
                         Bill came close. "I should kill 
                         you! you'deserve it! But I love 
                         you. So I'm going to keep you 
                         straight for the rest of your life, if 
                         I have to keep you shut up in one 
                         room! We re getting married, you 
                         and me. Right now!" 
                     
                     
                         "So, at last you've said what I've 
                         been waiting to hear! For six months 
                         I've waited. Now when you do 
                         speak, it's too late." Fran's face was 
                         very grave. "Bill, I'meant what I 
                         told you, last night. You and I are 
                         through!" 
                     
                     
                         "Will he marry you?" Bill's eyes 
                         glared into hers. 
                     
                     
                         "It isn't a question of marrying. 
                         I-" 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "I thought so! Well, you'd better 
                         do some tall thinking. you're out 
                         of a job. My uncle won't let you 
                         come back. No recommendation, 
                         either!" Bill's tone gloated. So 
                         you'd better take me up on my offer, 
                         pretty darned quick." 
                     
                     
                         "Go away!" said Fran slowly. 
                     
                     
                         "Before I begin to loathe you!" 
                     
                     
                         Bill's breath came whistling 
                         through set teeth. He caught her 
                         wrists and twisted them. His hands 
                         hurt. 
                     
                     
                         Derek came dashing into the 
                         lunch room. His face was furious. 
                         Bill let go of Fran and dodged out 
                         of Derek's way. "Better be sen- 
                         sible!" he advised Fran, over his 
                         shoulder, as he fled down the street. 
                     
                     
                         Derek came over to Fran. "If 
                         that beast had hurt you-" His 
                         voice wasn't very steady. 
                     
                     
                         Fran gasped: "I don't believe I 
                         thanked you for the nice break- 
                         fast!" 
                     
                     
                         Derek's face cleared. He smiled 
                         down into her eyes. "Did I ever 
                         happen to mention that you're the 
                         grandest girl in the world?" he asked 
                         softly. 
                     
                     
                         At two o'clock, people began 
                         crowding around the Chamber of 
                         Horrors, attracted by the crimson 
                         skull and crossbones Fran had 
                         painted. 
                     
                     
                         "Here!" said Fran, taking the roll 
                         of tickets from Derek. "I'll sell 
                         these, while you tell people about 
                         things inside the museum." 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, I couldn't let you do that, 
                         Fran! You've done so much al- 
                         ready. I- 
                     
                     
                         "Here's my dime, and I'd like to 
                         go into this-here place. If you two 
                         could decide which one of you is 
                         going to sell tickets!" broke in a 
                         woman s harsh voice. 
                     
                     
                         Fran pulled a ticket from the roll 
                         and pocketed the dime. She smiled  
                 
                 LS-1E 
             
             
                 
                 Extra Sheer 17 
                 
                     
                     
                         at Derek. "Go along!" she whis- 
                         pered. 
                     
                     
                         He patted her sleeve. "I'll get 
                         even later!" he promised. Then he 
                         disappeared into the museum. 
                     
                     
                         All afternoon, people straggled 
                         into the Chamber of Horrors. But 
                         they didn't seem to be much im- 
                         pressed. When they came out, they 
                         announced loudly that the show was 
                         no good. Fran's heart contracted 
                         with fear. What if the museum 
                         failed after all! What would Derek 
                         do then? Her hands went clammy 
                         cold. 
                     
                     
                         About four o'clock, business 
                         picked up. Crowds flocked in. They 
                         came out chattering interestedly. 
                         Fran strained her ears to listen. "Do 
                         you think King Louis is real? I 
                         don't. He's just another wax figure. 
                         But if you ask me, I'd say he's 
                         cleverly made!" 
                     
                     
                         King Louis! But they had no 
                         figure of King Louis. 
                     
                     
                         There was no time to think about 
                         the matter. People were arriving 
                         too fast. Fran made change with 
                         flying fingers. By five thirty the 
                         cash box was full! 
                     
                     
                         "This is the zero hour, miss," said 
                         Pete. He was the new man they 
                         hired to ballyhoo. "Might as well 
                         shut up shop for an hour. 
                     
                     
                         Fran nodded. Wearily, she slipped 
                         down from the high booth. 
                     
                     
                         "Where's the boss?" went on Pete. 
                     
                     
                         "He hasn't as much as stuck his nose 
                         outside the pitch, all afternoon." 
                     
                     
                         "I don't know," said Fran. She 
                         was Suddenly worried. Hastily she 
                         went into the museum. 
                     
                     
                         At her entrance, a weary figure in 
                         a blue satin suit and wearing a 
                         white periwig, got hastily in posi- 
                         tion on his knees in front of Marie 
                         Antoinette. 
                     
                     
                         Marie Antoinette was coquet- 
                         tishly lifting one corner of her skirt 
                         to display her shapely ankle, just 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         as Fran had arranged. But Fran 
                         hadn't painted the sign which hung 
                         above her. 
                     
                     
                         Is King Louis Real? Five Dollars to 
                         Any One Who Can Make Any of Our Wax 
                         Figures Smile! 
                     
                     
                         "Derek!" gasped Fran. 
                     
                     
                         King Louis scrambled to his feet, 
                         flexing his weary arms and legs as 
                         he did so. "I should have taken an 
                         easier position. To-night I think I'll 
                         just try standing in front of Marie!" 
                     
                     
                         "But Derek!" Fran was staring 
                         at his face, thickly incrusted with 
                         wax and paint. "I don't under- 
                         stand!" 
                     
                     
                         "I wasn't sure it would work. 
                         That's why I didn't tell you, be- 
                         fore." Derek stretched again. 
                     
                     
                         "George Washington's suit fits me 
                         beautifully, doesn't it?" he went on, 
                         as she still stared uncomprehend- 
                         ingly. I did this mechanical-man 
                         stunt at all the college powwows. 
                         It always brought down the house. 
                         And people this afternoon fell for it 
                         like nobody's business! They tried 
                         so hard to make me laugh, that they 
                         put themselves into good humor. 
                         I'll bet they bring all their friends 
                         and come back to-night. And the 
                         best thing of all: nobody could 
                         possibly recognize me under all this 
                         wax and paint!" 
                     
                     
                         "Derek, nothing on earth is go- 
                         ing to keep you from succeeding!" 
                         Her eyes were luminous with unshed 
                         tears. 
                     
                     
                         Derek shook his head. "Not since 
                         I have to live up to you, dear! I 
                         sort of bucked at making a fool of 
                         myself in front of all these stran- 
                         gers. It was different from making 
                         a little sport for my college pals. 
                         And then I thought of you, out 
                         there selling tickets. I remembered 
                         that you had given up your good job 
                         and thrown in your lot with my un- 
                         certain fortunes. That decided me." 
                     
                 
                 LS-2E 
             
             
                 
                 18 Street &amp; Smith's Love Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         Fran's lips trembled. He had 
                          called her dear! 
                     
                     
                         "I got fired!" she said slowly. "So 
                         this is really charity. Giving me a 
                         job, you see. I need a job." 
                     
                     
                         "And I need you," Derek mur- 
                         mured in an odd tone. 
                     
                     
                         As Fran sold tickets and made 
                         change that night, she thought 
                         about Derek and what he had said. 
                         She was in love with him! The 
                         knowledge came to her with the 
                         force of a blow. In love with Derek 
                         van Erp and she had never 
                         guessed. That was why she had at 
                         last realized that the thrill she felt 
                         over Bill's dangerous kisses, wasn't 
                         really love. This new tide of feel- 
                         ing which swept over her was quite 
                         different. It was something so won- 
                         derful that it took her breath away. 
                     
                     
                         "Hello, Fran!" 
                     
                     
                         Fran's thoughts stopped short. 
                     
                     
                         "Bill!" she gasped. With Bill was a 
                         big burly policeman. Fran s heart 
                         came up in her throat and stayed 
                         there. 
                     
                     
                         "Pete!" she said in an urgent un- 
                         dertone. "Take the ticket booth for 
                         a minute. Will you?" 
                     
                     
                         Pete climbed to the booth as she 
                         slipped down. She drew Bill a little 
                     
                     
                         distance from the museum. "Now," 
                         she gasped. "What do you want?" 
                     
                     
                         We want your Mr. van Erp! 
                         Bill was smiling nastily. 
                     
                     
                         Fran caught her breath. "Don't 
                         say his name so loud! He calls him- 
                         self Mr. Smith out here!" 
                     
                     
                         Blandly, the officer said: "What- 
                         ever he calls himself, 'tis no concern 
                         of ours. But I have a warrant for 
                         the arrest of the person who stole 
                         a wax figure out of Mr. Sam 
                         Krause's storeroom." 
                     
                     
                         "Oh!" Everything reeled dizzily 
                         about Fran. She clutched at the 
                         officer's arm. "But you can't do 
                         that! The mandarin was an old fig-  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         ure that just took up space. Mr. 
                         Krause offered it to anybody who 
                         would cany it away. There was no 
                         question of stealing! 
                     
                     
                         "Mr. Krause seems to think dif- 
                         ferently," put in Bill importantly. 
                     
                     
                         Fran turned on Bill like a whirl- 
                         wind. "So! This is the way you get 
                         even, is it? A low-down contemptible 
                         way. You know darned well that 
                         Mr. Krause wanted to get rid of that 
                         figure!" 
                     
                     
                         Bill smiled nastily. 
                     
                     
                         Fran went on in a breathless tone: 
                         "All right. Have it your way, if 
                         you want to! But I was the one 
                         who took that wax figure from Mr. 
                         Krause's storeroom. Serve your old 
                         John Doe warrant on me! Let's 
                         have this over with!" 
                     
                     
                         Bill stopped smiling and looked 
                         annoyed. "Mr. van Erp is the 
                         thief!" he snapped. 
                     
                     
                         "I was the one who took the fig- 
                         ure!" repeated Fran doggedly. 
                     
                     
                         Bill said a few words to the po- 
                         liceman in an undertone. The offi- 
                         cer moved over to the corner and 
                         stood there. Bill pulled Fran into 
                         a secluded corner. His mouth met 
                         Fran's in a kiss that was degrading 
                         and frightening. Finally he stopped 
                         kissing her. 
                     
                     
                         "You've got into my blood! he 
                         cried hoarsely. I didn't know how 
                         crazy I was about you, till I found 
                         out you'd fallen for this high-hat 
                         chap. But you'll never get him. 
                         See? Not if I have to kill both of 
                         you to keep you apart!" 
                     
                     
                         Fran struggled to free herself 
                         from his hateful embrace. His arms 
                         were like bands of steel about her. 
                     
                     
                         "I can have him put in jail for 
                         the theft of the mandarin. It won't 
                         do any good for you to say you took 
                         the figure. I'll swear -I saw him 
                         taking it from my uncle s shop!" 
                         Fran gave a pitiful little groan. 
                     
                     
                         "Besides, I know this fellow's real

                         name. No Smith business will go. 
                         So I'll smear the Van Erp name he's 
                         so proud of, over the front page of 
                         every dirty newsrag in town. I'll see 
                         that he pays plenty for taking my 
                         girl!" 
                     
                     
                         Fran clasped her hands. "Oh, 
                         no!" she gasped. She remembered 
                         how she had given her word to 
                         Derek that no one should ever know 
                         his real identity. "No. You 
                         mustn't do that!" she repeated. 
                     
                     
                         "There might be a way this could 
                     
                     
                         be fixed." Bill s voice was insinuat- 
                     
                     
                         ing. 
                     
                     
                         "What?" Instantly Fran was 
                         tense. She had a foreboding of 
                         something evil. 
                     
                     
                         "If you married 
                         me, I'd pledge you 
                         my word that I'd 
                         forget all this! Van 
                         Erp can hide down 
                         here in a moth- 
                         eaten museum till 
                         he dies, for all I 
                         care. 
                     
                     
                         Fran swayed. Her 
                         knees seemed to 
                         buckle under her. 
                         She remembered how Derek had 
                         called her dear! She thought of 
                         the expression in Derek's eyes when 
                         he had told her she was his friend. 
                         She couldn't let Derek down. Not 
                         ever. No price was too high 
                         to pay. 
                     
                     
                         "All right. If you'll prom- 
                         ise faithfully that Derek 
                         goes free! Fran felt sick 
                         and worn out. 
                     
                     
                         Bill s lips lingered on hers 
                         hatefully. Then he let her 
                         go. 
                     
                     
                         Fran stood quite still, run- 
                         ning the back of her hand 
                         across her lips as if to wipe off his 
                         kiss. 
                     
                     
                         Meanwhile, Bill had gone to sum-mon the police officer. Sorry! he 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                         
                             Fran was fum- 
                             bling her way out 
                             of the marriage- 
                             license bureau. 
                             She blundered 
                             blindly into some 
                             one who was run- 
                             ning down the 
                             corridor. "Fran! 
                             Fran darling! I'm 
                             not too late? You 
                             haven't married 
                             that rotter!" 
                         
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         said importantly to the policeman, "The whole affair was a mistake.

                         Just an error. Too bad I dragged 
                         you clear out here for nothing." 
                     
                     
                         Fran was shivering. Her head 
                         ached horribly. 
                     
                     
                         The price of Derek's pride was 
                         marrying Bill! She laughed hys- 
                         terically. 
                     
                     
                         Yesterday, she might have 
                         thought that being married to Bill 
                         was the grandest thing in the world. 
                         To-day, she knew better. She saw 
                         Bill with true eyes, and what'she 
                         saw, made her shudder. 
                     
                     
                         "Let's hurry!" she gasped, begin- 
                         ning to walk toward the subway. 
                         She must get away before Derek 
                         missed her. 
                     
                     
                         "Don't you want to get your 
                         hat?" Bill's voice seemed to come 
                         from a long way off. 
                     
                     
                         "What do I care about a hat?" 
                         Fran was tramping resolutely along. 
                     
                     
                         The ride into town was seemingly 
                         endless. Bill's hands were hot and 
                         possessive on her arm. Bill talked 
                         a great deal. Fran crouched against 
                         the seat. She felt numb and queer. 
                     
                     
                         "I'll be by to-morrow morning at 
                         nine," Bill said, when he left her at 
                         the door of her boarding house. "But 
                         let me tell you: If you try to com- 
                         municate with this Van Erp fellow, 
                         everything'll be all off. And he'll go 
                         to jail! Don't forget that. And re- 
                         member: I'm being pretty forgiv- 
                         ing. Not every man would conde- 
                         scend to marry you, after what's 
                         happened!" 
                     
                     
                         When Fran was alone in her 
                         room, she brushed her lips with her 
                         spread fingers, whimpering like a 
                         child who has been hurt. 
                     
                     
                         Married. Married to Bill! Oh, 
                         she couldn't! 
                     
                     
                         She threw herself face downward 
                         on the bed, and wept. Finally, ex- 
                         hausted, she fell asleep. 
                     
                     
                         It was eight o'clock when she 
                         woke, stiff and unrefreshed from 
                         sleeping in her clothes. Numbly, she  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         undressed and bathed. She couldn't 
                         think. Couldn't plan. Her mind 
                         seemed to have stopped. 
                     
                     
                         Slowly she put on her prettiest 
                         dress and her best slippers. With 
                         shaking hands, she rouged her pallid 
                         cheeks. 
                     
                     
                         Some one knocked at the door. 
                         Fran's hand flew to her heart. Had 
                         Bill come already? Surely it wasn't 
                         time! 
                     
                     
                         "Coming!" she said in an odd little 
                         scared voice. She pulled her hat 
                         over her curls. Her feet stumbled 
                         as she went to the door. 
                     
                     
                         Bill kissed her till she went limp 
                         in his arms. Everything in the room 
                         whirled about crazily, while Fran 
                         fought to keep from screaming. 
                     
                     
                         "White!" he said in a satisfied 
                         tone. "I'm sure glad you're wearing 
                         white. A regular bride!" 
                     
                     
                         Fran whispered: "I don't love 
                         you. You know that. Yet- yet 
                         you insist on this farce of a wed- 
                         ding?" 
                     
                     
                         Bill's eyes darkened angrily. 
                         "Stop that sort of talk!" he com- 
                         manded. you're going to be my 
                         wife. And my wife is going to do 
                         as she s told!" 
                     
                     
                         The marriage-license bureau was 
                         filled with people. Tremblingly, 
                         Fran followed Bill into the room. 
                         She felt as if she were Marie An- 
                         toinette on the way to the guillotine. 
                     
                     
                         Fran looked at the people dazedly. 
                         Tall women seemed to marry little 
                         men, and big men selected little 
                         girls. Old and young. Homely and 
                         pretty. Fran bit her lips, and sank 
                         down onto the nearest chair. 
                     
                     
                         "You'll have to wait!" cackled the 
                         old man who was with a young, gig- 
                         gling girl. "Looks like people is still 
                         gettin married, despite what the 
                         books and newspapers say!" 
                     
                     
                         Fran felt as if there wasn't enough 
                         air in the room to breathe. She 
                         twisted her fingers together. She 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Extra Sheer 21 
                 
                     
                     
                         fought with all her will to keep from 
                         fainting. 
                     
                     
                         Derek! She must remember that 
                         she was doing this for Derek! 
                     
                     
                         "Like to take a look at the morn- 
                         ing paper?" cackled the talkative 
                         old bridegroom-elect. 
                     
                     
                         Limply, Fran accepted the crum- 
                         pled sheet. She held the newspaper 
                         for a time, not even looking at it. 
                         She was horribly aware of Bill's 
                         shoulder against hers. Suddenly she 
                         felt Bill stiffen. He made a lunge 
                         for the newspaper, but he was too 
                         late. Fran's eyes had caught a 
                         glimpse of the front page. 
                     
                     
                         "Oh!" she gasped. 
                     
                     
                         She snatched the paper away from 
                         Bill's clutching hand. 
                     
                     
                         On the front page was a picture. 
                         Derek, in his King Louis costume! 
                         "Scion of Wealthy House Jailed," 
                         was the heading. Under the picture 
                         of an interior shot of the museum, 
                         was the text: "Derek van Erp 
                         Steals Wax Figure." Beside that 
                         was an old snapshot of Derek in his 
                         polo costume. 
                     
                     
                         Fran's eyes blurred with fury. 
                     
                     
                         "So! You sold Derek out any- 
                         way! After you'd promised!" 
                     
                     
                         "You're the next couple!" cackled 
                         the old fellow, coming back with his 
                         license in his hand. 
                     
                     
                         "Fran, I can explain!" Bill was 
                         licking his dry lips. 
                     
                     
                         "So can I!" Fran's hand shot out 
                         and she slapped Bill resoundingly 
                         across the face! 
                     
                     
                         A startled gasp went over the 
                         room. 
                     
                     
                         Fran didn't notice. She was fum- 
                         bling her way out of the place. She 
                         was crying horribly. She blundered 
                         blindly into some one who was run- 
                         ning pell-mell down the corridor. 
                     
                     
                         "Fran! Fran darling!" Loving 
                         arms closed about her. "Fran, I'm 
                         not too late? You haven't married 
                         that rotter!" 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Fran blinked back her tears. 
                         "Derek!" She whispered his name. 
                         She clung to him. "Oh, Derek, I 
                         didn't tell about you. I would have 
                         died, rather than have anybody find 
                         out. I was going to marry Bill to 
                         keep him from telling. I-" 
                     
                     
                         "So that was it!" Derek's voice 
                         was grim. "Darling, I've been 
                         tracing-" 
                     
                     
                         "No loitering in the halls, if you 
                         please!" said a harsh, official voice. 
                         Hastily, Derek released Fran. 
                     
                     
                         "Come on, dear," he said. "I've 
                         a cab waiting outside." 
                     
                     
                         "Can can we afford a taxi?" 
                         Fran asked doubtfully, as she got in. 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, my sweet!" He drew her 
                         close. He laid his face against hers. 
                         "I've been tracing you, ever since I 
                         got out of jail, early this morning. 
                         My uncle Laurence's lawyer got me 
                         out, the first thing. I paid forty 
                         dollars for the dog-goned mandarin. 
                         That got me free." 
                     
                     
                         "Oh!" sobbed Fran. "All your 
                         money! And it was my fault for 
                         giving the figure to you. I thought 
                         I was helping and-" 
                     
                     
                         "Where do you want to go? If 
                         anywhere?" asked the taxi driver in 
                         a disagreeable tone. 
                     
                     
                         "Drive around. Central Park. 
                         Anywhere!" Derek was kissing 
                         Fran tumultuously. 
                     
                     
                         "You were helping me, darling!" 
                         he assured her fatuously. "Uncle 
                         Laurence thought I was all Van Erp. 
                         He's my mother's brother, you see. 
                         And he disliked the girl I was going 
                         to marry. And he thought I was 
                         the sort of man who would sink un- 
                         der adverse conditions. And when 
                         he saw that article in the newspaper 
                         he was delighted! He came and 
                         looked me up, right away. Dear, 
                         he's giving me a job in his office. 
                         A real job, with lots of money. 
                         There's only one condition. I have 
                         to keep the wax-works museum, and  
                 
             
             
                 
                 22 Street &amp; Smith's Love Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         Saturdays he wants me to be King 
                         Louis again! He s afraid I'll get 
                         high-hat or something, I guess." 
                         Derek's voice was lilting with happi- 
                         ness. 
                     
                     
                         "Oh!" said Fran. She drew away 
                         slightly. "So you're going back to 
                         being the sort of man that's a mil- 
                         lion miles above me!" she said. "I- 
                         I'm glad for you, Derek. Awfully 
                         glad. Only-" Her voice broke. 
                     
                     
                         "Only you're going to hate being 
                         married to a mere business man?" 
                         Derek's lips lingered on hers. "Is 
                         that what you're trying to tell me?" 
                     
                     
                         "Married?" quavered Fran. 
                     
                     
                         "I couldn't tell you how much I 
                         loved you. I couldn't ask you to be 
                         my wife, not when I didn't have a 
                         penny to my name. But now I'm 
                         a plutocrat- Oh, Fran darling, 
                         you ve got to marry me. I love you 
                         so. I want you so. I need you so!" 
                         he finished in a low voice. 
                     
                     
                         Fran s lips quivered against his. 
                         "Of course I'll marry you!" she 
                         sobbed. "I've adored you, since the 
                         very first minute you came into the  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         store." 
                     
                     
                         Derek chuckled. "I'll bet that 
                         newspaper article will bring a lot of 
                         trade to the museum! Too bad we 
                         won't be there to see! I've left Pete 
                         in charge." He tilted Fran's chin 
                         with his forefinger. "Powder your 
                         pretty little nose, sweet! Uncle 
                         Laurence is waiting for us to have 
                         luncheon with him at the Ritz. 
                         Then we can go and get married. 
                         How would that program suit you?" 
                     
                     
                         "Anything!" Fran exclaimed. "So 
                         long as we're together!" 
                     
                     
                         Derek van Erp found that such a 
                         satisfactory answer that he almost 
                         forgot to give her the box he had 
                         in his coat pocket. 
                     
                     
                         "Six pairs of cobweb stockings, 
                         darling!" he said gleefully. "Bought 
                         with an advance on my salary! 
                         These stockings are your own, 
                         sweet. They don't belong to Marie 
                         Antoinette!" 
                     
                     
                         "I adore you!" repeated Fran. 
                     
                     
                         Their lips met in a long, long kiss.

                         THE doorbell rang and Delphine 
                         Parker's movements suddenly 
                         became feverish. She grabbed 
                         for her purse and hat, took one last 
                         look in the mirror, patted her hair 
                         expertly, added just a bit more 
                         rouge, and then, satisfied, snapped 
                         out the light. She doubted if she 
                         had ever looked better. Well, that 
                         was as it should be. She'd probably 
                         never have another chance like this 
                         one. 
                     
                     
                         She walked into the living room 
                         and at once the excited light in her 
                         eyes faded. Her face became 
                         absolutely expressionless. 
                     
                     
                         "0h, it s you, Tommy," she said 
                         slowly. "I thought you were still 
                         at school." 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "Came home for the holiday, 
                         Dell. I thought maybe you'd be 
                         surprised to see me, but I didn't ex- 
                         pect this tumultuous welcome. I 
                         mean, you could have controlled 
                         yourself a little better. Not shown

                         my arms like this." 
                     
                     
                         "Well"- defensively- "you could 
                         not expect me to have the band out, 
                         when you didn't even tell me you 
                         were coming. If you'd told me, I 
                         could have saved the evening for 
                         you. As it is, I've got a date." 
                     
                     
                         "I gather as much from your 
                         opening remark. Somebody I

                         "Martin French."

                         Tommy whistled softly. 
                     
                     
                         "Not the Martin French, of the 
                         rotogravure sections, and the wads 
                         of dough?" 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, don't be nasty. Martin 
                         French is nice." 
                     
                     
                         "I wasn't being nasty. Where 
                         did you meet the gentleman?" 
                     
                     
                         "He sits at one of my tables.

                         "Don't be silly. Nobody pays any 
                         attention to a man's reputation now- 
                         adays. 
                     
                     
                         Tommy's voice lost its bantering 
                         note. Delphine suddenly knew that 
                         he was in dead earnest. 
                     
                     
                         "And it won't do me any good to 
                         ask you not to go with him?" 
                     
                     
                         "No, it won't. Who gave you the 
                         right to pick my friends, anyway?" 
                     
                     
                         "Well" -quizzically- "I love you, 
                         Dell. And I've asked you to marry 
                         me. doesn't that even give me the 
                         right to ask a favor?" 
                     
                     
                         "And I've refused to marry you, 
                         and I've told you I didn't love you. 
                         You're no more to me than than 
                         the postman." Her anger went as 
                         suddenly as it had come. "Oh, 
                         Tommy, I didn't mean that. Not 
                         just that way. You and I have 
                         always been friends, and I hope we 
                         always will be friends. But-" 
                     
                     
                         "But my ideas are old-fashioned, 
                         and the place I live in is a small 
                         town, and I'm still a college boy 
                         no money, just prospects." 
                     
                     
                         "Please don't make it sound worse 
                         than it is, Tommy." 
                     
                     
                         The doorbell rang again. Tommy 
                         picked up his hat with a wry smile. 
                     
                     
                         "Maybe if I go out now," he said, 
                     
                     
                         "they'll be taking a picture of him 
                         for the papers, and I'll get in it."  
                     
                         Having the two men meet in the 
                         hall, and having to introduce them,  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         made Dell ill-at-ease. But Tommy 
                         did not linger, and in a few minutes 
                         Dell and Martin French were driv- 
                         ing off in the big imported roadster. 
                         She put Tommy resolutely out of 
                         her mind. This man was everything 
                         Tommy was not. This man could 
                         give his wife anything she wanted, 
                         no matter how expensive it might 
                         be. Dell knew she had to make the 
                         most of this night with him if she 
                         wanted him. And she did want him. 
                     
                     
                         When modern girls wanted a man, 
                         they did not sit back and wait for 
                         him to choose them. They followed 
                         out some definite plan to gain his 
                         favor. And in that one respect, they 
                         were apt to be as successful as the 
                         Royal Northwest Mounted. 
                     
                     
                         Martin French's age was inde- 
                         terminate due to the meticulous 
                         care he took of his face and skin, the 
                         massages, exercises, and the other 
                         youth-saving devices which only the 
                         very rich have time for and can 
                         afford. 
                     
                     
                         They had gone only a short dis- 
                         tance before Martin turned off the 
                         main highway, and entered the yard 
                         of a small country school. The high 
                         snowbanks on each side of the high- 
                         way effectively hid the yard from 
                         any passer-by, yet the yard itself 
                         was packed firm by many small feet, 
                         so that there was not the slightest 
                         danger of the car getting stuck. 
                     
                     
                         This move on Martin's part, took 
                         Dell by surprise. Yet he reassured 
                         her by sinking back in his seat, 
                         offering her a cigarette, and lighting 
                         one for himself. 
                     
                     
                         "Hope you don't mind," he said 
                         in that lazy, exciting voice of his. 
                     
                     
                         "Driving between high piles of snow 
                         isn't much fun. I don't like to drive 
                         anyway. Not when there's some- 
                         body like you to talk to. You know, 
                         I've got a lot to find out about you. 
                         I don't know a thing except what 
                         my eyes and my heart tell me." 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Going Primitive 25 
                 
                     
                     
                         "And what's that?" Dell smiled. 
                     
                     
                         "My eyes tell me you're the most 
                         beautiful girl I've ever seen, the 
                         most fascinating I've ever met. 
                         And my heart tells me that I'm be- 
                         ginning, for the first time in my life, 
                         to believe in love at first sight."  
                     
                         That so astonished Dell, she could 
                         think of nothing to say in reply. 
                         After a moment he went on. 
                     
                     
                         "You know, Dell, he said, I 
                         wish you knew me better. I wish 
                         you knew me well enough to realize 
                         what that means coming from this 
                         confirmed old bachelor. You've 
                         done something to me, all right. 
                         And to think that when I first saw 
                         you I thought you were just another 
                         pretty girl. I didn't realize that you 
                         were dangerous." 
                     
                     
                         Dell listened incredulously, skepti- 
                         cally, yet there was a ring of sin- 
                         cerity in his voice which forced her 
                         to believe him. Then, almost as if 
                         he could read her mind, he laughed 
                         softly. 
                     
                     
                         "I've got to stop talking like this," 
                         he told her. "You'll think I'm either 
                         crazy or have the world's best line. 
                         Even if it is the truth, I know how 
                         it must sound. I swear it's the first 
                         time it's ever happened to me. I'm 
                         just as astonished as you are."  
                     
                         Abruptly he changed the subject 
                         without waiting for her to speak. 
                         He drew Dell out about herself, and 
                         he talked about himself. He was a 
                         fascinating talker, and Dell listened 
                         enthralled. 
                     
                     
                         After a long time, he mentioned 
                         again his having fallen in love with 
                         her. He laughed about it wryly. 
                         And by that time it seemed to Dell 
                         as if she had known him for years. 
                     
                     
                         "I guess the joke's on me," he 
                         said. "Always before this, I've gone 
                         out with girls, made love to them, 
                         and then gone on to others. But 
                         there isn't going to be any love- 
                         making for me to-night. I want to  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         kiss you more than I've ever wanted 
                         to kiss any one before. And I won't 
                         do it because I won't dare risk it. 
                         I value your good opinion too darned 
                         much." 
                     
                     
                         That bit of frankness touched 
                         Dell. The spell of the night was on 
                         her, and she suddenly realized that 
                         she wanted him to kiss her. That 
                         if he kissed her, this half love which 
                         she felt for him might turn into a 
                         blinding passion which would match 
                         his. 
                     
                     
                         "You wouldn't lose my good 
                         opinion if you tried to kiss me," she 
                         told him softly. "If you loved me 
                         and didn't try to kiss me, I'd think 
                         it was funny." 
                     
                     
                         It didn't sound blatant, the way 
                         she said it. Martin looked at her, 
                         joyfully incredulous for a second. 
                         Then he took her in his arms and 
                         kissed her as she had never been 
                         kissed before. It was the first of 
                         many kisses. At first Dell had not 
                         intended that there should be more 
                         than one. But her refusals seemed 
                         to hurt him, and at last she made 
                         no pretense of refusing. She lay in- 
                         ert in his arms, trembling with the 
                         passion of his kisses, crying a little. 
                         They did not get home until almost 
                         morning. 
                     
                     
                         To her surprise, Dell experienced 
                         a sense of shame the next morning 
                         when she awoke. It was in vain that 
                         she told herself that kisses meant 
                         nothing, and that she loved Martin. 
                         She knew in her heart that she 
                         should not have let him kiss her, 
                         and that she did not love him. Not 
                         yet, anyhow. She wanted him, she 
                         admitted. She wanted to marry 
                         him. He was a matrimonial prize 
                         such as few girls ever capture. 
                         Maybe love would come later. She 
                         was not, like him, able to fall in love 
                         at first sight. 
                     
                     
                         She had to be at the inn early.

                         The work in the morning was con- 
                         tinuous, beginning with the early 
                         risers who were going out onto the 
                         lake to the fish shanties. Late 
                         breakfasts overlapped early lunch- 
                         eons, so that not till the middle 
                         of the afternoon did the girls get 
                         time off. The servants entered the 
                         inn through a door in the lattice- 
                         work under the vast high veranda, 
                         and passed on through another door 
                         into the basement. 
                     
                     
                         At three o'clock Dell stood just 
                         inside the lattice door putting on 
                         her gloves and buttoning her coat 
                         against the bitter cold outside, when 
                         she heard voices from the pathway. 
                         She could see Martin with two of 
                         his friends, and she did not go out 
                         at once, because she was afraid that 
                         she would not be able to greet him 
                         without embarrassment. She 
                         realized instinctively, that from out- 
                         side in the bright sunshine, he 
                         would not be able to penetrate the 
                         murk behind the lattice-work, 
                         though she could see him perfectly. 
                         She did not mean to listen, but she 
                         could hardly help herself. 
                     
                     
                         "I was out last night with that 
                         swell-looking blond who waits on my 
                         table," she heard Martin say. "And 
                         what a girl!" 
                     
                     
                         Stunned, she stood there, strain- 
                         ing to hear every word. 
                     
                     
                         "I suppose you tried the old line 
                         on her, the one my wife says you 
                         tried on her. 'I'm not going to kiss 
                         you because I care too much about 
                         what you think of me.'" 
                         Martin grinned good-humoredly. 
                     
                     
                         "Well," he replied, "you've got to 
                         admit that it's different from most 
                         lines, and that it usually works, even 
                         if it didn't on your darling." 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, I'll admit it works," the 
                         other man said grudgingly. "You 
                         could make most any of em believe  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         you were telling the truth. Well, 
                         are you going to marry the girl?" 
                     
                     
                         "Don't be silly, Mac. When I 
                         marry anybody, it won't be a girl I 
                         can kiss the first time I go out with 
                         her." 
                     
                     
                         "You're like all the great lovers," 
                         the other man grew sarcastic. 
                     
                     
                         "You've had it so easy, you're 
                         scared of your competitors. You ve 
                         only-" 
                     
                     
                         They drifted on out of earshot, 
                         leaving Dell standing rigid, her face 
                         white, her eyes cold and staring. 
                     
                     
                         Dell did not cry. She was so 
                         angry at first, that she could not 
                         think clearly. When the anger died 
                         down a little, and she was able for 
                         a minute to stop hating Martin, her 
                         ideas gradually changed. He was 
                         still just as good a prize as he had 
                         been before. Common sense told 
                         her that. She had had her chance 
                         to win him, and she had flubbed it. 
                         He had been testing her out, and she 
                         had kissed him against her better 
                         judgment, because she had supposed 
                         it was what she must do to please 
                         him. 
                     
                     
                         Now the point to be decided by 
                         cold analytical reasoning, was 
                         whether or not she still wanted him. 
                     
                     
                         She decided that she did. And 
                         now she had the upper hand, be- 
                         cause she knew how she stood with 
                         him, and he didn't know that she 
                         knew. In the three remaining days 
                         of his stay at the inn, she might be 
                         able to do a great deal if she tried 
                         hard enough. If she didn't win him, 
                         she would at least have had a good 
                         time. 
                     
                     
                         The next morning Dell met 
                         Tommy. He had lines, pails, wood, 
                         cooking utensils and food loaded on 
                         a sled. 
                     
                     
                         "I'm going to take my shanty out 
                         over the reef and fish for a couple 
                         of days," he told her. "Better skate

                         out and see me this afternoon if 
                         you can spare time from the new 
                         boy friend." 
                     
                     
                         Dell talked with him a while, and 
                         then went on up to the inn. Martin 
                         was the first of her people down for 
                         breakfast, and she found, in con- 
                         versation with him, that he, too, was 
                         going out to one of the shanties for 
                         a days fishing. Dell said nothing, 
                         but a plan was forming in her mind. 
                         Modern young ladies don't sit 
                         around and wait for men to come 
                         to them, she remembered. 
                     
                     
                         That afternoon, when she was off 
                         duty, she took her skates and went 
                         down to the wharf. Far out across 
                         the smooth expanse of ice, she could 
                         see the tiny specks which she knew 
                         were fish shanties. She put on her 
                         skates and started toward them. 
                         She covered the distance rapidly, 
                         with lazy, powerful strokes.

                         Champlain. The fishermen have 
                         shanties, about six feet long and four 
                         feet wide, equipped with bunks 
                         which fold up against the walls 
                         during the daytime, a folding table,

                         The shanties are on runners, and are 
                         dragged out to the fishing grounds, 
                         where they are anchored to keep the 
                         wind from carrying them away. 
                         Holes are cut in the ice to cor- 
                         respond to trap doors in the floor of 
                         each shanty, and the men sit in 
                         them fishing, sometimes for weeks 
                         on end without going ashore. The 
                         fish company truck drives out, buys 
                         their catch and brings them pro- 
                         visions. 
                     
                     
                         That afternoon the ice, which is 
                         kept clear almost all winter by the 
                         driving force of the wind sweeping 
                         unobstructed over the lake's hun- 
                         dred and fifty mile length, was here 
                         and there patched with snow. But 
                         it did not spoil the skating. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         When Dell at last reached the 
                         shanties, she went first to Tommy's. 
                         He was enjoying a fine run of smelt 
                         at the moment, and did not try to 
                         detain her when she informed him 
                         that she must leave and see Martin 
                         before she went ashore. 
                     
                     
                         "I might have known you 
                         wouldn't come clear out here just 
                         to see me," he grinned, "and went on 
                         with his fishing." 
                     
                     
                         The shanties which the hotel kept 
                         for its guests, were all painted red, 
                         and Dell could tell Martin's only by 
                         number. It was on the opposite side 
                         of the reef, and with several shanties 
                         between it and the smelt run. Martin 
                         was having no luck at all. He wel- 
                         comed Dell profusely. 
                     
                     
                         She came inside, took off her 
                         skates, and sat in the chair opposite 
                         him. 
                     
                     
                         "But this is perfectly grand," he 
                         told her. "I was bored to tears. 
                         And then the one person who could 
                         never bore me, came along. Oh, 
                         honey" -he was suddenly humble- 
                         "you look perfectly adorable. May 
                         I kiss you?" 
                     
                     
                         But Dell was all ready with her 
                         story. 
                     
                     
                         "Martin, she said, that was one 
                         of the things I came out here to talk 
                         to you about. I can't kiss you any 
                         more. It's not right. I never kissed 
                         a man the first time I went out with 
                         him before in my whole life. You- 
                         I guess you swept me off my feet. 
                         But it won't happen again. It's not 
                         right." 
                     
                     
                         Martin nodded slowly. 
                     
                     
                         "If you think we shouldn't, then 
                         we won't," he said. "You know you 
                         can do anything to me." 
                     
                     
                         But it was very evident that he 
                         did not intend to abide by that 
                         promise. Slowly, indirectly, he went 
                         about the task of breaking down 
                         Dell's resolve. Now that she could 
                         sit back detached and watch his 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Going Primitive 29 
                 
                     
                     
                         performance, she had to admit that 
                         it was the finest thing of its kind she 
                         had ever seen. It was done so per- 
                         fectly that again and again she 
                         found herself swayed by his words 
                         and ideas. Yet knowing that it was 
                         a line, kept her from yielding. 
                     
                     
                         Martin favored her with his whole 
                         repertoire. And when he found her 
                         still adamant, she saw another side 
                         of him. He came suddenly across 
                         the shanty and tried to force her to 
                         kiss him. She held him off like an 
                         expert, without losing her temper. 
                     
                     
                         "Please, Martin," she said. 
                     
                     
                         "Please don't." 
                     
                     
                         She might just as well have asked 
                         a favor of the wind. Martin had 
                         experienced her kisses, and he 
                         wanted more of them. He was will- 
                         ing to be adroit as long as it seemed 
                         to be gaining him his ends. But if 
                         adroitness failed, there was always 
                         force. Dell found out that either 
                         Martin French had been lying to his 
                         friends about his admiration for girls 
                         who would not allow themselves to 
                         be kissed, or else he reserved that 
                         admiration for girls in his own walk 
                         of life. Waitresses were just a pleas- 
                         ant interlude. 
                     
                     
                         "I won't stop," he told her. "I'm 
                         mad about you. I'm wild about 
                         you." 
                     
                     
                         Dell shook herself free, and stood 
                         facing him, her anger rising. 
                     
                     
                         "Martin, she said, if you don't 
                         stop, I'll- I'll call for help. I'll 
                         scream, and with all the shanties 
                         close to us, somebody will be here 
                         darn quick. Now be sensible." 
                     
                     
                         Martin paused, uncertain, his face 
                         a thundercloud. Then he turned 
                         and stalked through the door, 
                         slamming it after him. Dell 
                         dropped into a chair, relief flood- 
                         ing her. She found she had been 
                         under greater strain than she had 
                         supposed. She stayed in the cabin 
                         because she did not know what  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Martin's next move would be. She 
                         had taken her skates off, and his 
                         were still lying over in the corner. 
                         She had picked up one skate and 
                         started to put it on, when he re- 
                         turned. 
                     
                     
                         "Martin," she said, in a desperate 
                         effort at reconciliation, "please don't 
                         take it like that. Please." She 
                         wanted to tell him that he was being 
                         inconsistent, but she could not. Not 
                         without telling him how she recog- 
                         nized his inconsistency. 
                     
                     
                         "But, Dell," he said, and he threw 
                         his hands wide in a hopeless gesture, 
                         "I can't stand it. I can't stand 
                         having you near me, loving you the 
                         way I do, and not being able to kiss 
                         you. I can't stand it." 
                     
                     
                         "Then I'll go away. Because you 
                         can't go on kissing me the way you 
                         did last night. If I let you, you'll 
                         think I'm cheap." 
                     
                     
                         She began putting on her skates 
                         again, but he stopped her. 
                     
                     
                         "No, Dell. You can't go. Please, 
                         Dell." 
                     
                     
                         Again he tried to take her in his 
                         arms, and again she eluded him. 
                         And it was then that she became 
                         aware of a new sound. The sound 
                         of runners on ice. The shanty was 
                         moving with the wind. 
                     
                     
                         She tried to tear herself free from 
                         him but he was expecting the move, 
                         and forestalled her. Then she tried 
                         to scream. But again he was too 
                         quick for her. He crushed his hand 
                         over her mouth, and held it there. 
                     
                     
                         "Go ahead and yell," he snarled, 
                         in a tone she had never heard him 
                         use before. "I fixed that. We'll be 
                         far enough away in a couple of 
                         minutes so you can howl till you're 
                         blue in the face." 
                     
                     
                         Gradually Dell's first, unreason- 
                         ing panic, the panic which comes to 
                         any person on finding himself held 
                         prisoner, gave way to an even deeper 
                         panic built on thought. They were 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 30 Street &amp; Smith's Love Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         traveling north ahead of a south 
                         gale. And Dell knew that only a 
                         mile or so north of them, where the 
                         lake widened, there was open water. 
                         Lake Champlain does not freeze like 
                         the smaller bodies of water. The 
                         south end, which is comparatively 
                         narrow, freezes early, the middle 
                         part, where they were, freezes next, 
                         and often the wide lake does not 
                         freeze at all. The shanty was gain- 
                         ing momentum every moment, its 
                         flat side acting as a sail. Shortly, 
                         Dell knew, unless they jumped out 
                         onto the ice, they would both drown. 
                         Martin, a man who knew nothing 
                         about the lake, did not realize this. 
                     
                     
                         She tried to tell him. While she 
                         fought him, she panted out the in- 
                         formation. But he only vaguely 
                         listened. And he laughed at her, a 
                         hard, chilling laugh that had no 
                         mirth in it. 
                     
                     
                         He no longer tried to keep her 
                         from screaming, but she did not 
                         scream because she knew they were 
                         too far from the other shanties for 
                         any one to hear her. Instead, she 
                         tried to fight her way to the door. 
                     
                     
                         Her mind worked with startling 
                         clearness. She knew about how fast 
                         they were going, and about how far 
                         they had to go. And she realized 
                         that there was little time left. 
                         Again and again she tried to break 
                         away from him and jump out onto 
                         the ice. But always he caught her 
                         and held her. Over and over she 
                         screamed at him that open water 
                         lay ahead of them. That it was in- 
                         exorably closer every minute. 
                     
                     
                         But it did not good. All his life 
                         Martin had lied to get himself out 
                         of tight situations. He thought Dell 
                         was doing the same thing now. He 
                         was no longer trying to kiss her. 
                         He knew there would be plenty of 
                         time for that later on. He contented 
                         himself with keeping her there in 
                         the shanty, not letting her escape. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Dell grew frantic, almost insane 
                         with terror. She broke away from 
                         him and went to the tiny window 
                         In the gathering dusk she could see 
                         the angry black of open water not 
                         a hundred yards ahead. Some of 
                         her terror must have communicated 
                         itself to him, because he came over 
                         beside her to look. In the split 
                         second of complete quiet, Dell heard 
                         the ring of skate runners. Then 
                         Martin shrieked and jumped toward 
                         the door. As he did so, the shanty's 
                         momentum was checked so short 
                         that it threw Dell to her knees, and 
                         catapulated Martin on past the 
                         door, into the wall. 
                     
                     
                         They heard a shout outside, and 
                         Dell reached the door first. The 
                         shanty had stopped moving, and 
                         on its south side, his skates dug into 
                         the ice as he leaned back on the rope 
                         with which it had been anchored, 
                         stood Tommy. 
                     
                     
                         Martin came out, looking at the 
                         black water and trembling violently. 
                         Dell kept her eyes turned away from 
                         him. 
                     
                     
                         "You know," Tommy said grimly, 
                     
                     
                         "it was a good thing I tagged along, 
                         I guess. I saw your shanty start 
                         to go places, so I put on my skates 
                         and followed. Why didn't you jump 
                         out?" 
                     
                     
                         "We didn't know it was moving," 
                         Martin lied quickly, before Dell 
                         could answer. 
                     
                     
                         "I suppose I didn't see you come 
                         out and deliberately hack the 
                         anchor rope," Tommy snapped. 
                     
                     
                         A long silence followed. Finally 
                         Tommy broke it. 
                     
                     
                         "You two put on your skates and 
                         help me anchor this shack again. 
                         Then I'll start back. You got an 
                         extra spike, French?" 
                     
                     
                         Martin had one. They drove it 
                         deep into the ice, and fastened the 
                         end of the rope to it. 
                     
                     
                         "Now I guess I'll be on my way, 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Going Primitive 31 
                 
                      The spell of the night was on her, and she suddenly realized that she wanted him to kiss her. "You wouldn't lose my
                            good opinion if you tried to kiss me," she told him softly.  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Tommy said, "and leave you two 
                         love birds alone." 
                     
                     
                         "I'm coming along," Dell said. 
                         Her voice was not quite steady now 
                         that the strain was over. 
                     
                     
                         Martin went with them. They 
                         started away, in the teeth of the 
                         wind, Tommy leading. And sud- 
                         denly he came to swerving stop, 
                         at the same time grabbing his two  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         companions. Dell, looking up 
                         quickly, saw open water ahead of 
                         them. Automatically, she turned 
                         her eyes to Tommy, and met his 
                         quizzical glance. A wry smile 
                         twisted the corners of his mouth. 
                     
                     
                         "This was only a crack when I 
                         came along," he said. "Now there 
                         must be twenty-five feet of water 
                         here."

                         It took a few seconds for Dell to 
                         realize what that ever-widening 
                         strip of water between them and the 
                         main ice, meant. 
                     
                     
                         "Then- then we're marooned on 
                         this flow," she demanded in- 
                         credulously. 
                         He nodded. "It looks that way." 
                     
                     
                         "Well, we can swim that dis- 
                         tance, anyway," Martin French said. 
                     
                     
                         "Go ahead," Tommy told him. 
                     
                     
                         "I'm not having any ice water baths 
                         for mine, thanks. And when you 
                         get to the other side it will be a 
                         toss-up whether you can get to shore 
                         before you freeze." 
                     
                     
                         "But what are we going to do? 
                         We ve got to do something." 
                     
                     
                         "There isn't anything we can do. 
                         They'll pick us up to-morrow, if the 
                         ice cake holds together." 
                     
                     
                         They went back to the shanty. 
                     
                     
                         "We might as well eat," Dell said. 
                         "I'll see if I can make a meal out 
                         of what's here." 
                     
                     
                         "Better save some of it for to- 
                         morrow," Tommy suggested. 
                     
                     
                         "There isn't even enough for to- 
                         night," Martin told him. "We'll be 
                         off here to-morrow. Use it all."  
                     
                         Tommy dressed the smelt that 
                         were in the fish pail. There were 
                         quite a few of them, but pitifully 
                         little else. Only the left-overs from 
                         Martin's luncheon. Dell still felt 
                         hungry when they had finished, but 
                         the meal had made them all more 
                         cheerful. The cheerfulness grew as 
                         the evening progressed. Outside the 
                         wind had died down, so that they 
                         were drifting slower, even though 
                         the current was still taking them 
                         away from the main body of ice. 
                         The weather was much warmer, too, 
                         and inside, with the fire going, they 
                         removed their light leather skating 
                         coats. Dell began almost to enjoy 
                         the experience. Yet always she gave 
                         thanks deep in her heart that 
                         Tommy was there. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Martin brought out a liquor bottle 
                         and offered them each a drink. Dell 
                         refused, and Tommy took only a 
                         swallow. Martin drank quite a lot. 
                     
                     
                         "You don't know what's good for 
                         you," he told them. "You won't 
                         need any fire if you get a couple of 
                         shots of this down you." 
                     
                     
                         "I'll stick to the fire, as long as 
                         it lasts," Tommy told him. "That 
                         stuff tasted worse than bootleg 
                         liquor." 
                     
                     
                         Later on, Tommy went to the 
                         window and stood for a long time 
                         looking out. At last he called the 
                         others. Outside a dense fog was 
                         rolling out from the land, envelop- 
                         ing the shack in a dead, wet vapor. 
                         It gave everything a ghostly appear- 
                         ance. 
                     
                     
                         "I was afraid of this thaw," 
                         Tommy said. "I hope the fog will 
                         be gone by morning." 
                     
                     
                         But it was not gone by morning. 
                         Dell slept a few hours, and when she 
                         awoke, Tommy was already up. 
                         She woke cold. The fog enveloped 
                         them, and they could not see ten 
                         feet from the shanty. Tommy's face 
                         was grim. 
                     
                     
                         "Can- can'they find us in this?" 
                         Dell asked. She knew what the 
                         answer would be. 
                     
                     
                         "They may run onto us," he 
                         shrugged. "Or we may drift ashore. 
                         But it's a thousand to one chance. 
                         Even with planes, they won't find us 
                         to-day." 
                     
                     
                         Martin joined them. 
                     
                     
                         "I'm hungry as the dickens, he 
                         told them. What are we going to 
                         eat? 
                     
                     
                         "I'll bite," Tommy said. "What 
                         are we going to eat?" 
                     
                     
                         Martin went back into the shanty 
                         and rummaged around, but found 
                         nothing. At Tommy's suggestion, 
                         they went to the thick side of their 
                         flow, and drank deep, so that they 
                         would forget their hunger. But they  
                     LS-2E 
                 
             
             
                 
                 Going Primitive 33 
                 
                     
                     
                         dared not drink too much, and the 
                         icy water went down only a few sips 
                         at a time. 
                     
                     
                         After that they walked around to 
                         keep warm. They dared not use 
                         any more of their pitifully small 
                         supply of wood, for fear they might 
                         be there another night, or might get 
                         fish which would need to be cooked. 
                         Martin walked to the edge of the 
                         flow and called into the mist, again 
                         and again. But there was no 
                         answer, so finally he gave it up. 
                         He went back to the shack, then, 
                         and finished the rest of the liquor in 
                         the bottle. When Dell entered the 
                         shack a while later, he was drunk, 
                         and again tried to kiss her. She 
                         eluded him easily, and went outside. 
                     
                     
                         Tommy had rigged lines through 
                         four holes in the ice, but he was 
                         having no luck. The flow had long 
                         since left the shallow water of the 
                         reef, and there were few smelt in 
                         the deeper places. Besides that, his 
                         sinkers weren't heavy enough to cut 
                         down the angle of his lines. The 
                         fog held, and they heard or saw no 
                         one. 
                     
                     
                         Tommy remained cheerful in spite 
                         of everything. He and Dell walked 
                         around to keep warm, but they only 
                         partially succeeded. The fog pressed 
                         in upon them, making everything 
                         weird and unreal. The dampness 
                         of it accentuated the cold, and 
                         chilled them to the very bone. 
                     
                     
                         "Ugh," Tommy said disgustedly, 
                         "it's like walking around in a dish 
                         of oatmeal. You can pretty near 
                         feel it. I'll bet our folks are plenty 
                         worried right now. Especially 
                         yours. Mine never know what fool 
                         thing I'll be doing next." 
                     
                     
                         Several times they heard air- 
                         planes. But they were on the direct 
                         New York-Montreal route, so that 
                         such a circumstance would not have 
                         been strange whether there were 
                         searchers out or not. 
                     
                     LS-3E 
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Martin had produced another 
                         bottle from his pocket, which 
                         Tommy stole during the afternoon, 
                         and threw away. Dell did not begin 
                         to mind the cold or the hunger very 
                         much till nightfall. Then it was 
                         very bad. They sat huddled up in 
                         the shanty, and in spite of Tommy's 
                         studied attempts at cheerfulness, the 
                         time dragged, and there were long 
                         periods of silence. The grim reality 
                         of the situation had taken hold of 
                         them all. 
                     
                     
                         Dell had never been so cold be- 
                         fore in her life. It was a cumulative 
                         cold. It hadn't seemed bad at first, 
                         but there was no relief from it, and 
                         there was no food to make body 
                         heat. She was miserable from the 
                         gnawing hunger which gave her no 
                         rest, and the cold found her 
                         weakened, unable to combat it. 
                         Martin's attitude did not help. 
                         When he talked, he told them over 
                         and over that no help would come, 
                         that they would die out there. He 
                         cried in drunken, maudlin despair. 
                         Dell knew that if there had been no 
                         Tommy to counteract that un- 
                         healthy attitude, she would have 
                         gone mad. As it was, she wanted to 
                         cry, or to laugh recklessly. Some- 
                         times she could hardly keep herself 
                         from doing one or the other. If only 
                         either the hunger or the cold would 
                         let up for just one minute. She kept 
                         dwelling morbidly on that. If it 
                         would only let up for just one 
                         minute, she thought she could go 
                         back to it cheerfully. But it never 
                         did. The hunger grew worse, and 
                         the cold more intense with the 
                         darkness. 
                     
                     
                         For several seconds she was aware 
                         that Tommy was watching her in- 
                         tently. Suddenly he rose and took 
                         her hand. 
                     
                     
                         "Come on," he said. "We're 
                         going to run. You're close to 
                         hysterics." 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 34 Street &amp; Smith's Love Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         Dell knew that she was not close 
                         to hysterics. She hadn't uttered a 
                         sound. She told him so. Only she 
                         seemed to have to shriek to make 
                         herself heard. 
                     
                     
                         "I won't go. I can't go. I can't 
                         move." 
                     
                     
                         He pulled her roughly to her feet, 
                         and half dragged her outside. Then 
                         they ran. At first Dell stumbled 
                         again and again. But gradually, as 
                         the blood began to circulate, she 
                         could run without stumbling. Her 
                         legs grew tired. Her whole body 
                         seemed weak, as if her blood had 
                         turned to water. She began to drag 
                         back, making him pull her. He 
                         warned her twice, then stopped and 
                         slapped her, a stinging blow on the 
                         face. It cleared her head like magic. 
                         For an instant they glared at each 
                         other, and then Tommy dragged her 
                         forward again. In that instant she 
                         hated him. Hated him as she had 
                         never hated Martin, even when he 
                         had been holding her prisoner in the 
                         shanty. 
                     
                     
                         "Either you run," he told her 
                         grimly, "or there'll be more of 
                         those." 
                     
                     
                         Somehow she knew he meant it, 
                         and she ran. But she hated him. 
                     
                     
                         After a long while she began to 
                         beg him to let her stop. The cold in- 
                         side her had abated. It no longer 
                         seemed unbearable. But fatigue had 
                         taken its place. He let her walk 
                         then. But he would not let her stop 
                         altogether. And she was afraid of 
                         him. She had never seen him like 
                         that before. Even in her misery, 
                         she thrilled to his mastery. 
                     
                     
                         After what seemed to Dell like 
                         hours of walking and running, 
                         Tommy stopped at the shanty and 
                         told Martin to come out. Martin 
                         refused, and there was a short fight. 
                         Then Tommy dragged him out, and 
                         mercilessly forced him to walk with 
                         them. After that the grind went on.  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Twice Dell slumped to the ice in a 
                         heap. But each time Tommy 
                         dragged her brutally to her feet and 
                         made her go on. She welcomed each 
                         of Martin's rebellions, because they 
                         gave her a chance to rest. Vaguely 
                         she realized that Tommy was doing 
                         this to save her life, to keep her 
                         from freezing. Yet she did not want 
                         to live. She did not care. Life was 
                         too miserable, too horrible just now, 
                         to be borne. 
                     
                     
                         All night long they traveled up 
                         and down that ice flow. Dell grew 
                         gradually more and more sleepy, 
                         until it seemed as if she could not 
                         hold her eyes open. It seemed in- 
                         credible that she should go to sleep 
                         on her feet, yet several times she 
                         came close to it. Each time, Tommy 
                         shook her awake. 
                     
                     
                         "You can't go to sleep," he 
                         stormed at her. "If you do, you'll 
                         never wake up. Get hold of your- 
                         self, will you? Try to help me." 
                     
                     
                         Dell hated him. She hated him 
                         fiendishly for making her run and 
                         walk, and for keeping her awake. 
                         Once she caught herself thinking 
                         that when they came near the edge 
                         of the flow, it would be easy to 
                         shove him off. Just a tiny push 
                         would do it. He was almost 
                         tottering. 
                     
                     
                         With a little shudder, she realized 
                         that she was thinking about murder. 
                         The disgust she felt for herself, 
                         brought her wide awake for long 
                         minutes. 
                     
                     
                         She lost track of time. In a way 
                         that was blessed. She only knew 
                         that the fog did not lift when it was 
                         light again, and that again it grew 
                         dark. Sometimes they rested, but 
                         always Tommy forced them up 
                         again. Brutally made them get 
                         onto their feet and stumble along. 
                         The hunger was worse. They 
                         stopped often at the edge of the flow 
                         to drink. Dell noticed that now

                      All night long they traveled up and down that ice flow. Several times she came close to going to sleep on her feet.
                            Each time, Tommy shook her awake. "You can't go to sleep. If you do, you'll never wake up."  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Tommy did not go close to the edge 
                         when they were near him. She was 
                         glad he didn't.  
                     
                         While it was still dark, the fog 
                         lifted, and it grew bitter, searing 
                         cold. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "Now's the time for the fire," 
                         Tommy told them.  
                     
                         They cut up the table and the 
                         bunks with the hatchet, and built a 
                         bonfire on the ice. The heat was 
                         blessed, and some one might see the

                         flame. The shoreline was close, all 
                         dark trees and white snow. They 
                         were drifting toward it. Time 
                         seemed to jerk along for Dell. She 
                         was not conscious of dropping off to 
                         sleep. Yet that shore seemed to 
                         leap nearer in huge jerks. The 
                         gentle hump came when she was not 
                         expecting it, and threw her to her 
                         knees. 
                     
                     
                         They ran off the flow and 
                         floundered in the deep snow that 
                         came almost to their waists. There 
                         was no crust in the woods, where 
                         the sun did not seep through. 
                         Ahead of them was a shack, one 
                         side almost buried in snow. Tommy 
                         broke the lock on the door, and they 
                         went inside. There was a stove, an 
                         old keg of nails, and wood piled in 
                         the corner. Lots of wood. In five 
                         minutes they had the stove so hot 
                         that it glowed in the dim light of 
                         breaking day. 
                     
                     
                         Vaguely Dell realized that though 
                         they were warm, they were little 
                         better off than they had been be- 
                         fore. They could not wallow 
                         through that deep snow to find help. 
                         It would have been a physical im- 
                         possibility. Not even Tommy could 
                         do that. 
                     
                     
                         There were mattresses on the 
                         bunks. Martin took one bunk and 
                         Dell the other. The last thing she 
                         realized clearly before she dropped 
                         off into a stupor which was half 
                         sleep and half faint, was that 
                         Tommy had taken the hatchet and 
                         broken up the keg. She couldn't 
                         understand that. There was plenty 
                         of wood in the corner. She saw him 
                         fitting two of the staves to his feet 
                         like rude snow shoes. 
                     
                     
                         Once she came out of her stupor 
                         momentarily, to realize that Martin 
                         was just as he had thrown himself 
                         onto his bunk, but that Tommy was 
                         not there in the shanty. She 
                         dropped off into unconsciousness 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         again without thinking much about 
                         it. 
                     
                     
                         Next there were people, horrible, 
                         grotesque people, and she had hard 
                         work telling which were real, and 
                         which were part of her nightmares. 
                         Again in those dreams Martin was 
                         trying to kiss her, and Tommy was 
                         forcing her to walk on and on. She 
                         hated Tommy. 
                     
                     
                         She woke many times after that, 
                         and always the figures surrounding 
                         her were vague, blurred, as things 
                         had been blurred in the fog. But 
                         one day she woke peacefully, as if 
                         from a long sleep, and everything 
                         was natural. The hospital room, 
                         the tables, the chairs, the bed, all 
                         looked natural. And Tommy, sit- 
                         ting beside the bed, looked perfectly 
                         natural. 
                     
                     
                         "Why hello, Tommy," she said, 
                         and she smiled at him. 
                     
                     
                         He smiled back, but it was a misty 
                         smile, as if he knew a great relief. 
                         She suddenly found that she did not 
                         hate Tommy as she had supposed. 
                         It was something else. 
                     
                     
                         "So there's life in the old girl yet," 
                         he said. "Good old life. Good old 
                         girl." 
                     
                     
                         He talked on, very fast for several 
                         minutes. and then suddenly he 
                         stopped. 
                     
                     
                         "There's no use trying to laugh 
                         my way out of it," he said. "This 
                         thing has me down and pretty near 
                         licked. I've been like a crazy man 
                         for days. I've always loved you, 
                         Dell. But being out there so close 
                         to you, and seeing what a thorough- 
                         bred you were, made me love you 
                         all the more. And instead of being 
                         able to make you love me, I had to 
                         make you hate me. Hate me enough 
                         so maybe you wanted to kill me." 
                     
                     
                         "I thought I hated you," she told 
                         him softly, "but you can't think 
                         straight when you're in anguish. I 
                     
                     
                         -I don't hate you now." 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Going Primitive 37 
                 
                     
                     
                         Still his face was serious, worried. 
                         Couldn't he see that there was noth- 
                         ing to worry about? 
                     
                     
                         "But what about Martin? He 
                         came through it better than you 
                         did, and he'll be after you." 
                     
                     
                         "I found out about Martin," Dell 
                         shrugged. "That -that awfulness 
                         did something for me. When you're 
                         as close to death as that, and fight- 
                         ing to keep breath in your body, 
                         you get back to primitive values. 
                         Money doesn't matter. Nothing 
                         matters but courage and strength. 
                         Martin was a coward and pretty 
                         weak. You saved our lives. You 
                         you were wonderful, Tommy. 
                     
                     
                         "Then you don't love him?" 
                     
                     
                         She shook her head slowly. Then 
                         paused and waited. But still he said 
                         nothing, only watched her with a 
                         worried frown. 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, Tommy, can't you see? 
                         Love is one of the primitive things 
                         that matters. Love matters above 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         money, or anything else. If you 
                         have love, you're happy. If you 
                         don't, you're miserable. I found out 
                         that I loved you. That I've loved 
                         you for ages and have been fighting 
                         against it, and against you because 
                         you wanted to take away my free- 
                         dom. Now I'm not going to fight 
                         any longer, Tommy. I don't want 
                         to be free. I want to be yours. I'll 
                         be happy wherever you are. Come 
                         down here, Tommy, where I can kiss 
                         you and muss up your hair and know 
                         that you're real." 
                     
                     
                         Tommy was silent for a moment, 
                         then bending down he took her in 
                         his arms and crushed her close to 
                         him. 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, darling, I've been so 'fraid 
                         I was going to lose you. 'Fraid that 
                         you wouldn't love me." Suddenly 
                         he stopped talking and his lips found 
                         hers in a kiss that seemed to touch 
                         their very souls and make them one 
                         in that moment of ecstasy.

                         HOLD no shame that her lips, her laughing eyes, 
                         Her tiny feet and gaily colored dress 
                         Calls from your eager heart its deepest sighs, 
                         And melts your greatest frown to gentleness.  
                     
                         Hold no shame her lightest spoken word 
                         Echoes within your heart a grave command, 
                         Nor that her tender murmurs, half unheard, 
                         Come like a sweet rain to a parching land. 
                     
                     
                         Love needs no alibi, no masquerade, 
                         No hidden trysts, no secret sacrament; 
                         Love is too powerful to walk afraid 
                         Of all oppression seeking its descent.  
                     
                         Hold Love's hand beneath the brightest sun 
                         And laugh with her-nor hide from any one!

                         CHAPTER III. 
                     
                     
                         I NEVER quite 
                         knew how long I 
                         spent swimming 
                         and splashing in 
                         the sunny, tree-bor- 
                         dered pool. To my 
                         tense nerves, it 
                         seemed hours while I kept my eyes 
                         strained in the direction of the 
                         campus sloping up to Hillcrest 
                         Manor, teeth chattering in cold 
                         panic lest some of the school au- 
                         thorities would appear before I 
                         could manage to get away.  
                     
                         But it couldn't have been more 
                         than a few minutes before the  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         cameraman called 
                         out through the 
                         trees that he was 
                         finished. 
                     
                     
                         Trembling with 
                         relief, I ducked un- 
                         der the shadowy 
                         water at the far end 
                         of the pool just as 
                         he emerged once more onto the lit- 
                         tle beach. 
                     
                     
                         "Good work, sister! Here's your 
                         money, one hundred bucks." Jaunt- 
                         ily he counted out the bills, then 
                         stooped and laid them on the sand, 
                         weighting them down with a stone. 
                     
                     
                         "Say, we've got a car here. Want 
                         a lift anywhere?" he drawled, his  
                 
             
             
                 
                 Reckless Bride 39 
                 
                     
                     
                         eyes a little too friendly. Some- 
                         thing in their expression made my 
                         heart knock with sharp apprehen- 
                         sion. 
                     
                     
                         I hardened my face. "No, thank 
                         you." I shook my head so definitely 
                         that he shrugged, grinned knowingly 
                         and started back through the woods. 
                     
                     
                         I was frantic for them to be off. 
                         Shivering with chill and nervous- 
                         ness, I waited under the water until 
                         I heard their voices retreating 
                         through the trees, mingling pres- 
                         ently with the roar of a motor that 
                         soon died away in the distance. 
                     
                     
                         Like a flash, I was out of the pool, 
                         scrambling up the big rock where I 
                         had left my clothes. My hands were 
                         like ice after being in the cold water 
                         so long, but I managed to dress 
                         faster than I ever had in my life be- 
                         fore. 
                     
                     
                         My spirits rose like a bird as I 
                         snatched up the money from the 
                         sand and stuffed it down the neck 
                         of my sweater. How glad I was that 
                         I'd had the courage to earn it! Now, 
                         nothing could keep me from reach- 
                         ing Don before he sailed. 
                     
                     
                         Breathlessly, I began picking my 
                         way through the woods and soon 
                         found the tracks made by the movie 
                         people's car. Why on earth had I 
                         been so childishly self-conscious as 
                         to refuse a lift into the village? I 
                         wondered, running as fast as I could 
                         along the bumpy trail. But it was 
                         better that I had. I didn't dare 
                         leave any traces behind that could 
                         easily be followed! Once Miss Hill 
                         discovered my escape, she would 
                         lose no time in notifying Oliver. 
                     
                     
                         What he would do if he caught 
                         me this time, I didn't dare to think. 
                         All I knew was I had to get to Don 
                         before I could be traced there. 
                         Then, somehow, we could manage 
                         to outwit Oliver so he couldn't make 
                         trouble for Don. How, I didn't at- 
                         tempt to fathom out now. I was  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         straining every ounce of energy on 
                         getting completely away from Hill- 
                         crest before I could be overtaken. 
                     
                     
                         The thick underbrush soon tore 
                         off my béret and I stuffed it in the 
                         pocket of my tweed jacket. Twice 
                         I turned my ankle on the rough 
                         ground as I ran, but I kept on, ig- 
                         noring the pain. Would I never 
                         reach the road? It seemed hours 
                         before I finally emerged from the 
                         last strip of woods and climbed over 
                         a stone fence onto the highway. 
                         Here it was smoother going. I tore 
                         down the steep road, my ears 
                         strained for the sound of a car pur- 
                         suing me. 
                     
                     
                         The road curved sharply and as I 
                         stumbled along, hopelessly con- 
                         fused, I saw a quarter of a mile 
                         ahead crossroads bristling with sign- 
                         posts. Could I ever make it? My 
                         breath was burning my throat like 
                         fire. My heart was a sharp knife 
                         in my side. But, doggedly, my feet 
                         kept pounding on, driven by the 
                         desperate need of reaching the vil- 
                         lage where I could get a train to 
                         New York. Or, better, still, there 
                         might be an airport near enough so 
                         I could get a plane. That blessed 
                         money! I could feel the wad of it 
                         pressing the flesh under my sweater 
                         like a soothing hand of encouraging 
                         help. 
                     
                     
                         As I reached the crossing at last, 
                         gasping, breathless, it seemed there 
                         was something strangely familiar 
                         about the place. And no wonder! 
                         A glance at the nearest sign told me 
                         I had stumbled onto the State high- 
                         way. This was the same route Don 
                         and I had come the night we had 
                         eloped from Betty's! We had 
                         passed by this very spot, little 
                         dreaming how soon we were to be 
                         torn from each other's arms. 
                     
                     
                         The agony of that night surged 
                         over me in a black tide. A sob 
                         ached in my throat. I couldn't see

                         the signs across the road for the hot 
                         tears stinging my eyes. But only 
                         for a moment. There was no time 
                         for futile regret now. 
                     
                     
                         Blinking away the tears, I ran 
                         across the broad highway. Then, 
                         as I began searching the signs, I 
                         heard something that made my 
                         heart jump into my throat. Down 
                         the road a high-powered car was 
                         zooming toward me. 
                     
                     
                         Instantly, my brain flamed with 
                         alarm. It might be the police! Per- 
                         haps Miss Hill had already set them 
                         on my trail! Quick as lightning, I 
                         darted down the bank and hid in a 
                         clump of bushes, so thick that I 
                         couldn't see the road as I crouched 
                         there, cold with panic, praying des- 
                         perately that the car would pass on. 
                     
                     
                         But it didn't pass. With a 
                         screech of brakes that froze my 
                         blood sickeningly, it ground to a 
                         stop in the very spot where I had 
                         stood a moment before. Heavy feet 
                         leaped to the asphalt, bounded down 
                         the bank, came crashing through 
                         the bushes. 
                     
                     
                         Panting with stark terror, I fled 
                         through the brush like a wild, hunted 
                         animal. But it was no use. I was 
                         half paralyzed with fatigue and 
                         fear. A hand reached out and 
                         caught my arm in a firm grip. 
                     
                     
                         Sobbing stormily, I tried to fight 
                         free. But I was whirled helplessly 
                         about to face the dazzling sunlight. 
                     
                     
                         Then, suddenly, I wondered if I 
                         had lost my mind. 
                     
                     
                         "Lynore!" It was a sharp breath, 
                         harsh with unbelief. 
                     
                     
                         My heart stopped beating. 
                         Blinking against the blinding glare 
                         I stared up incredulously at the tall 
                         form towering over me while the 
                         world stood still. My senses reeled 
                         dizzily. Oh, it couldn't be Don! 
                     
                     
                         With a hoarse groan he stooped 
                         and engulfed me in his arms. 
                         Hungry, trembling arms that  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         strained me tight in an agony of 
                         relief. 
                     
                     
                         "Don!" I couldn't believe it. In 
                         another minute I'd wake up and find 
                         it was just a dream. With a sob, I 
                         put up my hand, half fearfully, to 
                         touch his face, and felt my heart 
                         leap wildly. No, it wasn't a dream! 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, Don!" Hysterically laugh- 
                         ing and crying at the same time, I 
                         crumpled against him, clinging to 
                         him while wave after wave of de- 
                         lirious joy surged over me. 
                     
                     
                         For an endless moment we clung 
                         together, not able to speak, not ask- 
                         ing the reason for this unbelievable 
                         miracle, knowing only that some- 
                         how our arms were where they be- 
                         longed at last, each crushing the 
                         other heart to heart, lips mated 
                         again in starved breathless kisses, 
                         while the long weeks of cruel loneli- 
                         ness faded away. 
                     
                     
                         "Darling!" Don's hand trembled 
                         over my hair, my eyelids, my 
                         throat, as though to convince him- 
                         self that I was real. He drew back 
                         a little, his eyes searching mine. 
                     
                     
                         "Where on earth have you been?" 
                         he demanded passionately. 
                     
                     
                         His face bending over mine was 
                         so haggard and drawn that my heart 
                         contracted seeing how terribly he, 
                         too, had suffered. 
                     
                     
                         Unsteadily, I pointed back up the 
                         road where I had come, telling him 
                         about Hillcrest Manor and explain- 
                         ing that I hadn't dared to let him 
                         know where I was for fear Oliver 
                         would carry out his threat to ruin 
                         his career if we tried to see each 
                         other. 
                     
                     
                         "There was nothing I could do but 
                         wait for my birthday. But when I 
                         saw in the paper that you were or- 
                         dered to sail, I couldn't wait! So 
                         to-day I -I ran away from school," 
                         I faltered, my cheeks tingling 
                         guiltily. "I was trying to find some 
                         way to get to New York when you 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Reckless Bride 41 
                 
                     
                     
                         came along. Oh, Don, how did you 
                         ever happen to find me?" I stared 
                         up at him breathlessly. 
                     
                     
                         He laughed grimly. "I was hunt- 
                         ing you, darling. I've been doing 
                         little else the last three weeks. I 
                         was in torture, not knowing what 
                         Oliver had done with you, but I 
                         couldn't find the least trace of you. 
                         I've been back to the inn at least 
                         twenty times but the manager swore 
                         he hadn't seen either of you since 
                         you left that night. The last few 
                         days I've had to be in Washington 
                         getting final instructions before sail- 
                         ing, and I just got back this morn- 
                         ing. I stopped at home long enough 
                         to learn if there had been any word 
                         from you, then I'drove up here 
                         again. I was determined to find you 
                         before I sailed. I went to the inn 
                         once again, but I got the same an- 
                         swer as before. I knew Betty 
                         Long's camp was closed, but I 
                         wasn't leaving any stone unturned 
                         to find you. I was on my way there 
                         when I saw you run across the road. 
                         I couldn't believe it was you, but I 
                         had to make sure. I'm sorry if I 
                         scared you half to death, dear!" He 
                         strained me convulsively against 
                         him, pressing his lips tenderly over 
                         my face. 
                     
                     
                         "I thought you were the police," 
                         I murmured, shuddering. 
                     
                     
                         He gave a start, his mouth tight- 
                         ening. "Say, that's right! There's 
                         no telling how soon they'll be after 
                         you. But this time they re not go- 
                         ing to find you!" There was a ring 
                         of triumph in his deep voice as he 
                         picked me up in his arms and strode 
                         through the bushes and up the bank. 
                     
                     
                         His big roadster was standing in 
                         the road, and the familiar sight of it 
                         was a quick thrill. Nothing could 
                         overtake us now! My blood sang in 
                         my veins as he lifted me in, then 
                         quickly leaped in beside me. With 
                         a quick twist of his strong brown  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         hands on the wheel, he whirled the 
                         car around and sent it speeding 
                         down the pike the way he had come. 
                     
                     
                         With a sigh of content I lay back 
                         in the deep seat, limp, half be- 
                         wildered with the wonderful reality 
                         of his nearness after the terrific anx- 
                         iety of trying to reach him. Yet in- 
                         side I was still tense with apprehen- 
                         sion that lay like a cold shadow on 
                         my heart. Suppose I would only be 
                         the means of bringing him trouble 
                         that would ruin his career! 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, Don, where can you hide me 
                         so Oliver won't find me?" I asked 
                         breathlessly against the stiff breeze 
                         of our rushing. 
                     
                     
                         "That's something I'll have to fig- 
                         ure out by the time we reach New 
                         York," he said thoughtfully. "But 
                         don't you worry about that, dear. 
                         You just leave everything to your 
                         husband." 
                     
                     
                         With a confident little laugh, he 
                         cuddled me close against him with 
                         one warm arm so that I couldn't see 
                         anything but the wall of his big 
                         shoulders and the profile of his face 
                         above the wheel. A thrill of hot, 
                         uprushing joy swept everything else 
                         from my mind. 
                     
                     
                         It was just as it had been the night 
                         of our elopement. Only now, every- 
                         thing, every moment was more 
                         precious for the weeks of separation 
                         that had gone between. The com- 
                         plete wonder of our love would only 
                         be the more poignant, the more 
                         overwhelmingly sweet for the 
                         anguish of our waiting. 
                     
                     
                         Dusk had deepened into night be- 
                         fore we finally reached New York. 
                         As we drove through the brightly 
                         lighted streets, my heart was beating 
                         a wild tattoo of mounting excite- 
                         ment. Yet each time we had to 
                         stop for traffic I went weak with ter- 
                         ror. Every pedestrian that glanced 
                         at us in casual interest, every face

                      "There's no telling how soon they'll be after you. But this time they're not going to find you!" There was a ring of
                            triumph in his deep voice as he picked me up in his arms and strode to his car.  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         in the cars abreast of ours seemed to 
                         be the face of Oliver. I clung, tense 
                         and nervous, to Don's arm and slid 
                         lower in the seat, keeping my head 
                         bent down until at last we turned in 
                         at a public garage. 
                     
                     
                         It was one where he wasn't 
                         known, he explained as we left the 
                         roadster there and transferred to a 
                         taxi. As we swung around a corner 
                         and sped uptown, I suddenly real- 
                         ized what address Don had given 
                         the driver. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         I stared at him, surprised. "But 
                         that's your apartment, isn't it?" 
                     
                     
                         He shook his head. "Not quite. 
                         It's a couple of blocks above. You 
                         don't mind walking back that little 
                         distance, do you, dear? We'll run 
                         less chance of being seen." 
                     
                     
                         "But, Don, it's dangerous for us 
                         to go there!" I panted, wanting to 
                         go there more than anywhere on 
                         earth. "It's the very first place 
                         Oliver will go to look for us." 
                     
                     
                         Don laughed, and covered my

                         hand in a close warm clasp. "When 
                         he does, he'll be informed at the of- 
                         fice that the place is vacant, which is 
                         true. We've sublet it furnished for 
                         the rest of the lease. The new ten- 
                         ant is coming to-morrow or the 
                         next day. When I left this morn- 
                         ing I didn't expect to be back, and 
                         mother was getting ready to leave. 
                         She's going to live with some friends 
                         in Westchester while I'm abroad. 
                         So the coast is clear. It will be the 
                         safest place we could possibly stay 
                         for to-night, at least." 
                     
                     
                         I stared at him breathlessly. 
                         "But how can we get in without be- 
                         ing seen?" 
                     
                     
                         "We can go around by the service 
                         entrance. The janitor's a good 
                         scout. He'll take us up in the serv- 
                         ice elevator and forget about it. It's 
                         not exactly the way I had planned 
                         to bring home my bride, but it's bet- 
                         ter than running the chance of be- 
                         ing separated again, isn't it, sweet- 
                         heart?" In the dusk of the speed- 
                         ing taxi his gaze held a light of love 
                         and longing that made my heart 
                         pound madly. 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, Don yes!" I whispered 
                         tremulously as the cab swung to 
                         the curb and stopped. 
                     
                     
                         Luck seemed to be with us. The 
                         street was deserted when we got out 
                         and walked the short distance to 
                         the rear of the apartment house. 
                         And a few cautious moments later, 
                         we found the hall to his suite empty 
                         as he unlocked the door. Even in 
                         our tense haste to get in before any 
                         one happened along, he picked me 
                         up in his arms and carried me over 
                         the threshold. 
                     
                     
                         "For good luck!" he said with an 
                         unsteady little laugh when we were 
                         safely inside. 
                     
                     
                         Without turning on the lights he 
                         carried me through the foyer into 
                         the big living room beyond, his foot- 
                         steps on the thick rugs scarcely dis-  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         turbing the silence. I could feel his 
                         heart pounding hard against mine 
                         as he made his way through the 
                         quiet shadows, and I sensed that he 
                         was thrilling to the same riot of 
                         emotions that were taking away my 
                         breath. 
                     
                     
                         The soft darkness was broken 
                         faintly by pale moonlight filtering 
                         through the closed Venetian blinds, 
                         lying in silver strips on the floor and 
                         touching the objects about the room 
                         into vague, opalescent shapes. The 
                         very atmosphere bathed us in peace, 
                         melting away the nervous tension 
                         that had tormented us through the 
                         past hours. 
                     
                     
                         With a happy sigh, I closed my 
                         eyes as Don sank down into a deep 
                         divan, still holding me in his arms. 
                     
                     
                         "Darling -home, at last!" He 
                         strained me close until our two 
                         hearts were thudding as one, until I 
                         was half gasping with the sheer joy 
                         of our surrender to love. 
                     
                     
                         His lips, hot and demanding, 
                         buried themselves in my throat, 
                         throbbed over my face, tingled on 
                         my eyelids until I looked up at him 
                         in breathless wonder, almost faint- 
                         ing with sheer, swooning happiness. 
                         Oh, I loved him so much! 
                     
                     
                         His arms were tightening with pas- 
                         sionate eagerness, his eyes shone 
                         with tender light, his voice was 
                         whispering his love with each quick, 
                         unsteady breath. 
                     
                     
                         Trembling, I raised my lips parted 
                         in breathless, quivering surrender to 
                         his. Ecstasy, like liquid fire, raced 
                         over me as I felt the stabbing sweet- 
                         ness of my husband's kisses. 
                     
                     
                         His eyes were drowning me with 
                         love as he bent over me. 
                     
                     
                         Suddenly, I felt him stiffen. Look- 
                         ing up, I saw he was staring in- 
                         tently over my head. Then, as I 
                         turned quickly, instantly on the 
                         alert, I heard the sound that had 
                         startied him. From an adjoining

                         bedroom came the distinct tread of 
                         footsteps. 
                     
                     
                         My heart stopped in a frenzy of 
                         terror. Quick as a flash, Don was 
                         on his feet, his breath hot with 
                         alarm as he picked me up from the 
                         divan. 
                     
                     
                         But before he could take a step, 
                         there was the sharp click of a door 
                         opening. An oblong of yellow light 
                         shot across the floor, obliterated in- 
                         stantly as the lights were snapped 
                         on in the living room and we found 
                         ourselves confronted not by Oliver, 
                         nor an officer as I dreaded, but by 
                         the tall, slender figure of a white- 
                         haired woman as startled as we. 
                     
                     
                         Don was the first to recover his 
                         breath. 
                     
                     
                         "Why, mother!" His laugh was 
                         shaky with relief. "I thought you 
                         had gone hours ago!" 
                     
                     
                         There was a moment of uncom- 
                         fortable silence. Then: 
                     
                     
                         "I was detained unexpectedly," 
                         came the low reply. 
                     
                     
                         The eyes regarding us were clear 
                         blue like Don's, but grave, unsmil- 
                         ing as they took us in with one 
                         level, understanding glance. 
                     
                     
                         My cheeks flamed hotly. Con- 
                         fusedly, I put up my hand to my 
                         tangled hair. 
                     
                     
                         But Don was drawing me forward 
                         eagerly, his arm tight about me. 
                     
                     
                         "Mother, this is Lynore my 
                         wife." There was a ring of triumph 
                         in his deep warm voice, and he 
                         glanced down at me, his soul in his 
                         eyes. 
                     
                     
                         The figure in the doorway seemed 
                         to hesitate a moment before she 
                         came slowly across the room and 
                         took my trembling hands in smooth, 
                         firm fingers. 
                     
                     
                         With a quick, eager smile I looked 
                         up at her, and suddenly sobered. 
                         For there was no answering smile on 
                         her handsome, aristocratic face. 
                         Only a stern gravity that sent an  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         odd chill of foreboding over me. 
                         Why I felt like that, I didn't know. 
                         Nothing in the world mattered, now 
                         that I was safe with Don. All I 
                         could fathom was that it had prob- 
                         ably come as an unpleasant shock 
                         to his mother to find him so unex- 
                         pectedly with a strange girl in his 
                         arms, and I tried not to blame her 
                         for being a little angry. 
                     
                     
                         Yet I couldn't shake off this un- 
                         reasoning panic. I stepped closer 
                         to Don, still staring wistfully at his 
                         mother. And then I realized, sur- 
                         prisingly, that she was not angry. 
                         It was, instead, anxiety that drew 
                         her fine features so sharply. Her 
                         sweet eyes were deeply troubled as 
                         she looked at us. 
                     
                     
                         "No, Don," she said tremulously, 
                         "she is not your wife." 
                     
                     
                         I stopped breathing. I just stood 
                         there staring at her, braced for what 
                         was coming next. 
                     
                     
                         Don's face went sober. His hand 
                         tightened on my arm. "I don't un- 
                         derstand you, mother," he said 
                         evenly. "I told you all about our 
                         elopement. You knew I went away 
                         this morning determined to find 
                         Lynore and-" 
                     
                     
                         "Yes," his mother interrupted un- 
                         steadily. "And you had been gone 
                         only a few minutes before a man 
                         called to see you on a matter he 
                         said was very important. When I 
                         explained that you had gone, he left 
                         this with me and insisted I give it 
                         to you as soon as possible." She 
                         had moved over to a secretary-desk 
                         in the corner, taking a long, stiff en- 
                         velope from the drawer and hand- 
                         ing it to Don. "I didn't know how 
                         to reach you quickly, so I decided to 
                         wait here in the hope that you might 
                         change your plans and return after 
                         all. The man was a special mes- 
                         senger. He said this was a court 
                         notice that your marriage has been 
                         annulled." 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Reckless Bride 45 
                 
                      Her eyes were deeply troubled as she looked at us. "No, Don," she said tremulously, "she is not your wife. Your
                            marriage has been annulled."  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "Annulled!" Don stared at the 
                         envelope, his face whitening. He 
                         turned his stricken eyes on me. "So 
                         that's what Oliver has been up to, 
                         keeping you penned up in that 
                         boarding school! Why didn't we 
                         guess?" 
                     
                     
                         I tried to speak, but no words 
                         came. My throat was dry and 
                         parched. It felt choked, constricted 
                         as though a tight band was slowly  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         smothering out my breath. The 
                         room blurred and swayed as every- 
                         thing went a little black before my 
                         eyes. 
                     
                     
                         Don tore open the envelope sav- 
                         agely, drew out the legal document. 
                         He held it so I could read it, his 
                         arms trembling about my shoulders. 
                     
                     
                         But I couldn't see for the hot, 
                         blinding tears scalding my eyes. All 
                         I knew was that Oliver had sepa-

                         rated us again, this time com- 
                         pletely. My heart dragged with the 
                         sickening futility of it all. I hid my 
                         face against Don, my body shud- 
                         dering helplessly with bitter, hope- 
                         less sobs. 
                     
                     
                         "Darling! don't!" Don implored, 
                         holding me tenderly and trying des- 
                         perately to soothe my grief. "Do 
                         you think for one second I'd let this 
                         annulment stop us? We'll get 
                         around that! Look at me, dear!" 
                         Gently he lifted my wet face to 
                         meet his eyes, and my heart lifted at 
                         the grim, undaunted look on his 
                         face. "We'll find some other place 
                         to keep you hidden until Saturday. 
                         Then we'll manage to get you on the 
                         boat somehow in time to sail. Your 
                         birthday comes next Thursday, 
                         while we'll be at sea. We'll simply 
                         have the captain marry us then, 
                         and Oliver won't be able to do a 
                         thing about it! And that will make 
                         everything all right again." 
                     
                     
                         Breathlessly I gazed up at him 
                         through my tears, my heart bound- 
                         ing upward again. 
                     
                     
                         But before I could speak, his 
                         mother laid her hand on his arm. 
                     
                     
                         "No, Don, you can't attempt any- 
                         thing like that," she insisted. "If 
                         Lynore's guardian is so opposed to 
                         the marriage, he would be sure to 
                         turn the whole thing into a scandal 
                         that would ruin your career in the 
                         consular service." 
                     
                     
                         I could feel Don stiffen. He drew 
                         a long breath and stood very 
                         straight. His mouth was a grim, 
                         tight line. 
                     
                     
                         "Then I'll give up my career! I'll 
                         quit the service before I begin!" he 
                         muttered dully. "I'll get a job do- 
                         ing anything before I give up Lynore 
                         like that. I refuse to sail without 
                         her. We're not going to be sepa- 
                         rated ever again. I mean it!" The 
                         out-thrust line of his jaw clutched 
                         at my heart, thrilled me insanely. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Close in his big arms, I felt a pang 
                         of pity for his mother. 
                     
                     
                         Her face had gone white as death. 
                         She put out her hand and tottered 
                         against a chair like an old woman. 
                     
                     
                         "Don!" she cried, so shrilly that 
                         my blood chilled again. "What are 
                         you saying? You can't mean you'd 
                         give up your whole life's ideals like 
                         that! Not after all we've gone 
                         through to get you where you are! 
                         It's been cruelly hard in all the long 
                         years since your father died, but 
                         I've gladly sacrificed every cent to 
                         educate you, was proud for any suf- 
                         fering I had to endure. Now, just 
                         when you've attained your ambition, 
                         I'deserve something more than this! 
                         You can't give up!" 
                     
                     
                         I could feel the color leave my 
                         face as I stared from her to Don, 
                         my heart hammering painfully. 
                     
                     
                         "Your mother's right, Don," I 
                         gasped. "You can't quit. There 
                         must be some other way for us. 
                         Even if you must sail at once, I can 
                         follow you-" 
                     
                     
                         "No, listen!" he interrupted sud- 
                         denly, his eyes glowing again. Blue 
                         and deep and sure. "I have it!"  
                     
                         Wonderingly, I stared at him as 
                         he drew me over to where his 
                         mother stood. His laugh was full of 
                         confidence as he put his arms around 
                         us both. "Mother, you take Lynore 
                         up to Westchester with you to-night. 
                         Oliver will have no way of tracing 
                         her there. After I drive you both 
                         out, I'll run down to Washington 
                         and spend to-morrow trying to ar- 
                         range things to suit us. Under the 
                         circumstances, I'm sure they'll give 
                         me permission to postpone my sail- 
                         ing date till Thursday. Then we 
                         can be married quietly that morning 
                         before the boat sails!" He kissed us 
                         both breathlessly, laughing his con- 
                         fident little laugh until my own ach- 
                         ing disappointment was soothed a 
                         little and I forced my spirits to meet 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Reckless Bride 47 
                 
                     
                     
                         the situation as gallantly as he was 
                         doing. 
                     
                     
                         It seemed a perfect solution. 
                         Even Don's mother was satisfied. 
                         Now that she saw our love need not 
                         be denied without endangering 
                         Don's future, she entered into the 
                         plan enthusiastically. Even in our 
                         anxious haste to leave the apart- 
                         ment quickly before Oliver could in- 
                         terfere again, she took time to hunt 
                         through her bags to get me a warm 
                         coat for the ride up to Westchester. 
                     
                     
                         Long before we reached the lovely 
                         country home of Mr. and Mrs. Eng- 
                         lish where we were to stay, I knew 
                         I was going to love her as my own 
                         mother, whom I couldn't remember. 
                         And I knew, too, that she was going 
                         to take me to her heart as a daugh- 
                         ter. For when she introduced me to 
                         our elderly host and hostess, who 
                         welcomed me with a gracious hospi- 
                         tality that made me almost happy, 
                         she put her gentle arm around me 
                         and said, with a courageous little 
                         laugh: 
                     
                     
                         "I've almost forgiven Lynore for 
                         taking Don away from me. It 
                         makes it a little easier since I'm to 
                         have the fun of their wedding." 
                     
                     
                         I was glad we had arranged things 
                         without breaking her heart. Don 
                         and I left her talking over hasty 
                         plans with her host and hostess who 
                         were tremendously thrilled at the 
                         prospects. We slipped out to the 
                         vestibule a moment before he left. 
                     
                     
                         Then an agony of loneliness 
                         swept over me like a black tide. As 
                         he took me in his arms and kissed 
                         me good-by, I thought I couldn't 
                         stand it. It was like tearing the 
                         heart out of my body to have him 
                         leave me again. What if he 
                         couldn't postpone his sailing and 
                         would have to go without me? Or 
                         what if Oliver would trace me in 
                         spite of our caution! I couldn't 
                         shake off this sense of impending  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         fate. I clung to him frantically, 
                         shivering in his warm arms. 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, Don, it seems we re doomed 
                         to be separated!" I gasped. "If 
                         anything happens this time, I'll 
                         die." 
                     
                     
                         He held me close. "We aren't go- 
                         ing to let anything happen, this 
                         time, darling," he whispered against 
                         my lips. "Isn't it wonderful the way 
                         there's an answer to everything if 
                         you hunt long enough? It's all 
                         turned out so much better than we 
                         thought, even better than eloping!" 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, how can you say that?" I 
                         panted, staring up at him. 
                     
                     
                         He held my face between his 
                         hands. His blue eyes gazing deep 
                         in mine were glowing with utter 
                         worship. "Because you're too won- 
                         derful for any makeshift marriage, 
                         Lynore." His voice was low, rev- 
                         erent almost. His arms cradled me 
                         as though I were infinitely precious. 
                     
                     
                         "My darling, you're the ideal of 
                         every dream I've ever had. I love 
                         you so much that I'm willing to wait 
                         for a wedding that's worthy of you, 
                         then there won't be the least chance 
                         of any stigma to threaten our hap- 
                         piness. Because, dear, our mar- 
                         riage is going to be paradise." 
                     
                     
                         He kissed me until we both were 
                         breathless. Then, with a husky 
                         little laugh, he was gone. 
                     
                     
                         CHAPTER IV. 
                     
                     
                         The days that followed were 
                         crowded with bewildering, exciting 
                         happiness. At times I even forgot 
                         the shadow of danger that hovered 
                         over me, threatening constantly to 
                         shatter our expectations. 
                     
                     
                         Don was with me every possible 
                         moment. He had succeeded in ob- 
                         taining official permission to post- 
                         pone his sailing date until Thurs- 
                         day, and he was staying secretly 
                         with Jimmie Rand, one of his col-

                         lege friends who owned an estate 
                         across the road from the English 
                         house. 
                     
                     
                         We had to use the utmost cau- 
                         tion, for we knew that Oliver had 
                         detectives trying to find me. Twice, 
                         they had even come to the house, 
                         asking for me. But Mr. English 
                         had ordered the servants to keep 
                         my presence an absolute secret. I 
                         didn't dare to step outside day or 
                         night, but there were plenty of se- 
                         cluded corners in the big house 
                         where Don and I could spend hours 
                         alone. 
                     
                     
                         Hours filled with heart-hungry 
                         kisses. Hours that were dangerously 
                         sweet with clamorous, yearning im- 
                         patience for the day when nothing 
                         on earth could keep us apart. 
                         Would Thursday never come? 
                         Every minute we were simply exist- 
                         ing for the time to pass until I was 
                         legally free from Oliver's power to 
                         take me away from Don. Our 
                         nerves were tense, constantly on 
                         edge with anxiety that the torment 
                         of our waiting would not be futile. 
                     
                     
                         Not that I hadn't plenty to do to 
                         help speed the days. It was taking 
                         all my ingenuity to get together 
                         some sort of a trousseau without be- 
                         ing able to leave the house to shop, 
                         even if I had had enough money. 
                         Of course, Don insisted on furnish- 
                         ing everything I wanted, but I hated 
                         to let him buy my clothes before I 
                         was his wife. Anyway, I still had 
                         the hundred dollars I had earned in 
                         my mad attempt to get expelled 
                         from school and get to him. 
                     
                     
                         My cheeks burned every time I 
                         thought of that afternoon in the 
                         mountain pool, but I refused to let 
                         it bother me. It would have been 
                         foolish to tell Don about it. What 
                         was the use for me to step down, 
                         even for a moment, from the high 
                         pedestal where his ideals had placed 
                         me? The incident would never have  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         occurred if I hadn't been placed in 
                         such desperate circumstances, which 
                         were entirely beyond my control, ex- 
                         cept to escape the best way I could. 
                         I told myself that every girl has 
                         things in her life that are unneces- 
                         sary to tell her husband. And so I 
                         had simply explained to Don that I 
                         had run away from Hillcrest during 
                         a hiking trip. The details were 
                         nothing but a memory to be forgot- 
                         ten, a secret no one would ever 
                         know. 
                     
                     
                         Nevertheless, I was thankful for 
                         the money, glad I hadn't had to 
                         spend any of it except a few dollars 
                         for a couple of cheap dresses to sup- 
                         plement the tweed suit I had worn 
                         from school. There was enough left 
                         to provide an astonishing amount of 
                         things at bargain prices which Don's 
                         mother managed to find for me on a 
                         couple of shopping trips to New 
                         York. There were two unbelievably 
                         cheap dinner dresses that looked all 
                         right at night, one of shiny black 
                         satin, smartly enough cut to be ex- 
                         cellent for dining in public aboard 
                         ship, the other of white chiffon that 
                         made me feel and look like a bride. 
                         My traveling ensemble was of deep- 
                         green wool that made my skin lus- 
                         trous white by contrast, and turned 
                         my hair to vivid gold under the 
                         small felt hat fashioned like a baby's 
                         bonnet. 
                     
                     
                         This was to be my wedding attire, 
                         since we were going straight to the 
                         boat after the ceremony which, 
                         owing to the necessary secrecy of 
                         our plans, was to be performed in 
                         the presence of only the immediate 
                         household and a few close friends. 
                         Nevertheless, Don's mother and 
                         Mr. and Mrs. English were making 
                         as elaborate preparations as possible 
                         under the circumstances. And Jim- 
                         mie Rand had quietly made arrange- 
                         ments for a smoker in Don's honor 
                         on Wednesday night.

                         I knew nothing about it 
                         until Don told me Wed- 
                         nesday afternoon.  
                     
                         I was in the big living 
                         room, busy helping one of 
                         the maids decorate an im- 
                         provised altar with ropes 
                         of smilax which Mrs. 
                         English had insisted on 
                         providing. The afternoon 
                         was unusually warm, and 
                         I had just opened the 
                         French window onto the 
                         terrace when I saw Don 
                         coming across the road 
                         from Jimmie's. The min- 
                         ute he stepped in through 
                         the open window where I 
                         stood waiting for him, I 
                         could tell he was fuming 
                         about something, after the 
                         maid had left us alone. 
                     
                     
                         "I hadn't any idea 
                         there was going to be a 
                         smoker," he complained, 
                         "until Jimmie called up from town 
                         a moment ago and told me to watch 
                     
                 
                 
                      I've got something that'll interest you. A film that was taken in a pool in the woods. It's pretty hot stuff. I
                            thought you wouldn't want your boy friend to see it, considering all the whoopee be-tween you and the guy in the
                            picture.  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         for the fellow he's sending out to 
                         furnish the entertainment. I did my

                         best to call it off, but Jimmie in- 
                         formed me that everything's set. A 
                         lot of our fraternity brothers are 
                         coming out from Philadelphia and 
                         New York, and several of the men 
                         in the State Department are com- 
                         ing up from Washington. So there's 
                         no possible way I can get out of go- 
                         ing, since I'm the guest of honor. 
                         Do you mind very much, dear?" he 
                         asked anxiously. 
                     
                     
                         "Of course I'll mind," I laughed 
                         ruefully. "But as long as it can't be 
                         helped, I'll go to bed early and get 
                         a beauty sleep." 
                     
                     
                         "As though you needed it!" He 
                         caught me close in his arms. "You'll 
                         be the most beautiful little bride a 
                         man ever had, darling! He buried 
                         his face in my hair, my throat, kiss- 
                         ing me as though he could never 
                         kiss me enough. 
                     
                     
                         Suddenly, just behind us, there 
                         was a step on the terrace. Startled, 
                         we drew apart in confusion. Then, 
                         with a gasp, I realized we had been 
                         off our guard just once too often. 
                         For a strange man was outside the 
                         window, a swarthy, beetle-browed 
                         individual who stood watching us 
                         curiously. How long he had been 
                         there I didn't know. I darted back 
                         of the curtain, trembling in terror 
                         as Don whirled on him. 
                     
                     
                         "Well, what do you want?" he de- 
                         manded shortly. "Why don't you 
                         go to the front door and ring the 
                         bell?" 
                     
                     
                         The man shrugged. "What's the 
                         use of bothering? I heard your 
                         voices and I came around to see if 
                         this is Mr. Rand's place. I'm fur- 
                         nishing the entertainment for a 
                         smoker he's giving to-night." 
                     
                     
                         "It's across the road," Don said 
                         briefly. "You go on over. I'll fol- 
                         low you in a minute." 
                     
                     
                         With a mumbled "Thanks," the 
                         stranger went down the steps and 
                         across the lawns. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Don turned to me and pulled me 
                         from my hiding place. "Why, 
                         you're trembling like a leaf, dear!" 
                         he said anxiously. 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, that man saw me!" I panted 
                         nervously. "I'm afraid he's a de- 
                         tective from Oliver!" 
                     
                     
                         Don shook his head. "No, he's 
                         exactly what he said. I've seen him 
                         before at smokers, and I don't par- 
                         ticularly like the type of entertain- 
                         ment he supplies, either. But it's 
                         Jimmie's party, so I have nothing 
                         to say. Well, I promised to show 
                         the fellow what's to be done in 
                         preparation, so I'll have to go now. 
                         I'll be back here after a while, but in 
                         the meantime I'm going to finish my 
                         packing so I'll be ready to sail to- 
                         morrow." He caught me close, his 
                         heart leaping in his eager eyes. "To- 
                         morrow just think of that, dar- 
                         ling!" He kissed me, a swift, hot 
                         kiss that throbbed with exultation, 
                         a kiss that promised everything in 
                         life. 
                     
                     
                         After he was gone I stood staring 
                         after him, my pulses leaping in 
                         pride for the lithe, handsome 
                         strength of his magnificent body as 
                         he strode across the road and dis- 
                         appeared in Jimmie's house. For 
                         a long time I stood there lost in 
                         dreams of the utter rapture waiting 
                         for us only a few hours ahead. 
                     
                     
                         Of a sudden I realized I was not 
                         alone. With a violent start, I saw 
                         that the beetle-browed man had 
                         come up onto the terrace again, so 
                         softly that I hadn't heard him. He 
                         had left off his hat, and his close- 
                         clipped hair stood up over his bul- 
                         let head like black bristling fur. He 
                         carried a bulging tan brief case, 
                         over which he was smiling at me. 
                         There was something in his furtive, 
                         swarthy face that sent a stab of un- 
                         reasoning panic through me, in 
                         spite of what Don had said about 
                         him. 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Reckless Bride 51 
                 
                     
                     
                         Frantically, I reached for the 
                         window to close it. But, with a 
                         quick, sinuous movement, he 
                         stepped forward and thrust his foot 
                         over the sill. 
                     
                     
                         "Wait a minute, sister," he 
                         drawled in a voice of easy familiar- 
                         ity. "I've got something of yours 
                         that'll interest you in a big way." 
                     
                     
                         I stared at him, my terror dis- 
                         placed by fury at his insolence. 
                     
                     
                         "You must be mistaken," I said 
                         coldly. "I never saw you before." 
                         I started to move away. 
                     
                     
                         His lips twisted in a grin. "And 
                         I never saw you before, neither. 
                         But it's a lucky break for both of 
                         us I got my directions mixed and 
                         accidentally busted in here a while 
                         ago. The minute I saw you, I 
                         recognized you from your picture." 
                     
                     
                         "My picture!" I stared at him, 
                         puzzled, suspicious. "I don't un- 
                         derstand." 
                     
                     
                         He tapped his bulging brief case. 
                     
                     
                         "I've got it right here in one of the 
                         films I'm going to show to-night at 
                         the smoker for Mr. Harrison. It 
                         was taken in a pool in the woods 
                         somewhere." He grinned know- 
                         ingly. 
                     
                     
                         I stepped back as though he had 
                         struck me in the face. My heart 
                         froze in my throat. In a flash, I 
                         realized what he meant, and a sick- 
                         ening wave of horror stabbed 
                         through me. Oh, it couldn't be 
                         true! Fate couldn't have twisted 
                         things like this! 
                     
                     
                         "It's pretty hot stuff, you know," 
                         he added, his dark face a leering 
                         mask. "I thought you wouldn't 
                         want your boy friend to see it, con- 
                         sidering all the whoopee between 
                         you and the guy in the picture." 
                     
                     
                         "But there wasn't any one else in 
                         it!" I gasped, my heart hammering 
                         terrifically, my breath choking my 
                         throat. "Anyway, I don't believe 
                         you could recognize me -the cam-  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         era was too far away!" I panted, 
                         desperately. 
                     
                     
                         He leered darkly. "You're wrong 
                         on both counts, sister. The guy 
                         that made this film is good. He 
                         specializes in pictures for the smoker 
                         circuit. Maybe you didn't know it, 
                         but he must have got a shot at you 
                         before you knew he was there. Any- 
                         way there's enough close-ups of your 
                         face so that I recognized you. Even 
                         if he had another couple there for 
                         the regular acting and you doubled 
                         for the girl in the water, no one'll 
                         ever know that from the picture. 
                     
                     
                         "The name of it is 'She Hung Her 
                         Clothes On A Hickory Tree,'" he 
                         said, watching me intently while my 
                         eyes dilated in horror as every word 
                         he uttered struck a death blow to 
                         my heart. 
                     
                     
                         "Of course", he added insinuat- 
                         ingly, "if you don't want the film to 
                         be shown to-night, I can sell it to 
                         you." 
                     
                     
                         I caught my breath sharply. 
                         "How much?" I panted. 
                     
                     
                         "Well, it s a total loss to us that 
                         way." He rubbed his chin thought- 
                         fully while I thought I'd go insane. 
                         "I'll make it one grand. One thou- 
                         sand bucks," he elucidated. 
                     
                     
                         My heart sank sickeningly. "But 
                         I haven't that much!" I gasped. 
                         Then I remembered all the money I 
                         had earned from this wretched pic- 
                         ture had gone for clothes for my 
                         trousseau, and a black mist clouded 
                         my brain. A horrible feeling of 
                         helplessness paralyzed me. I stared 
                         at him, mute with despair. 
                     
                     
                         "Well, it s 0. K. by me," he 
                         shrugged. "The film goes on to- 
                         night." He shifted his brief case 
                         and started to leave. 
                     
                     
                         "No!" I cried sharply. "Wait!" 
                         I pressed my shaking hand over my 
                         aching eyes, my brain reeling des- 
                         perately. What could I do? If 
                         only I could ask Don for the money! 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 52 Street &amp; Smith's Love Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         But I shrank from taking the risk 
                         of shattering his illusions about me. 
                     
                     
                         My thoughts flashed to the only 
                         other person I knew to ask for help. 
                         Oliver! He would have plenty of 
                         money. But I dared not go to him. 
                         He was still my guardian. He still 
                         had the power to stop the wedding. 
                     
                     
                         Yet there would be no wedding if 
                         the picture was shown at the 
                         smoker, I told myself wretchedly. 
                         Not only would I be sure to lose 
                         Don! But with so many of his col- 
                         lege friends there, together with his 
                         associates in the consular service, he 
                         would undoubtedly be dropped from 
                         his career with dishonor for having 
                         been engaged to a girl whose picture 
                         was featured in the smoker circuit! 
                     
                     
                         My heart thumped miserably. Oh, 
                         I had to do something! 
                     
                     
                         Desperately, I stared at the fur- 
                         tive eyes watching me. "There's 
                         only one way I can get you the 
                         money, only I can't get it to-day. 
                         To-morrow I'll be eighteen, and I'll 
                         come into what I've inherited from 
                         my father. I'll have to give you a 
                         note, due to-morrow. You can take 
                         it to my guardian then, and he'll 
                         have to pay you out of my money. 
                         There's only one thing-" I hesi- 
                         tated, in a panic of doubt and fear. 
                         But it was my only chance. "You'll 
                         have to promise not to get in touch 
                         with him until to-morrow. It 
                         wouldn't do you any good anyway. 
                         You wouldn't get your money till 
                         then. Besides, I -I'm hiding from 
                         him. He mustn't know where I am 
                         under any circumstances. I'll have 
                         to be sure of that before I give you 
                         his name." 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, you can trust me, sister," 
                         the man vowed solemnly. "I've got 
                         no wish to get you in trouble, only 
                         these days you can't blame a guy 
                         for picking up a little money wher- 
                         ever he can. I promise you on any- 
                         thing you want to name that I won't 
                         go to your guardian till to-morrow. 
                         Why, I couldn't leave here before 
                         two or three o'clock to-night if I 
                         wanted to. The smoker will last 
                         that long, and between now and 
                         then I've got to rig up a screen and 
                         some sort of a projecting booth. 
                         No, this is on the level, see?" Then, 
                         as I hesitated uncertainly, he added: 
                         Here's your film. 
                     
                     
                         He took a round flat tin box from 
                         his brief case and held it so I could 
                         see the sticker on top while he 
                         pointed to the printed title: "She 
                         Hung Her Clothes On A Hickory 
                         Tree." Then, still keeping it tor- 
                         mentingly out of my reach, he 
                         opened the container and unwound 
                         several feet of film, holding it up to 
                         the light for me to see. One glance 
                         made my face burn with shame and 
                         dismay. 
                     
                     
                         Frantically, I turned and ran 
                         across the room to the desk, snatch- 
                         ing up a pen and a sheet of paper. 
                         In a frenzy of haste I wrote a note 
                         to Oliver, directing him to pay the 
                         bearer one thousand dollars, and 
                         dating it for the next day. The 
                         film peddler stood over me watching 
                         closely until he had the note in his 
                         greedy hands. 
                     
                     
                         Another moment and he was 
                         gone, leaving the film coiled on the 
                         desk like a viper. 
                     
                     
                         Frenziedly, I gathered it up in a 
                         blind panic to destroy it at once. 
                         Burn it! Burn it! My brain or- 
                         dered desperately. I scarcely 
                         breathed for fear some one would 
                         pass me as I raced down to the base- 
                         ment, where after hunting fran- 
                         tically, I found some matches in a 
                         wall case above the laundry stove. 
                         A moment later, the wretched strip 
                         of celluloid vanished with a bright 
                         flare in the laundry tubs. 
                     
                     
                         I was glad Don had to go to the 
                         smoker that night. It would give 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Reckless Bride 53 
                 
                     
                     
                         me a chance to be alone and com- 
                         pose my shattered nerves, which had 
                         turned dinner into a nightmare for 
                         me. It was almost more than I 
                         could do to laugh and talk natu- 
                         rally during the meal, but somehow 
                         I managed to keep up until Don 
                         left. As it was, he stayed with me 
                         until after ten, when he saw the cars 
                         beginning to arrive across the road. 
                     
                     
                         Before he went, he held me close 
                         in his arms, whispering that this was 
                         the last night we'd ever have to be 
                         apart. I could feel his pulses leap- 
                         ing. His eyes, so blue and deep, 
                         were warm and glowing with his 
                         love for me, and my heart con- 
                         tracted thinking how narrowly I had 
                         escaped seeing them harden with 
                         scorn and contempt. But it was 
                         foolish to allow that thought to tor- 
                         ture me now, I kept telling myself. 
                         Hadn't I burned the film with my 
                         own hands? Don could never in 
                         the world find out about it. It 
                         could never endanger our love again. 
                         His kisses, passionate and tender, 
                         calmed me, filled me with a sense of 
                         utter security. When he left, I was 
                         on fire with thrills because I knew I 
                         was the happiest girl on earth. 
                     
                     
                         Shortly after I went up to my 
                         room, I heard the rest of the family 
                         retire for the night. But I didn't 
                         undress for bed just then. I had 
                         some last-minute packing to finish. 
                     
                     
                         It must have been at least a half- 
                         hour later when I heard a tap on my 
                         door. Opening it, expecting to see 
                         Don's mother, I was surprised to 
                         find the housekeeper standing there. 
                     
                     
                         "There's a man downstairs to see 
                         you, Miss Lynore," she said, a queer 
                         look on her stolid face. 
                     
                     
                         "To see me!" I stared at her, 
                         and then I saw she was holding out 
                         a visiting card. 
                     
                     
                         Uncertainly, I glanced at it 
                         and gasped sharply. For the name 
                         engraved on it was Oliver Bennett. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         An icy shudder cut through me. 
                         Oh, how could he have found me 
                         after I had eluded him this long! 
                         But he had, just as I had feared he 
                         would. I had known all along this 
                         might happen at any minute. 
                     
                     
                         My heart drummed insanely in 
                         my ears. "Oh, I can't go down! 
                         Tell him I'm not here," I panted, 
                         and then I saw the housekeeper had 
                         turned the card over, so I could see 
                         the words written on the back in 
                         Oliver s familiar handwriting. 
                     
                     
                         I know you are here. If you see me 
                         at once, I'll not make any trouble. But if 
                         you'refuse, I'll bring the police and force 
                         you to come with me. O. B. 
                     
                     
                         For a frantic moment I wanted to 
                         run and hide, or rouse the house- 
                         hold to protect me. But that would 
                         be madness. I knew he meant 
                         what he said about the police, and 
                         I had to prevent that at any cost. 
                         My only chance lay in making him 
                         see reason and let us alone. There 
                         was no other way out of it. I had 
                         to go down. 
                     
                     
                         Weak with terror, I entered the 
                         living room a moment later. 
                     
                     
                         Oliver was standing importantly 
                         in the center of the floor, a sly ex- 
                         pression on his handsome, florid face. 
                         His thin lips spread in a smile as I 
                         stood trembling in the doorway. 
                     
                     
                         "Ah, the little runaway in per- 
                         son!" he drawled. "Come in, child. 
                         don't be afraid. I'm not going to 
                         kidnap you this time. Let us sit 
                         down and have a quiet little talk." 
                         He motioned toward the davenport. 
                         Slowly he sat down. 
                     
                     
                         But I remained standing. "What 
                         do you want?" I faltered, searching 
                         his narrowed eyes, afraid to 
                         breathe. 
                         He raised his brows in a gesture he 
                         had always used when he had any 
                         one helpless in his power. "Well, 
                         first of all I want to congratulate

                         you on becoming a shall we call it 
                         a film star?" 
                     
                     
                         His words struck me like a bolt. 
                         I stared at him, my heart stopping. 
                     
                     
                         "How how did you find out?" I 
                         stammered, reddening painfully, 
                         scarcely realizing what I said. 
                     
                     
                         "I'll admit it was a surprise," 
                         Oliver chuckled, "after hunting you 
                         everywhere with detectives since 
                         you vanished from Hillcrest. I was 
                         just ready to believe you had 
                         drowned in the lake, until about an 
                         hour ago." He cleared his throat 
                         maddeningly. "I had a telephone 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         call from a man who peddles films 
                         for smokers. He said he had just 
                         sent a film featuring you out to a 
                         stag party being given to-night for 
                         young Harrison. He thought that 
                         I, as your guardian, wouldn't want 
                         it shown." 
                     
                     
                         My brain reeled sickeningly. 
                         Why hadn't I known the man would 
                         break his promise not to see Oliver 
                         before to-morrow! But I'd had to 
                         risk the chance in order to get the 
                         film from him. Then, suddenly, I 
                         remembered. "But he can't show 
                         the film! I gasped, weak with re-

                      "I'm the one who's going to call the police," Don cried. "I'm going to have you arrested on a blackmail charge unless
                            you leave Lynore alone. Besides, you're no longer her guardian. She's of age!"   
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         lief. "I burned it. He sold it to 
                         me. I gave him a note to you, to 
                         pay for it out of the money I inherit 
                         to-morrow morning." 
                     
                     
                         "I see." Oliver's eyes narrowed. 
                     
                     
                         "Then you did make the film! And 
                         they-" he paused, while a 
                         strange expression whipped across 
                         his face. "They made two copies." 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, no!" I choked, my eyes di- 
                         lating in horror. 
                     
                     
                         He nodded, secretly smiling. 
                         "The man who called me said his 
                         partner had telephoned that some- 
                         thing happened to the picture he had 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         and wanted the other copy rushed 
                         right out. They're an enterprising 
                         gang. They tried to get me for a 
                         thousand dollars to keep it off the 
                         screen to-night. I've got an hour 
                         yet to hand over the money." 
                     
                     
                         I pressed my hand against the 
                         pain in my throat. "Then you'll 
                         pay it?" I panted. 
                     
                     
                         He shook his head. "Not unless 
                         you make it worthwhile, my dear." 
                     
                     
                         "But I will," I moaned frantic- 
                         ally. "I'll give you twice the money 
                         you advance! I'll give you every 
                         cent my father left me! Only pay

                         it, Oliver!" I clutched at his arm 
                         in a frenzy of pleading. 
                     
                     
                         He took my hand in his. "I will 
                         on one condition, Lynore," he said, 
                         his eyes glinting. "That you marry 
                         me at once." 
                     
                     
                         I stiffened, and stared at him, ap- 
                         palled. In a suffocating flash I saw 
                         the hungry greed in his avid gaze, 
                         recognized it for what it was, for 
                         what it had been almost since I had 
                         lived in his home. And I had never 
                         dreamed it, even when he forbade 
                         my seeing other men! He had dared 
                         to think of me like this, even though 
                         he had a wife! I shrank away from 
                         him in revulsion. 
                     
                     
                         But he caught me back against 
                         him, holding me in a grip of steel. 
                         "Don't look so horrified, Lynore," 
                         he said softly. "My wife died three 
                         weeks ago in the sanitarium. I've 
                         been waiting for it before I spoke to 
                         you like this. I've tried to keep 
                         you free so I could marry you. I've 
                         been mad about you ever since you 
                         began growing up." With a swift 
                         motion he tried to kiss me. 
                     
                     
                         Blind with rage, I struck at his 
                         face. Desperately, I struggled 
                         against him. "Don't you dare touch 
                         me!" I panted. "I hate you. I 
                         wouldn't marry you for anything!" 
                     
                     
                         He reddened violently. "Not 
                         even to save young Harrison from 
                         seeing that film?" he said harshly. 
                     
                     
                         "From the description I got, it 
                         would be plenty to turn him against 
                         you if he sees it, and he will see it, 
                         unless you promise right now to 
                         marry me." 
                     
                     
                         My brain whirled as a black tide 
                         of hopeless despair engulfed me. It 
                         seemed my heart crashed and died 
                         inside my throat. What could I do? 
                         I closed my eyes in an agony of 
                         helpless panic. 
                     
                     
                         "You'd better make up your 
                         mind," Oliver was purring in my 
                         ear. "The film goes on in just a few 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         minutes. If you want me to buy it 
                         for you, you'll come with me now. 
                         I'll leave a check across the road, 
                         then we'll go to a magistrate and be 
                         married." 
                     
                     
                         As I stared at him, a sudden des- 
                         perate hope flamed through my 
                         brain. There might be just the 
                         barest chance I could outwit him. 
                     
                     
                         I lowered my eyes. "Well, all 
                         right, I said, very low. I'll get 
                         my coat." 
                     
                     
                         I was afraid he wouldn't release 
                         me. But he did. Evidently, he was 
                         surprised at my sudden meekness. 
                         He stood in the doorway watching 
                         me with glittering eyes while I went 
                         upstairs. 
                     
                     
                         The instant I reached the second 
                         floor, I began running silently along 
                         the thickly carpeted corridor until I 
                         reached the servants stairs. A mo- 
                         ment later I was hurrying through 
                         the dark kitchen, letting myself out 
                         the back door. As I ran silently 
                         over the grass around the end of the 
                         house I could see Oliver through the 
                         lighted living room windows, impa- 
                         tiently pacing the floor. Madly I 
                         sped across the road to Jimmie s, 
                         skirting the lighted drive until I 
                         reached a clump of shrubbery at the 
                         entrance. 
                     
                     
                         The door stood open. Laughing 
                         voices of men drifted out to me as 
                         I crouched there in the shadows, 
                         trembling. Then they hadn't gone 
                         down yet! I could hear them mov- 
                         ing about in a room to the right of 
                         the hallway, beyond a wide door- 
                         way half concealed with draperies. 
                         And right outside that room was a 
                         wrought-iron stairway, with a flight 
                         underneath leading down! Did it 
                         lead to the recreation room? And 
                         could I make it without being seen? 
                         I had to! 
                     
                     
                         Heart in my mouth, I slipped 
                         noiselessly inside, past the door 
                         without being seen, and down the  
                 
             
             
                 
                 Reckless Bride 57 
                 
                     steps. A moment later, I found my- 
                     self descending into what was un- 
                     mistakably, the recreation room. 
                     Stooping cautiously, I could see a 
                     white screen hung at the far end. 
                     And near the foot of the steps was 
                     a little boxlike booth. Some one 
                     was in it, and as I crouched there, 
                     watching breathlessly, the swarthy 
                     film peddler suddenly came out of it. 
                     He walked, slowly, over to the 
                     screen and adjusted it. Then he 
                     went out through a doorway behind 
                     it. 
                 
                 
                     Like a silent flash, I was down 
                     the stairs and in the tiny wooden 
                     booth. I nearly knocked over a 
                     film projector on a little table, in 
                     my eagerness to open a bulging tan 
                     brief-case lying beside it. Hands 
                     shaking, I opened it, and com- 
                     menced drawing out the contents. 
                     One after another round tin box I 
                     examined in mad haste until, at the 
                     very last, I realized it wasn't there. 
                     My heart knocked sickeningly. 
                     Desperately, I looked about, saw a 
                     small package lying on the chair. 
                     Wildly I tore off the wrapping just 
                     enough to see it was another film. 
                     And the title on the top was "She 
                     Hung Her Clothes On A Hickory 
                     Tree"! 
                 
                 
                     Snatching it up breathlessly, I 
                     slipped out of the booth. Under the 
                     stairs I saw a table piled high with 
                     smoking supplies, and I caught up a 
                     paper of matches as I shot up the 
                     stairs just as heavy feet reentered 
                     the room from the far end. As I 
                     reached the entrance hall, some one 
                     parted the draperies in the wide 
                     doorway, but I didn't stop. I 
                     didn't even look. Like a hunted ani- 
                     mal I raced out into the driveway. 
                 
                 
                     Swift feet pounded after me, and 
                     my heart knocked sickeningly. I 
                     couldn't get away! But I could 
                     destroy the film. 
                 
                 
                     Madly I fled around the house, 
                     tearing open the tin box as I ran. 
                     In an instant I had the film free. I 
                     caught the end of the strip and flung 
                     the spool to the ground, unraveling 
                     it completely in a glittering heap on 
                     the gravel. Stooping swiftly, I 
                     lighted one of the paper matches 
                     and touched it to the celluloid. 
                     There wras a bright flare in the dark- 
                     ness just as a tall figure came run- 
                     ning around the house. 
                 
                 
                     "Lynore!" It was Don, his voice 
                     thin with amazement. "What are 
                     you doing over here, dear?" 
                 
                 
                     I couldn't speak. My throat was 
                     dry, burning miserably. I turned 
                     and stared at him, panting, pressing 
                     my hand against my heart as he 
                     came up to me. 
                 
                 
                     Before he could touch me, another 
                     figure came pounding around the 
                     drive. A bullet head bristling with 
                     short hair flashed through the light 
                     streaming through the wrindowrs in 
                     the house. 
                 
                 
                     "Hey, where's that film!" A 
                     swarthy face was thrust close to 
                     mine. "You took it, you little-" 
                 
                 
                     "Here! Be careful!" Don seized 
                     his arm, flung him away from me. 
                 
                 
                     "What's the trouble?" he demanded, 
                     his jaw thrust out. 
                 
                 
                     "Ask her!" the film peddler 
                     snarled, pointing at me. "Ask her 
                     why she just stole one of the films 
                     out of the projection booth I was 
                     going to show at the smoker! Oh, 
                     so you burned it already!" 
                 
                 
                     Stooping, he picked up the 
                     charred spool on which the film had 
                     been wound from the center of a 
                     black smudge on the driveway. 
                     Angrily, he whirled on me again. 
                 
                 
                     "Say, do you think you can get 
                     away with that, even if you did pull 
                     the wool over this guy's eyes?" he 
                     laughed harshly. "It's a big pity 
                     he can't see you in that film. It's 
                     the hottest number we've ever had 
                     on the circuit. Well, any time you

                      "You know I couldn't hate you, Lynore, no mat-ter what you did. Promise you'll never doubt again that I love you!" he
                            demanded.  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         want to make some more money 
                         diving in your birthday suit, come 
                         around!" He turned and strode to- 
                         ward the house. 
                     
                     
                         Don flinched as though he had 
                         been struck. For a moment, there 
                         was tense silence as he turned to me, 
                         his eyes sick. 
                     
                     
                         "It isn't true, is it, Lynore?" he 
                         demanded, his voice hoarse. "Tell 
                         me it's a lie, and I'll kill him." 
                     
                     
                         My brain whirled frantically. 
                         But I knew it was useless to lie out 
                         of it. It would only make it more 
                         hopeless, if it ever came to light 
                         again. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         I nodded 
                         just miserably. 
                     
                     
                         "Yes, Don, it's 
                         true," I gasped. 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, I should 
                         have told you 
                         at first, but I 
                         never knew 
                         this would hap- 
                         pen-" my 
                         voice broke 
                         wretchedly.  
                     
                         Breathlessly, I 
                         sobbed out the whole story, from 
                         the minute I had vowed to be ex- 
                         pelled from Hillcrest Manor, un- 
                         til to-night when I had discovered 
                         there had been a copy of the original 
                         film which I had bought for a thou- 
                         sand dollars. 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, Don, tell me you under- 
                         stand!" I begged, my heart hammer- 
                         ing painfully. "Tell me you don't 
                         hate me!" 
                     
                     
                         But he turned away. His face 
                         white, set, he strode off around the 
                         driveway without another word. 
                     
                     
                         My mind went black. In that 
                         moment I wanted to die. Blindly, I 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Reckless Bride 59 
                 
                     
                     
                         stumbled across the lawns, sobbing 
                         miserably. I had lost Don, irre- 
                         trievably. All his tender, worship- 
                         ing love had turned to scorn and 
                         hate. There was nothing for me in 
                         life but to get away quickly, spare 
                         us both the humiliation of ever see- 
                         ing each other again. Gropingly, I 
                         started to run- And found my- 
                         self seized in a rough grasp. 
                     
                     
                         "So you tried to sneak away!" It 
                         was Oliver, angrily confronting me. 
                         "You'll see how far that gets you! 
                         I won't pay for the film now." 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, the film's burned!" I gasped. 
                         "And Don knows the whole thing. 
                         It's turned him against me. I hope 
                         you're satisfied." Weeping bitterly, 
                         I pulled away. 
                     
                     
                         "Sure, I'm satisfied." With a soft 
                         laugh, he pinned me against him. 
                         "I'm glad we're rid of him, then he 
                         won't try to interfere. Because you 
                         and I are getting married to-night." 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, no you're not!" spoke a deep 
                         young voice that made my heart 
                         leap. Looking up incredulously, I 
                         saw Don striding over the grass to- 
                         ward us. "But you are getting out 
                         of here, quick, unless you want to 
                         get hurt!" His hands clenched 
                         threateningly as he faced Oliver. 
                     
                     
                         "Take your hands off Lynore!" 
                         Oliver drew himself up impor- 
                         tantly. "Indeed not," he retorted, 
                         holding my struggling arm more 
                         tightly. "I'm her guardian. She's 
                         leaving with me to-night, if I have 
                         to call in the police." 
                     
                     
                         "I'm the one who's going to call 
                         in the police," Don cried. "I'm go- 
                         ing to have you arrested on a black- 
                         mail charge you and that film ped- 
                         dler downstairs, unless both of you 
                         leave Lynore alone. Besides, you're 
                         no longer her guardian." He held 
                         out his watch. "It's five minutes 
                         after twelve. She's of age!" 
                     
                     
                         A blinding wave of light seemed 
                         to free my soul. My heart began  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         beating so fast I thought I was go- 
                         ing to faint. Dimly, I was aware 
                         that Oliver was glaring at his watch. 
                         Then, with a grunt, and a fearful 
                         look at Don, he turned and almost 
                         ran out to the road. A moment 
                         later, we heard the sound of his car 
                         vanishing in the night. 
                     
                     
                         "Lynore!" With a low cry, Don's 
                         arms were about me. "Lynore, dar- 
                         ling, you're free! Nothing can ever 
                         take you away from me again!" 
                     
                     
                         I stared up at him, scarcely 
                         breathing. "Then you don't hate 
                         me!" I whispered, trembling. "I 
                         thought, when you went into the 
                         house-" 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, darling, I went in to warn 
                         that fellow not to spread the story 
                         around about that film. He'll never 
                         bother you again, neither he nor 
                         Oliver. They both know they've 
                         laid themselves open to serious 
                         charges." Don held me close, his 
                         eyes shining above mine with a 
                         tender, glowing light. "You know 
                         I couldn't hate you, Lynore, no mat- 
                         ter what you did. Tell me you 
                         know that, darling!" 
                     
                     
                         I looked up at him, a wave of 
                         joy drowning my heart in ecstasy. 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, yes!" I whispered tremu- 
                         lously. "I know it, Don." 
                     
                     
                         A moment longer he held me so 
                         I had to meet his eyes. "Promise 
                         you'll never doubt again that I love 
                         you -love you -love you!" he de- 
                         manded. 
                     
                     
                         But he didn't give me a chance to 
                         answer. His lips smothered the 
                         words on my mouth while his arms 
                         crushed me close against his heart in 
                         a mad, exultant embrace. 
                     
                     
                         And as we clung together in 
                         breathless surrender to our love, 
                         while the world stood hushed, stilled, 
                         it seemed that tiny silver bells of 
                         joy chimed in our thudding hearts, 
                         ringing in the new day. Our wed- 
                         ding day. 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 
                 
                     The Love Pawn 
                 
                 
                     By  Hortense McRaven  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         PAULA had never been kid- 
                         naped before, and the sensa- 
                         tion wasn't a pleasant one. 
                         She had often wondered how it 
                         would feel; now, she knew. Stolen, 
                         and only a week before her wedding 
                         to Monty Lewis! 
                     
                     
                         She glanced again at the grim 
                         stranger who had kidnaped her in 
                         her own car, and tried to imagine 
                         how he felt, also. A young fellow 
                         like that, really good-looking, must 
                         be goaded by some terrific strain, 
                         driven by some desperate need, to 
                         take such a chance. What suffering 
                         had etched those bitter lines in his 
                         hard, handsome face? 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Half an hour earlier, Paula had 
                         hurried from Madame Rosalie's, 
                         where she had been fitted with the 
                         last ermine bordered velvet, and 
                         the wispy bits of chiffon lingerie 
                         which were part of her luxurious 
                         trousseau. Stowing a flat box away 
                         in her sedan, she had glanced up to 
                         see this young fellow, with breath- 
                         taking nerve, step out from behind 
                         a truck on the crowded street, jump 
                         into her car beside her, and order 
                         tersely, "Drive out to highway 80!" 
                     
                     
                         Paula obeyed. What else could 
                         she do with an automatic sug- 
                         gestively touching her side? 
                     
                     
                         "If it's money you want," she 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 The Love Pawn 61 
                 
                     
                     
                         gasped, looking desperately about 
                         for help, "my uncle Jerry will pay 
                         you any amount! My uncle or my 
                         fiance would do that," she con- 
                         tinued, her tawny-brown eyes flash- 
                         ing furiously, "but I wouldn't!" 
                         She took one hand from the wheel, 
                         to snap her fingers under the man's 
                         nose. "I'd never give in! I'd refuse 
                         to traffic with your kind!" 
                     
                     
                         "Fine!" exclaimed her kidnaper, 
                         amazingly." I knew you were that 
                         kind, spirited and nervy, when I se- 
                         lected you to help me in a plan I've 
                         got! You might call me 'Red'- 
                         with a gesture toward his hair which 
                         flamed in the sunlight- "because 
                         we're going to know each other 
                         pretty well before we get through 
                         with this thing. Of course, I know 
                         you're Paula Ingram!" 
                     
                     
                         Sheer surprise made Paula drive 
                         on, down a busy street, past two un- 
                         suspecting traffic cops. Her captor's 
                         voice echoed in her ears with a 
                         familiar ring. Where had she heard 
                         it before? He was not at all the 
                         criminal type. He was well dressed, 
                         his hands cared for, his teeth nice. 
                         And he would have been splendidly 
                         attractive, but for those harsh lines 
                         about his mouth, that terrible look 
                         in his slate-gray eyes. 
                     
                     
                         The whole thing was almost ab- 
                         surd, it seemed so natural yet so 
                         horrid! She drove on, through 
                         business streets, residential districts, 
                         out to the open country. Twice, 
                         they passed people she knew; one, a 
                         car full of girls who had been with 
                         her at a luncheon in her honor, that 
                         very day! They waved at her. If 
                         she should scream, now- 
                     
                     
                         "No squealing!" ordered the 
                         deadly voice at her elbow. She 
                         could feel the cold steel of the re- 
                         volver through her dress. "Let your 
                         friends think you're taking a ride 
                         with a new date!" 
                     
                     
                         A new date! 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "You must be crazy!" she said, 
                         her eyes flashing. "You will never 
                         get away with this, you poor, puny 
                         thing! I almost feel sorry for you 
                         when I think of the money and 
                         power my guardian, Uncle Jerry, 
                         will put behind a search for me!" 
                     
                     
                         "There will be no search," said 
                         the man who called himself Red, 
                         calmly. "I've fixed that. We leave 
                         the car at Philadelphia, and I'm 
                         taking you by airplane to Santa 
                         Barbara, California." 
                     
                     
                         The countryside through which 
                         they were passing swam dizzily past 
                         Paula. To California from Wilming- 
                         ton, Delaware! To Santa Barbara, 
                         her city of recollections, the home of 
                         a man she wanted to forget! 
                     
                     
                         Red coolly relaxed, even lighted 
                         a cigarette. "You are the girl who 
                         is to help me take some money from 
                         the bank there!" 
                     
                     
                         "Help you rob a bank! I'll die 
                         first!" defied Paula's vivid, mutinous 
                         lips. "You -you can't force me to 
                         do that"! 
                     
                     
                         "Yet I have a hunch that you 
                         will. And my hunches seldom fail." 
                         He seemed so sure, that chills ran 
                         through Paula. "It won't be ex- 
                         actly robbery. Not from my point 
                         of view. Drive slowly, and let me 
                         tell you a little story. My name is 
                         Jack Delafield. Five years ago, my 
                         father was one of the wealthiest men 
                         in southern California. Then, on the 
                         market, he lost all except a quarter 
                         of a million. A lot of money for 
                         some people, but little enough when 
                         you've had more. A group of hard- 
                         boiled thieves in tailored clothes, 
                         four men who pretended to be 
                         friends, fleeced dad completely. De- 
                         liberately, murderously, took his last 
                         cent. It wasn't only the money, but 
                         his power, his name, all gone. One 
                         windy night, he came home to find 
                         just one bullet in his revolver. It 
                         was enough. He sent it through his

                         heart. Six months later, mother 
                         died, crushed. I faced the world 
                         alone. I had worshiped my dad, 
                         and" -the slate gray eyes brooded, 
                         bitterly- "I swore I'd have my re- 
                         venge, and got that money, my 
                         money, back! Oh, I tried the law, 
                         but it was no use. The gang had 
                         covered the evidence. And they're 
                         still at the same old game, robbing 
                         whenever they can. Now I've a 
                         chance to burn them up! Danger 
                         means nothing to me!" 
                     
                     
                         Paula felt a swift stab of pity. 
                         Young and so desperate! 
                     
                     
                         "I've laid my plans well." He 
                         was staring unseeingly at the town 
                         they were whizzing past. "The gang 
                         is operating in Mexico, with blinds 
                         in California. I've learned, no mat- 
                         ter how, that almost the exact sum 
                         they stole from us, will be in this 
                         bank in Santa Barbara for a few 
                         hours some day soon, until it can 
                         be divided. I'm going to get that 
                         money -mine- or die for it!" 
                     
                     
                         In spite of herself, Paula felt a 
                         thrill of excitement. She loved to 
                         live daringly, scent danger in the 
                         air. And with this handsome 
                         bandit- Her head, with its 
                         gold-brown hair flying, was up, her 
                         delicate nostrils wide. 
                     
                     
                         "Where do I come in on this?" 
                         she asked swiftly. 
                     
                     
                         "You are to be nice to the cashier 
                         of that bank, find out which day the 
                         money will be there. You are the 
                         only girl in the whole world who can 
                         do that, because Eric Kendall is in 
                         love with you!" 
                     
                     
                         Paula almost lost control of the 
                         wheel. "No," she cried furiously. 
                         "Not Eric Kendall! I won't do it! 
                         So that is the bank, and Eric-" 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, but you will!" Red broke in 
                         masterfully. "A year ago, you 
                         visited in Santa Barbara, and Eric 
                         fell madly in love with you. You 
                         had a wonderful time together. You 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         seemed to care for him. Re- 
                         member?" 
                     
                     
                         Remember? She could see Eric's 
                         blond head and broad shoulders, his 
                         well-groomed air of the prosperous 
                         young business man. There had 
                         been tennis tournaments and horse 
                         races at the smart country club, the 
                         green strips of sward, sun shining, 
                         pennants flying from the grand- 
                         stand; herself in a white dress with 
                         orange coat, the breeze on Eric's 
                         hair. Dances, too, in the open air 
                         pavilion, the feel of Eric holding 
                         her close, the perfume of thousands 
                         of California's sensuous carnations, 
                         and Eric making love to her, beg- 
                         ging her passionately to stay and 
                         marry him. Yes, Eric was attrac- 
                         tive, and with his bold, complacent 
                         way, would be successful. 
                     
                     
                         "You're thinking of him now," 
                         said Red, as if he read her mind. 
                     
                     
                         "When you see him again, the affair 
                         may click. You ran away from him 
                         last year, you came home to marry 
                         the millionaire, Monty Lewis, to 
                         please your uncle. But you don't 
                         love Monty; he doesn't stir you!

                         Paula gasped. How did he know 
                         all this? 
                     
                     
                         "I did want to please Uncle Jerry. 
                         He has done everything for me!" 
                     
                     
                         "Sure." The strange slate-gray 
                         eyes looked into hers. "But if you 
                         had really loved Eric, as a girl like 
                         you is capable of loving, you 
                         wouldn't have thought of that! You 
                         would have gone straight as a die to 
                         your man!" 
                     
                     
                         What a strange conversation with 
                         a bandit who had kidnaped her! 
                         Talking of love! And yet, with his 
                         fascinating, compelling eyes, and the 
                         lines almost gone from his face, he 
                         could have been a lover worthy of 
                         any girl, if fate had dealt with him 
                         differently.

                     He took both struggling hands in one big one, holding her fast. "Some little fury, aren't you? Calm down, sit at that
                        desk, and write what I dictate." 
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "This isn't getting us anywhere," 
                         she said angrily, shaking off his 
                         spell. "You'll be clapped in jail as 
                         soon as I am missed, and that won't 
                         be long now!" 
                     
                     
                         "But you won't be missed. Just 
                         before I picked you up, I sent a wire

                         wedding." 
                     
                     
                         "I know that. That played into 
                         my hand. Monty's trip was confi- 
                         dential, and he told no one he was 
                         going, except you. You intended to 
                         tell your uncle to-night, but by to- 
                         night you and I will be far away. 
                         Meanwhile, Uncle Jerry will think 
                         you are having a honeymoon with 
                         Monty, and Monty, up in Canada, 
                         will think you are safe at home. So 
                         no one will search for you!" 
                     
                     
                         Shakily, Paula kept the car in the 
                         road. "Who are you?" she cried. 
                         "And how did you learn all these 
                         things?" 
                     
                     
                         The man only laughed tauntingly. 
                         Then he said with that strange, 
                         ringing voice that kept echoing deep 
                         within Paula, "When we reach 
                         Philadelphia, you are going to write 
                         a note to Uncle Jerry in your own 
                         handwriting, saying you are safe and 
                         happy!" 
                     
                     
                         "I shan't!" cried Paula rebel- 
                         liously. "You shan't make me!" 
                     
                     
                         "But you will!" he said. Again, 
                         Paula had the feeling of being 
                         driven by fate. It was not the gun 
                         he had; more, it was some odd, com- 
                         pelling power, the way his look bore 
                         down on her. He was a strong, de- 
                         termined man. Paula knew it. 
                         Something feminine in her re- 
                         sponded, even while she fought 
                         against him. 
                     
                     
                         "I shan't help you get money 
                         from Eric's bank, either!" her vivid 
                         lips mocked him. "If you think I'll 
                         use his love for me to lure that in- 
                         formation from him, you'll find I 
                         can struggle to the last ditch!" 
                     
                     
                         "You are beautiful when you 
                         flame like that," he said suddenly. 
                         "I like a girl with temper, you 
                         precious little wild cat!" 
                     
                     
                         "Then you'll have plenty of 
                         chances to admire me!" 
                     
                     
                         He leaned nearer. "I could," he 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         said slowly, "if I were interested in 
                         girls. But I have no time for them 
                         now. All my mind and soul is cen - 
                         tered in my plan for revenge, and 
                         you are only a pawn in the dan- 
                         gerous game I play! The fact that 
                         you happen to be a pretty little love 
                         pawn means nothing, absolutely 
                         nothing, to me!" 
                     
                     
                         Paula s brows knotted. Only a 
                         love pawn, was she? She'd show 
                         him she had a mind and a will of 
                         her own. She didn't know yet what 
                         she would do, but she wouldn't fall 
                         in with his plans. 
                     
                     
                         She was tired when they arrived 
                         at Philadelphia at nightfall. They 
                         had made good time, stopping twice 
                         for gas, but always at such remote 
                         filling stations that Paula knew it 
                         would be useless to try to escape. 
                         Now she was so weary, the maze of 
                         city streets was all a blur. Red 
                         ordered her to stop at an apartment 
                         house in a quiet section. 
                     
                     
                         "It's a walk up," he apologized, 
                         but Paula didn't care. It was good 
                         to stretch her limbs. Only when he 
                         took a key from his pocket and un- 
                         locked the door of a small apart- 
                         ment did she wake up. 
                     
                     
                         "This is sketchily furnished from 
                         odds and ends left after our crash," 
                         he was saying, "but it is home for 
                         me for the present. Welcome, lady 
                         fair! We will spend the night here." 
                     
                     
                         With a click, he turned the key 
                         in the lock. Paula turned white. 
                         Locked in! Through the window 
                         she could see cavernous walls of 
                         other apartments, windows, more 
                         windows, and behind them, people 
                         were living, but who would hear 
                         her, or care, if she called? She was 
                         trapped! 
                     
                     
                         Red put out his hand to take her 
                         coat, but in spite of his gun, she 
                         struck at him furiously. "You 
                         brute," she sobbed, between set 
                         teeth, "how dare you bring me here?

                 The Love Pawn 65 
                 
                     
                     
                         Before I'd let you touch me, I'd kill 
                         myself!" 
                     
                     
                         He took both struggling little 
                         hands in one big one, holding her 
                         fast. "But, Paula-" 
                     
                     
                         "You think you can hold me," 
                         she panted, "but I'll show you. I'm 
                         strong." 
                     
                     
                         "Be quiet," he ordered. "I keep 
                         trying to tell you, you misunder- 
                         stand. If you behave yourself, I'm 
                         not going to harm you. We are not 
                         alone. I have two Japanese ser- 
                         vants who stayed with me when 
                         dad's establishment broke up. Any- 
                         way," he said coolly, "do you think 
                         I'd risk ruining my well-laid plans 
                         for you- a girl? Even if you are 
                         beautiful!" he added, with a queer 
                         look at the red mark she had left 
                         on his wrist. "Some little fury, 
                         aren't you? Calm down, sit at that 
                         desk, and write what I dictate."  
                     
                         Strangling her sobs, Paula stepped 
                         proudly across the worn, but once 
                         good rug. Automatically, she no- 
                         ticed the tasteful chintz, the few 
                         pieces of well polished furniture. He 
                         knew good things. His words kept 
                         ringing through her mind, "Even if 
                         you are beautiful." She did not 
                         know whether she was glad or sorry 
                         that he had taken his strange touch 
                         away from her. 
                     
                     
                         Better not resist. Better pretend 
                         to fall in with his plans. Later, 
                         she could think of a way to escape. 
                         She wrote what he dictated, that 
                         she was on her honeymoon, that she 
                         was gloriously happy. 
                     
                     
                         Red took the letter from her 
                         forcefully, and tore it up. 
                     
                     
                         "You have disguised your hand," 
                         he said sternly. "Write another!" 
                         The room swaying about her, she 
                         obeyed, too worn to wonder how he 
                         had known. But there was one 
                         more chance. She remembered a 
                         erame she used to play with Uncle 
                         Jerry. When she had been in a very  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         strict boarding school, where her 
                         letters were corrected, she always 
                         signed them with a special little 
                         crook to her name, so he would 
                         know she was in some childish 
                         trouble. She wrote it that way now, 
                         hoping, praying Uncle Jerry had not 
                         forgotten. 
                     
                     
                         "Doesn't seem exactly right yet," 
                         said Red critically. But let it 
                         pass. 
                     
                     
                         He rang, and gave orders to the 
                         Japanese, "Phone the garage to send 
                         for Miss Paula's car, and store it for 
                         a week. See that this letter gets off 
                         at once by air mail. And tell Yugi 
                         San to come here." 
                     
                     
                         When the tiny woman pattered 
                         in, she looked so much like a wee 
                         Madame Butterfly in her native 
                         kimono, that Paula almost said, 
                     
                     
                         "What a darling maid!" But she 
                         would not let herself praise Red's 
                         establishment. 
                     
                     
                         "Make Miss Paula comfortable in 
                         the guest room," he ordered 
                         smoothly. "Dinner in an hour." 
                     
                     
                         Both Yugi San and her husband, 
                         Koti, seemed to speak so little 
                         English, and they looked at their 
                         master with such doglike devotion 
                         that Paula realized it would be use- 
                         less to appeal to them for help. 
                     
                     
                         "Perhaps you would like to dress 
                         for dinner," Red was saying suavely. 
                         He handed Paula the box of clothes 
                         from her car. How strange the 
                         black box with its gold letters, 
                         "Rosalie," looked here! 
                     
                     
                         In the tiny guest room, she de- 
                         cided not to dress. But on second 
                         thought, why not? Why not give 
                         this disdainful young bandit who 
                         had no place for girls in his life an 
                         eyeful? 
                     
                     
                         Standing at last in the long, 
                         severe dress of heavy white faille 
                         which incased her form like the un- 
                         opened sheath of a lily bud, her eyes 
                         gleamed mischievously. She was

                         beautiful and she knew it. Dis- 
                         missing Yugi San, she turned 
                         proudly before the mirror, kicking 
                         aside the fascinating little fishtail 
                         train that swept the floor. The 
                         gown was demurely high in front, 
                         but low to the vanishing point in 
                         the back, revealing the smooth 
                         shoulders that hours with dancing 
                         masters and on horseback had given 
                         her. From head to foot she was 
                         chastely white, not a hint of color 
                         except her own gold-brown hair and 
                         carmine lips. She stretched luxur- 
                         iously, loving the feel of the stiff silk 
                         on her ivory body, wondering how 
                         certain slate-colored eyes would look 
                         when they saw her. 
                     
                     
                         There was a little cough at the 
                         door. 
                     
                     
                         "Dinner is served, Miss Paula." 
                         She jumped in amazement. A tall, 
                         black-haired butler stood there, im- 
                         maculate in evening clothes. 
                     
                     
                         "Benson!" Paula rushed to him in 
                         surprise. Benson, the substitute 
                         butler who had worked in her home 
                         when the regular man was ill. 
                     
                     
                         That strange ringing voice that 
                         sometimes cracked like a whip, 
                         sometimes stroked her like a caress! 
                         The puzzle which her mind had been 
                         trying to solve was suddenly clear. 
                     
                     
                         "You, Red, and the butler, Ben- 
                         son, are the same! You got that 
                         place in my home just to find out 
                         about me. Thinking you a servant, 
                         I never looked at you closely, but 
                         now I know! But the red hair-" 
                     
                     
                         "A red wig is the best disguise I 
                         know," he said. "People hardly look 
                         further than that. And I know lots 
                         about you. I've watched you come 
                         and go, listened to your telephone 
                         conversations. I've seen you going 
                         reluctantly to Monty Lewis's arms, 
                         and take his kisses coldly." 
                     
                     
                         "Ah," said Paula, "you cad!" 
                     
                     
                         "Forgive me. All part of my 
                         game." He stepped close to the taut  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         little figure in the beautiful stiff 
                         dress, and his glance appraised her 
                         charm. 
                     
                     
                         "You don't love him," he said 
                         coolly. "You will never go back to 
                         him. Oh, I've seen you, in all sorts 
                         of garbs, in riding breeches, in lacy 
                         negligee. I've stood so close beside 
                         your chair when you dined, I could 
                         have laid my lips to your quivering 
                         shoulder." The strange thrilling 
                         voice was caressing now. "And I've 
                         had intimate glimpses, through half- 
                         opened doors of you, all dewy from 
                         sleep, cuddling against satin pillows 
                         for your breakfast in bed." 
                     
                     
                         Dazed, a warm riot of feeling 
                         coursing through her, Paula stood, 
                         powerless to move while he placed 
                         his hand, tinglingly magnetic, on the 
                         silky smoothness of her bare back. 
                         Two pair of eyes, startled, looked 
                         into each others. For a long mo- 
                         ment, they stood thus. 
                     
                     
                         "You see, I could have kidnaped 
                         you for quite another reason, if I let 
                         myself go. But my will shuts 
                         women out. Getting that money 
                         back is my one obsession!" His 
                         voice cracked again. He took his 
                         hand away, leaving Paula shivering. 
                     
                     
                         "After the job is over, you will be 
                         safe. No one will suspect you. And 
                         I shall disappear over the Mexican 
                         border. I know a place where 
                         neither car nor plane can follow. 
                         With a fast horse under me, and a 
                         jingle of spurs, I'll be gone, and you 
                     
                     
                         you will find Eric's arms waiting 
                         for you. Eric is a handsome blond 
                         devil, after all." 
                     
                     
                         After all! A little drearily, 
                         Paula's heart echoed the words. 
                         She could do worse, she thought, re- 
                         luctantly tearing her glance from 
                         the dashing Red. At least, Eric 
                         would always have money to take 
                         care of her, and if he asked her 
                         again to marry him, under a golden 
                         California moon-

                         "Righto!" cried Red. "You're 
                         thinking of Eric, and Eric's love." 
                     
                     
                         A chime of dainty bells sounded. 
                     
                     
                         "Shall we go in to dinner, 
                         milady?" Gravely, Red offered his 
                         arm, gravely, Paula took it. A 
                         small table was set in the living 
                         room. 
                     
                     
                         The hour that followed left its 
                         impress on Paula for life. Dining 
                         opposite a charming man in impec- 
                         cable clothes, one who had once be- 
                         longed to the world she know, it 
                         was hard to believe he had brought 
                         her here by force. It must be true 
                         that he was Jack Delafield. She had 
                         heard of the family, remembered 
                         vaguely that they had lost their 
                         money somehow. 
                     
                     
                         Obviously, he was used to playing 
                         host. His ringing voice told her de- 
                         lightful things, and her laugh 
                         tinkled out. It was a delicious sit- 
                         uation, with just a spice of danger. 
                         He had told her he did not want 
                         her, yet she wondered if his eyes 
                         did not tell a different tale. 
                     
                     
                         The maid pattered to and fro with 
                         enticing foreign dishes; and the three 
                         red roses she had arranged with the 
                         artistic skill of the Japanese slowly 
                         opened in the warmth of the room 
                         like hearts of love, baring their vo- 
                         luptuous breasts to the kiss of the 
                         candlelight. 
                     
                     
                         Paula and Red sat long over 
                         coffee and cigarettes, until at last 
                         the candles burned low. The harsh 
                         lines were almost erased from his 
                         face, giving him a different look. 
                         What a shame, Paula was thinking, 
                         for a man like this to be drawn into 
                         crime! She felt an intense longing 
                         to help him, save him from himself. 
                         If she pretended to fall in with his 
                         plans, surely some way would be 
                         opened up to stop him from this 
                         awful thing! 
                     
                     
                         Something of what she was think- 
                         ing must have showed in her face.  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         With his usual clairvoyance, he put 
                         his hand forcefully on hers. 
                     
                     
                         "Don't get the idea of reforming 
                         me. I'm not worth it, and there's 
                         no use." 
                     
                     
                         The lines came back to his face. 
                         He crushed out his cigarette. 
                     
                     
                         "You are tired," he said abruptly. 
                         "Time for bed." 
                     
                     
                         Uneasiness laid hold on her again. 
                         It was so quiet there; perhaps he had 
                         sent the servants away. Perhaps 
                         she was alone with him. 
                     
                     
                         "Afraid?" he accused. "Must I 
                         explain again that although you are 
                         a prisoner, you are entirely safe 
                         with me? Yugi San is already 
                         asleep on her pallet in your room." 
                     
                     
                         "You" -faltered Paula, trust in 
                         him rushing over her. "You are 
                         nice. Good to me. I'll never be 
                         afraid of you again!" 
                     
                     
                         The city was dimmed by a light 
                         fog when they got away the next 
                         morning. Red's plane was ready at 
                         the airport, and Yugi San and Koti 
                         looked like dwarfs in their funny 
                         leather jackets and goggles. Paula 
                         could have called for help again and 
                         again as they crossed the city, but 
                         something stopped her. She told 
                         herself with a hammering heart that 
                         she didn't want to go back on Red. 
                         She wanted to see this thing 
                         through! 
                     
                     
                         The trip across country was one 
                         long thrill. Paula was not surprised 
                         when they reached Santa Barbara 
                         to find that Red had engaged rooms 
                         at a quiet hotel. Yugi San was her 
                         maid; Koti, his man. 
                     
                     
                         Then Red outlined his final plans. 
                         That night, there was to be a 
                         masked ball, at a beautiful resort on 
                         the beach. He had gotten cards, for 
                         he still had friends in Santa Barbara. 
                         Paula was to go with him, in mask, 
                         find Eric, flirt with him, get what in- 
                         formation she could about the

                         money. Red needed to know the 
                         exact day it was to be in the bank. 
                         On the actual day of the hold-up, 
                         she was to gain entrance by a side 
                         door, just before opening time, 
                         counting on Eric letting her in, then 
                         manage to keep his attention until 
                         Red did his work. Red had learned  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         that Eric was the only officer who 
                         kept a gun in his desk. He kept 
                         telling Paula they must not fail 
                         now, must not! 
                     
                     
                         "Suppose I refuse to do all this?" 
                         she asked her eyes flashing. 
                     
                     
                         "You won't refuse," he said 
                         quietly, his eyes compelling. "I 
                         know. I have another 
                         hunch!"  
                     
                         And that strange 
                         power she had felt ever 
                         since she'd known him 
                         stretched, taut as a 
                         wire, between them.  
                 
                 
                      Now was her mo-ment. Was she go-ing to help Red, or tell Eric every-thing? A rustle showed where Red was hiding, a
                            re-volver smothered in the lace ruffle at his wrist.

                         The ball was in full swing that 
                         night when a tall cavalier in plum- 
                         colored satin, buckled shoes and 
                         powdered wig, with a languishing 
                         lady in bouffant Dresden flowered 
                         taffeta on his arm, presented their 
                         cards at the exclusive club. The 
                         costumes were rented from an 
                         agency, but what did that matter? 
                         Under the crystal shaded candles, 
                         they glittered and shone. The pol- 
                         ished floors were crowded and ex- 
                         citement made Paula's breath come 
                         fast. Where in all that throng was 
                         Eric? 
                     
                     
                         Soon she spotted him, resplendent 
                         in black velvet with rhinestone or- 
                         naments. No disguise could hide 
                         his complacent bearing, the blue 
                         eyes that had always been a little 
                         shrewd. She managed to slip into 
                         his arms. 
                     
                     
                         "Eric," she whispered mysteri- 
                         ously, "are you glad to see me?" 
                     
                     
                         He started violently. "Who are 
                         you?" 
                     
                     
                         "Don't you know my perfume of 
                         jasmine flowers, Eric? 
                     
                     
                         "Paula!" He held her closer. 
                         "Where did you drop from?" 
                     
                     
                         "From the skies! Literally! 
                         Brought here by a young hero who 
                         swept me off my feet." 
                     
                     
                         "Where is Monty Lewis?" 
                     
                     
                         "In Canada," Paula replied 
                         calmly. "I've left him. I'm never 
                         going back." 
                     
                     
                         "Darling!" His voice grew thick. 
                         Paula noticed he had grown stouter 
                         since she'd seen him, and the blue 
                         eyes were shrewder. 
                     
                     
                         "Come outside," he was saying, 
                         "so we can'talk." 
                     
                     
                         Trailing through the door on 
                         Eric's arm, Paula quivered with the 
                         suspense of it all. Now was her mo- 
                         ment. Was she going to help Red, 
                         or tell Eric everything? 
                     
                     
                         In the darkness, half hidden by 
                         a tangle of yucca, she saw a certain  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         cavalier in plum-colored satin fol- 
                         lowing them. It was like some 
                         dramatic moment on the silver 
                         screen. She and Eric sat on a 
                         marble bench under pomegranate 
                         trees, the ocean breeze fanning their 
                         heated faces. A rustle that was not 
                         the wind showed where Red was 
                         hiding, a revolver smothered in the 
                         lace ruffle at his wrist. 
                     
                     
                         She let Eric put his arms about 
                         her, the powder from her bare 
                         shoulder making patches on the 
                         glistening black of his coat. 
                     
                     
                         "Paula, you ran away from 
                         Monty. You came to me! I'll 
                         never let you go back to him, never! 
                         I'm mad about you, Paula. More 
                         than ever. You've got to marry me 
                         to-morrow." He silenced her reply 
                         with a forceful kiss. "If I can wait 
                         that long." 
                     
                     
                         The bushes rustled. Paula smiled 
                         grimly. Did the cavalier in plum- 
                         colored satin like the sample of 
                         love-making he had forced on her? 
                     
                     
                         "Listen, sweetheart." Eric's com- 
                         placent voice was taking a great 
                         deal for granted. "I'm making lots 
                         of money. We're in on a big deal 
                         now. See this telegram! He struck 
                         a match to show her. It says that 
                         at dawn to-morrow, nearly a quarter 
                         of a million will be sent from Mexico 
                         by secret messenger, to be stored 
                         in the smaller vault of our bank till 
                         we can divide it. Just myself and 
                         three others. My share will be 
                         more than fifty thousand. That will 
                         be your wedding present. We'll be 
                         married and play around with it on 
                         a honeymoon in Europe!" 
                     
                     
                         Paula's breath stopped like a cur- 
                         rent that has been shut off. To- 
                         morrow! The thing Red had been 
                         planning, living for, the thing that 
                         had seemed somewhere in the future, 
                         was upon them like an avalanche! 
                     
                     
                         Another thought burst like a 
                         bomb through her dizzy brain. Red

                         had never told her that Eric him- 
                         self was one of that gang of four 
                         men, the thieving, murderous gang 
                         that had helped kill Red's father 
                         and ruin his life! She shrank from 
                         Eric with loathing. She had known 
                         he was ruthless, shrewd, but not a 
                         thief! How had she ever imagined 
                         she loved him? 
                     
                     
                         "What do you say, darling?" he 
                         insisted fatuously. 
                     
                     
                         The world turned crimson for 
                         Paula. She wanted revenge for Red. 
                         She wanted to help him. She 
                         wanted to follow him anywhere, 
                         everywhere, even if he were a fugi- 
                         tive from justice into the desert, 
                         into the mountain, clinging with him 
                         on the fast horse with jingling spurs. 
                         Oh, if he would only let her go with 
                         him! Why, she'd freeze or starve, 
                         just to be near him, just to have 
                         him kiss her carelessly now and 
                         then for she loved him, loved him, 
                         loved him! Why hadn't she known 
                         it before? 
                     
                     
                         Then she remembered. Red did 
                         not want her. Red would never take 
                         her. 
                     
                     
                         She got up stiffly. "I'll let you 
                         know to-morrow, Eric," she said in 
                         choked tones, and her face wet with 
                         tears, rushed back into the ballroom. 
                     
                     
                         The chill of dawn came into the 
                         hotel room which she shared with 
                         Yugi San, and found her haggard, 
                         unsleeping. All night long she had 
                         lain there trying to think of a way 
                         to keep Red from committing this 
                         crime. Although he felt the money 
                         was rightfully his, if he took it as 
                         he planned, he would be hunted 
                         down like an animal. His danger, 
                         his suffering, cut her as if her throb- 
                         bing heart had been laid bare. 
                         Alternately with this feeling, came 
                         the glory, the sweet shame of her 
                         love for him. She was proud of 
                         loving him; Jack Delafield, smooth,  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         suave man of charm, and Red- 
                         glorious Red, the bandit, who had 
                         forced her to drive off with him, and 
                         who now held her soul in the hollow 
                         of his strong brown hand. 
                     
                     
                         It rushed over her in wave after 
                         wave that left her weak and trem- 
                         bling. The kisses of Monty and 
                         Eric were nothing, nothing. She 
                         had never been desired by any man, 
                         because Red did not want her; she 
                         had never been kissed by any man, 
                         because Red had denied her his lips! 
                         Yet she was powerless to save him. 
                         After it was over, he would ride 
                         away and leave her. Only a love 
                         pawn in his game! 
                     
                     
                         Red's knock at the door sounded 
                         like the trump of doom. She felt 
                         like a prisoner going to her execu- 
                         tion when they slipped down to the 
                         comer near the bank, shivering 
                         under their coats. A small rented 
                         car waited near by. In it, Red was 
                         to make a dash for the border where 
                         the fast horse waited, and Paula, 
                         unsuspected, would be left free to 
                         take the first train home, or stay in 
                         California with Eric. 
                     
                     
                         "Good-by, Paula, and forgive me. 
                         You're a great little girl!" 
                     
                     
                         Paula could hardly see the dark 
                         head, the slate-gray eyes, for her 
                         tears. In a few moments now- 
                         Why, it couldn't be! She couldn't 
                         bear it! 
                     
                     
                         "Red," she said desperately. 
                     
                     
                         "Don't- don't do this thing! Don't 
                         brand yourself for life! In your 
                         heart, you know it's wrong. Don't 
                         mind about me. I don't matter. I 
                         don't count. Kick me aside. I 
                         won't tell. Only get away, and start 
                         your life somewhere else. 
                     
                     
                         His face grew so dark, she thought 
                         he was going to strike her. 
                     
                     
                         "No!" he cried. "No, no, no!" 
                         For a moment, Paula stood still 
                         on the bare street corner, the wind 
                         whipping her skirts. 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 The Love Pawn 71 
                 
                     
                     
                         "All right," she said shortly. 
                     
                     
                         "let's get going." 
                     
                     
                         She had tried. It was no use. 
                         She would follow him anywhere! 
                     
                     
                         She shut her eyes so she would 
                         not see him when he left her to wait 
                         near the door. 
                     
                     
                         The corner clock struck eight. At 
                         eight-thirty, Red had told her, the 
                         time lock on the vaults went off. At 
                         eight-fifteen, Eric came hurrying 
                         around the corner, ready to go on 
                         duty. 
                     
                     
                         "Good morning!" said Paula, 
                         placing herself in his way, smiling 
                         her prettiest. "Why in such a 
                         hurry?" 
                     
                     
                         He stopped short, amazed. 
                         "Paula, I didn't expect to see you 
                         here." 
                     
                     
                         She cast down her lashes. "Well, 
                         I got to thinking about last night 
                         and-" 
                     
                     
                         Eagerly, he drew her through the 
                         side door of the as-yet-unopened 
                         bank. 
                     
                     
                         "Come into my little cage, darling, 
                         where we can'talk. You promised 
                         to let me know to-day, sweet." 
                         Complacently, he took her hands in 
                         his. 
                     
                     
                         Paula looked wildly about her. 
                         The shades of the bank were drawn, 
                         the big front door shut. No one 
                         was about, except the janitor and 
                         another early worker. Outside, she 
                         had a glimpse of Red. He was sig- 
                         naling her. Her heart flew to her 
                         throat when she saw he had not put 
                         on the disguise, after all. Ah, the 
                         foolish bravado. There he was, 
                         dark hair, slate-colored eyes, ready 
                         to come in and do this awful thing! 
                         If she could only save him, the man 
                         she loved! 
                     
                     
                         The clock struck eight-thirty. 
                         And at the sound of that one stroke, 
                         a plan so simple, yet so daring burst 
                         full-born into her reeling brain, that 
                         she turned to ice at the very  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         thought. It was the sight of Eric's 
                         gun that made her think of it. 
                     
                     
                         "Eric, darling," she murmured, 
                         and slipped into his arms. With one 
                         quick gesture, she had the gun in 
                         her own hands. She turned on him. 
                     
                     
                         "Put them up!" she cried hoarsely. 
                     
                     
                         "Quick! And unlock the small vault 
                         and hand over that quarter of a 
                         million!" 
                     
                     
                         "Paula. Quit joking!" 
                     
                     
                         "Come one step nearer, and see 
                         who's joking! To the vault, I say"  
                     
                         Something in her white face and 
                         set lips halted Eric. The janitor 
                         and the other man came running, 
                         only to find themselves lined up, 
                         also. 
                     
                     
                         Paula almost smiled at Red s sur- 
                         prised face at the door. She had 
                         taken his play out of his hands and 
                         he didn't know what to do. Little 
                         did he realize what risk a woman 
                         will take for a man when she loves 
                         him! 
                     
                     
                         Quivering with fear that some- 
                         thing would stop her now that she 
                         had begun her dangerous game, she 
                         drove her prisoners before her, made 
                         Eric unlock the vault and give her 
                         the canvas bags of money. A flam- 
                         ing sense of power thrilled her as 
                         she backed to the door, keeping the 
                         trembling trio covered. There was 
                         no sound except the ticking of the 
                         big clock. Outside, on the street, 
                         traffic flowed on, undisturbed. 
                     
                     
                         At the very threshold, Paula 
                         cried in a clear voice, "I'm taking 
                         this money, Eric Kendall, to keep 
                         the man I love from doing it! By 
                         rights, it's really his money. It 
                         doesn't belong to you and your 
                         thieving gang. But we really don't 
                         want the filthy stuff, after all. That 
                         telegram you showed me last night 
                         can be traced, and Jack Delafield 
                         and I will have enough evidence 
                         against you to send you to jail so 
                         fast it will make your hair curl! 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 72 Street &amp; Smith's Love Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         Here take it! I only pretended to 
                         get it, to save him!" 
                     
                     
                         Superbly, she threw the bags of 
                         money on the floor at the frightened 
                         Eric's feet. "Much good it will do 
                         you now! And if there is any pun- 
                         ishment for my little joke, it is I, 
                         and not Jack Delafield who will 
                         have to pay! At least, I have saved 
                         him!" 
                     
                     
                         Sobbing, with great racking sobs 
                         shaking her, Paula ran from the 
                         building. Ran, leaving pande- 
                         monium, uproar behind her. Ran 
                         straight into Red's arms! 
                     
                     
                         Bewildered, he lead her to the car. 
                         "Quick, Paula, get in before that 
                         mob gets you! I don't know what 
                         it all means, but I've got to save 
                         you." 
                     
                     
                         Ah, it was sweet to have him take 
                         care of her, to sit beside him, and 
                         see him take the wheel. She looked 
                         at his brown hand there, and wanted 
                         desperately to put her own under 
                         it. She wanted to snuggle against 
                         him and ride on and on forever. 
                         But, of course, it couldn't be! He 
                         must put her out soon. After all, 
                         she must go back and face the conse- 
                         quences of what she had done. 
                     
                     
                         While for him, there would be the 
                         border, the desert, with a fast horse 
                         under him. But he would not be 
                         hunted. She had saved him from 
                         that! 
                     
                     
                         He careened around a corner, 
                         driving like the wind. 
                     
                     
                         "Red," she said, trying not to let 
                         her lips tremble, "put me out, while 
                         you get away!" 
                     
                     
                         "There is nothing for me to run 
                         from," he said. "I'm just taking 
                         you to safety. As for me, didn't you 
                         notice I came out without my dis- 
                         guise? That was because I decided 
                         not to take that money after all. I 
                         kept trying to signal you, but you 
                         didn't see me. From the first hour 
                         I saw you, Paula, something differ-  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         ent came into my life. But I denied 
                         it bitterly. Kept fighting against 
                         the thing you meant to me. At last, 
                         on that corner back yonder, when 
                         you begged me, you made me see 
                         what a cowardly fool I would be to 
                         carry out my plan. I couldn't go 
                         through with it, that's all! 
                     
                     
                         Far behind, a car was pursuing 
                         them, gaining on them block after 
                         block. 
                     
                     
                         "So," said Paula laughing shakily,

                         "we're being chased for something 
                         neither of us really did! I threw all 
                         the money back." 
                     
                     
                         "I can't understand," he shouted 
                         against the rushing wind, "why you  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         him, against the rushing wind, "be- 
                         cause I love you! And you may not have 
                         any time for women, Jack Delafield, 
                         and your mind may be set on re-  
                 
                 
                      With one quick gesture, she had the gun in her hands. She turned on him. "Put them up!" she cried hoarsely. "Quick!
                            And unlock the small vault and hand over that quarter of a million."  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         pulled off that stunt at all. I 
                         couldn't hear what you were say- 
                         ing. 
                     
                     
                         Paula's hat was off, gold-brown 
                         hair streaming. The suspense and 
                         the danger had made her eyes like 
                         pools of light, her lips were whipped 
                         to a scarlet froth. 
                     
                     
                         "I did it," she shouted back at  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         venge, but you can't get away from 
                         me. You kidnaped me, so here I 
                         am." 
                     
                     
                         "Ah," said the man called Red, 
                         only this time his wonderful voice 
                         was vibrant, low, and he no longer 
                         seemed to be trying to shout 
                         against the rushing wind, "how can 
                         there be any revenge, when you

                         spoiled all that? When you showed 
                         me the right way? And what use is 
                         there for me to run from you, al- 
                         though I wouldn't admit it, you had 
                         me tied the first hour I went into 
                         your home, and watched you one 
                         night, trailing down the stairs, to 
                         meet Monty Lewis? Darling, dar- 
                         ling, I might have known I couldn't 
                         harden my heart against you, you 
                         wonderful, vivid little queen!" 
                     
                     
                         Deliberately, he stopped under a 
                         feathery pepper tree on a side street. 
                     
                     
                         "Let them catch us if they want 
                         to, but first, I'll have my kiss!" 
                     
                     
                         A flame of tender fire enveloped 
                         Paula. His kiss made everything 
                         else in the world seem tame; his 
                         kiss set everything that had hap- 
                         pened before it, into the past. This, 
                         and this only, was the beginning! 
                         Of life and love and rapture. 
                     
                     
                         It was so that Uncle Jerry, in the 
                         pursuing car, found them a few 
                         moments later. Uncle Jerry, who 
                         had trailed Paula across the con- 
                         tinent on the clue of that little crook 
                         to her signature, and who had ar- 
                         rived at the bank to ask news of 
                         Eric, just in time to see her fleeing 
                         with Red! 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         After that, there was nothing else 
                         for Uncle Jerry to do except use his 
                         influence and his check book, in hav- 
                         ing Eric and his crowd brought to 
                         justice. And the newspapers made 
                         a heroine of Paula! 
                     
                     
                         But Red stubbornly refused to let 
                         Uncle Jerry's money do anything 
                         for him. 
                     
                     
                         "Sweetheart," he said, after the 
                         simple ceremony that meant just 
                         another marriage to the clerk, but 
                         heaven to Red and Paula, "do you 
                         realize that you've married a pretty 
                         poor man?" 
                     
                     
                         "Don't try to walk out on me!" 
                         cried Paula, her lips on his. "What 
                         difference does money make? The 
                         little love pawn has taken her 
                         heart's king! For always and 
                         always!" 
                     
                     
                         He crushed her to him and kissed 
                         her- long, thrilling kisses. 
                     
                     
                         "For our honeymoon," said Red 
                         softly, "I know a fast horse that 
                         will carry double!" 
                     
                     
                         And, holding her close in his arms, 
                         he told her of the horse, and of the 
                         tiny cabin in the desert where, under 
                         a star-spangled sky, they would 
                         spend their honeymoon.

                         SHE could hear him puttering 
                         about in his room as she lifted 
                         her hand to knock. Even after 
                         she had rapped on the door, she al- 
                         most turned back to the safety of 
                         her own apartment at the end of 
                         the hall. She didn't know his last 
                         name. He was an inventor, and his 
                         friends called him "Jerry." That 
                         was all she knew, except that she 
                         had been vaguely aware of his dis- 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         approval the few times they had 
                         chanced to meet. 
                     
                     
                         Jerry looked like the sort to con- 
                         demn her for running around with a 
                         bunch of carefree artists, more in- 
                         terested in good times than in art. 
                         He was frightfully serious about his 
                         work. Maybe he needed money, 
                         she thought. It would help her 
                         plans if he did. 
                     
                     
                         Serena smiled her most bewitch-

                         ing smile when he finally opened the 
                         door and faced her with an embar- 
                         rassed grin. 
                     
                     
                         "I thought you were one of my 
                         creditors," he explained. "That's 
                         why I didn't come sooner." 
                     
                     
                         "I hope the surprise is a pleasant 
                         one." She was somewhat embar- 
                         rassed herself. He was handsome in 
                         a blond, clean-cut way, much hand- 
                         somer than she had realized. 
                     
                     
                         "That depends. What can I do 
                         for you, Miss-" 
                     
                     
                         "Goodhue- Serena Goodhue. I'll 
                         tell you if you'll ask me in." She 
                         smiled up at him. 
                     
                     
                         When they were seated in his 
                         plainly furnished apartment, Serena 
                         looked up to meet his puzzled gaze. 
                     
                     
                         "I'm waiting to hear why you 
                         came. I'm very busy, you see." He 
                         waved in the direction of the clut- 
                         tered work table. 
                     
                     
                         "You invent things, don't you?" 
                         Then, when he nodded, "That's why 
                         I think you'll do." 
                     
                     
                         "This is very mystifying. What 
                         can my inventions have to do with 
                         you?" 
                     
                     
                         "My uncle invents things, too. I 
                         want you to marry me." 
                     
                     
                         "Marry you!" he exclaimed. 
                     
                     
                         She laughed at the look on his 
                         face. 
                     
                     
                         "Only for a few weeks," she ex- 
                         plained hastily. "I've just received 
                         word that my uncle is very ill. I 
                         must leave for California to-morrow. 
                         I wrote him some time ago that I 
                         was bringing my husband back 
                         there with me, to settle down." 
                     
                     
                         "It should be an easy matter for 
                         you to find a husband. There are 
                         many eligible men in New York, 
                         and you are very beautiful." His 
                         glance was one of contempt mixed 
                         with admiration. "This is doubtless 
                         your idea of a joke, but I'm really 
                         not interested." He rose as if to end 
                         the interview. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "It's not a joke, and I'm not in- 
                         terested in you, either- not really," 
                         she replied quickly. "The man I 
                         was engaged to jilted me. He mar- 
                         ried another girl a week ago." Her 
                         lips trembled. "I didn't tell Uncle 
                         John his name, and since my uncle 
                         can't live more than a few weeks 
                         longer, I thought maybe, for a thou- 
                         sand dollars, you'd marry me." 
                     
                     
                         "You didn't mention the thou- 
                         sand dollars. I might be interested, 
                         after all." 
                     
                     
                         "It's strictly a business proposi- 
                         tion," she said coldly. "I thought 
                         you might help to make Uncle 
                         John's last days happier, since you're 
                         both interested in the same thing."  
                     
                         He eyed her steadily. "No doubt 
                         you're still in love with the man 
                         who jilted you. Why don't you tell 
                         me your real reason for making this 
                         proposition? You want to save your 
                         face with your friends here in New 
                         York, isn't that it?" 
                     
                     
                         Serena felt the angry color rise 
                         in her cheeks. 
                     
                     
                         "Yes, I still love him. I'll always 
                         love him. Maybe I do want to save 
                         my face, as you put it. But that 
                         isn't my real reason for asking you 
                         to marry me. Please believe that."  
                     
                         He rose to stand in front of her, 
                         his arms folded across his chest. 
                         Looking up at his lean, athletic fig- 
                         ure in worn gray tweeds, Serena was 
                         suddenly ashamed. Here was a man 
                         who took his work seriously, who 
                         lived for an ideal! Perhaps she was 
                         missing something, after all. 
                     
                     
                         "You don't know the meaning of 
                         the word love," he told her gruffly. 
                     
                     
                         "You're selfish and self-centered, 
                         like the rest of that bunch you run 
                         around with. I know what you are- 
                         calling yourselves artists as an 
                         excuse to ignore the conventions, 
                         posing as the real things, when 
                         you're nothing but imitations!" 
                     
                     
                         "I didn't come here to be in- 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 First Payment On Paradise 77 
                 
                     
                     
                         sulted," Serena said, rising to face 
                         him, her brown eyes bright with 
                         anger. "I don't care what you think 
                         of me or my friends. I don't want 
                         to be married to you for even a few 
                         weeks. I'll find some one else." 
                     
                     
                         She turned quickly away from the 
                         look in his eyes. 
                     
                     
                         "Wait!" he commanded. "I'm 
                         sorry I said what I did. I need a 
                         thousand dollars badly. You might 
                         find a man less decent than I am. 
                         I assure you I'd have no desire to 
                         take advantage of the situation." 
                         He laughed boyishly. "I have a 
                         hunch I'd earn the money, coping 
                         with that spirited temper of yours, 
                         if I married you for a few weeks." 
                     
                     
                         "I'd see that you earned it," she 
                         answered, a dimple appearing at the 
                         corner of her mouth. "I'm not 
                         promising that the job will be an 
                         easy one." 
                     
                     
                         "What's your uncle's last name?" 
                         he asked. 
                     
                     
                         "Furman- John Furman. Have 
                         you ever heard of him?" 
                     
                     
                         "I'll say I have! He's one of the 
                         really great inventors. Why didn't 
                         you tell me sooner? I accept your 
                         proposal, if you'll have me." 
                     
                     
                         "I- I don't know," she stam- 
                         mered. It seemed absurdly melo- 
                         dramatic now; her impulsive deci- 
                         sion to run down the hall and ask 
                         a man, who was almost a stranger, 
                         to marry her. She wanted to hurt 
                         Landell Carnes! Hurt him as he 
                         had hurt her. He had thrown her 
                         over for a girl with loads of money, 
                         and had gone abroad with her to 
                         study art. Serena pretended that 
                         she had broken the engagement, but 
                         she knew that her friends suspected 
                         the truth. 
                     
                     
                         "I'll try to make it as easy as I 
                         can for you," Jerry offered gently. 
                     
                     
                         "You've been hurt, but it's mostly 
                         your silly pride. I'm going to take 
                         care of you till you're back home in  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         California." He held out a strong 
                         brown hand. "Shall we shake hands 
                         on our bargain?" 
                     
                     
                         As she put her hand in his, Serena 
                         felt tears dangerously close. She 
                         couldn't bear sympathy now. Her 
                         voice was sharp with pain when she 
                         answered: "Our bargain doesn't in- 
                         clude pity from you. I'm quite 
                         capable of taking care of myself. If 
                         you think you'll be able to stand 
                         me for a few weeks, we'll be mar- 
                         ried this afternoon." 
                     
                     
                         She turned and hurried out of the 
                         room, to the haven of her own at- 
                         tractive apartment. 
                     
                     
                         His name was Jerome Brandon, 
                         and he did have decent clothes to 
                         be married in. Serena was thank- 
                         ful that she hadn't offered to buy 
                         him a new outfit. He probably had 
                         a lot of silly pride, himself. She 
                         wished her friends could see her new 
                         husband in his well-tailored dark- 
                         blue suit. He was far handsomer 
                         than any of the men she knew. 
                         There was nothing about Jerry to 
                         be ashamed of. When she gave him 
                         money for the expenses of the trip, 
                         he accepted it casually, without any 
                         sign of embarrassment. 
                     
                     
                         The hours that followed were like 
                         a hectic nightmare. It was not until 
                         after they were on the train, headed 
                         for California, that Serena curiously 
                         removed the worn old ring from her 
                         finger. Jerry had placed it there 
                         during the ceremony. Some initials 
                         were inside, and the inscription: 
                         "Love Everlasting." 
                     
                     
                         "Love everlasting," she repeated 
                         to herself, and laughed mirthlessly. 
                         Her husband had a most peculiar 
                         sense of humor. Here she was, mar- 
                         ried to a man she barely knew, while 
                         her whole being was crying out for 
                         Landell. Dear, handsome Landell, 
                         who had broken her heart as care- 
                         lessly as he had won it. 
                     
                     
                         Jerry's cool acceptance of the

                         situation was more than Serena had 
                         bargained for. He saw that she was 
                         comfortable, that she had magazines 
                         and cigarettes, then left her, his  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         became ill, Serena glanced at Jerry. 
                         He was looking indifferently, 
                         his lips set in a straight line.  
                     
                         "It's part of your job to pretend  
                 
                 
                      Serena had thought that Landell was the only man who could thrill her, and here she was trembling because Jerry had
                            pressed his lips to hers. The knowledge made her angry with herself and with Jerry, who had kissed her merely as a
                            friend.  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         bride, alone, sunk in an abyss of 
                         misery. 
                     
                     
                         When they drove up before the 
                         rambling Spanish house that her 
                         uncle had built shortly before he 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         to like me," she reminded him 
                         sharply.  
                     
                         "I do like you, Serena." He 
                         turned to look into her eyes. "In 
                         spite of myself, I find I like you. 
                         I'll play the rôle of devoted young

                         husband when we're with your 
                         uncle." 
                     
                     
                         "I didn't mean that," she said, 
                         and flushed because his eyes were 
                         laughing. 
                     
                     
                         "Pretty setting," he said, chang- 
                         ing the subject quickly. 
                     
                     
                         "It's beautiful here," she agreed 
                         dully. 
                     
                     
                         The very brightness of the scene 
                         made her feel tired and miserable, 
                         as if she had already lived her life, 
                         and had come to this lovely spot to 
                         die. The red tile roof of the house 
                         gleamed in vivid contrast to the  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         green of the grass and foliage. 
                         Everything was bathed in Califor- 
                         nia sunshine. If she had only been 
                         coming home with Landell, instead 
                         of Jerry! Her longing to see him 
                         was at times almost physical pain. 
                     
                     
                         "This is my husband," she heard 
                         herself saying to her uncle's nurse, 
                         who met them on the patio and 
                         kissed Serena with the freedom of 
                         long service. 
                     
                     
                         "Your uncle is so happy about 
                         your marriage," she said after she 
                         had shaken hands with Jerry." He 
                         has been looking forward to the day 
                         when you return home with the 
                         man you love." 
                     
                     
                         She led the way to a far wing of 
                         the house, where the sick man had 
                         his quarters. Serena choked back 
                         her tears when her uncle took her 
                         hand in his and said feebly, "My 
                         little girl has come back to me. She 
                         has some one to care for her after 
                         I'm gone." 
                     
                     
                         He looked at Jerry, then, as if 
                         satisfied with what he saw: "You 
                         are a lucky fellow. Serena may 
                         have seemed thoughtless at times, 
                         but underneath she's fine and true." 
                     
                     
                         "I know that, sir," Jerry said so 
                         emphatically that Serena looked at 
                         him quickly to see if he meant it. 
                     
                     
                         "I'd like to live long enough to 
                         see your children running about the 
                         place, but that can't be." 
                     
                     
                         Serena looked away to keep Jerry 
                         from seeing the flush that spread 
                         over her face. When she glanced 
                         back at him, she was surprised to 
                         find that his eyes were gentle. She 
                         liked Jerry, in spite of herself. He 
                         was so straightforward, so much 
                         worth while. 
                     
                     
                         At breakfast the following morn- 
                         ing, he greeted her with boyish en- 
                         thusiasm. 
                     
                     
                         "It's a privilege to be here with 
                         your uncle. He's a great inventor, 
                         and he's a grand old man, besides."

                         "I'm glad. It will make things 
                         easier," she said, seating herself op- 
                         posite him. 
                     
                     
                         She had put on a becoming red- 
                         and-white knitted sports dress. 
                         Jerry didn't comment on her ap- 
                         pearance, but his blue eyes held 
                         approval. 
                     
                     
                         "Your uncle sent for me early this 
                         morning. We had a nice chat about 
                         your future. Our future," he cor- 
                         rected himself. "That's good!" 
                     
                     
                         "You didn't let him suspect any- 
                         thing!" She looked at him sharply. 
                         Fear filled her heart. 
                     
                     
                         "Trust me, Serena. I let him do 
                         most of the talking. This is going 
                         to be one of the most wonderful ex- 
                         periences of my life. Your uncle 
                         has given me permission to use his 
                         lab. Isn't that an honor?" Then, 
                         in answer to the question in her 
                         eyes: "I've been trying to put across 
                         a little gadget of mine. That's why 
                         I went into this deal." 
                     
                     
                         "You've told me very little about 
                         yourself," she reminded him. 
                     
                     
                         "Didn't think you'd be interested. 
                         If I put this invention of mine over, 
                         it will mean everything to some one 
                         waiting for me back home. Some 
                         one I love very much," he added 
                         tenderly. 
                     
                     
                         "I understand," she murmured. 
                         Jerry was in love, and he hadn't told 
                         her. She had confided in him, and 
                         he had kept silent about his own 
                         affairs. She might have known that 
                         any man as nice as Jerry would have 
                         a girl. 
                     
                     
                         "I've bored you with my troubles, 
                         when you have plenty of your own. 
                         I do hope you can put your inven- 
                         tion across." 
                     
                     
                         "I'm being paid to listen to your 
                         troubles," he said with his appeal- 
                         ing, boyish smile. "Anyway, I 
                         haven't been bored." 
                     
                     
                         He was laughing at her. She rose 
                         with dignity. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "You're making fun of my un- 
                         happiness. Just because you have 
                         some one waiting for you, to share 
                         your success, you make light of my 
                         misery. I- I wish I could die!" she 
                         cried, tears filling her eyes. 
                     
                     
                         He rose to face her across the 
                         table. 
                     
                     
                         "I wouldn't make light of your 
                         unhappiness, but I wish you'd for- 
                         get that cad you were engaged to. 
                         He isn't worth breaking your heart 
                         over." 
                     
                     
                         "He isn't a cad. You have no 
                         right to say that. you don't even 
                         know him. He married another girl 
                         because he owes it to his art to get 
                         ahead. He still loves me, I know 
                         he does." 
                     
                     
                         "And he turned down a love like 
                         yours for the sake of his art." He 
                         came around the table and took 
                         hold of her shoulders. "I want to 
                         be your friend, Serena." He bent 
                         his blond head and kissed her softly, 
                         full on her lips. "Just to seal our 
                         friendship," he said, not quite stead- 
                         ily. 
                     
                     
                         Serena put her right hand up to 
                         her lips. Jerry had kissed her! She 
                         had thought that Landell was the 
                         only man who could thrill her, and 
                         here she was trembling because 
                         Jerry had pressed his lips to hers. 
                         The knowledge made her angry with 
                         herself and with Jerry, who had 
                         kissed her merely as a friend, be- 
                         cause he loved another girl. 
                     
                     
                         "Never do that again," she de- 
                         manded. "A gentleman would re- 
                         spect our bargain." 
                     
                     
                         He smiled down at her. 
                     
                     
                         "Forgive me. You looked so lit- 
                         tle and sweet and unhappy." 
                     
                     
                         In a few days Serena realized that 
                         Jerry was avoiding her. She knew 
                         that he was spending most of his 
                         time in her uncle's lab in the base- 
                         ment. She stood it as long as she 
                     
                 
                 LS-5E 
             
             
                 
                 First Payment On Paradise 81 
                 
                     
                     
                         could, then went down and knocked 
                         sharply on the closed door. 
                     
                     
                         "Come in," he called. 
                     
                     
                         He glanced up from his work, 
                         scarcely seeming to see her. 
                     
                     
                         "You seem to be busy these days," 
                         she said, watching his long fingers 
                         move expertly over the machinery 
                         on the table. 
                     
                     
                         "Yes, I'm pretty busy," he 
                         grunted. 
                     
                     
                         "Isn't that Uncle John's invention 
                         you're working on?" 
                     
                     
                         "Just looking it over. Too bad 
                         he couldn't finish it." He didn't 
                         glance up. 
                     
                     
                         "He spent years working on that 
                         invention. You have no right to 
                         disturb his things. I forbid it." 
                     
                     
                         "Your uncle has something here," 
                         he said, looking up at her, his whole 
                         face alight. "You don't understand 
                         what this means." 
                     
                     
                         "I can't see why it should mean 
                         anything to you," she answered, 
                         and turned and left the room. 
                     
                     
                         That night her uncle grew worse. 
                         When the doctors told Serena that 
                         it was only a matter of hours, she 
                         went in search of Jerry. He was not 
                         in his room. She finally found him 
                         in the lab. She opened the door 
                         softly. He was working furiously 
                         with grimly set jaw. Working as if 
                         against time. She looked at the 
                         work table quickly. It was her 
                         uncle's invention. 
                     
                     
                         "Jerry!" she cried out. "Why are 
                         you here at this hour?" 
                     
                     
                         "I'm trying to finish some work. 
                         Do you need me?" 
                     
                     
                         "Uncle John is dying. He's ask- 
                         ing for you." 
                     
                     
                         "There won't be time to finish," 
                         she heard him mutter as he followed 
                         her up the narrow basement stairs. 
                     
                     
                         Her uncle died an hour later. It 
                         was to Jerry he spoke his last words: 
                     
                     
                         "Carry on, my boy, and be good to 
                         my little Serena." 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         When Jerry turned away, Serena 
                         saw that his eyes were filled with 
                         tears. Jerry was a good actor, she 
                         thought bitterly. If she didn't 
                         know the truth, she'd believe that 
                         he was really grieved. 
                     
                     
                         As she waited for Jerry in the 
                         library, the day following her uncle's 
                         funeral, Serena's mind was a con- 
                         fused jumble. Jerry would soon go 
                         out of her life forever. She won- 
                         dered how it would seem without 
                         him. She'd miss Jerry terribly. 
                         Miss his quick smile, his eager inter- 
                         est in everything about him. Jerry 
                         was so frank and outspoken, surely 
                         he must be honest. But why had 
                         he been working on her uncle's in- 
                         vention? The doubt arose again to 
                         torture her. Could he have known 
                         about the invention when he mar- 
                         ried her? He could finish it and 
                         present it as his own work, and no 
                         one would be the wiser. But she 
                         wouldn't let herself doubt Jerry. 
                         He was going back to the girl he 
                         loved, and that was that! 
                     
                     
                         He came in quickly, an apology 
                         on his lips. "Sorry to have kept you 
                         waiting. I've been getting my few 
                         belongings together." 
                     
                     
                         "I- I want to thank you- for 
                         everything. You were wonderful to 
                         Uncle John." She studied his face 
                         for any sign of embarrassment or 
                         guilt. His eyes met hers frankly, 
                         fearlessly. 
                     
                     
                         "He was a dear old man. I'll be 
                         better for having known him." 
                     
                     
                         She went over to the desk and 
                         picked up a check. As she handed 
                         it to him, she raised her brown eyes 
                         to meet his intense blue gaze. 
                     
                     
                         "I suppose you'll be going back 
                         to New York soon," he said. "You'll 
                         be happy to get back with your 
                         artist friends." 
                     
                     
                         "I'm not going back, Jerry. 
                         You've made me realize how unim-

                         portant my career is. I'm going to 
                         settle down here, as Uncle John 
                         wished." 
                     
                     
                         "You're a wonderful girl. I want 
                         to apologize for the things I said to 
                         you that first day. I didn't know 
                         you- then." He fingered the check 
                         absently. "I guess I was pretty 
                         rude. Forgive me." 
                     
                     
                         "Every word you said was true. 
                         I didn't make any sacrifices for my

                         wasn't in me, then." 
                     
                     
                         "Of course it was in you. You 
                         just hadn't had any reason to make 
                         sacrifices. These weeks here have 
                         meant everything to me, always re- 
                         member that." 
                     
                     
                         Of course they had meant every- 
                         thing to him, she reflected bitterly. 
                         He could go back to the girl he 
                         loved, with money enough to finance 
                         his invention. 
                     
                     
                         "I hope you'll be very happy, 
                         Jerry," she said slowly, because she 
                         found it very hard to wish him hap- 
                         piness with some one else. "And 
                         now, I guess that closes our business 
                         deal." 
                     
                     
                         Just then a servant came in with 
                         a card. 
                     
                     
                         "The gentleman is waiting in the 
                         study, Miss Serena." 
                     
                     
                         Serena glanced down at the card 
                         in her hand, and her face blanched. 
                         Landell was here, in her house! 
                     
                     
                         "You must excuse me, Jerry," she 
                         faltered. 
                     
                     
                         "Shall I wait?" 
                     
                     
                         "Please." 
                     
                     
                         She walked into the study across 
                         the hall as one in a trance. She 
                         didn't know what she felt or believed 
                         any more. When Landell came to- 
                         ward her with outstretched hands, 
                         she tried to speak, but her stiff lips 
                         could form no words. 
                     
                     
                         "Lovely Serena," he said in his 
                         caressing voice. "I've come back to 
                         you." 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "You've come back," she echoed, 
                         her voice sounding strange and far- 
                         away. "Why? And where is your 
                         wife?" 
                     
                     
                         "I left her. My marriage didn't 
                         turn out the way I expected." He 
                         took both of Serena's cold little 
                         hands in his. "You could always 
                         appreciate what it means to my 
                         work to have the right surround- 
                         ings." 
                     
                     
                         "Wasn't your wife willing to help 
                         with your career?" 
                     
                     
                         "She wouldn't give me time to 
                         work, and she nagged about the bills. 
                         I'm a great artist. I can't be both- 
                         ered with money matters." 
                     
                     
                         Serena studied his face as she had 
                         never consciously done before. He 
                         was handsome, yes, but there was a 
                         weakness about his mouth and chin 
                         that she had never noticed before. 
                         As she looked at the man before 
                         her, Jerry's clean-cut features ap- 
                         peared as clearly as if he stood there 
                         in Landell's place. She saw his 
                         frank blue eyes, his boyish smile. 
                         At that moment she recognized Lan- 
                         dell for the selfish egoist he was. 
                         What a blind little fool she had 
                         been! 
                     
                     
                         I" knew you'd be waiting for 
                         me," he said softly, trying to draw 
                         her into his arms. "You understand 
                         me." 
                     
                     
                         It was as if a veil had been torn 
                         from her eyes. She wanted to 
                         shout aloud for joy. She was free! 
                         Free of the infatuation that had all 
                         but wrecked her life! 
                     
                     
                         "Yes, I understand you," she an- 
                         swered quietly. "I understand you 
                         at last." 
                     
                     
                         "You can make up to me for the 
                         unhappy time I've had," he went 
                         on, misunderstanding. "I suppose 
                         your uncle left you well fixed. We'll 
                         travel, see new places, have a grand 
                         time together." 
                     
                     
                         "I don't love you, Landell," she 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 First Payment On Paradise 83 
                 
                     
                     
                         barely whispered, "I 
                         know now that I never 
                         loved you." 
                     
                     
                         "Of course you love 
                         me. You're crazy about 
                         me. I don't blame you 
                         for wanting to punish 
                         me, though." 
                         He drew her to him, 
                         despite her efforts to 
                         free herself. As he bent 
                         his lips to hers, she 
                         looked over his shoulder 
                         to see Jerry's face at the 
                         door. He disappeared 
                         down the hall as she 
                         jerked herself free. 
                     
                     
                         "I don't love you. I 
                         have only contempt for 
                         you. I'm in love with 
                         my husband. My hus- 
                         band- do you hear?" 
                     
                     
                         "Then it s true that you are mar- 
                         ried. But we can get rid of him 
                         easily enough." 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, yes, that will be easy," she 
                         said bitterly. "In fact, I'm rid of 
                         him already. 
                     
                     
                         "Then what is wrong?" he asked 
                         impatiently. 
                     
                     
                         I'll tell you what is wrong. I've 
                         thrown away my chances for hap- 
                     
                 
                 
                      Jerry's 
                         arms were 
                         about her. 
                         He was 
                         whispering 
                         all the 
                         endearing 
                         things she 
                         had so 
                         longed 
                         to hear. 
                         She lifted 
                         her lips for 
                         his kisses, 
                         unmindful 
                         of the 
                         group of 
                         people on 
                         the station 
                         platform. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         piness because of a cheap substitute 
                         for love. I married a real man and 
                         didn't have sense enough to appre- 
                         citate him. I wouldn't give the mem- 
                         mory of on of Jerry's smiles for a file- 
                         time with you. Now go!"  
                 
             
             
                 
                 84 Street &amp; Smith's Love Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         But it wasn't so easy to send 
                         Landell away. Serena had to listen 
                         while he enacted the rôle of broken- 
                         hearted lover. While he talked she 
                         heard a car go down the driveway. 
                         Her heart sank. Surely Jerry 
                         wouldn't go like that; without a 
                         word of good-by. 
                     
                     
                         Landell made his dramatic de- 
                         parture at last. Serena rushed out 
                         to the porch just as her car drove 
                         up. The driver stepped out and 
                         touched his cap respectfully. 
                     
                     
                         "Mr. Brandon made his train, 
                         Miss Serena." 
                     
                     
                         "Then he is gone," she said dully. 
                         Her heart felt like lead within her. 
                     
                     
                         She went inside and down to her 
                         uncle's lab as if drawn by an invis- 
                         ible force. Glancing about the room 
                         quickly, she saw that her uncle's in- 
                         vention was gone. Her whole world 
                         toppled about her ears as she buried 
                         her head in her arms on the dusty 
                         table. 
                     
                     
                         "Jerry, darling, how could you?" 
                         she sobbed. "I thought you, at 
                         least, would play fair." 
                     
                     
                         She wanted to die, here in this 
                         room, where her uncle had spent so 
                         much time. In this room that had 
                         meant so much to Jerry. He had 
                         told her that she didn't know the 
                         meaning of love. She knew, now. 
                         Jerry had gone back to the girl who 
                         was waiting for him. Now it was 
                         too late! 
                     
                     
                         She wearily dragged herself up to 
                         her room. A haggard-faced girl 
                         looked back at her from the mirror 
                         of her dressing table. 
                     
                     
                         "Jerry is gone," she told the 
                         image sadly. "He doesn't love me. 
                         He has gone back to her that other 
                         girl, waiting for him." 
                     
                     
                         Her gaze fell on a letter propped 
                         up against one of the ornate bottles 
                         on the dressing table. She opened 
                         it with shaking hands. The check 
                         she had given to Jerry fell into her  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         lap. She read the words through a 
                         blur of tears. 
                     
                     
                         Serena Dear: I'm fading out of the 
                         picture, I wanted to surprise you with news 
                         of the success of your uncle's invention. I 
                         know I can put it over, and it will mean 
                         a nice income for you. Find happiness 
                         with the man you love. The "some one" 
                         waiting for me is my mother. It might 
                         amuse you to learn that I love you with my 
                         whole heart and soul, Jerry. 
                     
                     
                         It was the postscript that brought 
                         a sob to her throat. Just a line, 
                         saying: 
                     
                     
                         I can't take the check. Please accept 
                         my services as a small payment on para- 
                         dise. 
                     
                     
                         Serena could never recall how she 
                         got out of the house and into her 
                         car. When she came to herself she 
                         was thundering out of the drive- 
                         way. The train had been gone for 
                         twenty minutes or more. There was 
                         the bare possibility that she might 
                         overtake it at the first station. As 
                         she drove she prayed: Dear God, 
                         let me be in time. I must ask Jerry 
                         to forgive me. 
                     
                     
                         The California highway gleamed 
                         white in the dusk. On and on! Sev- 
                         enty miles eighty. Once she 
                         thought she heard a train whistle in 
                         the distance. She pressed her foot 
                         down on the accelerator, and the 
                         car reeled crazily onward. She kept 
                         her eyes glued to the ribbon of road 
                         unwinding before her. She'd prob- 
                         ably wreck the car and kill herself, 
                         but she didn't care. She didn't want 
                         to live without Jerry, anyway. 
                     
                     
                         The train was still at the station 
                         when she stopped her car with 
                         shrieking brakes. Breathing a sigh 
                         of thanks, she climbed on the near- 
                         est coach. She was scarcely con- 
                         scious of the curious glances of the 
                         passengers. She knew that her hair 
                         was blown about her face in wildest 
                         confusion. What she didn't realize 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 First Payment On Paradise 85 
                 
                     
                     
                         was that she was altogether lovely 
                         in her yellow sports dress, that en- 
                         hanced the lights in her hair and 
                         eyes; red-brown hair, and hazel 
                         eyes, now dark with excitement. 
                     
                     
                         She found Jerry on the observa- 
                         tion platform. As she took hold of 
                         his arm, the train started to move. 
                     
                     
                         "Jerry!" she cried. "You must 
                         come with me. Hurry!" 
                     
                     
                         "Serena!" 
                     
                     
                         His cry held longing and heart- 
                         break. 
                     
                     
                         "I'll explain later, Jerry. The 
                         train is moving. We must get off." 
                         She pulled at his arm. 
                     
                     
                         He picked her up in his strong 
                         arms and sprang lightly from the 
                         moving train. Putting her on her 
                         feet, he faced her, a stern look in his 
                         blue eyes. 
                     
                     
                         "Now tell me why you are here. 
                         What is wrong?" 
                     
                     
                         Serena hesitated for a moment, at 
                         a loss how to begin. "Nothing is 
                         wrong," she finally said bravely. "I 
                         just came to tell you that I love 
                         you." 
                     
                     
                         Jerry stared at her in amazement. 
                         "You love me? But, darling I 
                         mean, Serena, I saw you in another 
                         man's arms. Please don't torture 
                         me. Tell me what this is all about." 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "I'm not torturing you, and I 
                         didn't want to be in his arms. If 
                         only you'd waited, you'd have heard 
                         me tell him that I love my husband. 
                         Oh, Jerry, won't you please come 
                         back to finish making the pay- 
                         ments on paradise?" 
                     
                     
                         "My dearest one! Paradise is 
                         wherever you are." 
                     
                     
                         Jerry's arms were about her. He 
                         was whispering all the endearing 
                         things she had so longed to hear. 
                         She lifted her lips for his kisses, un- 
                         mindful of the group of people on 
                         the station platform. 
                     
                     
                         "I want a husband for always and 
                         always," she said when she could 
                         get her breath. "Let's go back 
                         home now." 
                     
                     
                         "You mean, let's go back to para- 
                         dise," he corrected her softly, and 
                         stooped to kiss her once more before 
                         he helped her into the car. 
                     
                     
                         As they drove along in the dark- 
                         ness, Serena nestled against her hus- 
                         band s shoulders with a blissful 
                         sigh. Somewhere in the distance a 
                         train whistled lonesomely. She 
                         shuddered, thinking how nearly she 
                         had come to losing this man, who 
                         was her very life, and with whom 
                         she knew she was to find happiness 
                         forever and ever.

                         KATHY'S hair was as brown as 
                         a chestnut fresh from the burr 
                         and as smooth. There were 
                         dancing yellow gleams in it, as 
                         though fires had been lighted at its 
                         roots. All winter she had been let- 
                         ting it grow until now it lay, a 
                         soft coil, low on her neck. She wore 
                         a yellow wool dress that clung to 
                         her slender figure, and was belted 
                         by a wisp of twisted leather, like a 
                         gold chain. 
                     
                     
                         She had gone to the door with 
                         Wade Duncannon and was standing 
                         for a minute with him in the hall. 
                         It wasn't much of a hall. It smelled  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         of cooking, and there were worn 
                         places in the carpet, and the janitor 
                         had forgotten the ceiling lights when 
                         he cleaned, but Wade Duncannon 
                         wasn't thinking of the hall nor the 
                         carpet nor the ceiling lights, and 
                         Kathy knew it, and her heart ached 
                         with pity at the thing she saw in 
                         his eyes. 
                     
                     
                         "You've dove's eyes, Kathy." 
                         And smiling crookedly, he added: 
                         "A guy named Solomon told that 
                         to another woman a good many 
                         thousand years ago, and, if you 
                         remember, Solomon was a married 
                         man, too. A lot more married than

                         I am. That's supposed to be a joke, 
                         Kathy." 
                     
                     
                         But Kathy didn't laugh. She 
                         didn't smile. "I wish you wouldn't, 
                         Wade," she pleaded. "And I wish you 
                         wouldn't keep making excuses for 
                         coming here evenings. Night be- 
                         fore last it was some papers I'd for- 
                         gotten to sign at the office before I 
                         left. Last week it was something 
                         else just as absurd. To-night it's 
                         those bonds. They're in the safe. 
                         You saw me put them there your- 
                         self. And this is my sister's home, 
                         Wade. It isn't mine. Shiela is 
                         beginning to notice and so is Bob." 
                     
                     
                         Before the look in Kathy's honest 
                         gray eyes, Wade's dropped guiltily. 
                         He said, sullenly like a shamed boy: 
                         "I did look in the safe. Honest I 
                         did, Kathy, and I couldn't find 
                         them, and Cameron did want them 
                         in a hurry. He called me at the 
                         club. As for that sister and brother- 
                         in-law of yours, if they don't know 
                         I'm crazy in love with you, they re 
                         blind. 
                     
                     
                         "Kathy dear"- his sullenness 
                         softened to pleading- "it isn't as 
                         though Helen didn't want a divorce. 
                         She does. She's as anxious for one 
                         as I am anxious to give it to her, 
                         but she wants a New York divorce, 
                         where incompatability and mental 
                         cruelty don't go. And I'm just old- 
                         fashioned enough not to let her drag 
                         my name over every paper in this 
                         town for a- a whim. Unless you 
                         -" There was humbleness in his 
                         eyes; humbleness in his stammered 
                         unfinished question. 
                     
                     
                         But, at Kathy's shaken head, his 
                         humbleness was forgotten. He 
                         caught her hands in a tight grasp 
                         and pulled her to him. His dark 
                         eyes bored down into hers, fired with 
                         jealous anger. 
                     
                     
                         "What's the matter with me, any- 
                         way?" he asked. "Thirty isn't old. 
                         I've got money, and a clean past-  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         as men's pasts go. Cleaner than 
                         lots of men I know, or Helen 
                         wouldn't be howling her head off 
                         for a divorce she can't get! It's 
                         another man, that's what it is. You 
                         love some one else. Who is he? If 
                         I knew whom I had to fight! If 
                         I-" 
                     
                     
                         But Kathy's fingers were on the 
                         door, holding it open, and her voice, 
                         clear and final, was carrying out 
                         into the hall, and back into the 
                         living room behind her: 
                     
                     
                         "I'll find those bonds for you to- 
                         morrow, Wade. They're in the safe 
                         right where I put them. I'll come 
                         down early and get them out for 
                         you." And then, Wade's feet were 
                         on the stairs, and Kathy had turned 
                         toward the kitchen, and the half 
                         prepared tray for Shiela, that 
                         Wade s coming had interrupted. 
                     
                     
                         Kathy was glad, almost, of 
                         Shiela's headache that had sent her 
                         early to bed. She was glad that 
                         Bob wouldn't be home until late. 
                         She felt terribly depressed. Wade 
                         was so kind. So good. Even if he 
                         did have a good business and plenty 
                         of money, life had given him a bad 
                         deal. He wanted a home, a good 
                         wife, some one who would be con- 
                         tent to settle down and live a peace- 
                         ful life with him. Kathy knew, too, 
                         that he wanted her. If only she 
                         could go to him. If only she could 
                         let his love infold her, protect her. 
                         If only she could forget this blind, 
                         hopeless devotion for Bob, that she 
                         had hidden so long in her heart! 
                         That last year in the university, she 
                         had been so sure of him, before 
                         Shiela's coming had spoiled it all. 
                         So sure and so happy! Then Shiela 
                         and her frail loveliness, her blond 
                         wistful appeal, had arrived and Bob 
                         was her brother-in-law instead of 
                         her husband, and worshiping at 
                         Shiela's spoiled, indolent little feet. 
                     
                     
                         Kathy sighed, and brushed at her  
                 
             
             
                 
                 88 Street &amp; Smith's Love Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         eyes. Shiela's tray- she must get 
                         it in to her. And those bonds of 
                         Wade's. Strange he couldn't find 
                         them. 
                     
                     
                         She had almost reached the 
                         kitchen, when a noise made her stop, 
                         turn around. It came from the 
                         bedroom. It was Shiela, crying. 
                         Real crying, not the spoiled first-of- 
                         the-month whimpering that could 
                         bring Bob's arms about her in quick 
                         forgiving for a huge pile of unpaid 
                         bills. This was terrible crying. Wild 
                         sobs with terror behind them and 
                         fear. 
                     
                     
                         Kathy ran for the bedroom and 
                         threw open the door. "Shiela!" she 
                         gasped. "Shiela!" For a wild in- 
                         stant her heart almost stopped, at 
                         the sight of the crumpled froth of 
                         lace and silk on the floor at her feet. 
                         But at Kathy's voice, Shiela raised 
                         her head from the arm that had 
                         cradled it, and dragged herself to 
                         her knees. Her blue eyes were 
                         horror-filled, and her tiny face was 
                         twisted with fear. On the floor by 
                         her side was a bottle with the cork 
                         out, and the air was filled with a 
                         sweet, heavy odor. 
                     
                     
                         "Shiela Christie!" Kathy raged, 
                         and snatched at it. "That's the 
                         laudanum Bob got for his toothache! 
                         What are you doing with it? What 
                         does this mean?" But, before she 
                         could move, before she could reach 
                         Shiela, or touch her, Shiela was at 
                         her knees dragging at them crazily, 
                         yelling things at her, horrible things, 
                         about those bonds Wade Duncan- 
                         non had been hunting for; about 
                         being at the office, and seeing them 
                         in the safe, and- 
                     
                     
                         "You mean," Kathy heard her- 
                         self saying slowly, "that you took 
                         those bonds, Shiela?" 
                     
                     
                         "Last week!" Shiela wailed. 
                         "That day when I came in to see 
                         you and you left me alone to hunt 
                         for something in the file room. I-  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         I saw them there, where you had 
                         put them, and- 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, Kathy, don't look at me like 
                         that! Don't! I had to have money. 
                         I just had to. I owed every one! 
                         Things Bob never had heard of. 
                         That fur coat I'd told Bob I'd saved 
                         the money for I paid for it with 
                         my house money, and they wouldn't 
                         take it back, and the grocer said he 
                         was going to sue us! Oh, I was 
                         crazy!" 
                     
                     
                         "But those bonds were worth a 
                         thousand dollars, Shiela!" A thou- 
                         sand dollars! You didn't owe that 
                         much! You couldn't! Where's the 
                         rest of it? Maybe we can make it 
                         up some way- borrow the money." 
                     
                     
                         "It's gone. Every bit of it. It's 
                         gone." Shiela pulled herself to her 
                         feet and stumbling to the bed, threw 
                         herself across it. Her weak face was 
                         swollen with tears. Tears hung heavy 
                         on her long lashes. "A woman I 
                         know who plays the market she- 
                         she told me if I could get some- 
                         thing to use for collateral, she could 
                         make thousands for me. So- so 
                         I gave her five hundred dollars and 
                         was going to get everything back 
                         before you missed it at all. 
                     
                     
                         "How did I know she'd lose it for 
                         me? How did I know the market 
                         would drop like it did? And out 
                         there to-night, when I heard Wade 
                         Duncannon asking you for it, when 
                         I knew they'd find me out- Oh, 
                         I wish I were dead! I do! I do! 
                         I tried to kill myself and I was too 
                         scared even to die! 
                     
                     
                         "They'll send me to jail, and Bob 
                         will hate me! He's so hard about 
                         money, Kathy! So dreadfully hard!" 
                     
                     
                         "Hard!" Kathy's eyes swept the 
                         room, its frivolous lace pillows, its 
                         gaudy toilet table littered with 
                         powders, perfumes and creams. 
                         "Seventy-five dollars a week, Shiela, 
                         and every cent of it turned over to 
                         you! Hard! And now you've

                         brought this on him! Oh, Shiela, 
                         how could you? How could you!" 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "That's right Take Bob's part! 
                         Stand up for him! You're in love 
                         with him! You've always 
                         been in love with him. Be- 
                         fore he asked me to marry 
                         him, you'd have snapped 
                         him up. you're my sister, 
                         yet, right here in my own 
                         house, you're in love with 
                         my husband! You're glad 
                         I'm in this mess. You want 
                         him to leave me, so you 
                         can get him for yourself! 
                     
                     
                         Kathy was sick. Her se- 
                         cret, the secret she had 
                         thought buried so deeply in 
                         her heart, was discovered 
                     
                 
                 
                      Sheila!" gasped Kathy. "Shiela!" For a wild instant her heart almost stopped, at the sight of the crumped figure at
                            her feet.

                         at last. The walls reeled. The floor 
                         swayed. The ivory of her cheeks 
                         was a crimson agony of shame. 
                     
                     
                         Shiela slid to the floor, dragging 
                         the ruffles and satin of her bed with 
                         her. She snatched at Kathy's arm, 
                         her fingers digging cruelly into the 
                         soft flesh. "I'm horrid! I know I 
                         am, Kathy. You've been so good 
                         to us living here when you'd lots 
                         rather have lived alone, and paying 
                         board and all, but I can't help it! 
                         I'm mad! You can help me out of 
                         this, Kathy, and you've got to!" 
                     
                     
                         "Wade Duncannon is crazy about 
                         you. You could tell him anything 
                         and he'd believe it. Tell him you 
                         never put the bonds in the safe at 
                         all that they have been lost, mis- 
                         laid. Tell him-" 
                     
                     
                         "He gave them to me himself," 
                         Kathy interrupted dully. "He stood 
                         there and watched while I put them 
                         in the safe. And no one has the 
                         combination of that safe but Wade 
                         and myself. Not a soul. To-morrow 
                         he ll know they are gone, and-" 
                     
                     
                         "Well, suppose he does find out." 
                         Shiela's words were slow, she kept 
                         her eyes averted. "What if he does? 
                         He- you could do anything and get 
                         away with it, Kathy." 
                     
                     
                         Kathy's voice was very still, as 
                         still as her white face and dove-gray 
                         eyes, when she spoke: "I could let 
                         him think I stole them? Is that 
                         what you mean? Because Wade 
                         Duncannon loves me too much to 
                         harm me, I could let him think me 
                         a thief, to save you?" 
                     
                     
                         "Not to save me alone!" Shiela 
                         wailed. "To save Bob, Kathy! He's 
                         the one who'll suffer most and you 
                         know it. You know what the doc- 
                         tor said about his heart. What any 
                         shock anything sudden or terrible 
                         was liable to do to him?" She 
                         snatched at Kathy's hand, grabbed 
                         from it the still half-filled bottle. 
                         "If you won't help me, Kathy, I'll  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         kill myself! I will. When he comes 
                         home he'll find me dead! And he'll 
                         die, too. The shock will kill him. 
                         you'll be a double murderer, 
                         Kathy!" 
                     
                     
                         She ran for the bathroom, 
                         slammed the door shut, and turned 
                         the key. Kathy pounded on it. 
                         Outside on the stairs she heard the 
                         sound of feet. Bob's feet. Heard 
                         him in the hall, and heard Shiela's 
                         wailed, "Promise! Promise! I'll 
                         never run up another bill, Kathy! 
                         Never! Promise!" 
                     
                     
                         And then, she was unfastening the 
                         burglar chain on the door, with her, 
                         "I promise," still on her lips. 
                     
                     
                         She was grateful for the room's 
                         dimness. Grateful, for the first time 
                         for Bob's brotherly, unseeing eyes. 
                     
                     
                         "H'lo, sis," he mumbled, and 
                         threw his coat and hat onto a chair. 
                         Where's Shiela Hey! Shiela!" 
                     
                     
                         "She's got a headache," Kathy 
                         replied. "She's in the bedroom, Bob. 
                         Better not turn on the lights. 
                         you'll find a cold supper in the ice 
                         box." And going to her room, she 
                         closed her door very quietly on his 
                         anxious, love-filled, "Darling!" It 
                         seemed to her suddenly that she 
                         couldn't bear any more. 
                     
                     
                         In the darkness of her tiny room, 
                         she undressed. It was warm out- 
                         side. Even the air of the great city, 
                         was sweet with the live, soft odor 
                         of spring. Down below a car 
                         honked. There was the low caress 
                         of a man's voice, and the soft laugh 
                         of a happy girl. Somewhere a radio 
                         was playing, some one was singing 
                         a dreamy love song. "Bob! Bob! 
                         Bob!" Kathy sobbed. "For your 
                         sake! For you!" And kneeling by 
                         the window, her brown head on her 
                         bent arm, she cried herself into a 
                         miserable sleep of exhaustion. 
                     
                     
                         When Wade reached his office the 
                         next morning, Kathy was there

                         waiting for him. There were faint 
                         shadows beneath her huge gray eyes, 
                         and against the pallor of her face, 
                         her lips were a splash of crimson. 
                         Because she neither thought of it 
                         nor cared, she never had been so 
                         beautiful. 
                     
                     
                         Looking at her, Wade flushed, and 
                         fumbled with his hat and cane to 
                         hide the starved hunger that shook 
                         him. His voice was casual, even 
                         gruff. 
                     
                     
                         "Those bonds, Kathy? I suppose 
                         you found them. Cameron is com- 
                         ing for them this morning." 
                     
                     
                         There was a strange tenseness 
                         about her silence that brought him 
                         about quickly to meet her eyes. 
                     
                     
                         Inside herself somewhere, Kathy 
                         was telling herself: This isn't true. 
                         It must be a nightmare: I'm dream- 
                         ing. While outside, she was saying, 
                         baldly, her words bleak and toneless 
                         with fright: 
                     
                     
                         "They aren't there, Wade. They 
                         aren't there. I took them. I had to 
                         have money and I took them to play 
                         the market. I had expected to make 
                         a lot of money, but I lost." 
                     
                     
                         His hands were on her shoulders, 
                         turning her to face him. His eyes 
                         were boring into hers. "You what? 
                         he was crying down at her. You 
                         what? Say that again, Kathy! You 
                         did what?" 
                     
                     
                         "I took them. I had to have 
                         money and I took them. It- it-" 
                         She groped wildly for a reason, and 
                         snatched at the first thing her half 
                         crazed mind could grasp Shiela's 
                         reason. "It was a fur coat I owed 
                         for. They were going to sue me, 
                         and I took the bonds, to gamble on 
                         and lost." 
                     
                     
                         "That's a lie," Wade said. His 
                         face was as pale as Kathy's, but his 
                         eyes were hot with quick suspicion. 
                     
                     
                         "You might as well tell me, Kathy. 
                         You took that money to help the 
                         man you love. What is his name?  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         If I can't get it from you, I'm going 
                         to your sister and your brother-in- 
                         law. I'm going to find out." He 
                         was reaching for his hat when Kathy 
                         caught his arm. She wasn't crying, 
                         she was too miserable to cry. But 
                         she was sobbing. Dry, tearless sobs 
                         that tore at her throat. 
                     
                     
                         "Wade! Please! Please not that! 
                         I'll pay you back! I'll do anything, 
                         Wade, if you don't tell them. Any 
                         thing!" 
                     
                     
                         He looked down at her clingin 
                         fingers; looked into her eyes. "You'll 
                         do anything, will you?" he said. 
                     
                     
                         "Anything. Scared, aren't you? 
                         And all for a fur coat! Bosh!" 
                     
                     
                         Crossing to a window, he stoo 
                         there, his arms crossed, looking 
                         moodily down into the street below. 
                         "All right, Kathy," he said at last, 
                         and laughed, and Kathy chilled at 
                         his laughter, it was so cold and 
                         mirthless and hard. "All right. I'm 
                         taking you up on that. You say 
                         you were in trouble; that you had 
                         to have money. You knew I would 
                         have given you ten times that sum 
                         if you wanted it, yet rather than let 
                         me have the pleasure of helping you, 
                         you stole it. 
                     
                     
                         "You owe me a thousand dollars, 
                         Kathy, and you're going to pay it 
                         back. Do you know how?" 
                     
                     
                         Coming close to her, he stood be- 
                         fore her, holding her eyes with his. 
                         It seemed to Kathy she couldn't 
                         have moved had the world come to 
                         an end. She didn't try. 
                     
                     
                         "You are going to spend this 
                         week-end up in the mountains with 
                         me," Wade went on. "I've got a 
                         cottage up in the Catskills, and 
                         you're going there with me. You're 
                         going to be that 'cause for divorce' 
                         that Helen has been wanting me to 
                         give her for so long. And you're 
                         going to give me that kiss I've 
                         starved for and hungered for and 
                         dreamed of." 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 92 Street &amp; Smith's Love Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         The next thing Kathy knew, his 
                         arms were around her, his lips were 
                         on hers, and a wild, strange ecstasy, 
                         was holding her limp and helpless in 
                         his grasp. 
                     
                     
                         When he released her, Kathy 
                         stood, very still and very white, 
                         staring at him. She was shaking; her 
                         teeth were chattering. It wasn't be- 
                         cause she had never been kissed 
                         before; she had. What pretty girl 
                         hasn't? It was that she had wanted 
                         those kisses. That the instant 
                         Wade Duncannon's lips had touched 
                         hers, something had happened to 
                         her. Something wonderful, some- 
                         thing terrible! Something that had 
                         made her forget everything but his 
                         lips on hers. But then she was 
                         remembering again! 
                     
                     
                         "You!" she gasped, her voice 
                         hoarse with fury. "How dare you? 
                         How dare you?" She stared, fasci- 
                         nated, at a muscle that beat and 
                         throbbed in his white face. 
                     
                     
                         "How dare I?" Wade asked, and 
                         laughed. "Does that mean how 
                         dare I kiss you, or how dare I ask 
                         you to go up to the cottage with 
                         me? You women! All alike, aren't 
                         you? Bluff. Promises. You, who 
                         were willing to do anything. Any- 
                         thing!" His words came bitterly 
                         from between twisted lips. "Right- 
                         eous now, aren't you? You weren't 
                         so righteous when you took that 
                         thousand dollars for a fur coat! 
                     
                     
                         "You know I won't make you go 
                         through with it, and- I won't. 
                         you're cheap, just like Helen. 
                         you're cheap and chiseling. But you 
                         win." 
                     
                     
                         He reached for the phone, and got 
                         the outside office. "I want a thou- 
                         sand dollars in gold certificates, 
                         issue L. 19873. Have them here in- 
                         side an hour." Looking up, he faced 
                         a new Kathy. 
                     
                     
                         "I'm not a chiseler, Wade," she 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         said. "I'm ready to kiss you any 
                         time you want me to. I'm ready 
                         to go with you, too. When do we 
                         leave?" There was defiance in her 
                         upraised chin. Her whole air was 
                         defiant, but there was no defiance 
                         in her eyes. Instead there was fear. 
                         The fear of a child facing the dark 
                         and terribly afraid, and try as she 
                         could, Kathy could not hide it. 
                     
                     
                         Wade took her hands. "Kathy, 
                         for months I would have given my 
                         life to have kissed you just once, 
                         as I kissed you now and you haven't 
                         let me touch you. For months you 
                         could have had me, my name, my 
                         love, and you turned them down. 
                         And now you are willing to let my 
                         wife spread your name across the 
                         front page of every newspaper in 
                         this town! You are willing to go up 
                         there to that mountain place of 
                         mine alone, with me, for two nights 
                         and a day, for a fur coat! It doesn't 
                         make sense. 
                     
                     
                         "I want to know his name! I 
                         want the name of the man for whom 
                         you're doing this. I want his name!" 
                     
                     
                         It seemed to Kathy that her heart 
                         was crying. That inside her, she 
                         could feel its tears, but outside she 
                         was quiet and still. Even her voice 
                         was level and controlled. "When- 
                         ever you are ready to go, Wade," 
                         she said, and walked away from him. 
                     
                     
                         In her own office Kathy pulled 
                         out her machine, and went about 
                         her work. She took dictation- 
                         Wade's dictation her fingers 
                         pounding methodically at the keys. 
                         She took messages- Wade's mes- 
                         sages. She listened to his terse, 
                         hastily made plans. 
                     
                     
                         He was to call Helen's attorney 
                         and notify him when Helen could 
                         get her evidence. They were to 
                         leave, he and Kathy that very after- 
                         noon, after work. He said, and 
                         Kathy's cheeks crimsoned miser- 
                         ably: "No need your going home 
                         after clothes. Everything you'll 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Cause For Divorce 93 
                 
                     
                     
                         need will be at the lodge. You're 
                         about Helen's size." And he had 
                         added, his lips twisting wryly, 
                     
                     
                         "You'll have to fix it up with your 
                         family, some way. I'm having no 
                         irate brother-in-law bearing down 
                         on me with a gun." 
                     
                     
                         "You needn't worry," Kathy had 
                         replied and tried to sneer, but the 
                         sneer had quickly turned into a sob. 
                         She ate no lunch. She thought 
                         that food would choke her. But 
                         coming in to her office, Wade said 
                         gruffly, "Go get yourself some coffee. 
                         You look half dead." 
                     
                     
                         She got some coffee, and called 
                         Shiela. Lily, the maid who came 
                         three hours a day to clean, an- 
                         swered the phone. Mis't Christie, 
                         she's out, yassum. . . . No'm, I 
                         dunno whar she is. . . . I'll tell her 
                         to call Mistah Duncannon's office, 
                         yassum, and I'll tell her you ai' t 
                         comin home till Monday, sure I 
                         will." 
                     
                     
                         "She'll get it all twisted," Kathy 
                         thought. And then desperately: 
                         "What difference does it make any- 
                         way? What difference will any- 
                         thing make after Monday?" 
                     
                     
                         At three o'clock, she put on her 
                         hat, and closed her desk. "The last 
                         time I'll be working here," she told 
                         herself. And thinking of the pub- 
                         licity that would follow Wade s 
                         divorce, added: "Or anywhere else, 
                         probably." Taking the elevator 
                         down to the street, she found Wade 
                         waiting there with his car. 
                     
                     
                         His foot on the gas, Wade stared 
                         down at her. "Easier to dance than 
                         pay the piper, isn't it, Kathy?" 
                     
                     
                         "I'm not complaining, am I?" 
                         Kathy asked, and bit at her lips to 
                         still their trembling. 
                     
                     
                         For a long time they rode in 
                         silence. Kathy thought of things. 
                         Of silly, inconsequential things. Of 
                         the people they passed. Whether 
                         they were happy or miserable, as she  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         was. Of the buildings looming 
                         about them, and the secrets they 
                         held. She thought of Wade's place 
                         in the Catskills, of things she had 
                         heard about it. How he had built it 
                         for a honeymoon cottage and never 
                         used it. How he kept it stocked 
                         with food and wouldn't have a tele- 
                         phone, and ran away to it when he 
                         was tired or overworked or wanted 
                         to be alone. 
                     
                     
                         One of the girls from the office 
                         had gone up there once with some 
                         papers for his signing, and had told 
                         about it, her eyes wide with awe. 
                         "It's glorious! Flowers and moun- 
                         tains and a lake all his own, and 
                         electric lights and swell furniture! 
                         And you ought to see the boss in 
                         a bathing suit! And laughing like 
                         a kid!" 
                     
                     
                         Wade in a bathing suit! Wade, 
                         happy and swimming and young! 
                         The Wade who had kissed her and 
                         awakened her heart to love! Shiv- 
                         ering again in memory of that mo- 
                         ment's wild ecstasy, Kathy looked 
                         up to find Wade staring down at 
                         her, and her cheeks crimsoned in 
                         angry self-consciousness. 
                     
                     
                         They left the city behind them. 
                         Left the main highway behind them. 
                         Left civilization behind them, to 
                         turn into a dirt road that swirled 
                         through blue-black canyons, dark 
                         with early twilight. 
                     
                     
                         There were no houses, no build- 
                         ings of any kind. It seemed to 
                         Kathy she never had seen anything 
                         so silent, so utterly still. At her 
                         side, Wade Duncannon was still, 
                         too, his dark eyes on the road ahead, 
                         his face in profile toward her, clean- 
                         cut, strong, and as still, too, as the 
                         rocks that loomed on either side. 
                     
                     
                         Suddenly, to Kathy, all her 
                         troubles- those that were with her, 
                         and those that were before her- be- 
                         came dwarfted and utterly insigni-

                         Her shoulder brushed Wade's, her 
                         fingers touched his sleeve, and 
                         rested there, and a sudden strange 
                         peace swept her. 
                     
                     
                         Light as her touch had been, 
                         Wade answered to it, with a quick 
                         look. "A spooky place, these hills," 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         he said moodily. "Have to have 
                         a good conscience to ride through them, Kathy. A conscience 
                         without fur coats to make it tiwnge."  
                     
                         Tears, which she had refused to 
                         shed before, pinched Kathy's eyes. 
                         "You're cruel," she cried and jerked  
                 
                 
                     
                         His hot fingers held hers tight. "I'm not sick. It's your lips I want, sweet. It's you I'm sick for. Give me your
                            lips-" His words trailed into space.

                         her fingers free. "I- I wasn't think- 
                         ing of coats or anything else but 
                         how far away trouble seemed and- 
                         and-" 
                     
                     
                         The car grated to a stop. Put- 
                         ting his fingers beneath Kathy s 
                         chin, Wade raised her face to his. 
                         "And what, Kathy?" he asked. 
                         "What else were you thinking? You 
                         touched me with your hand. I 
                         didn't ask you to do it, and you 
                         didn't know you were doing it. For 
                         the first time in all these months, 
                         you wanted to touch me. I want 
                         to know why?" 
                     
                     
                         And because, beneath the gaze of 
                         his steady eyes, Kathy felt as she 
                         had felt beneath his kiss, helpless 
                         and spineless and weak, she an- 
                         swered him truthfully as a child 
                         might have: 
                     
                     
                         "I was thinking it was as though 
                         you and I were alone in eternity, 
                         and how peaceful it was, and how 
                         sweet. And I just wanted to touch 
                         you, that was all. Just without any 
                         reason." And she added, irritable 
                         and pettish, too, as a child might 
                         have done: "I'm sorry you hated 
                         it so. I won't do it again." 
                     
                     
                         Listening, Wade's dark eyes were 
                         like flames. There were red spots 
                         burning high on his thin dark 
                         cheeks. He leaned toward her. 
                         For an instant, Kathy thought he 
                         was going to kiss her again, and 
                         fought against that wild something 
                         inside her that wished he would. 
                         Steeled herself against it, for very 
                         shame. But he didn't, and the car 
                         was on its way climbing, climbing. 
                     
                     
                         Twilight deepened into night. 
                         The road rose higher and higher. 
                         Climbed to meet the moon and the 
                         stars. Turned at last into a graveled 
                         driveway, that darted, like a white 
                         tongue, from beneath an arched 
                         concrete mouth. Kathy climbed to 
                         the ground, and while Wade ran the 
                         car into a garage, and locked the  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         doors, she stood, staring, wide-eyed, 
                         at the little jewel of a house before 
                         her. A white jewel of a house, so 
                         white and shining that the moon- 
                         light seemed to come from it, and 
                         not from the moon at all. There 
                         was an arched door with a honey- 
                         suckle vine over it, and a lock that 
                         Wade opened, to let the warm odor 
                         of a closed house out to greet her, 
                         and, as she followed him over the 
                         sill, there were lights popping on, 
                         and doors being flung open, and 
                         more honeysuckle, filling the whole 
                         house with its heady fragrance. 
                     
                     
                         At the end of a soft-carpeted 
                         hallway, glass doors opened onto a 
                         white pillared portico, that held the 
                         star-dotted sky as in a frame, and 
                         listening, Kathy could hear the 
                         swish-swish of water, carrying the 
                         thought of beauty with it, like the 
                         soft rustle of a woman's skirts. 
                     
                     
                         Kathy's voice was a hush of de- 
                         light, and her hand caught at her 
                         throat for the wonder that filled it. 
                     
                     
                         "It's beautiful!" she cried. "It's 
                         dream land. It's love land!" She 
                         hardly knew she had spoken, until 
                         Wade's harsh laugh brought her 
                         back to herself with a jerk. 
                     
                     
                         "Worth a fur coat, is it?" he 
                         jeered, and his face was white be- 
                         neath its tan, and Kathy thought 
                         suddenly, almost forgetting the hurt 
                         of his words, that he looked ill and 
                         strange. She noticed how his hands 
                         shook, and how wild his eyes were, 
                         and shivered in sudden foreboding, 
                         as his hands, pulling her toward him, 
                         burned through the thin sleeves of 
                         her dress. 
                     
                     
                         "I didn't mean that, Kathy," he 
                         said hoarsely. "I didn't want to say 
                         that at all, I've got a rotten head- 
                         ache. I've had one all day, and 
                         what you said just now hit me on 
                         the raw. This house is a dream 
                         house. I built it of dreams that 
                         never came true. It was meant for

                         a love house, and it has never known 
                         love. 
                     
                     
                         "Do you want to know what 
                         Helen said to me, when I brought 
                         her here, a bride? She said, 
                     
                     
                         'Heavens, Wade! This tomb! If 
                         you think you can bury me in a 
                         place like this, you're crazy! Take 
                         me back to the city quick!' 
                     
                     
                         "There's a garden out there 
                         somewhere. Let's go out, Kathy. 
                         I want to sit there with you beside 
                         me and dream." 
                     
                     
                         In the grass were tiny white 
                         flowers like fallen stars. He threw 
                         himself down among them and 
                         pulled Kathy to his side. His hot 
                         fingers held hers tight. 
                     
                     
                         "You're sick!" Kathy cried. "I 
                         know you are, Wade. It's in your 
                         eyes. It's been there all day and 
                         I didn't know it. You're burning 
                         with fever. I'm going in and make 
                         you some coffee." 
                     
                     
                         She tried to free herself, but he 
                         held her close. "Coffee in love 
                         land?" he mocked. "It's your lips 
                         I want, sweet. It's you I'm sick 
                         for. Give me your lips-" And 
                         then, his words were trailing off 
                         into starry space, and he was 
                         doubled up, his hands clasped to his 
                         side, his face twisted into a gasping 
                         torture of pain. 
                     
                     
                         "My side!" he groaned. "Had 
                         an attack- once- before. They 
                         froze it out, and now it's come 
                         again! Up here!" 
                     
                     
                         How Kathy got him to the house 
                         she never knew. As far as the door 
                         he had helped her. Had walked, 
                         leaning against her, an arm about 
                         her shoulders. But there, he fainted. 
                         A table was in the way and as he 
                         fell, his head struck it. A tiny 
                         trickle of blood oozed from his 
                         temple to dribble down a gray cheek. 
                     
                     
                         Kathy had to let him lie where 
                         he had fallen until she found a bed- 
                         room. She was humbly grateful  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         there were no stairs in this house 
                         built of dreams. With her arms be- 
                         neath his shoulders, she dragged 
                         him to it, and finally got him onto 
                         the bed. 
                     
                     
                         By the time she had his shoes off, 
                         and his collar and tie, he was con- 
                         scious, or partly so, and his face 
                         was not pale but red as fire, and his 
                         eyes were burning pits that sunk 
                         away from the pain that racked 
                         them. 
                     
                     
                         "In- the kitchen- the ice ma- 
                         chine," he mumbled. "Could- 
                         could you make- an ice-pack? 
                         Only hope- to freeze it. No- doc- 
                         tor nearer than twenty miles. No 
                         telephones in dream houses, you 
                         know." 
                     
                     
                         But Kathy didn't hear the last, 
                         for she was in the kitchen swinging 
                         open the doors of the small ice box, 
                         snatching at its tiny, ice-filled trays, 
                         her heart pinching with terror at 
                         the few cubes they held. 
                     
                     
                         She found a towel and made it 
                         into a pack, smashing the ice down 
                         with a cleaver, snatched at random 
                         from a kitchen drawer. Frantically 
                         she ripped Wade's shirt, and slipped 
                         the freezing blessedness against his 
                         tortured side. 
                     
                     
                         The bruise on his head was swell- 
                         ing. She wet towels and laid them 
                         against it, holding them there with 
                         cool, white hands. His lips were 
                         bleeding, and leaning over, she saw 
                         the marks of his teeth in them, and 
                         was sick with pity. She was crying 
                         and didn't know it, but in an inter- 
                         val of pain, Wade saw it, and 
                         smiled bleakly: "That fur coat- 
                         it let you in for a- lot of trouble," 
                         he whispered. And later, when she 
                         had slipped her arm beneath his 
                         head: 
                     
                     
                         "That's nice, dear. That's so 
                         nice. I've dreamed that you held 
                         me like that. I've dreamed-" 
                     
                     
                         And listening to him, Kathy knew

                         How Kathy got him to the house she never knew. As far as the door he had walked, leaning against her, an arm about
                            her shoulders. But there, he fainted. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         what, it seemed to her there in that 
                         lonely room, she must have known 
                         all along; that she loved Wade Dun- 
                         cannon. That she always had loved  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         him. What that kiss 
                         of his had proven to 
                         her, and what the 
                         agony in her heart 
                         was proving to her 
                         now, that if he died, 
                         she must die, too. 
                         That she couldn't 
                         live without him. 
                         Out in the kitchen, 
                         beside the refrigera- 
                         tor, its regulator tick- 
                         ing away like mad, she shook impo- 
                         tent, furious little fists. If only the 
                         ice would hold out! If only it would 
                         make enough, and make it quickly!

                         Seeing the worry in her eyes, 
                         Wade whispered weakly: "Don't 
                         -take it- so hard, dear. It's the 
                         ice, isn't it? It- can't last. When 
                         -it's gone, you can't do anything 
                         more. No one- can. I- I- wish 
                         you'd clear out. I- I- did- what I 
                         said I would do, Kathy. I- told 
                         Helen's attorney. They'll be- here. 
                         They'll be here- to-morrow. You 
                         -you mustn't let them find you. 
                         You- you- wouldn't wish that on 
                         me, Kathy to die- with that- on 
                         my soul! Even if- you- do- hate 
                         me- you wouldn't- want- that!" 
                     
                     
                         And then Kathy had him against 
                         her heart and was cradling him 
                         there, sobbing to him with an agony 
                         of words that poured themselves 
                         out as though there were no end: 
                     
                     
                         "I love you! I love you! I don't 
                         hate you! I love you! You can't 
                         die! You can't! See, my arms 
                         about you- they'll hold you fast! I 
                         don't care if all the world finds me 
                         here! I want them to! I didn't 
                         take that money. I didn't! When 
                         you're well I'll tell you everything 
                         -everything! I want to tell you. 
                         But now, nothing matters, darling, 
                         but that you live! That you live 
                         for me!" 
                     
                     
                         And then the ice was gone, and 
                         there was nothing left nothing but 
                         her love and her straining arms. 
                     
                     
                         Day was dawning when the fever 
                         broke at last. Where his face had 
                         been, an instant before, parched and 
                         burning dry, suddenly, beneath 
                         Kathy's desperate touch, it was wet 
                         and cool, and his eyes had closed in 
                         an exhausted, painless sleep. 
                     
                     
                         Pulling the covers over him in 
                         great thankfulness, Kathy stumbled 
                         to the door. Too tired to cry; too 
                         tired to even think, she was stand- 
                         ing there, staring numbly at a shin- 
                         ing dew-washed world, when Bob 
                         and Shiela rattled up the graveled 
                         drive. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         For a second she looked at them, 
                         speechless, almost not recognizing 
                         them. The world and all it held 
                         had been so far away. Then, with 
                         a strangled sob, she ran to meet the 
                         white-faced, frantic-eyed Shiela, 
                         who was running to meet her with 
                         outstretched arms. 
                     
                     
                         "He'll live, Shiela! Wade is going 
                         to live!" she sobbed. "He's been 
                         sick all night long oh, so terribly 
                         sick, but he'll live! Oh, I didn't 
                         know I wanted a woman so! I 
                         didn't know I wanted, so awfully, 
                         to cry!" 
                     
                     
                         Hours afterwards- centuries- 
                         seconds- now that Wade was out 
                         of danger at last, Kathy kept no 
                         time they were gathered together 
                         about his bed. He had wakened 
                         from a long, deep sleep to their 
                         voices, whispering in the kitchen, 
                         and had called Kathy's name, and 
                         she ran to him to kneel down and 
                         kiss his fright-filled eyes: 
                     
                     
                         "Darling! It's not Helen. It's 
                         Bob and Shiela. They've been here 
                         for hours. They've got something 
                         to tell you that can't wait! I can't 
                         let it wait; not one minute. Not 
                         one second! Shiela! Bob!" 
                     
                     
                         It wasn't a long story as they told 
                         it, Bob and Shiela together, beside 
                         Wade's bed. A gaunt, dusty, 
                         very sober Bob, holding a wilted, 
                         tear-streaked Shiela by the hand. 
                     
                     
                         Shiela's words had come slowly 
                         at first, for she had been frightened 
                         -terribly frightened. But, con- 
                         scious of her husband beside her, of 
                         his fingers comforting her and giving 
                         her strength, she had spoken her 
                         confession from brave lips, her tiny 
                         blond head tip-tilted, her blue eyes 
                         round and true. 
                     
                     
                         As Kathy had known she would, 
                         Lily, the little maid had twisted 
                         her message. "Miss Kathy done 
                         spendin' th' week-end with Mistah 
                         Duncannon. Yassum. That's what 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Cause For Divorce 99 
                 
                     
                     
                         she say, right ova this hyar phone." 
                         And frantic with guilt, Shiela had 
                         taken a taxi to Wade's office, to find 
                         him gone. Mr. Duncannon was in 
                         the mountains for the week-end. 
                         He had made no secret of his des- 
                         tination, there had been no need. 
                         But it was the doorman who told 
                         her about Kathy. He had seen them 
                         drive away together. That was 
                         when, broken, utterly crushed, 
                         Shiela had gone to Bob with the 
                         truth. 
                     
                     
                         "-and Bob was so good! Oh, 
                         youve no idea how good!" she cried. 
                     
                     
                         All this awful night when we lost 
                         our way twice, and thought we'd 
                         never get here! When we were so 
                         frightfully worried, he never scolded 
                         me at all! Never blamed me, but just 
                         tried to help me. And now we're 
                         here, and everything is all right 
                         and-- 
                     
                     
                         "We'll pay back every cent, Mr. 
                         Duncannon, Bob and I! Every 
                         penny, and I'll never run up another 
                         bill as long as I live!" 
                     
                     
                         Wade's hand was weak as a 
                         baby's, but it was strong enough to 
                         find Kathy s and cling to it. 
                         "Kathy!" he whispered. "Darling! 
                         It was your sister you were shield- 
                         ing! There wasn't any man in it 
                         at all! Oh, Kathy, Kathy, I want 
                         to hear you say it. I want to hear 
                         you say there wasn't any man!" 
                     
                     
                         The question was still trembling 
                         on his lips, still unanswered, when 
                         another car rolled up the drive, and 
                         other footsteps came hurrying 
                         through the open door and down the 
                         hall, until, filling the bedroom door, 
                         blocking it, triumphant, exulting, 
                         stood Helen, Wade Duncannon's 
                         wife, and her attorney, tall, thin- 
                         faced and frosty-eyed. 
                     
                     
                         At first, confused a little by the 
                         sun outside, Helen had seen only 
                         the bed, and Wade lying there, his 
                         head against Kathy's shoulder, and  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         she had laughed. "Well done, 
                         Wade! couldn't have been better. 
                         Guess this will pass as 'cause for 
                         divorce' even in New York!" 
                     
                     
                         Then, her eyes narrowing a trifle, 
                         "Who's the girl? haven't I seen 
                         her before? I guess we'll have to 
                         have her name." 
                     
                     
                         Wade raised himself. Turned, in 
                         Kathy's tender arms. His face was 
                         grim. "This is Miss Willis, my sec- 
                         retary," he said. "And, Helen"- 
                         he smiled a little sadly, a little 
                         wistfully, but crookedly amused 
                         "I would like to have you meet her 
                         sister and brother-in-law, Mr. and 
                         Mrs. Christie. They are spending 
                         the week-end here with me, too. 
                         I'm afraid, Helen, my dear I'm 
                         afraid your 'cause for divorce' is 
                         no good. A man who has had an 
                         attack of appendicitis, over a per- 
                         fectly chaperoned Saturday night 
                         can't-" 
                     
                     
                         "But you called my lawyer!" 
                         she broke in. "You told him if we'd 
                         come up to-day we'd get our evi- 
                         dence. You told him that, Wade!" 
                         Kathy stumbled to her feet. She 
                         pushed her hair back from her tired, 
                         white face. Her eyes were shining; 
                         not dove's eyes now, but star eyes, 
                         misty and love-filled and sweet. 
                         And her lips were sweet, too; up- 
                         curved and tender, and crimson 
                         with the blood from her beating 
                         heart: 
                     
                     
                         "And you can have it" she cried. 
                         "Of course you can! He's trying to 
                         shield me, can't you see? We were 
                         here alone all night. Bob and 
                         Shiela just came. We meant to be 
                         alone. We love each other. We're 
                         crazy about each other. Go on 
                         back and get your divorce! I want 
                         you to have it! I can't wait until 
                         you get it!" 
                     
                     
                         Looking at her, Helen stripped off 
                         her gloves and found a chair. "Bet- 
                         ter give me the story, some one," 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 100 Street &amp; Smith's Love Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         she sighed. "There's more than 
                         'cause for divorce' in that girl's 
                         face." 
                     
                     
                         It was Bob who told it. Told of 
                         the stolen bonds, of Shiela's weak- 
                         ness and Kathy's sacrifice. And 
                         listening, totally unconscious even 
                         that she was doing it, Kathy buried 
                         the last ghost of her old hero- 
                         worshiping adulation, behind a 
                         sister's glowing pride. 
                     
                     
                         When he had finished, Helen 
                         stared about the tiny room for an 
                         instant, and dabbed, unashamedly 
                         at her rouged, mascara-streaked 
                         cheeks. "Some kids!" she said. 
                         "Some kids!" And going to Kathy, 
                         she kissed her. And then, smiling 
                         down at Wade: "I'm not such a 
                         bad egg, Wade, after all. We'll get 
                         our divorce, but we'll make it via 
                         Reno. I'm leaving to-night. Good- 
                         by, and take the happiness you 
                         deserve and I never gave you!"  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Then her car was tearing out toward 
                         the road, and Wade was holding out 
                         his hungry arms, and asking, 
                         eagerly, jealously, humbly, over and 
                         over again: "There's no one else but 
                         me, is there, Kathy? Tell me! 
                         Please tell me, darling, that I'm the 
                         only man you love! Please!" 
                     
                     
                         And Kathy was answering; crying, 
                         against his cheeks, against his lips, 
                         against his hair: 
                     
                     
                         "There's no one in all the world 
                         but you! There's never been any 
                         one in all the world but you! There 
                         never will be!" And Shiela, stum- 
                         bling from the room, pushing Bob 
                         before her, blinking at the tears that 
                         blinded her, knew with a happy, 
                         worldly wisdom, that what Kathy 
                         was saying was true. 
                     
                     
                         That, once real love comes to a 
                         woman's heart, all other loves are, 
                         as troubles are: Dreams that vanish 
                         with the day.  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         STARS 
                     
                     I SHALL snare the stars from the sky  In a net of dreams-come-true-  Silver stars, and golden stars,  And stars
                        that are palely blue-  But I shall bring them, every one,  When dawn springs up and the night is done,  I shall
                        bring them to you!  
                     And I shall say to you: "Now this  Pale-blue star I will trade for a kiss;  And this one, silver as frost on the
                        pine,  You shall wear, if you are mine  For an hour, for a day, for a twelve-month gay-  Bright, bright in your
                        hair it shall shine!  
                     But this! this star of smoldering gold,  It shall be yours, to have and to hold,  It shall become of yourself a
                        part,  If you will place it and me in your heart!

                     Day Of Awakening 
                 
                 
                     By  Dorothy Ainsworth  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         HEATHER dropped the bundle 
                         of magazines she was un- 
                         wrapping as the drug-store 
                         door opened. Dick Cross, tall and 
                         handsome, his face flushed and un- 
                         shaven, saluted her jauntily. 
                     
                     
                         "Hello, angel face. Ish y'workin* 
                         hard?" 
                     
                     
                         "You're drunk," Heather said 
                         quietly. 
                     
                     
                         Dick leaned against the soda 
                         fountain and yawned. "Well, y'see 
                         it was like thish. Last night-" 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "I know," Heather interrupted, a 
                         note of weariness in her voice. "I 
                         know the rest of that speech by 
                         heart. The fact remains, though, 
                         that we're having a flu epidemic here 
                         in Broadville, and you're running the 
                         only drug store in town. What 
                         about the prescriptions- and what 
                         about your promise to me?" 
                     
                     
                         He scowled. "Can't put in fifteen 
                         hours a day here." 
                     
                     
                         "I am," Heather retorted, sorting 
                         the new magazines that had arrived 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 102 Street &amp; Smith's Love Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         that morning. "Somebody has to be 
                         on the job. Doctor Burns dropped 
                         in with a handful of prescriptions 
                         before seven this morning." 
                     
                     
                         "Bet he came t'see you," Dick 
                         snickered. 
                     
                     
                         Heather's brown eyes were con- 
                         temptuous. "You are drunk. You 
                         know he's engaged to Nancy Tren- 
                         ton. See if a little sleep won't sober 
                         you up. You can't fill those pre- 
                         scriptions in the shape you're in 
                         now." 
                     
                     
                         "Y'd think we were married inst'd 
                         engaged," he mumbled. 
                     
                     
                         She slipped his ring off her finger, 
                         and laid it on the marble counter. 
                     
                     
                         "We aren't even engaged," 
                         Heather announced calmly. "I told 
                         you I wouldn't put up with your 
                         drinking again." 
                     
                     
                         He stared at her bare hand 
                         stupidly. 
                     
                     
                         She continued: 
                     
                     
                         "I can't go on, Dick. I've given 
                         you a hundred chances. And each 
                         time that you've broken your word 
                         it has done something to me to my 
                         feeling for you. I don't love you 
                         any more. I can't even respect 
                         you," she said with finality. 
                     
                     
                         Dick fumbled with the ring. 
                         "'Nother man," he said heavily. 
                         "Y're walking out on me because 
                         'nother man." 
                     
                     
                         Heather colored painfully. "You 
                         had better get some sleep now. I'll 
                         stay on here at the store until you 
                         have time to break in a new girl." 
                     
                     
                         He laughed shortly. "Y're only 
                         talking, but maybe I'll call your 
                         bluff. Other fish in t'sea. 
                     
                     
                         Tilting his hat over his eyes, he 
                         walked unsteadily to the prescrip- 
                         tion room at the back of the store. 
                         He had set up a cot there for just 
                         such emergencies. Heather waited 
                         a few minutes after she heard the 
                         creak of the springs. Then she went 
                         back, too, and covered him with his  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         overcoat which he had thrown onto 
                         the floor. 
                     
                     
                         She touched his hair lightly. He 
                         looked so utterly helpless that her 
                         heart contracted a little. With pity 
                         -not love. Pity that he should, at 
                         twenty-five, be throwing himself 
                         away like this. She had really 
                         meant it when she had told him that 
                         she no longer loved him. Now she 
                         wondered if she ever had loved him 
                         in the true sense of the word. Hand- 
                         some and fascinating, he had swept 
                         her off her feet in a whirlwind court- 
                         ship. 
                     
                     
                         She hurriedly closed the door be- 
                         tween the prescription room and the 
                         store as a customer impatiently 
                         tapped on the cigar counter. It was 
                         Nancy Trenton, very chic in a gray 
                         squirrel jacket and a tiny violet- 
                         colored hat pulled down over her 
                         short auburn hair. 
                     
                     
                         "I'm terribly sorry," Heather 
                         apologized. "I didn't hear you come 
                         in." 
                     
                     
                         "Two packages of cigarettes," 
                         Nancy said sharply. "Charge them 
                         to dad." 
                     
                     
                         Heather reached for Mr. Tren- 
                         ton's favorite brand. "I'm glad he's 
                         better this morning," she said cheer- 
                         fully. 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, they aren't for him," Nancy 
                         retorted. "He's still too sick to 
                         smoke. I'm tired of walking around 
                         on tiptoe, so I'm driving over to Lin- 
                         wood to-day. And, by the way, if 
                         Grant comes in here, don't let him 
                         know you saw me," she said quietly. 
                     
                     
                         It was then that Heather noticed 
                         the glistening black roadster which 
                         was parked in front of the drug 
                         store. The car bore a license plate of 
                         another State, and a stranger sat at 
                         the wheel. Heather glanced swiftly 
                         at Doctor Grant Burns's fiancée. 
                     
                     
                         "Grant is so tied up with his prac- 
                         tice he never takes me any place," 
                         Nancy said defensively. 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Day Of Awakening 103 
                 
                     
                     
                         The man in the black car played 
                         an impatient little tune on the horn. 
                         Nancy hurried outside and motioned 
                         for him to stop. Heather saw her 
                         point her smartly-gloved hand up- 
                         ward. Doctor Burns's office was 
                         directly over the drug store. 
                     
                     
                         With a surging mixture of feelings, 
                         Heather watched the roadster drive 
                         away. Nancy Trenton was a hope- 
                         less flirt, and Grant Burns was such 
                         a fine chap. Heather knew all about 
                         how Nancy had pursued him until 
                         finally they had become engaged. 
                     
                     
                         She recalled Grant's tired young 
                         face as she had seen it a few hours 
                         before. And Nancy was two-timing 
                         him because he couldn't take her 
                         places! For just a moment Heather 
                         allowed herself to be lost in a day- 
                         dream of how it would seem to be 
                         engaged to a man like Grant Burns. 
                         Some one dependable, she thought 
                         wistfully. 
                     
                     
                         Her next customer was old Doctor 
                         Addison, his eyes red-rimmed from 
                         loss of sleep, his face pinched-looking 
                         and drawn. He pulled off his hat 
                         and rubbed his forehead wearily. 
                     
                     
                         "Dick's drunk again, I suppose," 
                         he said in a tired voice. "Wish you 
                         were a druggist, Heather. I need 
                         these prescriptions right away." 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, Dick worked late last night, 
                         but I'm expecting him in any minute 
                         now," she fibbed loyally. "We'll 
                         have the prescriptions delivered be- 
                         fore noon." 
                     
                     
                         "Hm-m-m!" snorted the old doc- 
                         tor. "What do you see in him, 
                         Heather? You're the prettiest girl 
                         in town, and you're going to marry 
                         a scamp like Dick Cross!" He 
                         looked at her evenly. 
                     
                     
                         She showed him her bare left 
                         hand. "But I'm not marrying him," 
                         she contradicted. "Which means 
                         that I'll be out of a job as soon as 
                         the epidemic is over." 
                     
                     
                         "Broken with Dick, have you?"  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Doctor Addison asked with his 
                         booming laugh. "Say, that will 
                         make life worth living for at least 
                         three of my patients!" he said shyly. 
                     
                     
                         The door opened and Doctor 
                         Burns strode in. "My prescriptions 
                         gone out yet, Heather?" he asked 
                         worriedly. 
                     
                     
                         "I- I'm sorry," she stammered. 
                         It wasn't so easy to lie when Grant's 
                         blue, piercing eyes were upon her. 
                         "Dick worked late last night and he 
                         hasn t come in yet."  
                     
                         He frowned. "Funny thing, I 
                         thought I saw him more than an 
                         hour ago. How are things going 
                         with you, doc?" 
                     
                     
                         "Awful!" Doctor Addison an- 
                         swered bluntly. "I haven't had my 
                         clothes off in forty-eight hours. I'm 
                         going to grab a cup of coffee and 
                         then drive over to Turner's. Thad is 
                         pretty low." 
                     
                     
                         "Run up to my place. I've got 
                         an electric plate and a coffeepot in 
                         the back room," Grant offered. 
                         "Some things I'd like to talk over 
                         with you, too, if you don't mind," 
                         he added. 
                     
                     
                         The door closed on Doctor 
                         Addison's dragging heels. Grant 
                         smiled provocatively into Heather's 
                         dark eyes. "You've been a soldier, 
                         and nobody seems to be giving you 
                         much credit. But I want you to 
                         know I think you're pretty swell," he 
                         said proudly. "And about Dick- 
                         get him on the job if you have to 
                         use dynamite. I've got to have 
                         those prescriptions." 
                     
                     
                         When he had gone, Heather 
                         crossed the store and looked 
                         earnestly at her reflection in the 
                         mirror behind the soda fountain. 
                         Dark eyes set wide apart- hair, 
                         pale-gold- a small, pointed face. 
                         Nothing spectacular, she thought. 
                         Just another pretty girl in a world 
                         of pretty girls, even if Doctor 
                         Addison had called her the prettiest 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 104 Street &amp; Smith's Love Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         one in town. But Nancy was that. 
                         And Nancy was engaged to Grant. 
                         Heather turned sharply away from 
                         the mirror, a little afraid of what she 
                         might see in her own eyes. 
                     
                     
                         Dick was deep in a drunken 
                         stupor. She took him by the shoul- 
                         der and shook him vigorously. He 
                         was as limp as a rag doll. She tried 
                         sloshing cold water on his face, but 
                         still he slept. Then she slapped him 
                         repeatedly with the palm of her 
                         hand, until he sat up at last. 
                     
                     
                         "What the-" he began 
                         hoarsely. 
                     
                     
                         "Dick Dick," she cried urgently, 
                         "snap out of it. You've got to fill 
                         those prescriptions. Both Doctor 
                         Burns and Doctor Addison have 
                         been in." 
                     
                     
                         "Lemme lone. He slid back 
                         onto the pillow." 
                     
                     
                         "Dick!" She shook him. "Please 
                         -Dick!" she cried tearfully. 
                     
                     
                         She got him on his feet and mixed 
                         a bracer. "Here, drink this." 
                         Heather took the empty glass 
                         from him. "How do you feel?" she 
                         asked anxiously. 
                     
                     
                         "Rotten." He swayed a little on 
                         his feet. 
                     
                     
                         "I mean," Heather explained, "do 
                         you feel as though you could go 
                         ahead with the prescriptions? Is 
                         your head clear enough?" 
                     
                     
                         "Sure. Get me some coffee and 
                         I'll be all right," he said brusquely. 
                     
                     
                         "Black coffee not dish water. And 
                         you might write out the labels for 
                         me. I'm too shaky." 
                     
                     
                         "Maybe I'd better go for the 
                         coffee instead of phoning," she sug- 
                         gested. "Then it's sure to be strong 
                         enough. But I'll write the labels 
                         first, so you can get started. You're 
                         sure you're all right?" she repeated. 
                     
                     
                         "I could put up old Addison's stuff 
                         in my sleep," he snapped. 
                     
                     
                         There were eleven prescriptions in 
                         all. Heather wrote out the labels in  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         her neat, round hand as Dick read 
                         them to her. She often did that for 
                         him. Sometimes she pasted on the 
                         labels, too. Then, slipping into her 
                         coat, she ran the block to the res- 
                         taurant. 
                     
                     
                         She was sitting on a stool at the 
                         counter talking to Bill, the pro- 
                         prietor, while she waited for the 
                         special brew of coffee, when some 
                         one in the kitchen screamed. Bill 
                         muttered under his breath, and 
                         darted through the swinging doors. 
                         And as the screams continued, 
                         Heather ran into the kitchen, too. 
                     
                     
                         There she found Sadie, the 
                         waitress, gripping her right hand 
                         with her left. The front of her 
                         apron was stained with blood, and 
                         her wrist was bleeding profusely. 
                         She pulled away from Bill when he 
                         tried to help her. 
                     
                     
                         "Doctor Burns is in his office. I'll 
                         take Sadie there if you'll rush that 
                         coffee over to Dick, yourself," 
                         Heather offered. 
                     
                     
                         She pulled a clean handkerchief 
                         from her coat pocket, and knotting 
                         it around Sadie's right wrist, she 
                         made a tourniquet with it. The girl 
                         still gripped the palm of her hand, 
                         so that Heather could only guess as 
                         to the extent of the injury. 
                     
                     
                         Sadie's frightened screams had 
                         changed to moans of pain. Heather 
                         watched her anxiously as she took 
                         her to Grant's office. He was sitting 
                         at his desk, head resting on his arms, 
                         when they entered. Doctor Addison 
                         had already left. 
                     
                     
                         Sadie sank limply into a chair and 
                         showed him her hand. "Steady," he 
                         whispered tensely, in an aside to 
                         Heather. "I'm going to need your 
                         help." 
                     
                     
                         Twenty minutes later Grant took 
                         Sadie home, and Heather was glad 
                         to drop down onto the couch in his 
                         back room. She was feeling a little 
                         faint herself, and she was dead tired 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Day Of Awakening 105 
                 
                     
                     
                         besides. She had been work- 
                         ing twelve hours a day and 
                         more, at the drug store dur- 
                         ing the period of the epi- 
                         demic. 
                     
                     
                         It seemed to Heather that 
                         she had only just fallen 
                         asleep when she heard some 
                         one calling her name, softly, 
                         insistently. She tried to open 
                         her eyes, to rouse herself, but 
                         she was too tired. 
                     
                     
                         Then strong arms lifted 
                         gently, and she burrowed her face 
                         against a tweed coat that smelled of 
                         tobacco and medicine. The arms 
                         tightened about her arms which 
                         made her feel so secure, that even 
                         half-awake, she knew they did not 
                         belong to Dick. Suddenly her eyes 
                         flashed open, and she looked deep 
                         into Grant's blue ones. He lowered 
                         his head and kissed her. Hungry 
                         kisses that filled her with a strange, 
                         sweet fire. Without thinking, 
                         Heather returned his lasses, pressing 
                     
                 
                 
                      Grant smiled pro- 
                         vocatively into 
                         Heather's dark 
                         eyes. "I want you 
                         to know I think 
                         you're pretty 
                         swell," he said whispered. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         her soft lips against 
                         his burning ones.  
                     
                         "Heather," Grant whispered. "Heather- dearest."  
                     
                         "But, Nancy-" 
                         she whispered back re- 
                         proachfully. 
                     
                     
                         Grant's arms dropped from her so 
                         suddenly that she fell back against 
                         the wall. He groaned, and thrust a 
                         hand through his light hair.  
                     
                         "Forgive me, Heather, and for- 
                         get," he cried in despair. 
                     
                     
                         She laid her fingers against her 
                         lips to steady them. "But, I can't 
                         forget. I- I don't want to," she 
                         cried defiantly. 
                     
                     
                         "I ought to be shot," he said 
                         savagely. "There's Nancy, and 
                         there's Dick-" 
                     
                     
                         "There's only Nancy," Heather 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 106 Street &amp; Smith's Love Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         corrected him. "I've definitely 
                         broken with Dick." 
                     
                     
                         Grant looked at her quickly, and 
                         his face brightened at the good news. 
                         But then it clouded slowly, and he 
                         continued in a dreary voice: 
                     
                     
                         "I thought my work was all-im- 
                         portant in my life, that it always 
                         would be. But it isn't, Heather 
                         you are." There was such aching 
                         desire in his voice that she made a 
                         little pleading gesture with her hand. 
                         "I'm fond of Nancy, and it wouldn't 
                         be fair to hurt her. What are we to 
                         do you and I?" he asked des- 
                         perately. 
                     
                     
                         Heather pulled on her coat. "I'll 
                         go away. I couldn't work for Dick 
                         any more, now. I told him I'm go- 
                         ing as soon as the long hours at the 
                         store are over." 
                     
                     
                         Grant turned up her collar pro- 
                         tectingly, and for just a moment 
                         his fingers lingered against the warm 
                         smoothness of her throat. 
                     
                     
                         "Two o'clock," he said at last. 
                         "I'd better get started on my calls. 
                         Good-by, Heather." 
                     
                     
                         She shivered. That good-by 
                         sounded so final. "Good-by," she 
                         managed, and fled down the stairs 
                         to the drug store. 
                     
                     
                         She found Dick in the prescription 
                         room, drinking straight whiskey. 
                         "Well," he began savagely, "about 
                         time you were getting back." 
                     
                     
                         Heather glanced at the work 
                         table. The milk bottle in which Bill 
                         had delivered the coffee, and an 
                         empty cup stood there. The labels 
                         were gone. "Did Chuck Parks take 
                         the prescriptions in his car?" she 
                         asked worriedly. 
                     
                     
                         Dick jerked his head in assent. 
                         "Where have y'been?" he asked 
                         brusquely. 
                     
                     
                         She hung up her coat. "Sadie cut 
                         her hand badly while I was at the 
                         restaurant, and I took her to Gra- 
                         Doctor Burns's office. Afterward I  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         meant to rest only a minute while 
                         he took her home, but the first thing 
                         I knew, I fell asleep," she explained 
                         wearily. 
                     
                     
                         "And I'm supposed to believe that 
                         you were sleeping all that time?" 
                         He pulled his mouth into an ugly 
                         line. "About time Nancy Trenton 
                         got wise to things, I'd say!" 
                     
                     
                         "Dick!" she cried in horror. 
                     
                     
                         The telephone rang, and Heather, 
                         glad of the chance to escape, flew 
                         to answer it. The call was from the 
                         Trenton home. 
                     
                     
                         "That was Doctor Burns," she 
                         told Dick in a startled voice. "He 
                         wondered if you could have made a 
                         mistake in filling his prescription for 
                         Mr. Trenton, or mixed the labels. 
                         He's taken a turn for the worse. It's 
                         his heart." 
                     
                     
                         Dick moistened his lips. He swore 
                         softly and reached for the whiskey. 
                     
                     
                         "If he dies-" Heather stopped. 
                     
                     
                         Dick swallowed convulsively. 
                         Then he shrugged his shoulders. 
                         "You wrote the labels," he said un- 
                         concernedly. "If I tell them that 
                         you made a mistake in pasting them 
                         on, that let's me out." 
                     
                     
                         Heather stared, horror-stricken. 
                         "You wouldn't!" she cried with 
                         trembling lips. 
                     
                     
                         Dick grinned unpleasantly. 
                         "Burns isn't going to testify that 
                         you weren't here when the prescrip- 
                         tions went out. He's not going 
                         around telling people that you two 
                         were alone in his office for a couple 
                         of hours. Not when old man Tren- 
                         ton's money is involved," he cried 
                         triumphantly. 
                     
                     
                         She tried to think, but her head 
                         was swimming, and she sank down 
                         onto the cot. 
                     
                     
                         She mustn't do anything that 
                         would hurt Grant professionally, 
                         Heather told herself. And if he 
                         wanted to clear her, she mustn't let 
                         him do it. 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Bay Of Awakening 107 
                 
                     
                     
                         "You win," she said dully. "Only, 
                         we'd better get both doctors to check 
                         over the other prescriptions that 
                         went out this morning. If Mr. 
                         Trenton did get the wrong bottle, 
                         some one has his." 
                     
                     
                         Heather reached Doctor Addison 
                         at Carlson's, and he called back an 
                         hour later to say that his prescrip- 
                         tions corresponded with their labels. 
                         She telephoned Grant at Trenton's, 
                         and he said that he would check his. 
                         It was nearly five o'clock when he 
                         came into the drug store. 
                     
                     
                         "How is Mr. Trenton?" she asked, 
                         trying to avoid his compelling gaze. 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, fair, considering. Where's 
                         Dick?" he asked lightly. 
                     
                     
                         Heather indicated the back room 
                         with a nod of her head. "Drunk," 
                         she replied tonelessly. "I'm glad 
                         you came in, instead of phoning," 
                         she said eagerly. "I want to talk 
                         to you." 
                     
                     
                         "That makes it mutual," Grant 
                         grinned happily. "Heather, I'm go- 
                         ing to kiss that dimple in the corner 
                         of your mouth!" 
                     
                     
                         She drew back quickly. "About 
                         Mr. Trenton's medicine. It's best 
                         that people should think that I made 
                         the mistake that I mixed the labels 
                         on the bottles. you're not to tell 
                         them that I was with you, instead 
                         of Dick, at the time. Nancy-" 
                     
                     
                         "There wasn't any mix-up in 
                         labels," he interrupted briskly. 
                         "And Dick filled the prescription 
                         correctly. It was Nancy who caused 
                         her father's heart attack. She was 
                         married over in Linwood, to-day.  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Mrs. Trenton was a little afraid to 
                         tell me, under the circumstances. 
                         Nancy had telephoned her just be- 
                         fore I got to the house. Some fellow 
                         from Kansas whom she had met 
                         while she was away at school. Mr. 
                         Trenton's wild with rage. That's 
                         what I meant when I said his con- 
                         dition was fair, considering." 
                     
                     
                         "Oh," Heather breathed faintly. 
                         "Married!" 
                     
                     
                         Grant stepped closer and im- 
                         prisoned her hands. "And now, 
                         darling," he cried with a happy 
                         smile, "I'm going to kiss that 
                         dimple." 
                     
                     
                         "Not here where everybody can 
                         see you," she begged in sudden 
                         panic. 
                     
                     
                         "Why not? Broadville and the 
                         rest of the world might as well know 
                         that I'm crazy about you, and that 
                         we re going to be married." 
                     
                     
                         "Well," Heather said demurely, "I 
                         do think you might have told me 
                         first." 
                     
                     
                         He flashed a teasing, irresistible 
                         smile, and drew her into his strong 
                         arms. "I love you, Heather," he 
                         whispered tenderly. "Let me take 
                         care of you, always." 
                     
                     
                         "Always," she answered, clinging 
                         to him. 
                     
                     
                         He kissed her eyes with their little 
                         shadows of fatigue, the soft hollow 
                         of her throat, her warm, sweet lips. 
                         When he released her at last, she 
                         looked up at him bravely, and smiled 
                         into the eyes of the man who 
                         promised her unselfish love, and 
                         divine happiness.

                     A SERIAL- 
                 
                 
                     Part III. 
                 
                 
                     THE STORY SO FAR: Sophia Ambler thought herself in love with Vincent Nelson until he introduces her to Rhoda Kinsella and
                        informs her that Rhoda is the good type of girl he intends to marry. Lonely, Sophia turns to Arnold Cranston, a playboy, for
                        amusement. She also goes out with her publisher boss, Thursby Linden. She is with him one night when they meet Lisbet, society
                        girl who is in love with Linden. Rhoda, out with Cran- ston, becomes mixed up in a murder and goes to Sophia for help. The
                        police, thinking Sophia is the woman in the case, refuse to listen to explanations and take her to the station house where she
                        is forced to spend the night. 
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         CHAPTER V.  
                     
                         IT seemed to Sophia 
                         that a night had 
                         never been so long. 
                         She wondered what Ar- 
                         nold was doing. Had he 
                         sobered up? Probably. 
                         She knew enough of po- 
                         lice methods to know 
                         that they probably so- 
                         bered him forcibly.  
                     
                         Finally faint streaks 
                         of light, like the prying 
                         fingers of some gaunt 
                         skeleton, found their way into her 
                         cell. Glad as she was to see the be- 
                         ginning of day, she shrank from 
                         those horrible, deathlike fingers that 
                         seemed to seek her out only to point 
                         jeeringly at her. 
                     
                     
                         It was an eternity before day 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         dawned fully, an eternity shot with 
                         strange noises, harsh voices seeming 
                         to talk and to no one in particular. 
                     
                     
                         A girl in the cell next to her 
                         awakened, stretched, yawned, and 
                         then looked across interestedly at 
                         Sophia in her transparent pajamas. 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Little And Lovely 109 
                 
                     
                     
                         "Gee! You weren't caught doing 
                         the town in those things, I hope?" 
                         she asked finally in a voice that 
                         echoed with a strong note of friend- 
                         liness. 
                     
                     
                         "No, I'd just gone out to the car 
                         of a friend parked in front of my 
                         place," Sophia explained none too 
                         eagerly. She didn't feel like talking.  
                     
                         The girl laughed. 
                     
                     
                         "And they grabbed you! Now 
                         wouldn't that be just like some 
                         dumb copper! wasn't doing a 
                         thing, I spect?" 
                     
                     
                         "No. Just talking to a friend." 
                     
                     
                         "Just like me! Me and my boy 
                         friend just happened to be in front 
                         of this house talking when the dame 
                         inside found she'd been robbed. 
                         And we was in for it! It wasn't our 
                         fault that some one'd thrown the 
                         junk into our car just as we was 
                         getting ready to get in and take a 
                         drive. I told the copper, but would 
                         he listen to that?" 
                     
                     
                         "Innocent as a baby! You tell 
                         'em, Hazel!" came from down the 
                         row of cells. And some one laughed 
                         in a hard, cruel way. 
                     
                     
                         Sophia felt a little bit sick and 
                         dizzy with it all. She was glad when 
                         the matron appeared. The woman 
                         surveyed her with cold eyes. 
                     
                     
                         "Hope you don't think you can 
                         go to court in them things?" she 
                         said, indicating the fragile pajamas. 
                     
                     
                         "I wanted the officer to let me 
                         change before I came," Sophia re- 
                         plied. "He wouldn't, though." 
                     
                     
                         The woman nodded her head. 
                     
                     
                         "Yeah. Well, they're onto your 
                         tricks. Going out in things that 
                         ain't decent and then asking to go 
                         home to change. This sudden 
                         modesty of you dames hands us a 
                         laugh! That's what it does. It 
                         don't fool nobody!" 
                     
                     
                         Sophia stared at the woman but 
                         said nothing. There wasn't any use 
                         trying to convince her. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Then, roughly from the matron: 
                     
                     
                         "Well, what're you going to do 
                         about it? Got any way of getting 
                         decent things to cover yourself 
                         with?" 
                     
                     
                         "If you'd let me send to my apart- 
                         ment-" Sophia started to sug- 
                         gest. 
                     
                     
                         "Where is it?" And as Sophia 
                         gave the address: "Pretty swell 
                         address for a girl that comes here." 
                     
                     
                         But Sophia ignored that and went 
                         on to explain to say to any one who 
                         answered the door there to send her 
                         an ordinary street dress and access- 
                         ories to go with it. 
                     
                     
                         Sophia was glad, for the clothes 
                         that were finally handed to her. 
                         She looked them over carefully first, 
                         half expecting to find some message 
                         in them, some word from Rhoda. 
                         But there was none. 
                     
                     
                         She realized, of course, that it 
                         might have been intercepted by the 
                         matron or almost any one whose 
                         hands the things passed through. 
                     
                     
                         She dressed, making herself as 
                         presentable as she could with the 
                         crude conveniences at hand. 
                     
                     
                         At nine, or thereabouts, she had 
                         been told, she would be taken to 
                         court for a preliminary hearing. 
                     
                     
                         Sophia had no clear idea of what 
                         to do. Her work on the paper had 
                         given her an idea of court procedure 
                         but her own case seemed so simple 
                         that it seemed almost superfluous 
                         to even take her to court. 
                     
                     
                         She would need no lawyer, be- 
                         cause she had no case to be plead. 
                         She would tell her story, and then, 
                         of course, they would release her 
                         and probably be a little ashamed of 
                         having held her overnight. 
                     
                     
                         There was a stirring in the cor- 
                         ridor. Sophia heard men's voices. 
                     
                     
                         "Fine hour to get up over some 
                         female that's been running wild!" 
                     
                     
                         "Sure it wasn't some female run- 
                         ning wild that made you want that

                         extra nap this morning, mayor?" 
                         There was laughter in the voice and 
                         something about its intonation 
                         struck straight to Sophia's heart and 
                         set it trembling madly. 
                     
                     
                         She knew those tones! 
                     
                     
                         Hot color rushed to her face. She 
                         turned in panic as if seeking some 
                         means of escape but, in that narrow 
                         cell, found none. 
                     
                     
                         The speakers had stopped in front 
                         of her cubicle. They went on talk- 
                         ing as if unaware of her: 
                     
                     
                         "You know you're coming up for 
                         reelection next fall, the younger 
                         man was saying in an easy assured 
                         voice. And my paper goes into the 
                         homes of a lot of your people. I 
                         don't like to remind you of that, 
                         but it seems necessary right now." 
                     
                     
                         The mayor's fat, ungainly body 
                         teetered on its toes. Evidently he 
                         was thinking. 
                     
                     
                         "I know," he finally said, "but 
                         your paper's always been with my 
                         party. Why, you'd lose readers if 
                         you swung out of line." 
                     
                     
                         "I can afford to take a chance on 
                         that. But you can't afford to take 
                         a chance on losing votes," the other 
                         man returned crisply. 
                     
                     
                         There was a long silence then 
                         which seemed to be tense. 
                     
                     
                         "I know, Linden"- it was the 
                         mayor's voice "but I can't do this. 
                         Why, it ain't legal! It ain't accord- 
                         ing to law!" 
                     
                     
                         Thursby Linden's crisp, clipped- 
                         off, sardonic laugh echoed for only 
                         a moment in the corridor. 
                     
                     
                         "I've known you to be a little bit 
                         careless of the law before, mayor! 
                         And this is a case of have to. It's 
                         copy marked 'must.'" 
                     
                     
                         "But suppose it gets found out 
                         that I came over here and inter- 
                         fered in this case like this what're 
                         people going to think? What's my 
                         wife going to think? Yeah, what's 
                         my wife going to think of my  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         meddling in the case of a girl like 
                         this?" A note of triumph in his 
                         voice as if at last he was sure he 
                         had found a telling argument. 
                     
                     
                         Once more Sophia, sitting in her 
                         cell, her hands clenching, feeling as 
                         if she must be going a little bit mad 
                         with suspense, heard Linden's laugh. 
                     
                     
                         "That's a good one! Your wife! 
                         What do you suppose she'd think if 
                         she knew that some of your clothes 
                         had been found in the apartment of 
                         that cabaret singer who was found 
                         murdered the other day? One of 
                         my boys did a little sleuthing on his 
                         own before even the police got on 
                         the job." 
                     
                     
                         "Why, man, that's blackmail!" 
                         The mayor's eyes were wide open, 
                         and the words came after a mo- 
                         ment s silence. 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, no! I wouldn't call it by 
                         any such hard name as that. It's- 
                         well, merely business." 
                     
                     
                         I know, but I don't see how I 
                         can do this, the mayor stalled. 
                     
                     
                         "Now see here"- Sophia, listen- 
                         ing, recognized the note of purpose 
                         in Linden's voice- "I want that girl 
                         out of here. She can't come up in 
                         court. Her name must not get into 
                         the papers in connection with this. 
                         That's the case. That's what I 
                         want of you." 
                     
                     
                         "Well- why, Linden," the mayor 
                         was squirming, "I can't interfere 
                         with the boys here. You know how 
                         we've been trying to make a clean- 
                         ing up lately. The word's gone out 
                         that some one's got to be taken in 
                         for every crime reported. We're not 
                         going to have a lot of cops walking 
                         the streets for nothing. They can 
                         at least grab some one that looks 
                         suspicious and find something out 
                         about 'em, make some attempt to 
                         get 'em. And now I can't tell the 
                         first man that follows orders to lay 
                         off. How would that look?" 
                     
                     
                         "I'm not interested in that,

                         The matron surveyed Sophia with cold eyes. "Hope you don't think you can go to court in them things!" she said,
                            indicating the fragile pajamas. "Got any way of getting decent things to cover yourself with?" 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         mayor. I've stated a case and it 
                         must go my way." 
                     
                     
                         "Anyway, what's it to you? If 
                         she's on the level, she'll get out and 
                         if they've really got something on 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         her, why then she ain t safe out. 
                         Anyway, she's a secretary in your 
                         office, ain't she?" with a shrewd look 
                         at the publisher. 
                     
                     
                         Sophia caught the look and

                         understood it, but somehow it 
                         brought no blush to her pale skin. 
                         She had the feeling that it was all 
                         too unreal, that the whole thing was 
                         some strange play that she had been 
                         called upon to act in. 
                     
                     
                         She had an odd feeling of detach- 
                         ment. 
                     
                     
                         "I've told you what I want, 
                         mayor," the words, coming in Lin- 
                         den's cool voice were clipped off and 
                         curt. "I don't generally ask twice 
                         for anything." 
                     
                     
                         The too plump man peered at the 
                         taller, slimmer one with eyes that 
                         were oddly and humorously childish! 
                     
                     
                         "By heaven, Linden, you want a 
                         man to jeopardize his whole position 
                         in town! I've put effort into getting 
                         where I am and now to risk the 
                         whole thing over some little secre- 
                         tary that gets into a jam with the 
                         boy friend-" 
                     
                     
                         Linden straightened. 
                     
                     
                         "Is this a refusal?" he asked 
                         curtly. "I haven't all morning to 
                         spend, even on this." 
                     
                     
                         "Well, now-" 
                     
                     
                         "Yes or no?" 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, well, you'n me've been 
                         pretty good friends! Sure, we'll turn 
                         her loose!" And suddenly he was 
                         genial, as if granting a favor that 
                         was of his own doing. "I'll call 
                         Dreher and tell him to forget the 
                         case!" 
                     
                     
                         Their feet sounded on the con- 
                         crete floor. 
                     
                     
                         "That means I'll take her right 
                         out with me now- right away?" 
                         Linden asked. 
                     
                     
                         "Sure! Sure!" the mayor replied, 
                         eagerly willing to go all the way with 
                         the favor once he had started. 
                     
                     
                         They disappeared. 
                     
                     
                         Sophia knew that even though 
                         Linden had not looked at her once, 
                         not met her eyes for even an instant, 
                         the two men had been talking about 
                         her. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         She wondered how Linden had 
                         learned about her being there. Per- 
                         haps Rhoda had gotten in touch 
                         with him. At least it had been tact- 
                         ful of him not to look at her while 
                         she sat miserably in that cell. She 
                         couldn't have endured that. 
                     
                     
                         Shortly she heard steps in the 
                         corridor and knew that the matron 
                         was coming toward her door. The 
                         older woman stopped. 
                     
                     
                         "You sure are a lucky girl," she 
                         said and in a voice quite different 
                         from the one she had previously 
                         used, "Shaving influential friends to 
                         get you out of a jam. I thought 
                         something like this might happen 
                         when I saw your address." 
                     
                     
                         She was unlocking the door and 
                         Sophia, her nerves taut, stepped 
                         dizzily out into the corridor. 
                     
                     
                         Vaguely she heard one of the girls 
                         back of her say: "Some folks have 
                         all the luck." 
                     
                     
                         And then she was following the 
                         matron blindly. 
                     
                     
                         "Sophia!" 
                     
                     
                         It was Linden. And Sophia, her 
                         hands in his, was trying to laugh, 
                         since she knew she must do that 
                         or cry. 
                     
                     
                         "Thanks, I'll remember this," 
                         Sophia heard him saying to the 
                         chubby man who stood beside him 
                         and was eying her keenly. 
                     
                     
                         And then she was glad that he 
                         hustled her out of the place and 
                         down to his big, roomy roadster. 
                         She needed the uplift of the luxury 
                         of that, after what she had just gone 
                         through. 
                     
                     
                         "How did you know?" 
                     
                     
                         They were her first words and it 
                         was only with a conscious effort of 
                         will that she kept them steady. 
                     
                     
                         "Hick, doing an early round, saw 
                         your name and inquired. I nearly 
                         passed out when he told me- 
                         seemed impossible." 
                     
                     
                         Sophia said nothing for the mo-  
                 
                 LS-7E 
             
             
                 
                 Little And Lovely 113 
                 
                     
                     
                         ment. She was thinking of Hick, 
                         lean, lanky, nervous police reporter 
                         who worked on a battered old type- 
                         writer that no one else could use 
                         and always sat face to the wall. 
                     
                     
                         "I'm taking you home now. 
                         Would you like to stay there all 
                         day and rest? You can have the 
                         day off if you want. Perhaps you'd 
                         better?" 
                     
                     
                         Sophia thought a moment. 
                     
                     
                         "No," she finally said, "unless you 
                         don't want me in the office. I'd 
                         rather get back to work." There 
                         was something timid and frightened 
                         in her voice. 
                     
                     
                         "Want you in the office?" With 
                         his characteristic laugh. "We 
                         couldn't get along without you! 
                         That was why I came down there 
                         and insisted upon having you!" 
                     
                     
                         "Then I'll just go home and 
                         freshen up and get right to work. 
                         I'd rather." 
                     
                     
                         "Fine!" 
                     
                     
                         Linden didn't ask her anything 
                         about what had happened. Some- 
                         times Sophia was glad and then the 
                         next moment she longed to tell him 
                         all about it and ask him what he 
                         knew of Arnold's fate and that of 
                         the other man in the case. 
                     
                     
                         She wanted to talk. It would 
                         have relieved her. And yet she felt 
                         she had no right to put the burden 
                         of her confidences on Linden. 
                     
                     
                         Perhaps he wouldn't want to be 
                         that much drawn into the affair. 
                         Because Sophia knew enough of 
                         police procedure to know that even 
                         though she had been released and 
                         was driving away, free, with her 
                         chief, there would still be more to 
                         the case. 
                     
                     
                         Just what direction the rest would 
                         take she couldn't even guess. But 
                         that it was not finished she knew. 
                     
                     
                         Linden stopped the car directly in 
                         front of St. Mark's and was out in- 
                         stantly, attending her as if she  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         might have been a queen of the 
                         realm. 
                     
                     
                         The telephone girl looked up at 
                         her casually; there was no knowl- 
                         edge of what had happened in her 
                         calm and friendly eyes! 
                     
                     
                         "The young lady left your key in 
                         your box, Miss Ambler," she said. 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, thanks, such a lot!" leading 
                         the way to her apartment door. 
                     
                     
                         She was a little bit surprised that 
                         Linden accepted her invitation to 
                         come in and wait while she changed. 
                         Ordinarily he was at his desk at 
                         that hour immersed in flimsy, for 
                         while he did none of the actual edit- 
                         ing himself, he kept in close touch 
                         with incoming news- wire and local. 
                     
                     
                         He said nothing until she emerged 
                         from the bath-dressing room, in 
                         fresh clothes and smiling faintly. 
                     
                     
                         "That was quickly done!" Sophia 
                         was glad that he injected nothing 
                         personal into the moment. So far 
                         he had not asked her one question 
                         or uttered one word of sympathy. 
                     
                     
                         It was better that way, for she 
                         knew that the first word of sym- 
                         pathy would have broken the dam 
                         that was holding back her tears. It 
                         would have been easy to break down 
                         and she didn't want to. 
                     
                     
                         Linden was on his feet, leading 
                         the way to the door, locking it and 
                         handing her the key. 
                     
                     
                         In his car they turned directly to- 
                         ward the office. 
                     
                     
                         At the curb he paused a moment 
                         before getting out and turned to 
                         Sophia. 
                     
                     
                         "No one at the office knows any- 
                         thing about this, except Hick, so 
                         there'll be no explanations." 
                     
                     
                         And for that, too, Sophia was 
                         grateful. 
                     
                     
                         At first it seemed to her that it 
                         would be almost too difficult to take 
                         her place at her desk and go 
                         through the routine of the day, but 
                         as she fell into line of duty it was 
                     
                 
                 LS-8E 
             
             
                 
                 114 Street &amp; Smith's Love Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         the hours previous that began to 
                         seem impossible and dreamlike to 
                         her. 
                     
                     
                         She felt as if it must have been 
                         some other girl who had rushed 
                         madly out in the night to try to res- 
                         cue Arnold Cranston and had only 
                         succeeded in getting herself dragged 
                         into difficulty. 
                     
                     
                         Occasionally her thought lingered 
                         for a moment on Arnold. She 
                         worried a little about him. And yet 
                         she knew that he had so often run 
                         afoul of the police during his drink- 
                         ing that it would probably be noth- 
                         ing new or alarming to him. 
                     
                     
                         In the evening she would get in 
                         touch with him, or he might even 
                         be waiting for her. 
                     
                     
                         Rhoda, of course, had saved her 
                         own skin. There was nothing there 
                         to worry about. 
                     
                     
                         But instead of going straight 
                         home as she had planned when her 
                         office hours were over, Sophia found 
                         Linden standing at her desk. 
                     
                     
                         "You're having dinner with me to- 
                         night", he said. "If you have any 
                         other arrangements, please call 
                         them off. This is important." 
                     
                     
                         There was something like fright in 
                         Sophia's eyes as she looked up at 
                         him. The earnestness of his voice 
                         had alarmed her. He didn't gen- 
                         erally speak to her that way. 
                     
                     
                         "Certainly- why, I'll be glad to!" 
                         she replied, not quite steadily. 
                         "Would you- could we stop at the 
                         apartment so I could change?" 
                     
                     
                         A little grin twisted Linden's lips 
                         as he looked down at her. 
                     
                     
                         The dark silk of her suit looked 
                         as fresh as the moment she had put 
                         it on. Her soft honey-colored hair 
                         waved beautifully under her trim 
                         little hat. 
                     
                     
                         "You look perfect as you are," he 
                         said. 
                     
                     
                         "Then that's all that's neccessary! 
                         On our way!" 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         They drove uptown and along the 
                         Drive, where Sophia looked down 
                         on water that reflected a calm 
                         summer twilight sky. She remem- 
                         bered that other evening when they 
                         had been driving along there and 
                         had seen the blonde whose sharp 
                         anger had sent Linden home in a 
                         blue funk. 
                     
                     
                         Sophia wondered what that girl 
                         was doing on that evening, why Lin- 
                         den was out without her. 
                     
                     
                         Probably she had one of those 
                         swell dates that Linden so disliked 
                         in summer. 
                     
                     
                         They were threading their way 
                         through narrow Riverdale Avenue 
                         in Yonkers, and then up through 
                         wide and beautiful North Broadway 
                         and on to the open road. 
                     
                     
                         They drove miles without a word 
                         and yet there was no strain in the 
                         silence. Their companionship 
                         seemed to be the sort that had no 
                         need for words. It was an easy 
                         thing that blended well with a sum- 
                         mer evening after a hard day. 
                     
                     
                         Through Tarrytown and the roll- 
                         ing hills of Ossining. On to Har- 
                         mon and down a steep hill flanking 
                         the property of one of the former 
                         and well-known wives of a theatrical 
                         producer, to turn sharply right and 
                         bring up at the door of an inn 
                         around which the Croton River 
                         winds with lazy grace. 
                     
                     
                         There, with the car drawn close 
                         to the evergreens flanking the door, 
                         Linden dropped the evening paper, 
                         still damp from the press when they 
                         started, in Sophia's lap. 
                     
                     
                         "Seen it?" he asked. 
                     
                     
                         "No." 
                     
                     
                         "Better look at it then." 
                     
                     
                         Sophia opened it and stared at 
                         the front page. She felt the color 
                         draining from her face. 
                     
                     
                         "This" -she asked in a strained 
                         voice- "is what you brought me out 
                         here for?" 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Little And Lovely 115 
                 
                     
                     
                         "Partly." His voice was natural. 
                         "Only partly. I do want to talk to 
                         you about this. But" -and he was 
                         smiling gently as he bent to take the 
                         keys from the car- "I wanted the 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         pleasure of this evening with you 
                         more." 
                     
                     
                         Sophia felt a smile curving her 
                         lips in spite of the terrific beating of 
                         her heart. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                         Stepping off the porch of the inn, the faint scent of evergreens sweet in her nostrils, Sophia was held by the sheer
                            beauty of the night. Linden seemed to sense her mood. "Beautiful, isn't it?" he murmured. 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 116 Street &amp; Smith's Love Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         "Thanks," she said. 
                     
                     
                         "Thank yourself for being such a 
                         comfortable person to know." 
                     
                     
                         "I'm not sure that's a com- 
                         pliment." 
                     
                     
                         "It is, in this day and age, lady 
                         fair! It certainly is!" 
                     
                     
                         They were out of the car and 
                         walking into the restaurant. 
                     
                     
                         Linden, who evidently knew the 
                         place, led the way to a small private 
                         dining room at the right. 
                     
                     
                         The room drew a gasp of sur- 
                         prised admiration from Sophia. 
                     
                     
                         Its walls in Japanese scenes were 
                         almost startling in an electric, icy 
                         sort of blue, its woodwork black 
                         enamel touched with gold, and its 
                         windows hung with gold-toned 
                         fabric that gave an effect of per- 
                         petual sunshine; its furniture black 
                         lacquer. 
                     
                     
                         Linden caught Sophia's look of 
                         startled and wondering admiration. 
                         He laughed softly. 
                     
                     
                         "Now, I haven't that purpose in 
                         mind at all! If I ever make love to 
                         you it will be honest love, probably 
                         in an early-American setting. It 
                         seems more respectable!" 
                     
                     
                         "I'm not sure that you're not one 
                         of those wicked men that one hears 
                         about. I've never seen a place like 
                         this before!" 
                     
                     
                         And instantly Sophia was con- 
                         scious of the fact that she had said 
                         something that might have been 
                         better left- unsaid. There was a 
                         strange tenseness in the atmosphere 
                         and Linden was leaning across the 
                         table toward her with an air 
                         reminiscent of a certain few mad 
                         moments in the dusk of her apart- 
                         ment that Sophia had never quite 
                         been able to forget. 
                     
                     
                         "No, Sophia," he was saying in 
                         that warm, glowing voice that 
                         seemed to light fires within her own 
                         blood, "you haven't seen this place 
                         before! There are a great many  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         places you haven't seen, things you 
                         haven't done that I'd like to take 
                         you and do with you! With a girl 
                         like you beside him, a man-" he 
                         paused as if just realizing that his 
                         emotion was running away with 
                         him. 
                     
                     
                         And Sophia sat opposite him, mo- 
                         tionless. A spell seemed to have 
                         been cast over her in that moment 
                         and she forgot everything except 
                         that Thursby Linden, who had once 
                         called her "little and lovely," sat 
                         opposite her and that his voice was 
                         echoing to the very uttermost 
                         reaches of her heart. 
                     
                     
                         And then he was talking again 
                         and in his thoroughly businesslike 
                         tone: 
                     
                     
                         "But we didn't come here to be 
                         romantic, young lady, however easy 
                         it may be, with the Croton River 
                         winding down there below us and 
                         gold fish lazing in the water! I want 
                         to talk to you about last night." 
                     
                     
                         Sophia looked up at him, her eyes 
                         apprehensive and very young in 
                         their fright. 
                     
                     
                         "Don't be frightened," Linden 
                         said. "I'm standing by and with 
                         all the confidence in the world in 
                         you, little lady. I just want to 
                         know what really happened last 
                         night. I have the garbled police 
                         version but I want the real one." 
                     
                     
                         And so, while their dinner was 
                         brought to them, Sophia told him 
                         the story of the night before, be- 
                         ginning at the place where she sat 
                         in the garden in her pajamas enjoy- 
                         ing the cool, starlit night. 
                     
                     
                         "I see," Linden said as she 
                         finished. "And you don't want this 
                         girl Rhoda brought into it because 
                         you don't want Vincent Nelson 
                         hurt?" He was looking away and 
                         there was an odd note in his voice. 
                     
                     
                         "No," Sophia murmured quietly. 
                     
                     
                         "You realize, of course, that 
                         there's going to be considerable fuss

                         kicked up over the disappearance of 
                         the girl from the car. Of course, it 
                         will never get out that they had one 
                         girl jailed for her. The mayor 
                         couldn't explain his part in it and 
                         neither could any one else. But 
                         they're going after that girl pretty 
                         hard. There'll be orders given to 
                         let you alone, but under pressure 
                         the police who picked you up may 
                         disregard those orders and come 
                         after you personally to try to get 
                         something on you. Don't you 
                         think then that it would be better 
                         to get this Rhoda to come clean? 
                         Cranston won't talk not as long as 
                         she's out of the picture he says, and 
                         he's apparently a man of his word."  
                     
                         Sophia thought a minute. 
                     
                     
                         "I can't drag Rhoda into it- not 
                         unless she comes forward herself 
                         with her story." 
                     
                     
                         "You're foolish, because she 
                         won't. You're risking things. I'll 
                         protect you as much as I can, but 
                         there may be a limit to what I 
                         can do." 
                     
                     
                         "I'll- I'll risk it," she murmured. 
                     
                     
                         "And there's another phase of

                         Jack Maddern, member of the 
                         wealthy Maddern family. He was

                         the job. That means the Maddern

                         clean this up, little girl. It doesn't 
                         look too good. I feel like putting it 
                         to you that it's your duty to put 
                         the investigators on the right road 
                         by telling them what you know." 
                     
                     
                         "But they wouldn't believe me," 
                         she said, her slim white hands mov- 
                         ing in a gesture of emptiness. 
                     
                     
                         "With the other girl to question 
                         they would." 
                     
                     
                         "You think it s really my duty?" 
                     
                     
                         "Unquestionably. Your duty to 
                         the family of the dead man- any  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         honest citizen's duty. I had this in 
                         mind when I got you released this 
                         morning." 
                     
                     
                         "The only way I'd want to do it," 
                         came thoughtfully from Sophia, 
                         would be by telling her and having 
                         her go to the authorities herself." 
                     
                     
                         "That would be the nicest way to 
                         do it." There was admiration in 
                         the fine dark eyes with which he 
                         looked at her. 
                     
                     
                         For a moment it seemed to 
                         Sophia that her hands would have 
                         to go out across the linen tablecloth 
                         to him, to be held in his. But he 
                         made no move toward her, so she 
                         sat motionless, waiting for the riot 
                         of emotion within her to subside. 
                     
                     
                         "I'll do it then," she said in a 
                         barely audible voice when she dared 
                         trust herself to speak. 
                     
                     
                         "The sooner the better." 
                     
                     
                         "To-morrow evening." 
                     
                     
                         "Make it noon. Have a luncheon 
                         date with her and stay as long as 
                         you wish. Get your point over, 
                         though, before you leave it. It's im- 
                         perative." And his voice was all 
                         business again and his eyes had 
                         cooled. 
                     
                     
                         Sophia felt a distinct sense of let 
                         down and chided herself for it. She 
                         had no right to mistake his interest 
                         in her! She was being utterly 
                         foolish! 
                     
                     
                         "I'll try to." 
                     
                     
                         "That s the stuff!" 
                     
                     
                         The dregs of coffee in their cups 
                         had long ago grown cold. Linden 
                         signaled the waiter and paid the 
                         check.  
                     
                         CHAPTER VI. 
                     
                     
                         Outside a soft, fitful summer 
                         shower had rustled through the 
                         trees and shrubbery and spangled 
                         them with glistening jewels. Sum- 
                         mer evening, with a sky set with a 
                         million stars, was folding gently 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 118 Street &amp; Smith's Love Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         down over the earth- a thing of soft 
                         shadows and gentle breezes, of low 
                         murmurings. 
                     
                     
                         Stepping off the porch of the inn, 
                         the faint scent of evergreens sweet 
                         in her nostrils, Sophia was held by 
                         the sheer beauty of it. 
                     
                     
                         City people missed so much, she 
                         thought. 
                     
                     
                         Never to know the faint sounds 
                         of summer evening in the country, 
                         the soft sighing of wind in the trees, 
                         the vagrant scents of sleeping 
                         flowers, the whir of wings in the 
                         dusk almost that was never to 
                         live! 
                     
                     
                         Linden seemed to sense her mood. 
                     
                     
                         "Beautiful, isn't it?" And there 
                         was that in his voice that made it 
                         seem as if his arms had reached out 
                         for her and then dared not claim her, 
                         and had drawn suddenly back 
                         again. 
                     
                     
                         Sophia knew a sense of chill and 
                         of hurt. A strange aloneness that 
                         almost frightened her. 
                     
                     
                         And then, with an almost actual 
                         physical effort she shook it off. 
                         Foolish to miss his caresses when 
                         they had never been hers and never 
                         had or could mean anything to her! 
                         Foolish to let their omission make 
                         her feel so deserted and alone! 
                     
                     
                         And then she was sitting in the 
                         car and Linden was slipping in be- 
                         side her and behind the wheel. 
                     
                     
                         She wondered if his hands act- 
                         ually trembled a little as they took 
                         the wheel or if she only imagined 
                         that. The light was so uncertain. 
                     
                     
                         "I'd like to go the other way in- 
                         stead of back to town," Linden said 
                         in a low voice as the motor started. 
                     
                     
                         Sophia was looking out into the 
                         night and echoing his thought a 
                         thousandfold, too poignantly to 
                         speak, so she merely turned and 
                         smiled at him. 
                     
                     
                         "Laughing at me, aren't you, 
                         lady fair?" And he had broken the 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         spell and was Thursby Linden, the 
                         great publisher again. 
                     
                     
                         But it wasn't so easy for Sophia. 
                         Laughing at him! As if she could 
                         when suddenly she knew that her 
                         heart ached with a strange empti- 
                         ness, because his arms had failed to 
                         do what his voice had hinted. 
                     
                     
                         "I hope I haven't kept you from 
                         some other date to-night," he said 
                         after a short silence. "I had to have 
                         this out with you, though. I want 
                         to know that you're going to be 
                         clear of things yourself." 
                     
                     
                         "No, I hadn't any other date. I 
                         was glad when you asked me." 
                     
                     
                         Linden turned to her sharply for 
                         a moment. 
                     
                     
                         "Were you?" And once more it 
                         seemed that something infinitely 
                         sweet and close hung in the air, 
                         something that Sophia wanted to 
                         snatch and hold against her heart 
                         and never let it go. 
                     
                     
                         But a moment later his attention 
                         was on the road again and Sophia 
                         was contenting herself with looking 
                         at the river which stretched out to- 
                         ward the city like a path of silver. 
                     
                     
                         As they drove along and the night 
                         grew darker the stars overhead were 
                         like brittle crystal against the dark- 
                         blue velvet of the sky and summer 
                         night scents assailed her nostrils. 
                     
                     
                         It was all so beautifully dream- 
                         like. It didn't seem possible that 
                         there was the city to go back to 
                         with its heat and duty. 
                     
                     
                         Sophia felt the air on her face 
                         grow gradually warmer as they ap- 
                         proached the city until finally, it 
                         seemed to be fanned from huge 
                         radiators. 
                     
                     
                         It was over all too quickly that 
                         glimpse of country in mid-summer. 
                     
                     
                         "It's been lovely," she said to 
                         Linden as he crossed the sidewalk 
                         with her toward the entrance of the 
                         group of buildings in which was her 
                         tiny apartment. 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Little And Lovely 119 
                 
                     
                     
                         He smiled down at her. Sophia 
                         could just see his eyes gleaming in 
                         the soft light. 
                     
                     
                         "Not half so lovely as you've 
                         been," he said. 
                     
                     
                         She felt suddenly foolishly word- 
                         less. She knew that she should 
                         have some light flippant reply for 
                         that, but none came to her vivid 
                         lips. A thing that usually was easy 
                         for her was suddenly impossible. 
                     
                     
                         She looked up at him as they 
                         stood at the door of her studio. Her 
                         wide and lovely gray eyes met his 
                         dark ones just as their wistfulness 
                         was at its peak. 
                     
                     
                         "Sophia!" 
                     
                     
                         It came from him a trace huskily 
                         as she swung the door back and said 
                         gayly: 
                     
                     
                         "'Won't you come into my 
                         parlor?' said the spider to the fly." 
                         And she would have given worlds to 
                         have recalled those words then, just 
                         after her name had come from his 
                         lips sounding so like a prayer! 
                     
                     
                         "I can't think of anything nicer 
                         at the moment." He was once more 
                         the perfectly controlled publisher, 
                         lighting a cigarette with fine non- 
                         chalance, while Sophia's lips trem- 
                         bled over it and her breath came 
                         almost too unevenly to draw. 
                     
                     
                         But he seemed not to notice and 
                         with a perfectly steady hand lifted 
                         the match to his own cigarette. 
                     
                     
                         "Sweet little place you've got 
                         here," he said after they d sat for a 
                         moment of silence. 
                     
                     
                         "I like it." 
                     
                     
                         And it seemed to Sophia such 
                         silly conversation, such foolish 
                         meaningless words to say when 
                         there was really so much that she 
                         wanted to say to him. 
                     
                     
                         But something had happened to 
                         the evening. That whimsical mood 
                         of romance that had seemed to hang 
                         so tenderly near their grasp on 
                         several occasions eluded them en-  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         tirely for the remainder of the eve- 
                         ning and Sophia held out her hand 
                         with prim formality as Linden rose 
                         to go. 
                     
                     
                         "It's been lovely this evening," 
                         she heard herself saying with 
                         strained formality when she wanted 
                         to say so many other things. "And 
                         it's wonderful of you to have in- 
                         terested yourself in me, helped me 
                         so to-day. I don't know what 
                         would have happened to me other- 
                         wise." And she was looking up at 
                         him very earnestly. 
                     
                     
                         But Linden brushed it all aside 
                         with an easy laugh. 
                     
                     
                         "Nonsense, child! you'd always 
                         get by- anywhere, anytime!" And 
                         then: "But don't fail to take care 
                         of that other matter to-morrow- 
                         the other girl." 
                     
                     
                         Sophia wondered if he'd even 
                         heard her reply, so casual and care- 
                         less was his leaving. 
                     
                     
                         She turned back to her room with 
                         an oddly unfinished, uncomfortable 
                         feeling. He'd been so casual and as 
                         for herself- She couldn't quite 
                         understand. 
                     
                     
                         She had supposed all along she 
                         had been in love with Vincent Nel- 
                         son, and yet it took only the near- 
                         ness of Linden since that first eve- 
                         ning to set her very blood on fire, 
                         to start a thousand wistful dreams 
                         in her heart. 
                     
                     
                         And his leave-taking had been so 
                         casual! 
                     
                     
                         Yet he had troubled to come and 
                         get her that morning, had put him- 
                         self in a position of obligation for 
                         her! Surely that meant some- 
                         thing! There were other girls in the 
                         office who could take his dictation 
                         almost as well as she could. 
                     
                     
                         Her brain was chaotic that eve- 
                         ning as she turned to her bed. One 
                         thing stood out even over and 
                         above her charge to see Rhoda on 
                         the morrow Thursby Linden had 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 120 Street &amp; Smith's Love Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         spoken her name with emotion 
                         weighting his voice! 
                     
                     
                         She held the memory of that close 
                         against her heart. Whatever else 
                         might come, she would always have 
                         that. 
                     
                     
                         And with all the shadow that 
                         hung over her, knowing well that 
                         she was the mysterious girl who 
                         figured in the newspaper story of 
                         the murder, Sophia Ambler slept 
                         with a smile curving her colorful 
                         lips. 
                     
                     
                         The man she loved had betrayed 
                         his own emotion in the speaking of 
                         her name! Her heart sang at that. 
                         New hope filled it. 
                     
                     
                         And she loved him. She was 
                         finally ready to admit that. 
                     
                     
                         Her sleep that night was dream- 
                         ridden. Blondes with clear, high, 
                         haughty voices passed swiftly 
                         through her dreaming in high 
                         powered limousines and looked 
                         back angrily, men drank too much 
                         and then staggered crazily to cars 
                         which they smashed into other cars. 
                     
                     
                         And Sophia awakened herself 
                         from sleep with her own cry of 
                         fright at a collision of dreamed 
                         automobiles. 
                     
                     
                         She went back to sleep only to 
                         dream again of hysterical girls cry- 
                         ing, begging to be spared the con- 
                         sequences of their own folly. 
                     
                     
                         Sophia wasn't much rested when 
                         she awakened to the light of an- 
                         other day. 
                     
                     
                         But she dressed with more care 
                         than usual. It seemed imperative 
                         that she look well. Thursby Lin- 
                         den would be at the office, at the 
                         desk next to hers. 
                     
                     
                         He glanced up but with only a 
                         cool good morning, as she took 
                         her place near him and she felt as 
                         if her heart was sinking untold 
                         miles. 
                     
                     
                         It was at noon that he seemed to 
                         really realize her presence. She was  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         standing at her desk putting on her 
                         hat to go to lunch. 
                     
                     
                         "You're to take your time to- 
                         day," he said in a voice that held a 
                         note of gentleness. "Be sure to take 
                         care of that matter." 
                     
                     
                         "I will. And thanks." She 
                         looked down at him, her wide gray 
                         eyes grateful. Surely he must care, 
                         she thought, what happened to her. 
                     
                     
                         She had called Vincent's office 
                         and made the date with Rhoda 
                         through him. Vincent had not even 
                         talked to Rhoda about it so sure 
                         was he of her doing what he asked. 
                     
                     
                         "Tell her it's important," Sophia 
                         had added just before she hung up. 
                     
                     
                         And so Rhoda appeared at 
                         Sophia's apartment a bit defiantly. 
                     
                     
                         "You might have at least asked 
                         for me," she said nastily. 
                     
                     
                         Something flamed within Sophia 
                         at the words. She had intended to 
                         be kind to the girl. All her anger 
                         at Vin had died out and seemed to 
                         leave her with no reason to be any- 
                         thing but kind and understanding 
                         to a girl who found herself in an 
                         unreckoned difficulty. 
                     
                     
                         But Rhoda's words swept all her 
                         kind intentions before them like so 
                         much sun-baked chaff in a strong 
                         wind. 
                     
                     
                         "Because I knew you wouldn't 
                         come if I did," she said coldly. "I 
                         knew that with Vin aware of the 
                         date you'd have to keep it or ex- 
                         plain things to him. And that 
                         might be difficult!" 
                     
                     
                         "I don't know what you're talking 
                         about!" 
                     
                     
                         Sophia stared at the girl. 
                     
                     
                         "I'm talking about the night be- 
                         fore last," she finally said. 
                     
                     
                         Rhoda shrugged her shoulder. 
                     
                     
                         "That doesn't mean anything 
                         to me!" 
                     
                     
                         Sophia wondered if she was hear- 
                         ing aright or if it was all some 
                         strange dream. Rhoda who, the 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Little And Lovely 121 
                 
                     
                     
                         last time she had seen her, was 
                         cringing and begging for protection, 
                         was suddenly coldly defiant. 
                     
                     
                         "Perhaps you think it doesn't," 
                         Sophia said after a little silence. 
                         "But that isn't all cleared up. If 
                         you've read the papers you know 
                         that Arnold's in a jam, a bad one, 
                         and won't talk." She waited, half 
                         expecting Rhoda to speak but when 
                         no word came from the other girl: 
                         "It's up to you to do something." 
                     
                     
                         "I haven't anything to do with- 
                         I'm not doing anything!" 
                     
                     
                         "You haven't anything to do with 
                         it? Rhoda!" Sophia exclaimed, 
                         scarcely able to believe that she had 
                         heard aright. 
                     
                     
                         "Of course not! No one knows 
                         that I was even out with Arnold 
                         that night! Why should I volun- 
                         tarily step into such a mess?" 
                     
                     
                         "Because"- the word coming 
                         slowly as she tried to understand 
                         the other girl's code- "you are the 
                         only one who can tell what hap- 
                         pened, who can put the seal of truth 
                         on Arnold's story that he was at 
                         certain places that night with you, 
                         drinking, when Maddem was killed. 
                         They know how long he had been 
                         dead when they found him. If 
                         Arnold can prove that he had only 
                         reached that spot a few moments 
                         before he was found there, he'll be 
                         all right. Otherwise-" she 
                         paused dreading to say the words 
                         that came to her mind. "Don't you 
                         see what you can do for him? You 
                         can save Arnold from-" 
                     
                     
                         "That's ridiculous!" the other 
                         girl broke in. "Arnold has money, 
                         let him spend it getting out! Why 
                         should I risk my position, risk losing 
                         Vin just to save him? To spare 
                         him a little trouble? It means my 
                         whole life. I'm not going to do it; 
                         and if that's what you called me 
                         here for, you've just wasted a good 
                         lunch!" 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         They were at the table and 
                         Sophia was pouring tea from the 
                         quaint orchid pot. 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, no, I haven't," Sophia said. 
                         "Suppose I tell what I know? I 
                         will, if I have to." 
                     
                     
                         "What you know!" Derisively. 
                         "What good would that do! What 
                         do you know, after all?" 
                     
                     
                         "About your coming in here that 
                         night as you did." 
                     
                     
                         There was a little pause during 
                         which the girls eyed each other and 
                         seemed to match purpose. It was 
                         Rhoda who broke the silence and 
                         startlingly: 
                     
                     
                         "I'd say you lied." 
                     
                     
                         Her words dropped into the 
                         silence of the room like particles of 
                         ice falling on cold concrete. 
                     
                     
                         Their chill seemed to go through 
                         to the very bones of Sophia. She 
                         shivered as she looked into the 
                         opaque eyes of the girl opposite her. 
                         She had the feeling of being in some 
                         strange and horribly unreal dream. 
                     
                     
                         This couldn't be the girl Vincent 
                         Nelson had paragonized. He had 
                         said she was good. Good! 
                     
                     
                         "And who would there be to 
                         prove that I wasn't telling the 
                         truth?" Rhoda was going on. 
                         "People would believe me before 
                         they would you. It pays to have a 
                         good reputation, you know!" 
                     
                     
                         Sophia gasped at the words and 
                         stared at the other girl as if she was 
                         discovering a new kind of human. 
                     
                     
                         "I'm not going to sacrifice my- 
                         self for Arnold Cranston!" Rhoda 
                         continued. "Why should I?" 
                     
                     
                         "You wouldn't be sacrificing your- 
                         self. you'd only be helping Arnold, 
                         getting him out of a jam, releasing

                         car in which Maddern was found. 
                         It's mad of even the police to link 
                         him with Maddern's death, but 
                         they've got to pin the thing on some

                         "But you wouldn't be," Sophia 
                         persisted. "I should think you'd 
                         welcome a chance to test Vincent's

                         Rhoda laughed unpleasantly.

                         "And you're letting things like 
                         that keep you from being honest 
                         about Arnold?" There was unbelief 
                         in Sophia s voice. It was almost 
                         impossible that Rhoda, who had 
                         been worrying over a nephew being 
                         out at night, could be so hard and 
                         callous. 
                     
                     
                         "It isn't a matter of that- it's 
                         what's going to happen to me that 
                         I'm thinking of. I can't afford to 
                         do anything different than I am." 
                     
                     
                         "Then I suppose," Sophia began 
                         in a lower tone, "that it would be 
                         just as useless to tell you that I'm 
                         in the jam almost as badly as 
                         Arnold is? Mr. Linden has gotten 
                         me out. I spent a night in a cell 
                         for you. It s pretty indefinite 
                         whether I'll stay out or not."  
                     
                         Rhoda paused on that for a mo- 
                         ment. Then: 
                     
                     
                         "Surely if your boss" -with a 
                         peculiar intonation - "can get you 
                         out, he has influence enough to keep 
                         you out. And that should be 
                         enough for you. Let people stew 
                         in their own juice, I say! If Arnold 
                         hadn't been drinking so much they'd 
                         believe what he says and he'd be 
                         all right. He needs a lesson!" 
                     
                     
                         "So do a lot of us, Rhoda, but not 
                         quite this cruel a lesson." 
                     
                     
                         "Well, is there anything else you 
                         want to say to me?" She had 
                         finished the crisp salad Sophia had 
                         put before her. 
                     
                     
                         W"ould there be any use saying 
                         anything else to you?" 
                     
                     
                         Not if it's along the line you 
                         have been talking." 
                     
                     
                         Sophia sat staring out the low 
                         windows at the back of her apart-  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         ment, windows that looked out onto 
                         the garden she loved, the pool where 
                         fish that she had actually made 
                         friends with, moved like darts of 
                         gold, the trees and privet that 
                         swayed in every breeze that passed 
                         but she saw none of the beauty 
                         of it. 
                     
                     
                         She was thinking of a number of 
                         things of love and the things it did 
                         to people. Rhoda cheating cruelly 
                         and calling it love. The exquisite 
                         blonde polluting Linden's leisure 
                         hours with "musts," and calling it 
                         love. 
                     
                     
                         "Love" was a word, she decided, 
                         that could mean almost anything 
                         or nothing at all. 
                     
                     
                         "Well?" It was Rhoda smiling 
                         faintly, a tinge of triumph in the 
                         smile. She evidently felt that she 
                         had won her point. 
                     
                     
                         Sophia looked up at her, studying 
                         her face intently for an instant. 
                     
                     
                         "Well, nothing, I guess," she said 
                         finally. "There just isn't any more! 
                         Everything's been said that can be. 
                         I don't know what next." And then 
                         she paused a moment, a strange 
                         little smile twisting her vivid lips 
                         as an idea, rather a memory, came 
                         to her. She said: 
                     
                     
                         "You're getting away with this 
                         just as you got away with that story 
                         about the attempt at kidnaping you, 
                         aren't you? Or, at least, you think 
                         you are." 
                     
                     
                         It startled Rhoda for a moment, 
                         caught her off guard, but only for 
                         a moment. She grinned. 
                     
                     
                         "Well, it worked anyway, didn't 
                         it?" she asked. "Vin didn't let me 
                         go home alone any more. I'm not 
                         so dumb, after all!" 
                     
                     
                         "Pretty cheap stuff though." A 
                         trace of loathing in her voice as she 
                         thought back to the night Rhoda 
                         had told that far-fetched tale. 
                     
                     
                         "Well, all's fair in love and war, 
                         ole dear! And this was both! It

                         worked just as what I'm doing now 
                         will work!" 
                     
                     
                         "I hope you know what you're 
                         talking about." 
                     
                     
                         "Is that all you wanted of me?" 
                     
                     
                         "Yes, that s all," Sophia replied 
                         quietly, not looking at the girl. 
                     
                     
                         "Well" -with an attempt at 
                         airiness- "thanks for a nice lunch!" 
                         Rhoda stood at the door a moment 
                         and waited for a reply. Then when 
                         none came she closed it and passed 
                         on out into the heat of mid-after- 
                         noon. 
                     
                     
                         Sophia in the cool dimness of her 
                         apartment looked at the clock on 
                         the high old mantel. 
                     
                     
                         Half past two! They had sat long 
                         at lunch and accomplished nothing. 
                     
                     
                         She must get back to the office. 
                     
                     
                         She was just rising, ready to 
                         powder her nose and put on her hat, 
                         when the telephone tinkled. 
                     
                     
                         Something about the sound 
                         breaking into the quiet of that hour 
                         startled her, though actually there 
                         should be nothing alarming about 
                         the ringing of one's telephone. That 
                         is what one had it for! 
                     
                     
                         She answered it and started a 
                         little at the voice that she heard. 
                     
                     
                         She listened a moment. 
                     
                     
                         "But I can come," she said. 
                     
                     
                         "No, don't," Linden said crisply. 
                         "I'd rather you wouldn't. I've got- 
                         ten wind of something. Don't be 
                         alarmed. I can handle it but 
                         please don't come to the office." 
                     
                     
                         "All right, if you say so." And 
                         she knew that Thursby Linden must 
                         have heard the tremor of fear in 
                         her voice, for his reply came 
                         quickly: 
                     
                     
                         "I'll be there in as near an hour 
                         as I can make it. Meantime, don't 
                         let any one in unless you know 
                         them." 
                     
                     
                         "All right." 
                     
                     
                         Sophia's slim white hands were 
                         icy as she turned from the tele-  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         phone. Fear clutched at her heart 
                         like a strangling hand. 
                     
                     
                         And then she tried to laugh at 
                         herself. What, after all, had she to 
                         fear? She had done nothing. Quite 
                         accidentally she had become en- 
                         tangled in a crime but she had no 
                         part in it. 
                     
                     
                         She was even free. Not even out 
                         on bail. So what had she to fear! 
                     
                     
                         She tried to laugh herself out of 
                         the strange mood that had sud- 
                         denly possessed her. She scoffed at 
                         herself. Why she hadn't even the 
                         courage of Rhoda! 
                     
                     
                         Rhoda laughed at the whole thing 
                         and she was really a part of it! 
                     
                     
                         She flayed herself for a craven. 
                     
                     
                         But her hands trembled as she 
                         washed and put away the dishes 
                         and some of the fine china showed 
                         nicks as it was put back on the 
                         shelf. Sophia turned from it rue- 
                         fully. She had loved that set- 
                         orchid, and thin as an eggshell. 
                         Against her soft green linens it 
                         looked like an exquisite garden. 
                     
                     
                         She slipped out of her office 
                         clothes and into a soft eggshell 
                         white with a stunning sash of black. 
                     
                     
                         If Thursby Linden was coming to 
                         see her, no use of reminding him of 
                         the office. And it was nice to dress 
                         up for a change- nice, she realized, 
                         to dress up for him. 
                     
                     
                         But still her hands trembled a 
                         little over the fastening of the smart, 
                         heavy sash. 
                     
                     
                         It was longer than an hour be- 
                         fore Linden appeared and when 
                         finally he did, Sophia knew a sense 
                         of relief. 
                     
                     
                         At least with him there nothing 
                         could happen. 
                     
                     
                         "It was nice of you to let me 
                         have the afternoon off. It's so 
                         warm," she said, after all her fever 
                         of anticipation, falling back into the 
                         employee-and-employer attitude. 
                     
                     
                         She had wanted just for that once 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 126 Street &amp; Smith's Love Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         with him to live up to the dress she 
                         had put on. And then failed. 
                     
                     
                         "I think I was doing myself a 
                         favor in giving myself the oppor- 
                         tunity to come here," he said, 
                         settling in a comfortable chair, light- 
                         ing his cigarette and then sitting 
                         back to look admiringly at her. "I 
                         wonder if you have any idea of how 
                         charming you are?" 
                     
                     
                         "I wouldn't mind a bit being 
                         told!" With an audaciousness that 
                         doubly enhanced her fragile love- 
                         liness. 
                     
                     
                         Thursby Linden's dark eyes were 
                         warm with something more than 
                         admiration as he looked at her. He 
                         bent and caught her hand as she 
                         passed him and, staying her 
                         progress, lifted it to his lips. 
                     
                     
                         "We'll come to that later. I 
                         always like to leave the nicest things 
                         until last. Right now we have 
                         something rather serious to talk 
                         about. Don't get frightened," as he 
                         saw the dark points of alarm widen 
                         her lovely gray eyes. "I just want 
                         to put you on your guard, lady fair, 
                         so that we can give you the 
                         maximum protection." 
                     
                     
                         "Protection from what?" 
                     
                     
                         "Well" -and he was trying to 
                         laugh slightly at the thing- "from 
                         this sort of thing." 
                     
                     
                         He rose, moved to the studio 
                         couch where she sat and dropped 
                         down beside her and held out a bit 
                         of paper upon which words were 
                         crudely printed. 
                     
                     
                         "I don't know how much there is 
                         to this," he said, well concealing the 
                         alarm that he felt. "But it's best 
                         not to miss any bets in a thing like 
                         this. We've got a new kind of 
                         criminal to deal with nowadays. A 
                         new sort of desperation, more petty 
                         and still worse to deal with. A 
                         thing that stoops to a depth of 
                         vicious cruelty that normal people 
                         can't quite conceive of. I'm telling  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         you this, Sophia, not to frighten you 
                         but just to put you on your guard 
                         -very much on your guard."  
                     
                         Sophia took the piece of paper 
                         and looked up at the man forcing 
                         a brave little smile to her lips: 
                     
                     
                         "I'm not afraid, mister!" With a 
                         funny little swagger of bravado. 
                         "Bring on your bold, bad men!"  
                     
                         But her pale face became even a 
                         shade paler as she read the crude 
                         words on the soiled paper. 
                     
                     
                         She looked up at Linden speech- 
                         less. 
                     
                     
                         "A kid, a little street urchin, 
                         brought that into the office straight 
                         to my desk this noon, shortly after 
                         you'd gone. He scooted past every 
                         barrier no one could stop him 
                         barefoot and ragged! and came 
                         straight to my desk. Some one had 
                         put him wise as to just where to 
                         come with that. And you, little 
                         lady, evidently were shadowed this 
                         noon as was your guest!" 
                     
                     
                         "No!" Startled, the word burst 
                         from her lips. 
                     
                     
                         "I'm afraid so. Whoever it was 
                         who murdered young Maddern 
                         knows that I'm here right now!" he 
                         said quietly. And it was then that 
                         Sophia noticed that he had been 
                         speaking in a very subdued tone 
                         since his arrival at the apartment. 
                     
                     
                         "But you have nothing to do with 
                         it- we have nothing to do with it!" 
                     
                     
                         "I know, child, but they've got a 
                         goat there- Arnold Cranston- and 
                         they don't want your story to re- 
                         lease him and set the police on the 
                         trail of the real killers. Coppers get 
                         funny when they're driven by the 
                         chiefs. And there's been a drive 
                         lately a hard one. Higher-ups 
                         have been criticized because mur- 
                         derers, thieves, and kidnapers have 
                         been getting away with their swag 
                         and no one has been caught. The 
                         higher-ups have brought pressure to 
                         bear and the result is that the cops

                         are going to bring in some one for 
                         every crime now. As long as they 
                         have some one to pin a thing to 
                         they won't make much of an effort 
                         to get any one else. As long as they 
                         can hold Cranston there everything 
                         will be hunky-dory. Cranston's 
                         pretty much alone in the world. 
                         There's no one turning heaven and 
                         earth to get him out poor bird. 
                         And he's evidently too much of a 
                         man to give this other girl away." 
                     
                     
                         "But he will give her away when 
                         he realizes how serious it's going to 
                         be with him!" 
                     
                     
                         "I'm not so sure," he replied, in 
                         a tone as if he himself wondered at 
                         the fellow. "I've been looking into 
                         that and the strange part of it is 
                         that he's fallen into an attitude of 
                         not caring. He seems to feel his 
                         life isn't worth mixing other people 
                         up in trouble and so he isn't saying 
                         a word!" 
                     
                     
                         "But he can't do that! Why, it's 
                         crazy of them to accuse him- crazy! 
                         There isn't a bit of evidence that 
                         points to him!" 
                     
                     
                         "Of course there isn't. The case 
                         against him is as full of holes as a 
                         sieve. There just isn't any case 
                         against him! But what difference 
                         does that make? Until some one 
                         else shows up they've got him and 
                         the wheels of justice are moving 
                         along and, of course, the time will 
                         come when it will be too late to do 
                         anything even if any one would." 
                         Sophia stared. Her eyes were 
                         wide with horror. It seemed im- 
                         possible that her innocent hurrying 
                         across the street that night could 
                         have resulted in so much turmoil. 
                     
                     
                         It seemed impossible that the 
                         processes of law and the thing called 
                         justice could be so weird. 
                     
                     
                         There was nothing sane or sen- 
                         sible about holding Arnold! 
                     
                     
                         Any one could see that. But the  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         trouble was no one wanted to that 
                         is, no one who mattered. 
                     
                     
                         Sophia looked down then, again, 
                         at the note in her hand. 
                     
                     
                         She shivered as if a cold wind had 
                         blown over her and closed her eyes 
                         for a moment.  
                     
                         CHAPTER VII. 
                     
                     
                         When Sophia opened her eyes 
                         again, she felt Linden's gaze upon 
                         her and saw in the dark depths of 
                         his fine eyes that warm, gentle 
                         thing that had gone so straight to 
                         her heart and held it once before. 
                     
                     
                         She made an impulsive movement 
                         toward him. Her slim white hands 
                         went out involuntarily through the 
                         cool dimness of the room. It 
                         seemed to her that her very heart 
                         was crying out in its loneliness and 
                         longing. 
                     
                     
                         And then the sharp ringing of the 
                         telephone bell shrilled through the 
                         silence. 
                     
                     
                         Sophia started. A mask of fear 
                         lay for a moment over her white, 
                         startled face. The thing was getting 
                         her nerves. 
                     
                     
                         Linden understood. He was on 
                         his feet beside her. He had her 
                         hands in his, small, cold, fluttering. 
                         He held them firmly. 
                     
                     
                         "Hold on to yourself," he said in 
                         a low, calm tone. "You really 
                         haven't a thing to fear as long as 
                         you're careful and I'm seeing to it 
                         that you're that. Let me listen 
                         while you answer." 
                     
                     
                         Sophia lifted the instrument and 
                         spoke into it. It seemed that she 
                         waited a thousand years for some 
                         sound from the other end of the 
                         wire. 
                     
                     
                         It came finally, low, guttural, 
                         horrible: 
                     
                     
                         "Say, lady, if you like the place 
                         you're livin', better lay off the

                         Sophia shivered and closed her eyes. When she opened them again, she saw in the dark depths of Linden's eyes that
                            warm, gentle thing that had gone straight to her heart and held it once before. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         idea of spilling what you know 
                         about the fellow that's up for the 
                         Maddern killing. There was just 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         a moment's silence. Then: "And 
                         we don't mean mabye!"  
                     
                         Before the man had finished

                         speaking Linden had rushed from 
                         the room to the operator out in the 
                         hall. 
                     
                     
                         "Find out where Miss Ambler's 
                         call is coming from, please!" he or- 
                         dered crisply. 
                     
                     
                         The girl plugged in, investigated, 
                         and then turned to the waiting man. 
                     
                     
                         "The party's hung up and there's 
                         no way of tracing him," she said 
                         politely. 
                     
                     
                         Thursby Linden managed to 
                         thank her just as politely and then 
                         hurried back to Sophia to find her 
                         standing, white and frightened, the 
                         telephone still in her hand. 
                     
                     
                         Linden took it from her and re- 
                         placed it. 
                     
                     
                         "That was close," he said. "I ex- 
                         pected it, but it came even a little 
                         sooner than I thought. Some one 
                         followed your girl friend here and 
                         listened to your conversation. Do 
                         you think we'd better warn her?" 
                     
                     
                         Sophia grinned cynically. 
                     
                     
                         "She's safe. A forty mule team 
                         couldn't pull the facts from her. 
                         She's going to let things go just as 
                         they will." 
                     
                     
                         "Then the less we say to her the 
                         better. She might even turn in with 
                         the other side." 
                     
                     
                         "I suppose things like that do 
                         happen, though Rhoda's supposed 
                         to be good!" With a trace of sar- 
                         casm in the tone. Her courage was 
                         returning to her, flooding back and 
                         washing before it all the fear that 
                         had rioted her. 
                     
                     
                         There was something to fight and 
                         she was ready for it! 
                     
                     
                         Suddenly she seemed to gird her- 
                         self for battle. She even stood and 
                         pulled the smart black sash a bit 
                         around her. 
                     
                     
                         Linden grinned. 
                     
                     
                         "You have the air of getting 
                         ready for battle!" he said. 
                     
                     
                         "That's just what I'm doing! I 
                         suppose this is what that note 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         meant. I'm the dame that was to 
                         keep her trap shut?" 
                     
                     
                         "Yes, little and lovely. They 
                         dared refer to your exquisite mouth 
                         in that way!" he exclaimed, in ten- 
                         der humor. 
                     
                     
                         "I'll make them pay!" In humor, 
                         but there was something grim about 
                         it. "I'm going to be one of those 
                         girls that makes them pay and pay 
                         and pay if you know what I 
                         mean!" 
                     
                     
                         There was frank admiration in 
                         Linden's eyes. 
                     
                     
                         "You're made of swell stuff, 
                         Sophia," he said, his voice echoing 
                         the admiration of his eyes. 
                     
                     
                         "And you're made of grand stuff!" 
                         She was standing, hands behind her, 
                         looking up at him. And then with 
                         a gay little laugh: "Aren't we the 
                         bouquet slingers though!" 
                     
                     
                         "But with me, Sophia, I'm afraid 
                         it wasn't a bouquet." There was a 
                         rather tensely quiet note in his 
                         voice. 
                     
                     
                         "You're not insinuating that my 
                         flowers were any less real than 
                         yours?" 
                     
                     
                         "No, only that I don't deserve 
                         them so much. A brave woman is 
                         something, Sophia. A brave one 
                         who is at the same time generous 
                         and feminine and lovely." 
                     
                     
                         "Should I take a bow?" she asked, 
                         laughing with sweet lightness. 
                     
                     
                         "I think you should!" 
                     
                     
                         And then for a moment they stood 
                         looking at each other again with 
                         that peculiar, warm, tense electric 
                         current passing between them. 
                         Sophia felt as if his arms were reach- 
                         ing out for her; she had the sensa- 
                         tion of being held in them and yet 
                         they were standing apart, his arms 
                         down at his sides. 
                     
                     
                         "But, after all, the joking's over" 
                         -her voice was quite serious- 
                         "threats or no threats, I'm not go-

                         terrific price that he's apt to have 
                         to if some one doesn't interfere. I'm 
                         going to talk when the time comes, 
                         regardless!" 
                     
                     
                         Thursby Linden's hand moved up 
                         in a staying gesture as if he would 
                         have stopped the words that some 
                         one listening in might hear. But it 
                         was too late. They had poured 
                         from Sophia's vivid lips with young 
                         and passionate earnestness. 
                     
                     
                         "Sophia!" In low voiced protest. 
                         She stopped then and looked 
                         around as if there might be some 
                         one in the room. 
                     
                     
                         "What a rash child you are!" 
                     
                     
                         And then once more they found 
                         themselves standing, staring at each 
                         other. 
                     
                     
                         "Have you a date for to-night?" 
                         Linden asked finally and quite 
                         frankly. 
                     
                     
                         Sophia grinned. 
                     
                     
                         "No, tall and handsome," she 
                         said. "I told you I'd been stood up. 
                         I haven't any dates any more I'm 
                         all out of them!" 
                     
                     
                         "That boy will come running 
                         back as soon as he finds out how 
                         lucky he was when you looked at 
                         him! But that's neither here nor 
                         there! If you haven't a date, how 
                         about going out with me? I have 
                         an engagement with that blond 
                         queen who spit fire from the 
                         limousine the other night, but why 
                         not come along with us?" 
                     
                     
                         Sophia stared at him for a mo- 
                         ment. 
                     
                     
                         "Do you realize what you're ask- 
                         ing, Thursby Linden?" she ques- 
                         tioned. "Do you know that you're 
                         just begging for trouble when you 
                         suggest such a thing to that girl?"  
                     
                         Linden laughed easily. 
                     
                     
                         "You don't know her!" he said. 
                         "Lisbet likes meeting people better 
                         than anything she does. You know, 
                         she's one of those girls who's always 
                         studying types- oh, very seriously 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         because she's going to write a 
                         book some day! She'll be crazy to 
                         know you. You'll be something new 
                         to her! She's often asked me about 
                         the girls in the office." 
                     
                     
                         "I know, but asking you about 
                         them, being mildly curious about 
                         what kind of fish, flesh or small fry 
                         they are, and going out in the same 
                         party with them are two quite dif- 
                         ferent things, ole dear, if I may 
                         say so." 
                     
                     
                         "You may say so, little and 
                         lovely," catching her mood, "but 
                         that doesn't mean that I believe it! 
                         I know Lisbet. She's got her funny 
                         little ways, but on the inside she's 
                         all right. I'm going to call her."  
                     
                         And before Sophia could say any- 
                         thing more he had the telephone in 
                         his hand and was giving an East 
                         Side number. 
                     
                     
                         "Surely, sweet, I'd love to! I'd 
                         be thrilled! I think that s grand 
                         perfectly grand!" 
                     
                     
                         Linden had drawn Sophia into the 
                         circle of his arm and held the phone 
                         so that she could hear what Lisbet's 
                         high, sweet voice said. 
                     
                     
                         "And so, you see," he said after 
                         hanging up, "that's that!" 
                     
                     
                         He had just turned from the 
                         phone and they were standing very 
                         close. He looked down at her for 
                         a tense moment, gripped her shoul- 
                         ders and held her so for an instant. 
                         Then he pushed her from him. 
                     
                     
                         "Run away before I kiss you!" he 
                         said, trying to speak lightly but not 
                         quite able to mask the emotional 
                         huskiness of his voice. 
                     
                     
                         "Is it to be a very precious date 
                         to-night, or semiprecious?" she 
                         asked quickly, looking up at him 
                         quizzically and trying to hide the 
                         emotion that had surged through 
                         her own being in that close moment. 
                     
                     
                         "I'd say precious"- he had got- 
                         ten control of himself again- "but 
                         of course, you're talking about 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Little And Lovely 131 
                 
                     
                     
                         clothes as women always are, so 
                         let's say semiconscious and you stay 
                         just as you are. That dress is per- 
                         fect. You're a dream in it." 
                     
                     
                         "Thank you, kind sir!" Her 
                         elaborate curtsy in the dim light 
                         was an extravagantly lovely thing. 
                     
                     
                         "And now come here, young lady, 
                         and let me very seriously tell you 
                         that aside from wanting very much 
                         to spend the evening basking in the 
                         cool light of your beautiful eyes, I 
                         haven't wanted you and your young 
                         rashness to be alone to-night!"  
                     
                         She stepped back in mock offense. 
                         "Then it wasn't that you were 
                         pining for my society? Just as sort 
                         of protector like a mustard plaster 
                         in cold weather or something?"  
                     
                         Linden laughed: 
                     
                     
                         "Well, you could have picked out 
                         a little nicer simile. I don't know 
                         that I'm flattered! A mustard 
                         plaster!" 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Sophia laughed lightly- a laugh 
                         that was like the chiming of a thou- 
                         sand silver bells at twilight, a laugh 
                         that was like a soft breeze blowing 
                         over a colorful garden at vespers. 
                     
                     
                         "That makes it all right," said 
                         Linden. "Anything's all right that 
                         starts the music of your laugh. 
                         Have you ever listened to it your- 
                         self, little and lovely? It's the most 
                         beautiful thing." 
                     
                     
                         "Some day when I'm very down 
                         and in need of flattering compli- 
                         ments, I'll laugh and listen to it and 
                         try to remember that lovely thing 
                         you've just said!" 
                     
                     
                         "I could say so many things so 
                         much lovelier." There was a sud- 
                         den earnestness about his voice that 
                         Sophia recognized and that all but 
                         stayed the mad beating of her heart. 
                         The room seemed suddenly to be 
                         filled with a tense undercurrent of 
                         emotion.

                     By  Dorothy Cox Hesse  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         LESS than half a dozen passen- 
                         gers occupied the 4:15 bus 
                         when Eloise got on just one 
                         minute before it left the city termi- 
                         nal for its night run to the sea. 
                     
                     
                         This was the season of the year 
                         when the northern Pacific beaches 
                         were not so popular. Storms were 
                         frequent and fogs were of almost 
                         daily occurrence. But Eloise Mer- 
                         rill's heritage was of the sea. Her 
                         great-grandfather had been a sea 
                         captain, sailing to the Far East; her 
                         grandfather had owned a steamship 
                         line, and her father, Cecil Merrill, 
                         was a shipbuilding magnate, who 
                         had added to his riches another for- 
                         tune by marrying Eloise's mother. 
                     
                     
                         This evening Eloise was doing an 
                         unprecedented thing; on an irre- 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         sistible impulse she had boarded a 
                         bus instead of driving her own fast 
                         roadster. 
                     
                     
                         She had left a note for her mother 
                         telling her not to worry or to be an- 
                         noyed. This once, she'd decided, be- 
                         fore it might be too late, she would 
                         have a taste of unhampered, unher- 
                         alded, unphotographed freedom. She 
                         craved a week-end trip like any other 
                         average young girl who wasn't flat- 
                         tered, deceived, publicized and 
                         sought after at every turn. 
                     
                     
                         And the very good-looking young 
                         man seated directly across the aisle 
                         was not at all unaware of her amaz- 
                         ing beauty. He could scarcely take 
                         his eyes off her. Yet, somehow, his 
                         frequent and admiring glances in her 
                         direction were not offensive. The 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Two In Love 133 
                 
                     
                     
                         first time his dark-gray eyes met 
                         Eloise's hazel, gold-flecked ones, she 
                         experienced a quick, delightful thrill. 
                         This in itself was unusual, for she 
                         was used to being stared at. 
                     
                     
                         Eloise had everything that other 
                         girls long for; beauty, health, wealth 
                         and a high social position. But she 
                         wanted something more, and that 
                         particular something was the one 
                         thing which seemed hopelessly im- 
                         possible to obtain. She longed to 
                         love and be loved romantically, 
                         ardently, for herself alone, stripped 
                         of the allure of great riches. 
                     
                     
                         She looked out the window, but 
                         scarcely saw the darkening fields or 
                         the flaming foliage of autumn. She 
                         was lost in thought, wondering 
                         about the dark-haired young man 
                         dressed so becomingly in a brown 
                         tweed suit. Who was he, what was 
                         he, and why was he aboard this clat- 
                         tering bus bound for the practically 
                         deserted beaches? He had a metro- 
                         politan, successful air about him. 
                         She had glimpsed a leather brief case 
                         partly covered by his folded over- 
                         coat, which lay on the empty seat 
                         beside him. Probably an ambitious 
                         bond salesman, or a prominent 
                         young lawyer. She wanted terribly 
                         to know. 
                     
                     
                         She couldn't resist a second 
                         glance, and was amazed to find her 
                         heart thumping faster when their 
                         eyes met. His eyes smiled a friendly 
                         greeting, and involuntarily, her 
                         warm, sweet mouth curved in a 
                         provocative smile; but she turned 
                         her head away quickly, and con- 
                         tinued to stare blankly out the win- 
                         dow. 
                     
                     
                         Suddenly the bus left the State 
                         highway, and almost immediately, a 
                         strong wind came up. Eloise pulled 
                         her green béret with its cocky little 
                         feather more closely over her cop- 
                         per-colored hair, and reached for her 
                         green swagger coat. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Like a flash, the young man 
                         jumped up and held her coat for 
                         her. "May I please?" he begged. 
                         "Wouldn't you like some of the win- 
                         dows closed?" 
                     
                     
                         "Yes, thank you," exclaimed 
                         Eloise eagerly. Then after the 
                         briefest of pauses: "You can tell im- 
                         mediately when you reach the coast 
                         highway. It always gets so windy." 
                         She smiled up at him and he smiled 
                         down at her, and at that very mo- 
                         ment a lurch of the swaying bus 
                         landed the stranger directly into the 
                         vacant seat beside her. 
                     
                     
                         "We'll soon be running into a 
                         fog," she ventured, and hoped that 
                         her voice did not betray her delight 
                         over the happy accident. 
                     
                     
                         "Going far?" His voice was deep 
                         and soft. 
                     
                     
                         "To De Lake," she replied. "I've 
                         friends who always spend a month 
                         in the fall at their cottage there. 
                         They hate the summer crowds and 
                         like to watch the storms. And," she 
                         added, with an enchanting smile and 
                         a flash of her beautiful white teeth, 
                         "so do I. I love to see those tre- 
                         mendous waves dash so madly 
                         against the rocks and bombard the 
                         lonely beaches. It's savage and 
                         overwhelming, and it thrills me more 
                         than anything I know of." 
                     
                     
                         "I know," he declared understand- 
                         ingly, "it gets me that way, too. 
                         Sort of fills one with strange, wild 
                         yearnings for one hardly knows 
                         what." 
                     
                     
                         "We're pagans, I guess," laughed 
                         Eloise. 
                     
                     
                         "Or romantics," he smiled down 
                         into her eyes. 
                     
                     
                         For a few minutes there was si- 
                         lence. Then, "How far do you go?" 
                         she asked as nonchalantly as pos- 
                         sible, while her heart pounded furi- 
                         ously as she waited for his reply. 
                         She didn't want him to leave, this 
                         gallant stranger who already seemed

                         like an old friend. It seemed 
                         strange, but she needed him. 
                     
                     
                         He was so real, so understanding, 
                         and he didn't know she was a poor 
                         little rich girl, running away. It was 
                         surely fate which had prompted her 
                         to hop onto a public bus for a long 
                         night ride alone. Maybe she was a 
                         romantic, but she was already prac- 
                         tically certain that this clean-cut, 
                         good-looking, soft-spoken stranger 
                         was the one man she wanted. The 
                         mere thought that he might not re- 
                         ciprocate and fall in love with her 
                         almost sent her into a panic. 
                     
                     
                         "I'm bound for Agate Beach," he 
                         told her. "My chief is staying at 
                         the inn under doctor's orders, to rest 
                         and play golf in the salt air. I'm 
                         taking down some blue prints for 
                         his approval." 
                     
                     
                         "Your chief?" queried Eloise, ex- 
                         periencing a momentary sense of 
                         disappointment because he was not 
                         what she had thought. 
                     
                     
                         "Yes," he explained, "he's the 
                         senior partner of West, Harris &amp; 
                         West, architects. I'm secretary; 
                         chief secretary, I suppose you'd call 
                         it." 
                     
                     
                         "Oh," replied Eloise. "I've heard 
                         of the firm. A very old, established 
                         company; sort of pioneers on the 
                         coast, aren't they, and literally roll- 
                         ing in wealth?" 
                     
                     
                         Then, without waiting for his an- 
                         swer, she went on. "Too much 
                         money is an awful handicap, I 
                         think." Suddenly aware of the slip, 
                         she gave a gasp of dismay. This 
                         young secretary with the warm, 
                         pleasant smile and clear eyes must 
                         not suspect that she was one of those 
                         with too large a share of the world's 
                         riches. She wanted to win him with- 
                         out that ever-popular lure. 
                     
                     
                         Resolutely, she turned her face to 
                         him. "I've had ample opportunity 
                         to learn something about rich peo- 
                         ple," she hastened to explain. "I'm  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         traveling companion to a very 
                         wealthy, restless, and discontented 
                         woman. She and her husband mar- 
                         ried to combine two large fortunes 
                         and to please their parents. But I 
                         don't think mere liking is enough. 
                         Of course, she couldn't ever have 
                         been a romantic," she finished, smil- 
                         ing up at him roguishly. 
                     
                     
                         "Like you," he smiled in return. 
                         And then: "But you're amazingly 
                         wise for a girl so young." 
                     
                     
                         "Well," she continued with a little 
                         shrug, "I've been around a good 
                         deal. Traveling all over, one picks 
                         up a lot. I've made three trips to 
                         Europe, two to the Orient, one to 
                         Rio de Janiero, and two to Florida 
                         with my- my employer, and she's 
                         never satisfied. When she's here she 
                         wants to be there, and when she's 
                         there, she wants to be elsewhere." 
                     
                     
                         "You think settling down would 
                         appeal to you, then?" he asked mis- 
                         chievously. 
                     
                     
                         Eloise was thrillingly conscious of 
                         the ardent look in his eyes, the sup- 
                         pressed eagerness of his voice. He 
                         was undoubtedly falling in love with 
                         her. He must be! And it was fate 
                         that had brought them together. 
                         She shivered a little. 
                     
                     
                         If she hadn't taken this shaky 
                         bus she'd never have known this de- 
                         licious, achingly sweet feeling which 
                         was filling her being with a warm, 
                         happy glow. She longed to snuggle 
                         up close to him, to let her head drop 
                         on his shoulder, and ride on and on 
                         through the windy darkness with 
                         the fog sifting across her face, 
                         spraying it like a pin-point shower. 
                     
                     
                         "You're cold!" he murmured soli- 
                         citously. "I'll close those rear win- 
                         dows altogether." 
                     
                     
                         When he resumed the seat beside 
                         her, they, as with one accord, sat 
                         huddled together. And the warmth 
                         and masculine strength of him so 
                         moved and thrilled Eloise that her 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Two In Love 135 
                 
                     
                     
                         lovely face flushed hotly. If her 
                         fastidious, conventional mother 
                         could see her now, she'd go into a 
                         heavy faint. But what, Eloise asked 
                         herself, did her mother know of the 
                         kind of love that flames up like a 
                         torch in the darkness, to warm the 
                         heart and carry one away with joy? 
                     
                     
                         His arm, which lay across the 
                         back of the seat, slowly slid down to 
                         her shoulder; his hand pulled her fox 
                         fur more closely about her face, and 
                         remained there. Eloise did not re- 
                         sent it. On the contrary, she felt a 
                         delicious tingle racing through her. 
                     
                     
                         The bus slowed down. Ahead of 
                         them lights blurred drunkenly in 
                         the thick fog. "Twenty minutes 
                         here for lunch, the driver an- 
                         nounced." 
                     
                     
                         They were the first to alight. In- 
                         side the little cafe it was cozy, warm 
                         and cheerful. They sat on stools 
                         before an immaculate lunch counter, 
                         and ate hot clam chowder, sand- 
                         wiches and coffee. 
                     
                     
                         "Delicious chowder!" exclaimed 
                         Eloise. 
                     
                     
                         "The best I ever ate," he de- 
                         clared. 
                     
                     
                         And Eloise, who had eaten the 
                         richest and most expensive foods in 
                         most of the famous hotels of Eu- 
                         rope, wished with all her heart that 
                         she might go on by this young man's 
                         side forever, eating in homy little 
                         inns, enjoying simple pleasures. 
                         The yearning in her heart became an 
                         ache. A deep, argent hunger to pos- 
                         sess and be possessed. 
                     
                     
                         "You haven't told me your 
                         name," he reflected suddenly, when 
                         they had drunk the last drop of 
                         steaming, fragrant coffee. "I'd like 
                         to know, because, you see, I can't 
                         let you go without some assurance 
                         that I can find you again. And 
                         soon!" he added fervently. 
                     
                     
                         "But I'm sailing for Hawaii next 
                         week," replied Eloise regretfully, and  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         intentionally neglecting to give a 
                         name. She would have to think up 
                         one, she told herself nervously. "My 
                         restless lady wants to drink in the 
                         sunshine and grow slim on a diet 
                         chiefly of pineapple," she laughed. 
                     
                     
                         They were back in the bus again 
                         and moving slowly onward through 
                         a strange, eerie world, blanketed 
                         with ever-thickening fog, while well 
                         out from the shore line, the melan- 
                         choly sound of a whistling-buoy 
                         gave almost continuous warning to 
                         ships of the nearness of dangerously 
                         concealed rocks. 
                     
                     
                         "Another half hour and you'll be 
                         getting off," he announced ruefully, 
                         as if he, too, were affected by the 
                         peculiar loneliness of the dreary 
                         night. "Please trust me, and be- 
                         lieve what I am going to tell you. 
                         I never dreamed I'd be lucky 
                         enough to meet a girl like you. 
                         There are things I want to say that 
                         I can't say here. Would you mind 
                         if I stopped off at De Lake to-night 
                         and came to see you at your friends' 
                         cottage in the morning?" 
                     
                     
                         "I'd be glad to see you again in 
                         the morning," she answered, trying 
                         desperately to control the happy 
                         tremor in her voice. "If it isn't 
                         stormy we could have a round of 
                         golf, if you'd like. We can borrow 
                         my friends clubs. There's a tricky 
                         little course near by." 
                     
                     
                         "That would be wonderful!" he 
                         cried. "I'd better tell you my name 
                         now. It's Stephen McCready." 
                     
                     
                         And mine, fibbed Eloise, is 
                         Louise Morgan. 
                     
                     
                         Two hours behind schedule, they 
                         alighted stiffly from the bus. The 
                         sleepy night agent emerged from his 
                         tiny office and directed Stephen to 
                         the hotel. Then he picked up 
                         Eloise's bags and said he would take 
                         her down to the Hardings cottage. 
                     
                     
                         Grace and Jim Harding were pop-

                         fireplace when she stumbled into the 
                         warm, bright living room. 
                     
                     
                         "We'd given you up," Grace cried. 
                         "Did you have a breakdown or did 
                         the fog delay you?" 
                     
                     
                         "It was the fog," Eloise explained 
                         after she was seated, shivering, be- 
                         fore the fire, telling them about the 
                         trip. She omitted only the impor- 
                         tant detail that she was hopelessly 
                         in love with a sort of glorified chief 
                         clerk, whose name she had learned 
                         only fifteen minutes before. 
                     
                     
                         This information she imparted to 
                         Grace later, when Grace was curled 
                         up in bed under a woolly comforter, 
                         while Eloise cold-creamed her face 
                         and unpacked. 
                     
                     
                         "You're plain crazy!" Grace ex- 
                         claimed. "You know you wouldn't 
                         dare marry him; you'd ruin both 
                         your lives. Your worlds are too far 
                         apart. You've just gone absurdly 
                         romantic. Next week, on the boat, 
                         you'll be having an exciting flirta- 
                         tion under a tropic moon and forget 
                         Stephen. To-night I think you've 
                         got a touch of fog on the brain." 
                     
                     
                         Eloise gave her a disgusted look. 
                         "And the week after that, she 
                         stormed, mother'll be trying to 
                         marry me off to that Count Belfern 
                         we met in Palm Beach last spring. 
                         He's meeting us in Honolulu. And 
                         I'll be causing mother headaches 
                         and no end of woe, because if ever I 
                         did have the idea, that I might marry 
                         him, and pay his bills, and add new 
                         distinction to his ancestral castle, 
                         it's all off now. Since I've met 
                         Stephen and learned about real love, 
                         I wouldn't marry a prince with a 
                         throne in the immediate offing." 
                     
                     
                         "You're being a little ridiculous, 
                         Elose. Besides, do you want to 
                         break your parents' hearts?" 
                     
                     
                         "Their hearts won't break and 
                         you know it, Grace. Only their ego 
                         would be hurt if I marry, as they'd 
                         say, beneath me. They want, me to 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         make a brilliant match; to uphold 
                         the family name and all that. But 
                         I don't care a snap about such 
                         things, now. I want to exercise my 
                         right to choose my own future. 
                         Mother and dad had their choice. 
                         Now I'm going to make mine." 
                     
                     
                         "But don't forget," Grace per- 
                         sisted, "that you've deliberately de- 
                         ceived Stephen. And another thing, 
                         he might not relish the idea of being 
                         just a rich girl's husband." 
                     
                     
                         "That's what's bothering me most 
                         right now," Eloise admitted. "How- 
                         ever, dad may disinherit me." 
                     
                     
                         "I doubt it," Grace said de- 
                         cisively. "He may threaten to do 
                         so and stage a few wild gestures, 
                         and then relent. But even so, 
                         there's the cool million or so your 
                         grandmother left you outright. 
                         What would you do about that?" 
                     
                     
                         "Heavens!" cried Eloise in dis- 
                         may. "Honestly, Grace, I forgot all 
                         about that! Suppose it would be a 
                         stumbling block. Still, we could put 
                         it in trust or whatever it is people 
                         do for their children, or keep it for 
                         our old age. Or, if Stephen is hope- 
                         lessly proud and set, we could give 
                         it to some charity or whatever 
                         Stephen advises for getting rid of 
                         it." 
                     
                     
                         Grace sniffed and shook her head 
                         dismally. "You are sunk. If you 
                         actually think you could live on a 
                         clerk's earnings, I give up. It's no 
                         use arguing. But don't tell me a 
                         year or two from now that I didn't 
                         warn you," she advised solemnly. 
                     
                     
                         "Then you and Jim won't give me 
                         away, but you'll let me tell him after 
                         he- after he tells me what I think 
                         he s going to," exclaimed Eloise a 
                         bit incoherently and with slightly 
                         less assurance. 
                     
                     
                         What if he really wasn't as serious 
                         as she'd thought? Or suppose he 
                         saw everything differently in the 
                         morning. She felt a little panicky. 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Two In Love 137 
                 
                     
                         "I'd marry you no matter who you were," she whispered huskily. I love you so much." His arms tightened around her,
                            his heart pounded at thethought of her great love for him. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         It would be more than she could 
                         bear to lose him, now. 
                     
                     
                         "Count on us, of course," said 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Grace encouragingly. "And ask him 
                         here for lunch if you're still on speak- 
                         ing terms after the golf or love game.

                         And now good night, and for pity's 
                         sake don't lie awake losing your 
                         beauty sleep, thinking about how to 
                         live on fifty dollars a week." 
                     
                     
                         But Eloise did lie awake. Hours 
                         and hours, and decided if worst came 
                         to worst, and he would not accept 
                         her money, she would indeed have 
                         to learn to figure costs and make 
                         budgets. The prospect didn't please 
                         her, but she wanted Stephen so 
                         badly. Mentally, she tried to budget 
                         forty-five or fifty dollars a week to 
                         pay rent, food and clothing bills. 
                         But it wouldn't come out anywhere 
                         near right. Then she'd go over it 
                         all again, but forget half of the 
                         items, until the whole business was 
                         dismally, depressingly discouraging. 
                         Exhausted, finally, she went to 
                         sleep. 
                     
                     
                         The next morning was clear. The 
                         sun came out and the sea was a 
                         deep, bright blue. A good omen, 
                         Eloise thought, as she dressed in her 
                         most becoming soft wool dress, a 
                         golden-yellow and chestnut-brown 
                         combination which did bewitching 
                         things to her almost amber-colored 
                         eyes and shining bronze hair. 
                     
                     
                         Stephen came just after they had 
                         finished breakfast, and almost imme- 
                         diately they departed for the golf 
                         links. They played two holes, and 
                         then sat down on a bench in the 
                         warm sunshine. 
                     
                     
                         "I couldn't sleep," he began, "for 
                         thinking of you. It's terribly soon 
                         to be saying it, but I love you, 
                         Louise. The minute I saw you 
                         something wonderful happened that 
                         had never happened to me before, 
                         nor ever will again. It isn't given 
                         to a man to love twice this way. I 
                         can't give you up," he cried pas- 
                         sionately. "If there's any hope at 
                         all for me, please tell me at once, for 
                         I can't stand this uncertainty an- 
                         other minute." 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         He had firm hold of her hands, as 
                         if he were afraid to let go of them. 
                     
                     
                         "I loved you from the very mo- 
                         ment you stepped into that rickety 
                         old bus, and somehow, I felt that 
                         you returned my love. Tell me 
                         quickly, darling, was I right?" He 
                         gazed at her, an excited glitter in 
                         his eyes. 
                     
                     
                         "Yes, Stephen." she murmured in 
                         a soft, tremulous voice, "I love you, 
                         too." 
                     
                     
                         "You darling!" he cried. Then, 
                         after a hasty glance about the 
                         course, he snatched her into his 
                         arms and kissed her lips, her eyes, 
                         her glorious hair. "I haven't much 
                         to offer a girl who's had the world 
                         for a playground," he whispered 
                         against her soft cheek, "but if you'll 
                         take the big chance with me, some 
                         day, I'm sure, I'll stand at the head 
                         of something, instead of at the bot- 
                         tom. Are you willing to give up 
                         your position, my sweet, and stay 
                         and marry me?" 
                     
                     
                         And now, suddenly Eloise was 
                         fearful. Truly afraid to tell him of 
                         her deception and of her immense 
                         wealth. He was, just as she had 
                         suspected, the kind that wanted to 
                         win his own place. There had been 
                         pride and ambition in his voice when 
                         he said, "Some day I'll stand at the 
                         head of something." 
                     
                     
                         She turned her face away. She 
                         didn't want to see his eyes condemn 
                         her. "Yes, I'll stay and marry you 
                         Stephen," she whispered softly. 
                         "But wait, wait!" she cried wildly, 
                         as he was about to take her in his 
                         arms again. "I've a confession to 
                         make. I'm not a paid companion; 
                         I'm that unhappy rich woman's 
                         daughter. I'm terribly, disgracefully 
                         wealthy, Stephen. I'm Eloise Mer- 
                         rill. I hated it, deceiving you, but 
                         you do understand, don't you?" she 
                         pleaded, lifting her beautiful, be- 
                         seeching face to his. "It was the

                         only way I could make sure of being 
                         loved just for myself." 
                     
                     
                         Very tenderly, he gathered her 
                         close. "You'd marry a nobody, a 
                         comparatively poor man, Eloise?" 
                         His voice shook with emotion. 
                     
                     
                         "I'd marry you no matter who 
                         you were," she whispered huskily. 
                         "I love you so much." 
                     
                     
                         His arms tightened almost fiercely, 
                         but still she felt there was some- 
                         thing troubling him. A look of in- 
                         decision flickered across his face. 
                     
                     
                         "What is it?" she demanded fear- 
                         fully. 
                     
                     
                         "I was just thinking, people say 
                         very uncomplimentary things about 
                         a poor young man who marries a 
                         very rich girl." 
                     
                     
                         "I knew it!" she cried, pulling 
                         away from him and looking straight 
                         into his eyes. "At least I was afraid 
                         you'd feel that way. So I thought 
                         it all out before I went to sleep last 
                         night, and I'm willing to give up all 
                         my money and live on whatever you 
                         make. With your love and help I 
                         can learn, Stephen. Father can cut 
                         me off, except for a small dowry, 
                         and I'll give the fortune my grand- 
                         mother left me to some worthy 
                         charity." 
                     
                     
                         Stephen held her off and looked 
                         at her, his heart pounding at the 
                         thought of her great love for him, 
                         until a suspicion of tears dimmed his 
                         eyes, and he swallowed painfully. "I 
                         don't deserve you," he said very sol- 
                         emnly, "but all the rest of my life, 
                         sweetheart, I shall try to make up 
                         to you for that brave little speech." 
                         He kissed her again, and then con- 
                         tinued: 
                     
                     
                         "I'm ashamed, too, for putting you 
                         to such a test. But you see, 
                         precious, it's been almost an obses- 
                         sion with me to find a girl who would 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         love just me. I understand all too 
                         well what you have had to contend 
                         with. It's been practically the same 
                         with me. So when I knew I was 
                         falling in love with you last night, I 
                         deliberately deceived you, same as 
                         you did me. 
                     
                     
                         "I'm Stephen McCready West, 
                         junior partner of West, Harris &amp; 
                         West, and some day I'll be the head 
                         of the firm. I had a little smash-up 
                         with my car yesterday afternoon; 
                         that's how I happened to be aboard 
                         that blessed bus." 
                     
                     
                         Eloise went suddenly limp in his 
                         arms. This was almost too much. 
                         It sounded like a fairy tale; such 
                         things didn't really happen. 
                     
                     
                         Here she was, ready to give up 
                         her wealth and social position for 
                         the man she loved, only to discover 
                         that he was offering her the very 
                         same things. Surely she'd wake up 
                         to find it all a dream. 
                     
                     
                         But Stephen was talking. "Shall 
                         you mind so very much being simply 
                         scandalously rich, my darling, be- 
                         cause" and his face broke irre- 
                         sistibly into a broad grin "my 
                         mother, who owned a large number 
                         of gilt-edged bonds, left them all to 
                         me when she died." 
                     
                     
                         Eloise's cheeks were glowing 
                         again, her eyes were dancing jewels. 
                     
                     
                         "I shan't mind at all," she exulted, 
                         "since we found love first." 
                         "Is next week too soon for the 
                         wedding, my precious?" asked Ste- 
                         phen eagerly. 
                     
                     
                         "Not for rich romantics like us," 
                         laughed Elose happily, and looked 
                         straight up into his smoldering eyes. 
                     
                     
                         He drew her thrillingly close, 
                         kissed her hair, her eyes, and finally 
                         clung to her warm, eager lips. She 
                         returned kiss for kiss, happy in the 
                         knowledge that real love was theirs.

                         This is a forceful week. There will be 
                         changes, restlessness, and strong emotional 
                         reactions. Carry on with your work and 
                         pay strict attention to your job, not for- 
                         getting to consider new ideas and new 
                         methods of procedure. Be careful in han- 
                         dling money. Take care of that which you 
                         possess and be careful of swindling and 
                         robbery. The planets carry an undercur- 
                         rent of sobriety, practicality, and serious- 
                         ness, which can be made very helpful if 
                         used constructively. Do not be bitter or 
                         morbid. Utilize these serious moments for 
                         considering all things carefully and logi- 
                         cally. Eliminate those factors which are 
                         impeding your progress. Do not expect too 
                         much from your emotional relations with 
                         others. Be kind, tolerant, and understand- 
                         ing. Make the seven-day period efficient 
                         and productive. Allow no day to pass you 
                         by without having accomplished some- 
                         thing, no matter how small or petty you 
                         may consider it.

                         This is a mixed day. Some 
                         parts of it will be pleasant 
                         and harmonious; others will 
                         be unusually active; others 
                         will be emotional and upset- 
                         ting. The morning hours 
                         will be exciting, unsettled, 
                         stimulating mentally, and 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         there will be a tendency to 
                         act rashly. This is a good 
                         morning and favorable after- 
                         noon for using original ideas 
                         that are practical, and for 
                         relations with those in supe- 
                         rior positions. The evening 
                         hours will be steady, conserv- 
                         ative, and quiet. Do not de- 
                         pend too much upon your 
                         social expectations this eve- 
                         ning. Hilarity and excessive 
                         festivity are not the order of 
                         the evening

                         The morning hours will be 
                         active, the afternoon hours 
                         slightly dull and dependent 
                         upon routine; the evening

                         able for lively conversation. 
                         Just an average day, but not 
                         entirely unfavorable. There 
                         will be many features of the 
                         various periods which will be 
                         harmonious and decidedly 
                         pleasant.

                         Until 8:30 a. m. this morn- 
                         ing there will be pleasant 
                         reactions and domestic har- 
                         mony, if you do not try to 
                         force issues. Keep the deeper 
                         emotions in the background. 
                         The day as a whole will bring 
                         delays, disappointments, and 
                         emotional upheaval. Do not 
                         be morbid. Do not try to force

                         Keep your emotions in the 
                         background and work. Be 
                         practical, conservative, and 
                         diligent. This is a good after- 
                         noon and evening to think 
                         about financial matters and 
                         the use of your funds.

                         This is a good, practical day. 
                         The mind will be efficient 
                         and you will be able to face 
                         the bare facts in connection 
                         with all things. The daytime 
                         hours should be used for com- 
                         mercial efforts; make adjust- 
                         ments and deal with older 
                         people. Adjust misunder- 
                         standings. The evening hours 
                         will bring recreational and 
                         pleasurable developments. Use 
                         your mind constructively this 
                         evening. Talk things over 
                         with any one associated with 
                         your life. Write, attend to 
                         correspondence, make plans, 
                         and establish better relations 
                         with those in whom you are 
                         interested.

                         The early-morning hours are 
                         uncertain and the influences 
                         will produce nervousness and 
                         an uncertain attitude until 
                         after 8:00 a. m. The later 
                         morning hours are pleasant 
                         and harmonious. The after- 
                         noon hours are favorable for 
                         dealing with other people; for 
                         contacts and interviews, cre- 
                         ative work, and inspirational 
                         activities. The evening pe- 
                         riod is balanced, active, ex- 
                         citing, and favorable for any 
                         plans you may have made 
                         previously.

                         There is a New Moon to- 
                         day at 7:09 a. m. The morn- 
                         ing hours are very active 
                         and favorable for getting 
                         things done. The afternoon 
                         hours are exciting and there 
                         will be excessive activity, the 
                         liability to quarrels and in- 
                         jury from sharp instruments 
                         until 7:15 p. m. The eve- 
                         ning hours are stimulating 
                         mentally, but there is an un- 
                         dercurrent of quietness and 
                         seriousness. The evening  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         hours, however, can be made 
                         productive, interesting, and 
                         efficient.

                         This is another vital day, but 
                         there will be a strong emo- 
                         tional undercurrent which 
                         will be unpleasant to endure. 
                         Events will follow closely 
                         upon one another during the 
                         day until 4:00 p. m., carrying 
                         an element of the unexpected. 
                         The late afternoon and the 
                         evening hours are pleasant, 
                         harmonious, and can be made 
                         most enjoyable. 
                     
                     
                         IF YOU WERE BORN BETWEEN 
                         March 21st and April 20th

                         -Aries people born between March 25th 
                         and April 2nd may expect a pleasant week, 
                         except for a slight nervousness which will 
                         react upon the digestive organs. Your 
                         judgment is good at this time if you will 
                         be conservative and be cautious in money 
                         affairs. If born between April 7th and 
                         16th, you should use cold logic in settling 
                         your affairs. Keep your temper and poise. 
                         Do not be impulsive; go easy.

                         -Taureans born between April 24th and 
                         May 1st must be careful in their emotional 
                         affairs. Use your head and do not live ex- 
                         cessively. Avoid serious relations with the 
                         opposite sex. Rely upon your intuition 
                         and develop your spiritual understanding. 
                         If engaged in literary work, this is a favor- 
                         able and productive week. If born be- 
                         tween May 4th and 13th, expect to live 
                         quietly and in a restricted groove. Take 
                         your pleasures lightly. Watch your temper 
                         and equilibrium. Accept changes philo- 
                         sophically and do not try to move too rap- 
                         idly. A time for restraint.

                         June 2nd will have an irritating week and 
                         it will require stern control to keep your 
                         nerves steady. There will be mental con- 
                         fusion and your decisions must be made 
                         carefully. Affairs in the home will be an- 
                         noying to you. Inspect all contracts care- 
                         fully before affixing your signature. Seek 
                         advice from other sources. Be cautious in

                         your speech, especially with those in supe- 
                         rior positions. Socially and emotionally, 
                         the week will be a pleasant one. Work 
                         diligently and constantly. If born between 
                         June 7th and 16th, you will find the week 
                         upsetting and annoying. But you will see 
                         opportunities and be able to act efficiently. 
                         Do not scatter your forces. Think sanely 
                         and do not be impulsive. Sift your values.

                         July 2nd will find their minds responding 
                         efficiently this week. Inspirational and 
                         creative thinking will bring results. So- 
                         cially, the week will not live up to expecta- 
                         tions, but you should be thinking of im- 
                         portant things and should capitalize upon 
                         your commercial talents at this time. If 
                         born between July 6th and 14th, there will 
                         be changes and irritations and some annoy- 
                         ance with various factors of your exist- 
                         ence. Do not allow your feelings to rule 
                         you. Keep on the job and convert your 
                         energy into constructive effort.

                         -Leo people born between July 24th and 
                         August 1st must be careful in their rela- 
                         tions with their fellow men this week, par- 
                         ticularly with the opposite sex. Financial 
                         conditions related to partners will be a 
                         source of worry. Postpone important deci- 
                         sions this week, if possible. If born be- 
                         tween August 6th and 14th, you will be 
                         restless and desire change, but this is not 
                         the proper time to make vital adjustments. 
                         Do not argue with any one about anything. 
                         Try to be patient with restrictions.   
                     
                         August 22nd and September 23rd 
                         (Virgo) 
                     
                     
                         -Virgo people born between August 25th 
                         and September 3rd will find the trend of 
                         their life this week extremely annoying. 
                         You will have to be very cautious with 
                         the written and spoken word. Do not allow 
                         your imagination to run riot and erect fears 
                         about nonexisting conditions. Determine 
                         to be calm, logical, and balanced. If born 
                         between September 8th and 17th, you 
                         should not be too critical at this time. You 
                         will have an unusual amount of energy and 
                         you are likely to be too impulsive. Make 
                         adjustments and changes which are neces- 
                         sary for improving your welfare, but deter- 
                         mine to live quietly, harmoniously, and 
                         efficiently. Do not forget the necessity of 
                         duty, regardless of your personal feelings.

                         -Librans born between September 25th 
                         and October 3rd will have a fairly pleasant 
                         week, socially and personally, but unless 
                         you make a strenuous effort, the results 
                         you desire will not be forthcoming. Rely 
                         upon your intuition and inspiration. If 
                         born between October 6th and 14th, you 
                         may expect radical changes. Live quietly 
                         and accept the readjustments gracefully. 
                         You will have to sift your values and ac- 
                         cept a new attitude upon life. Petty things 
                         will annoy you this week, but keep plug- 
                         ging, if you expect to further your interests. 
                         All Librans will have to forgo personal 
                         pleasure at this time in order to execute 
                         their jobs well.

                         25th and November 2nd will find their 
                         minds very alert and efficient this week. 
                         Solve problems related to children and 
                         those in your charge. Avoid the opposite 
                         sex as much as possible. Live quietly and 
                         seriously. Stay on the job. Protect your 
                         health. If born between November 8th 
                         and 16th, you will find it difficult to follow 
                         routine and will wish to sacrifice commer- 
                         cial interests to your desires and impulses 
                         a course most inadvisable. This is a vital 
                         week. Keep your temper. Do not be sar- 
                         castic. Be constructive.

                         24th and December 2nd will find the week 
                         irritating and petty matters annoying. Be 
                         careful of the written and spoken word. 
                         Take your pleasures seriously and enjoy 
                         yourself, but be sure that you watch your 
                         health and obtain enough rest. Relaxation 
                         is good for you at this time, but you will 
                         have to work hard and live moderately if 
                         you wish to further your interests. If born 
                         between December 7th and 14th, this is a 
                         restless period, but your basic influences 
                         are excellent and you must stay on the job 
                         if you wish to accomplish anything at all. 
                         You will have much energy at this time; 
                         conserve some of it.

                         responding efficiently this week. It is a 
                         productive week for those engaged in cre-

                         ative work, especially of a mental nature. 
                         You should enjoy a very pleasant seven 
                         days. Make important decisions this week. 
                         If born between January 7th and 16th, be 
                         very careful with your dealings commer- 
                         cially and with those in higher positions. 
                         This is an energetic week. Keep your 
                         viewpoint balanced and do not allow your 
                         temper to get beyond control. Be patient 
                         if you have slow results. Be most cautious 
                         in handling property and real estate. Do 
                         nothing impulsively.

                         -Aquarians born between January 24th 
                         and February 1st will have a pleasant 
                         week in many respects. Keep plodding 
                         along and attend to all duties, no matter 
                         how irksome they are. Your mental proc- 
                         esses should be working efficiently at this 
                         time, so see that you use your head intel- 
                         ligently and often. If born between Feb- 
                         ruary 5th and 15th, you are operating with 
                         favorable influences, but you will have to 
                         stay on the job every minute if you wish 
                         to get results. Make necessary changes. 
                         This is a very energetic week for you. Use 
                         your energy constructively.

                         -Pisceans born between February 25th 
                         and March 2nd should have a pleasant, 
                         active week. There will be an element of 
                         confusion, of course, but you can control 
                         your negative viewpoint and adjust some 
                         of the uncertain factors if you will think 
                         clearly and logically. If born between 
                         March 7th and 16th, you will be upset this 
                         week and should be cautious about every- 
                         thing, especially the liability of minor acci- 
                         dents. Be careful in handling sharp instru- 
                         ments. This is a time for you to stay in 
                         a groove, to some extent; otherwise you 
                         will suffer financially. 
                     
                     
                     
                         TAURUS HUSBAND 
                     
                     
                         The Taurus husband is an autocratic in- 
                         dividual. He is practical, loves his home, 
                         and insists upon order and system. He is 
                         intense, jealous, strongly physical, and not 
                         interested in persons on the outside when 
                         they interfere with his schedule and exist- 
                         ence. He loves beauty, color, and the 
                         romantic side of life; becoming very tem- 
                         peramental when routine is disrupted. The 
                         Taurus man is emotional and fixed in his 
                         opinions. If you wish to have harmony   
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         with this life partner, be tolerant of his 
                         ideas and do not openly oppose him. He 
                         needs to be prodded gently and subtly, but 
                         his stubbornness is notorious and dictation 
                         is something for which he will not stand in 
                         the least degree. Never play practical 
                         jokes on him; his sense of humor does not 
                         extend that far. 
                     
                     
                         Taurus men have moments of morbid 
                         resentment toward life and toward persons 
                         associated with them. They are very sen- 
                         sitive and are likely to brood over matters 
                         for a long time before doing anything about 
                         them. Facts and reality are the keynotes 
                         of the male Taurean's existence. He likes 
                         to sift everything to its actual source, and 
                         if you think you are fooling this man over 
                         a long period of time, you have another 
                         thought coming. It is rare to see these 
                         husbands swerving from their ideals, prin- 
                         ciples and beliefs. They believe in con- 
                         stancy and have such an intense pride in 
                         possessiveness and authority, it is unusual 
                         to see them in the divorce courts. But, 
                         remember, when they are through with 
                         anything, all the king's horses and all the 
                         king's men are powerless to influence them 
                         to change. The sanctity of the domestic 
                         situation is not to be tampered with, in the 
                         eyes of the Taurus husband. Do not at- 
                         tempt to blast these men from their chosen 
                         path of living. That is extremely impor- 
                         tant. Allow him to go his leisurely way. 
                         If he can control his temper and live with 
                         a goal in sight, success is his eventually, 
                         and you can depend upon his reliability.

                         Ireland, hour not stated: This is more of 
                         an acknowledgment of your letter than 
                         anything else, Mr. Q. It was impossible 
                         for me to communicate with you directly, 
                         and my copy was written long ago for that 
                         period when you desired to receive your 
                         answer through the magazine. You were 
                         not very definite about your trip, but I 
                         assume it was a journey connected with 
                         business. Your influences this year are 
                         favorable, if you will coordinate your ef- 
                         forts with past endeavor and contacts, and 
                         continue to pursue a program which I hope 
                         you made long ago. As far as I can ob- 
                         serve from the general positions in your 
                         chart, the results of the year are solely 
                         dependent upon your hard work and your

                         portunities. If you care to write me again, 
                         I will be very glad to hear from you. 
                     
                     
                         M. C., born January 1, 1909, Texas, 1:00 
                         a. m.: I think you will make a success of 
                         secretarial work. You have an evenly bal- 
                         anced disposition and you are shrewd. 
                         Your mind will develop excellently as you 
                         become older. As long as you are engaged 
                         in study at this time, do not give it up, 
                         but in the future, if you have an oppor- 
                         tunity to study designing, commercial art, 
                         or something of that nature, it would be 
                         advisable. You have a fairly good year in 
                         1934, in some respects, but you will have 
                         restrictions which will be irksome. Do not 
                         try to move too fast. Try to seek part- 
                         time work. You will be able to do your 
                         work efficiently.

                         1901: Please write me again more in de- 
                         tail. It would be better for you to tell 
                         me the nature of your husband's illness 
                         and the hour and place of birth of him and 
                         of yourself. Of course, I do not answer   
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         medical questions, but am able to show 
                         periods of improvement and a better men- 
                         tal attitude, if I have sufficient birth data 
                         on which to make a judgment. Your hus- 
                         band's chart shows restricted health condi- 
                         tions in 1934, but I hesitate to express my 
                         opinion about his physical welfare because 
                         of lack of the information stated above. 
                         We published an article about the sign 
                         Taurus, under which your husband was 
                         born in the issue of November 4, 1933. If 
                         you will send us fifteen cents, we will be 
                         glad to send you a copy of the issue. 
                     
                     
                         Miss V. R., born October 21, 1908, 
                         Florida, 1:00 a. m.: I do not know 
                         whether or not you have met the man you 
                         will marry, but you certainly will be in the 
                         mood for marriage beginning in November, 
                         1934, and during the following winter you 
                         will receive a proposal, which will probably 
                         result in marriage in the late spring or 
                         early summer of 1935. You see, astrology 
                         indicates the impulses, urges and oppor- 
                         tunities, but you are a free agent and be- 
                         ing a human being you have the power 
                         to make your own decisions. Of course,

                         when you contemplate a marital partner- 
                         ship or a business partnership with any 
                         one, the two charts affect each other. That 
                         is why it is necessary to have the chart 
                         of both persons concerned when a ques- 
                         tion on this subject is asked. 
                     
                     
                         Mrs. E. M., born January 1, 1914, New 
                         York, 12:30 a. m.: Chicago would be a 
                         more pleasant and better place for you, 
                         but New York is better for your husband. 
                         So, what shall I say to you? The influ- 
                         ences in your husband's chart are not fa- 
                         vorable for a change in residence until the 
                         fall months of 1934. The year 1935 is good 
                         for both of you and there will be some 
                         phases of your life this year which will be 
                         pleasant and acceptable, too. But next 
                         year is the better period for both of you 
                         in every way. Your husband will be very 
                         restless this summer and there is a journey 
                         shown for both of you, so I suggest that 
                         we compromise. Take the trip to Chicago 
                         when it is convenient to do so, look over 
                         the situation, then make your decision. In 
                         my opinion, it would be very inadvisable 
                         for you to make a big jump, not knowing 
                         the conditions ahead. If your husband is 
                         employed now, I certainly do not advise 
                         you to make this important move before 
                         the spring months. 
                     
                     
                         Miss W. G., born February 9, 1915, time 
                         and place not stated: As nearly as I can 
                         judge without your complete birth data, 
                         your chart does not blend well with that 
                         of the young man. You will meet some 
                         one else whom you will like much better 
                         during the year, and you will have the op- 
                         portunity to marry in the early fall months. 
                         Your influences generally for the year are 
                         better for business, however, and you 
                         should try to advance yourself in your 
                         work or seek a better position in the spring.  
                     
                     
                         EDWARD, born September 23, 1908, New 
                         York, 8:45 a. in.: It does not seem to 
                         me that you are suited for your present 
                         position. I advise you to seek creative 
                         work of some nature, such as illustrat- 
                         ing or landscaping or even floral work. 
                         Also, you would do well in merchandising, 
                         especially in relation to wearing apparel. 
                         Department-store work should be very sat- 
                         isfactory to you because you have many 
                         interests and this would give you several 
                         outlets. You have a good chart, but you 
                         should never postpone anything. Often, 
                         you will lose chances because of this tend- 
                         ency to procrastinate. You were born 
                         under the sign Libra. We have to list the   
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         signs in the "Born Between-" in the man- 
                         ner we do, because of the flexibility of the 
                         time the sun enters each sign each year. 
                         Thank you for your letter. If I can do 
                         anything further for you, let me know. 
                     
                     
                         Miss E. P., born July 8, 1912, place not 
                         stated, 1:00 a. m.: I really think you are 
                         going through a transitional stage here and 
                         that your affections are tied up in such a 
                         way that you would regret marriage if it 
                         is executed in the near future. I am very 
                         sincere when I say that a marriage from 
                         your personal standpoint should not trans- 
                         pire until the summer months of 1935. On 
                         the other hand, in many respects the 
                         majority, I should say- your chart blends 
                         exceedingly well with that of the Pisces 
                         man February 24th. It is quite possible 
                         for me to see why this great attraction 
                         exists and why you love him so much. 
                         But you are a sensible person and I feel 
                         you know this young man will not live up 
                         to your expectations entirely. You are 
                         very ambitious, and from what I am able 
                         to observe about the young man without 
                         his hour of birth it is my opinion that 
                         your outlook upon life differs and complete 
                         harmony from an economic standpoint does 
                         not exist. I am here to help you and it is 
                         against my ethics for me to say definitely 
                         that you should marry this man. I advise 
                         against it and suggest that you hold your 
                         decision for a time. Think it over. If I 
                         can help you further, let me know. 
                     
                     
                         A. R. A., born December 22, 1916: Will 
                         you please write again and send me your 
                         complete birth data. Also, the full data 
                         of the young man in question. I am un- 
                         able to answer your specific question about 
                         marriage unless I have complete data. 
                     
                     
                         Mrs. B., born April 5, 1868, Maryland, 
                         5:00 p. in.: Thank you so much for your 
                         kind letter. As you know, it is always 
                         pleasing to know that your work is en- 
                         joyed and appreciated, and a warm glow 
                         came around my heart when you wrote 
                         that you traveled so far each week to buy 
                         the magazine. About your property: It 
                         would not be advisable for you to force 
                         the sale on your house at this time. As a 
                         matter of fact, it would be better for you 
                         to wait for about another sixteen months. 
                         I know you dislike hearing this, but your 
                         influences at this time are not as favorable 
                         for the sale as they will be later. Of 
                         course, you can sell at sacrifice, but I would 
                         hate to see you do that. Perhaps you can 
                         make an arrangement for companionship 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                  Your Stars And You 147 
                 
                     
                     
                         which will keep you from being so lonely. 
                         I see your point of view and appreciate 
                         your feelings, but in this case, patience will 
                         bring reward. You are an Aries person 
                         and patience is not one of your strongest 
                         attributes, but, I am sure, you have lived 
                         this life rather completely and realize that 
                         we cannot have everything we wish at the 
                         time we want it. Will be glad to hear 
                         from you any time you care to write to me.  
                     
                     
                         M. E. B., born October 19, 1888, New 
                         York, 2:30 p. m.: At the time you wrote 
                         me you were upset mentally and were in- 
                         clined to place a morbid construction upon 
                         everything, and I feel sure you have gotten 
                         hold of yourself somewhat by this time 
                         and will have overcome some of your 
                         panic. You have an excellent chart at 
                         birth, comparatively speaking, and even- 
                         tually you will find much contentment and 
                         stability of a permanent nature. You must 
                         not allow any individual factor to color 
                         your entire viewpoint or your mode of 
                         existence, because you are a person who 
                         will have many things happen throughout 
                         a lifetime. Charge all these things to ex- 
                         perience and incorporate them construc- 
                         tively into your single pattern of life. 
                         When this association of seven years ended 
                         recently, it was the termination of a defi- 
                         nite cycle in your existence and now you 
                         must go on to other fields, which will bring 
                         you experiences- some pleasant, and others 
                         annoying. The year 1934 will bring marked 
                         changes in your environment, in connection 
                         with your associates in your social and 
                         business life. Nothing is hopeless. The 
                         workers of the world must carry on to big- 
                         ger things and higher developments. If 
                         certain conditions exist too long we begin 
                         to stagnate and fail to turn with the wheels 
                         of progress, and in a person of your tem- 
                         perament, the failure to make advancement 
                         every day of your life is detrimental to 
                         your viewpoint. You have been in a rut, 
                         to some extent, during recent years, and 
                         that is why this sudden shifting of the 
                         scenes has disturbed you. It is that way 
                         with most of us. One of the most impor- 
                         tant years of your life is 1934. There will 
                         be readjustments and many changes, men- 
                         tally, physically, and spiritually. Two spe- 
                         cific times of mental and actual upheaval 
                         are in February and November. Your in-   
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         fluences for the year are uncomfortable in 
                         some respects and bring mental strain. On 
                         the other hand, if you will take each oc- 
                         currence as it arises, handle it in your usual 
                         efficient manner, charge it to progress, and 
                         go on to new things, you will save yourself 
                         heartache and mental security. Some of 
                         your planetary conditions this year are very 
                         promising. You will have the assistance 
                         of the planets in meeting these crises, and 
                         your salvation will be in keeping philosoph- 
                         ical and balanced. There is an element in 
                         your chart which brings you protection, 
                         and if you will only have confidence in 
                         yourself and your future, no matter what 
                         the personal adjustments are, you will pre- 
                         serve your excellent faculties for bigger and 
                         better things. I am not trying merely to 
                         soften my words by offering you encour- 
                         agement. It will be a hard year to live, 
                         but there are mitigating influences which 
                         will be helpful and which will bring you 
                         much pleasure. The summer period is less 
                         strained than the other months, and by 
                         the time the end of November arrives, you 
                         will know definitely just why everything 
                         that will have happened has occurred. 
                         Above all things, avoid a feeling of panic. 
                         That will do no good and you can handle 
                         your affairs much better if you keep a 
                         clear head. I am sorry not to have been 
                         able to answer you sooner, but it was im- 
                         possible. The future is much brighter for 
                         you. Keep that conviction uppermost in 
                         your mind. My best wishes go forward 
                         and my offer of further cooperation, when- 
                         ever needed.

                         DOES the intangible glamour of 
                         footlights interest you? Then 
                         let Dancing Doll tell you 
                         about the many years she has spent 
                         on the stage. Her life is a series of 
                         colorful experiences; she has trav- 
                         eled in big and small towns, and 
                         stage life in Hollywood and Los An- 
                         geles is no novelty to her. Like all 
                         show people, she has a warm heart 
                         and extends the glad hand of friend- 
                         ship to those who want it. Girls, 
                         make friends with this little dancer! 
                     
                     
                         Dear Miss Morris: I am a girl of 
                         twenty-three, have blond hair, blue eyes, 
                         and a happy-go-lucky disposition. I am a 
                         dancer, and have been on the stage for 
                         eight years, although I'm not dancing at 
                         present. I can tell you many interesting 
                         facts about the theater world, girls. I have 
                         traveled a good deal, have danced in big 
                         and small towns, and know the show folks. 
                         You'll find me a true friend, Pals. I'll be 
                         glad to exchange snapshots, and will tell 
                         you all about myself. I'll more than ap-

                         Dear Miss Morris: I'm a seventeen- 
                         year-old Irish girl living in the Far East. 
                         I'm greatly interested in outdoor sports, 
                         singing, dancing, have an affectionate and 
                         sunny disposition, but I'm very lonely be- 
                         cause I haven't many friends. Won't 
                         some of you Pals write to me? I'll ex- 
                         change snapshots, picture post cards of 
                         China, stamps, labels, and anything else 
                         girls are interested in.

                         Dear Miss Morris: You may not be- 
                         lieve it, but I'm really a very lonely young 
                         man of twenty-five. I am very fond of 
                         all sports, especially swimming, racing, 
                         dancing, and wrestling. I would enjoy 
                         hearing from college boys and any one else 
                         who would care to write to 
                         Oklahoma Ben. 
                     
                     
                         Does farming interest you? 
                     
                     
                         Dear Miss Morris: I'm sure many 
                         Pals will admit that although farming is 
                         interesting, there are many dull moments,

                         too. I'm a young married woman who'd 
                         like to hear from girls and married women 
                         of all ages. Though my days are busy- 
                         we raise poultry in addition to working 
                         the farm- the evenings are often long and 
                         lonely. My pet hobby is collecting picture 
                         post cards. May I expect a shower of 
                         letters? Farmerette Clair.

                         Dear Miss Morris: I'm a nineteen- 
                         year-old college boy pleading for Pen Pals. 
                         I'm studying to be a chemical engineer, 
                         care for everything and every one except 
                         girls, and as business is quite dull in my 
                         town, I would more than appreciate hear- 
                         ing from those who want a sincere Pal.

                         Dear Miss Morris: Here's a lonesome 
                         young girl who wants her share of Pals. 
                         I have recently moved to Washington, 
                         D. C., and find it hard to get acquainted. 
                         I love excitement, have traveled a lot, but 
                         I like New York best. I've no particular 
                         hobbies, but enjoy the movies, reading, 
                         and almost everything else. All you girls 
                         who want a truly understanding Pal, write 
                         to me. Your age doesn't matter. I 
                         promise to answer all letters.

                         girls? We are not exactly lonely, but we'd 
                         love to have some Pen Pals. We want to 
                         hear from girls living in the West, but girls 
                         from all over the world are certainly wel- 
                         come. We are three happy friends who 
                         believe in having good times. So come 
                         on, girls, send some of your letters our 
                         way. We'll be very glad to exchange snap-

                         girls, write soon. I'll be glad to tell you

                         and Africa. Eileen of Durban.

                         Dear Miss Morris: I'm a Canadian 
                         girl of eighteen. Because of poor health, 
                         I can't work, and therefore I must stay 
                         home most of the time. I have loads of 
                         time to write letters, and as I haven't very 
                         many friends, it would be great to hear 
                         from Pals everywhere. Though I don't get 
                         around much, I'm peppy and full of mis- 
                         chief, and try never to feel sorry for my- 
                         self. Girls, all letters will get a prompt 
                         answer. Mischievous Toots. 
                     
                     
                         Angie's bashful, but longs for 
                         Pals. 
                     
                     
                         Dear Miss Morris: I am a brown- 
                         eyed girl of twenty-six. I'm very bashful 
                         and shy, but once I get acquainted, I have 
                         much to talk about. I'm not working at 
                         present, and time drags heavily. I've lots 
                         of time to write letters. I'd be delighted to 
                         see my mail box filled with letters from 
                         Pals all over the world. So hurry, and 
                         give a lonely girl a break! Angie. 
                     
                     
                         You'll like Madalyn and Irvin. 
                     
                     
                         Dear Miss Morriss We are brother 
                         and sister. Madalyn is fourteen, and 
                         Irvin is seventeen. We'd like to hear from 
                         young girls and boys living in the South, 
                         as we expect to visit there this summer. 
                         We've had quite a lot of adventures and 
                         want to swap yarns. We are interested 
                         in every one and everything, and are sure 
                         that Pals who write to us won't be dis- 
                         appointed. Who'll be the first? 
                         Madalyn and Irvin. 
                     
                     
                         All sorts of girls interest her. 
                     
                     
                         Dear Miss Morris: Although I am not 
                         employed at present, I am keeping cheerful 
                         and hope that better luck will come my 
                         way soon. I know that it would help a 
                         lot if some of the girls would write to me. 
                         I want to hear from girls everywhere and 
                         in different professions, if any. Age is of 
                         no consequence. I live near New York, 
                         and can tell you about the big city. Come 
                         on, Pals, keep my mail box filled.

                         Dear Miss Morris: Is there any one 
                         who would care to write to a sick young 
                         boy who has been in the hospital for al- 
                         most two years? It would make me so 
                         happy to have some Pals to write to, and 
                         I know that receiving letters would please 
                         me more than anything else I can think of. 
                         I have brown hair, blue eyes, a happy 
                         disposition, and make friends easily. Boys, 
                         send your letters my way, won't you? 
                         Some Fun Kid.

                         Dear Miss Morris: Have you room 
                         for another girl who wants Pals to write 
                         to? I'm twenty years old, have traveled 
                         a little in the United States, can speak 
                         French, and am very fond of all sports. 
                         I hope some of you girls will find my plea 
                         interesting enough to answer it. I will an- 
                         swer all letters. Big Sister.

                         nineteen, and very lonely. I live in a silk- 
                         mill town, and haven't many friends. I'm 
                         good-natured and friendly, and want to 
                         hear from all you girls between nineteen 
                         and twenty-two. I will exchange snapshots

                         ing and home economics. I'm twenty-

                         dancing. I want to exchange snapshots 
                         and post cards. I understand the meaning 
                         of friendship. Pen Pals, I'm waiting for

                         Dear Miss Morris: May I join your 
                         Corner? I'm a colored girl seventeen years 
                         old. I've just finished high school and 
                         am getting ready to enter college this year. 
                         I'm interested in cooking, sewing, and espe- 
                         cially writing letters. I promise to answer

                         Dear Miss Morris: My chief wish is 
                         to find some true-blue Pals. I'm a young 
                         man of twenty, study and read after my 
                         day's work, play the piano, and take an 
                         interest in life. I'm not especially inter- 
                         ested in girls, though some of them are 
                         nice. I'm considered good-looking, and 
                         have a likable personality. If you fellows 
                         want a snapshot and a friendly letter, let 
                         me hear from you- Old Stater.

                         years old, and am just recovering my 
                         health. I've been working ever since I was 
                         sixteen, understand human nature, and 
                         know what hard breaks some girls have 
                         to put up with. I am a bookkeeper and 
                         comptometrist. I think I've had an in- 
                         teresting life, and those who write to me 
                         won't find my letters dull. Girls between 
                         twenty and thirty, won't you please write 
                         to me? Bay Road Ila.

                         from Pen Pals all over the world, and 
                         promise to answer every letter. I'm a girl

                         and am interested in all sports. Above 
                         all, I just love to write letters. Come on, 
                         all you girls everywhere, sling some ink 
                         my way, won't you? Wilky.

                         and brought up in the city, but am now 
                         living in a small town. I'm fond of fun 
                         and good times, and really have oodles 
                         of time to write letters, so don't think 
                         you'll be neglected, Pals. I will send a 
                         photograph of myself to those who'd like to 
                         have one. Won't some of you girls write?

                         Dear Miss Morris: I'm a very lonely 
                         girl of almost eighteen. I live very near 
                         New York, and am interested in every one 
                         and everything in the world. I want to 
                         hear from girls far and near, and believe 
                         I can make my letters very interesting. 
                         I have brown eyes and hair, a sunny dis- 
                         position, like sports, dancing, and writing 
                         letters more than anything else. Prompt 
                         replies are promised. Betty B.

                         Dear Miss Morris: As I haven't many 
                         friends I am most anxious for some Pen 
                         Pals. I will be a real friend to those who 
                         care to write to me. I am patient, and 
                         can overlook faults in others. I believe 
                         there is more good in every one than some 
                         people think. I'm a Jewish girl of twenty-

                         Dear Miss Morris: I'm a young mar- 
                         ried woman of twenty-one. I'm not able 
                         to do any heavy work as I have been ill 
                         for two years, but my hobby is collecting 
                         antiques, curios, and odd articles. I 
                         spend my time decorating my home, find- 
                         ing new ideas for needlework, and other- 
                         wise trying to keep happy and cheerful. 
                         I would love to hear from girls and young 
                         married women who have similar interests.

                         I'm a junior in college, interested in foot-

                         Pals from fourteen to eighteen years of 
                         age. I'm a Canadian girl of fifteen, have 
                         blond, curly hair, blue eyes, and am full 
                         of pep and nonsense. I can tell you all 
                         about Canada, if you're interested, so 
                         won't you all write to me? Ardis.

                         Dear Miss Morris: May a young 
                         chap of twenty-five enter your Corner? 
                         I'm well educated, fairly handsome, lib- 
                         eral-minded, and have traveled quite a 
                         bit. I'm fond of swimming and hiking, 
                         and when it comes to wanderlust, I suf- 
                         fer from it frequently. At present I'm 
                         holding down a secretarial job in a New 
                         York office. Fellows, let's get going!

                         Dear Miss Morris: I'm a girl of sev- 
                         enteen, and live on a large farm in Minne- 
                         sota. My favorite sports are swimming, 
                         tennis, and riding. The country here is 
                         lovely, but I do get so very lonely. I 
                         want to receive letters from Pals every- 
                         where, and hope to get at least one letter 
                         from every State in the Union. I'm a 
                         senior in high school, have blond, curly 
                         hair, blue eyes, and a happy disposition.

                         friendship. I am very fond of all outdoor 
                         sports, and especially fishing. I also en- 
                         joy music and reading, but as I'm a man 
                         hater, I don't go out much with boys.

                         stickers. I like to travel, but don't seem 
                         to do enough of it to satisfy me, and am 
                         very fond of the theater. I want to hear

                         the friends we have don't mind. We've 
                         never had any Pen Pals; do we stand a 
                         chance? We promise to answer all let-

                         Dear Miss Morris: It's very nice to 
                         live in a big city, but I adore country 
                         life. I've traveled a little, but feel it was 
                         not enough. Writing letters is my pet 
                         hobby, and I hope that girls everywhere, 
                         age doesn't matter, will write to me. I can 
                         sew, cook, play the piano and saxophone. 
                         I collect stamps, love to read, and am 
                         studying French. I'm twenty years old, 
                         and friends say I'm a very attractive girl.

                         Dear Miss Morris: Having lived in 
                         big cities ever since I can remember, I find 
                         existence in a small town rather painful. 
                         I've traveled a lot, so perhaps that is why 
                         I'm restless. I have no friends here, 
                         though at present I'm attending college, 
                         and am longing for some Pen Pals. I'm 
                         still in my teens, have reddish-brown hair, 
                         blue eyes, and am slim. I'm a 1934 mod- 
                         ern girl. Come on, everybody! Nadine.

                         Dear Miss Morris: Please find room 
                         in your Corner for my plea. Hi, there, 
                         fellows! Do you want a Pal who won't 
                         bore you? I'm six feet tall, like to sing 
                         and laugh, and enjoy life in general. I 
                         have studied art and have been quite suc-   
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         cessful in it. I will send you some of my 
                         sketches if you want them. I'd like to 
                         hear from Pals living in Michigan and 
                         California, especially those who also ap- 
                         preciate art, have traveled some, and are 
                         between twenty and thirty years of age. 
                         I'll answer every letter. Live-wire Ed.

                         Dear Miss Morris: My plea is for 
                         lots of Pen Pals who will write to a girl 
                         living in Hawaii, the paradise of the 
                         Pacific. I want to hear from Spanish 
                         and English girls who have felt the lure 
                         of tropical countries. I promise faithfully 
                         to answer all letters promptly, and I'm 
                         sure my replies will be far from dull. I've 
                         had an interesting life so far. May I tell 
                         you all about myself, girls?

                         have been disappointed in love, and can 
                         sympathize with those who have had 
                         heartaches. I'd like to hear from those 
                         who are lonely and blue, because I believe 
                         that I can help them to cheer up. Girls 
                         between eighteen and twenty-one, won't

                         like to see the rest of the world as happy 
                         as I am. I'm not exactly lonesome, but 
                         I love to write letters, and want to hear 
                         from girls everywhere, particularly cow- 
                         girls living on ranches in the West. One

                         I can keep my Pen Pals busy writing to 
                         me. I have an even-tempered disposition, 
                         try to be generous with every one, and 
                         the few friends I have seem to have no 
                         objection to having me around. I would

                         disposition. I want to hear from girls 
                         around my age. Who'll write to lonesome 
                         me? Franny.

                         Dear Miss Morris: Have you room 
                         for a very youthful Pen Pal seeker? I 
                         want lots of Pen Pals. I'm a girl of fifteen, 
                         attend high school, and live near many 
                         orange groves in California. I like some 
                         outdoor sports, but am interested mostly 
                         in aviation and hope to try it in the near 
                         future. I have traveled all over the 
                         United States, Mexico, and Canada. Those 
                         of you who want a true Pal, address your 
                         letters to Jinkie.

                         woman of thirty-three a chance to hear 
                         from Pen Pals around her own age? I'm 
                         a school-teacher living in the South. I'm 
                         interested in outdoor life and sports, en- 
                         joy getting together with people, and make 
                         friends easily, although there aren't many 
                         people I haven't met in my town. Won't 
                         some of you older Pals give me a chance 
                         to be your friend? I'll exchange snap- 
                         shots, and will answer all letters.

                         Dear Miss Morris: I would very 
                         much like to hear from red-blooded Ameri- 
                         cans. I'm a young man whose hobbies 
                         are writing letters, collecting snapshots, 
                         making friends, and traveling. Nothing is 
                         nicer than having many true friends, and 
                         I think that boys make better friends than 
                         girls. My occupation is typing manu- 
                         scripts for authors. It's a fine job, but I   
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         have plenty of time on my hands to do 
                         my own correspondence. Fellows, you'll 
                         not be sorry if you write to me.

                         Dear Miss Morris: I just can't resist 
                         asking you to help me find some Pen Pals. 
                         I'm a young girl of twenty, and as I work 
                         only until eleven o'clock each day, I've 
                         plenty of time to write letters. I have 
                         red-gold hair, blue-gray eyes, and a cheer- 
                         ful nature. My hobbies are reading, 
                         music, swimming, knitting, dancing, and 
                         I'm fond of the movies. No matter how 
                         many girls write to me, I promise to an- 
                         swer every letter. I'd like to hear from 
                         Pals everywhere. Waterloo Lillian.

                         of twenty-one, like all sports, but best of 
                         all dancing. I used to weigh one hundred 
                         and fifty pounds, but I have reduced to 
                         a hundred and fifteen. I'll tell you how 
                         to reduce, girls, if you'll write to me. I'm 
                         really lonely, and want to hear from girls 
                         everywhere in the United States. I'll ex- 
                         change snapshots with you. Drop me a

                         traveled in many foreign countries, and 
                         can tell you about my interesting experi-

                         Dear Miss Morris: I'm a young man 
                         of twenty-four, interested in the politics 
                         of my State. I'd like to hear from young 
                         men everywhere. I promise not to talk 
                         shop, and will write lengthy letters about

                         IT has, no doubt, occurred to many 
                         newly married couples that the 
                         business of rushing away on a 
                         honeymoon trip could, for various 
                         reasons, be either dispensed with or 
                         postponed, especially when the bride 
                         is a modern young business woman 
                         who feels that she cannot absent 
                         herself from her work for any length 
                         of time. But if we give way to mel- 
                         low sentiment, there is something so 
                         lastingly sweet and romantic about 
                         a honeymoon the delightful holi- 
                         day of two married sweethearts who, 
                         for a short period, can feel free from 
                         immediate responsibilities and the 
                         trying adjustments of married life. 
                         Southern Sweetheart can't decide 
                         whether to take a honeymoon trip, 
                         or begin housekeeping at once. 
                     
                     
                         Dear Mrs. Brown: I am faced with a 
                         very puzzling problem. Like many other 
                         girls of twenty-one, I have met the right 
                         man and we are planning to marry in the 
                         spring. However, I find it very hard to 
                         decide whether we should go away or start 
                         our life together without too many sudden 
                         changes.  
                     
                         Do you think that a young business 
                         woman should take a honeymoon trip when  
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         she marries? Bob, my fiance, insists that 
                         it's up to me to decide, but I can't make 
                         up my mind. 
                     
                     
                         It has been agreed that I am to keep 
                         on working after we are married, because 
                         we will need both salaries to keep things 
                         going, and I know that many young brides 
                         find marriage a bore when time hangs too 
                         heavily on their hands. 
                     
                     
                         I have a rather responsible job which 
                         needs my constant attention, and, besides 
                         that, I think that the various adjustments 
                         all young couples have to go through when 
                         they marry cause enough upheavals. 
                     
                     
                         But whenever I stop to think about it, 
                         I notice that almost every girl I know 
                         who is planning to marry is looking for- 
                         ward to the time when she will go away 
                         on her honeymoon with the man of her 
                         dreams. 
                     
                     
                         My mother thinks that Bob and I 
                         should have a honeymoon trip, but my 
                         older sister argues that in these modern 
                         times sensible young couples can easily get 
                         along without a trip of this kind. 
                     
                     
                         I would like your advice on this prob- 
                         lem, Mrs. Brown, and will gladly welcome 
                         any suggestions that Friend In Need read- 
                         ers care to make to help me decide this 
                         honeymoon question.

                         Sometimes it seems that the only 
                         way to make a decision no matter 
                         how important the question- is to

                         toss a coin and take the conse- 
                         quences. All joking aside, however, 
                         although some people are inclined to 
                         look upon the time-honored honey- 
                         moon custom as an upsetting ordeal, 
                         many young couples feel it is the 
                         ideal way to begin married life. 
                     
                     
                         Most people feel that there is a 
                         rare sweetness and a feeling of ela- 
                         tion in going away from the rest of 
                         the world, if only for a short time. 
                         On the other hand, many young 
                         married couples would probably find 
                         just as much joy in marriage if they 
                         started housekeeping immediately 
                         after the wedding ceremony. 
                     
                     
                         Responsible jobs, of course, can- 
                         not very well be left hanging in mid- 
                         air. But don't you think, my dear, 
                         that some one else could look after 
                         the more important details of your 
                         work until you returned? If the 
                         responsibility of your job worries 
                         you, perhaps you could go away for 
                         only two weeks, or start in house- 
                         keeping at once and make week-ends 
                         your special kind of honeymoon 
                         holiday. 
                     
                     
                         Dear Mrs. Brown: At nineteen, when 
                         I was a telegraph messenger boy, I started 
                         going with a girl of sixteen. I worked my- 
                         self up until, at twenty-one, I became a 
                         commercial telegraph operator. The salary 
                         was good, and I thought I was old enough 
                         to get married. I proposed to my girl 
                         friend, and was accepted. 
                     
                     
                         The position I held, however, was a little 
                         too heavy for one of my short experience, 
                         and the consequences were that I worried 
                         about it so much that I was obliged to 
                         give it up. This, of course, changed all 
                         my plans regarding marriage, and I de- 
                         cided to try my luck in a distant State. 
                     
                     
                         Through a misunderstanding in our let- 
                         ters, my sweetheart and I broke our en- 
                         gagement, and we both started going out 
                         with other friends. When I returned home 
                         a year later, I met her again, and some- 
                         how we made up. For a year everything 
                         ran smoothly, although I was not working 
                         steadily and we couldn't get married. 
                     
                     
                         A few weeks ago my fiancee went visit- 
                         ing out of town, and having nothing bet- 
                         ter to do, I went to a skating rink where I   
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         met a girl with whom, I think, I fell in 
                         love. Recently, this girl admitted that she 
                         cared for me, and has offered to give up 
                         all her other boy friends if I would break 
                         my engagement. 
                     
                     
                         But how can I do that, Mrs. Brown? I 
                         know that my fiancee loves me, and I 
                         would hate to hurt her. The question 
                         is, should I break off with her and take a 
                         chance on wrecking our lives, or would 
                         that be too selfish? 
                     
                     
                         I am still very fond of my fiancée and 
                         will always consider her a very fine person. 
                         We might marry, and I could try to make 
                         her happy, but do you think that it would 
                         work out? 
                     
                     
                         My new girl friend doesn't care whether 
                         I have a job or not. She says that my 
                         future prospects make no difference in her 
                         affection for me. I have tried to find out 
                         how my fiancee would feel if we were to 
                         break up again, but she wouldn't even dis- 
                         cuss it. Don't you think that she would 
                         forget me in time? I feel sure that your 
                         opinion will be of great value to me. 
                         Steve. 
                     
                     
                         As an engaged man, no matter 
                         what the circumstances, you are not 
                         being fair to your fiancee if you date 
                         another girl. 
                     
                     
                         If you are very sure that you no 
                         longer care for the girl you're en- 
                         gaged to, it would be nothing less 
                         than sheer folly to go ahead with 
                         the marriage. Better to hurt her 
                         now, than let her gradually realize 
                         that she does not possess your love. 
                         It is tragic when, after a five-year 
                         courtship, a young couple are nearer 
                         a breaking point than the consum- 
                         mation of their hopes and dreams. 
                     
                     
                         On the other hand, if you take 
                         stock and try to analyze your emo- 
                         tions, as well as your mental atti- 
                         tude, you may find that what seems 
                         to be love is merely the kind of 
                         mutual attraction that often springs 
                         up without the slightest warning 
                         between two young people whose 
                         tastes are mutual. I suggest that 
                         you stop seeing this other girl for 
                         a few months before you take any 
                         serious steps toward breaking your 
                         engagement.

                         Any girl seriously interested in a 
                         young man would be concerned 
                         about his prospects and anxious to 
                         see that he got ahead in life. 
                     
                     
                         Dear Mrs. Brown: I am fifteen years 
                         old, and my parents are very strict with 
                         me. They say I am too young to go out 
                         with boys, but I am allowed to have the 
                         crowd come up to my house. 
                     
                     
                         When I am invited to a dance, I always 
                         refuse because I haven't a boy friend I 
                         could ask to take me. There is a social 
                         club my parents want me to join. It' a 
                         church organization, and after the meet- 
                         ings the boys and girls dance and have a 
                         good time together. But all the girls have 
                         their boy friends there, and I would feel 
                         terribly out of place without one. 
                     
                     
                         A few of the boys haven't girl friends, 
                         but I'm not allowed to have boy friends. 
                         I don't go anywhere, and even though my 
                         parents say I can have all my friends over, 
                         I know so few. The girls I do know all 
                         have boy friends. At times I feel so bad 
                         I think I'll never have any friends. 
                     
                     
                         My parents told me that I can have 
                         dates when I am seventeen, but by that 
                         time I probably won't have any friends at 
                         all, if I don't get around now. 
                     
                     
                         Do you think I should join this club, 
                         Mrs. Brown? Perhaps this will sound very 
                         silly, but so many girls of my age have 
                         boy friends that I feel sort of left out. I 
                         could sneak out to make friends with some 
                         boys, but my parents would find it out 
                         and then they wouldn't let me out at all. 
                         Do you think I should go to this club with 
                         a girl? Thank you in advance for any 
                         advice you give me. Marjorie. 
                     
                     
                         By all means join the club, child, 
                         especially if your parents want you 
                         to. If you feel shy about going 
                         alone, why not take a girl friend 
                         with you? That will help you to 
                         feel less self-conscious. 
                     
                     
                         Your parents are quite right. You 
                         have plenty of time for boy friends. 
                         Girls of your age can find many in- 
                         teresting things to do without fol- 
                         lowing in the footsteps of much 
                         older girls in order to have some fun. 
                         Since you have your parents per- 
                         mission to invite your friends to 
                         your home, you might give a little 
                         informal party once in a while and  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         tell the girls you know to bring some 
                         of their friends. This will help you 
                         to widen your circle of friends. 
                     
                     
                         It's natural for girls of your age 
                         to want friends and good times, but 
                         you should be careful what sort of 
                         friends you choose and what kind of 
                         good times you go in for. You will 
                         never go wrong by obeying your 
                         parents. 
                     
                     
                         Dear Mrs. Brown: I would like to say 
                         a few words to Perplexed, whose letter re- 
                         cently appeared in your column. I feel 
                         that I have been very lucky, and perhaps 
                         my letter will be of help to her. 
                     
                     
                         I have been engaged to a boy for three 
                         years. He is also crippled, although not so 
                         badly that he can't work at any job. His 
                         handicap is due to infantile paralysis. 
                     
                     
                         When we became engaged he had a job, 
                         but didn't have a cent saved. But when 
                         he had a nice sum in the bank, he got sick 
                         and had a hard time. He wrote me from 
                         the hospital and told me that we'd have 
                         to part, as he thought I wouldn't care to 
                         be tied to a sick man. 
                     
                     
                         But I didn't feel that way at all, Mrs. 
                         Brown, and I knew how he felt about being 
                         crippled. I've stuck by him for three 
                         years, and now we expect to be married 
                         soon. 
                     
                     
                         Here's what I want to say to Perplexed: 
                         She and her fiance ought to get together 
                         and talk things over. After my fiance spent 
                         all his money on doctors bills, his father 
                         offered to help him take a course in radio 
                         work. Jim went to a school in Chicago, 
                         and was told that in our State the gov- 
                         ernment offered a course of this kind and 
                         others free to the crippled. 
                     
                     
                         Jim came back, and upon investigation 
                         found this to be true, and that the same 
                         thing is done in other States, also, though 
                         we don't know if all the States do this. 
                         Jim is now taking up printing, and as soon 
                         as he is finished he has a job waiting for 
                         him in a newspaper-publishing house. 
                     
                     
                         If Perplexed will tell her friend to find 
                         out what can be done, perhaps he can take 
                         a course of some kind that will enable him 
                         to work without using his feet all the time, 
                         and it will also give him a chance to prove 
                         his love for her. 
                     
                     
                         I know how you feel about your boy 
                         friend, Perplexed, but if you stand by and 
                         try to help find a way for both of you, it 
                         will bring you closer to each other and 
                         you'll be very happy.

                         I hope you will try to do all you can, 
                         and I wish you joy and happiness. 
                         Irene. 
                     
                     
                         Thank you so much for your let- 
                         ter, Irene, and I hope that Perplexed 
                         will not miss it. I'm sure it will 
                         help her to buck up and feel less 
                         hopeless. Sometimes it seems very 
                         hard to make plans for the future 
                         when there are so many obstacles, 
                         but we never know what we can do 
                         until we try. Good luck, Irene! 
                     
                     
                         Dear Mrs. Brown: I am a girl, eight- 
                         een years old, smoke and drink a little, 
                         but outside of these two habits I am a 
                         respectable girl. The boys who date me 
                         never attempt any tricks. 
                     
                     
                         Last winter I met Al. He is thirty years 
                         old, is a successful business man, and is 
                         well-to-do financially. He tells me he loves 
                         me and wants me to marry him, but I'm 
                         very undecided. 
                     
                     
                         Early this past summer I met Charlie, 
                         and since then I have been dating both 
                         boys. The last time I went out with Char- 
                         lie he also asked me to marry him. He is 
                         twenty-three years old and has a fairly 
                         good business of his own. 
                     
                     
                         But I can't seem to make up my mind, 
                         Mrs. Brown, which boy to accept. Al and 
                         I often quarrel, though we make up easily 
                         enough. Charlie and I get along fine and 
                         seldom disagree. I'm in love with both, 
                         and feel I could be happy with either one. 
                         However, one thing that bothers me is 
                         that when I want to go some place, Al 
                         always complains that he's tired, and this 
                         usually starts a quarrel. Some of my 
                         friends have told me that before Al went 
                         with me he used to come to their parties 
                         and stay until all hours of the morning. 
                         But when he's with me, he's always tired, 
                         and wants to go home early. 
                     
                     
                         Won't you please help me decide which 
                         one to accept? I feel Al is a little too 
                         selfish. Divided Love. 
                     
                     
                         Al's excuse does seem to have the 
                         earmarks of a selfish attitude. A 
                         man can't be tired all the time! But 
                         before you go on worrying about 
                         either man, has it occurred to you 
                         that when a girl feels she can be 
                         happy with one or the other of her 
                         suitors, she is not in love with either? 
                         A girl can be fond of two boys, but  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         when it comes to marriage, it would 
                         not be possible for her to have ex- 
                         actly the same feeling toward both 
                         young men. 
                     
                     
                         If you were really in love, child, 
                         your heart would do your choosing 
                         for you, and there would be no 
                         guessing as to which man is the 
                         right one. I doubt if you're in love 
                         at all, and you shouldn't feel that 
                         you must accept one or the other. 
                     
                     
                         As long as you remain undecided, 
                         chances are that you are only inter- 
                         ested in them in a friendly fashion, 
                         and I suggest that you continue on 
                         that basis with them and have other 
                         boy friends, too. A girl never loses 
                         out by waiting until she is sure it's 
                         love on both sides. 
                     
                     
                         Dear Mrs. Brown: Can a girl be too 
                         decent? This has been my problem for 
                         some time. I want to explain my situa- 
                         tion and hope you can help me. 
                     
                     
                         I am a girl of eighteen. I have a lovely 
                         home and the nicest parents any girl could 
                         wish for, but it seems that I am not able 
                         to get a boy friend like other girls. 
                     
                     
                         Every one tells me I am very good- 
                         looking, and I am considered one of the 
                         best-dressed girls in town. I haven't any 
                         physical defects, and I'm not a bit con- 
                         ceited or snooty. 
                     
                     
                         I don't smoke or drink, and I simply 
                         refuse to neck or pet. No matter who 
                         the boy is, I never let him kiss me the 
                         first time he takes me out, and most of 
                         the boys seldom come back the second 
                         time. I guess I'm just a flat tire. 
                     
                     
                         If you were me, would you let down 
                         the ideals you had, Mrs. Brown? It seems 
                         that only then can a girl have some boy 
                         friends, for the boys won't date a girl if 
                         she's straight and refuses to be mauled 
                         over. 
                     
                     
                         I've almost given up hope that I will 
                         ever meet a boy who will appreciate a re- 
                         spectable girl and admire me for myself. 
                         Am I too goody-goody? 
                     
                     
                         I belong to several clubs and have trav- 
                         eled a little more than most girls, but 
                         everywhere I go the boys are all the same. 
                         Still Hoping. 
                     
                     
                         Stop worrying about whether a 
                         girl can be too respectable. I think 
                         it's the boys who ought to worry 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 The Friend In Need 159 
                 
                     
                     
                         about their crudeness and inability 
                         to appreciate the finer qualities in a 
                         girl. Be proud of your high ideals, 
                         and don't try to conceal them, 
                         whether some of the boys you meet 
                         believe in them or not. 
                     
                     
                         The so-called friendships or popu- 
                         larity with boys who expect every 
                         girl to slide down to any level they 
                         suggest aren't worth a thought. One 
                         of these days the right man will 
                         come along, and then you will be 
                         ever so glad that you have kept your 
                         ideals and didn't change your ideas 
                         about how boys and girls should be- 
                         have. 
                     
                     
                         Dear Mrs. Brown: I am twenty years 
                         old and my fiance is twenty-three. We 
                         have been engaged a little over one year, 
                         and it has been the most miserable year 
                         of my whole life, because Walter's jealousy 
                         has made me terribly unhappy. 
                     
                     
                         I have been absolutely true to him, and 
                         I love him dearly, but honestly, Mrs. 
                         Brown, he is killing my love. He doesn't 
                         trust me out of his sight, and if I as much 
                         as leave the house for a minute when he 
                         isn't with me, it's just plain war. He can 
                         think up more things that I might have 
                         done than I could ever have time to do. 
                     
                     
                         He expects me to come straight home 
                         from work and stay in, unless he takes 
                         me out. I can't even speak to some of 
                         my old friends if I happen to meet them 
                         on the street. 
                     
                     
                         If we go to a show and I see some one 
                         I know and smile in greeting, he's angry 
                         for the rest of the evening and sulks like 
                         a baby. But he can give every pretty girl 
                         the most searching look, and I mustn't 
                         mind. I've tried to talk and argue about 
                         his jealousy, but it has no weight with 
                         him at all. 
                     
                     
                         It's getting so I can't stand it, and I 
                         would break the engagement to-morrow, 
                         even though I know I would never be 
                         happy without him or love another as 
                         dearly, but I know that he would be heart- 
                         broken, too. 
                     
                     
                         We have stopped going to parties and 
                         to some of my girl friends homes because 
                         of his insane jealousy. Why can't he see 
                         that he is simply killing my affection for 
                         him? Mitzie. 
                     
                     
                         I don't want to sound pessimistic, 
                         but more often than not it's a most  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         difficult job trying to cure a man of 
                         his jealousy, and you have all my 
                         sympathy, Mitzie. When a man is 
                         as jealous as your fiance, it shows 
                         that he is afraid some other man 
                         may come along and that you may 
                         fall in love with him. Psychologists 
                         have explained that jealousy is a 
                         feeling of inferiority which arises 
                         from the idea that the sufferer is 
                         not as good as the next person, and 
                         that he is being looked down on. 
                         This, of course, is silly and childish. 
                     
                     
                         I suggest that the very first time 
                         you find your friend in good humor, 
                         you try to talk this over with him. 
                         Tell him in a friendly but frank and 
                         definite way that you do love him; 
                         but, if he insists on continuing to 
                         express such groundless jealous 
                         spasms and accusations, he is bound 
                         to kill your affection and respect. 
                     
                     
                         Try to make him understand that 
                         unless he treats you with the trust 
                         and respect due you, you can't pos- 
                         sibly go on loving him. If you two 
                         succeed in reaching an understand- 
                         ing, I'm sure you'll both be much 
                         happier. He should try to realize 
                         that, even if you are engaged to him, 
                         you can't expect to stop being hu- 
                         man and avoid all your friends. 
                         That's unnatural and certainly un- 
                         reasonable. To keep happy and in- 
                         terested, we should have friendly 
                         contacts with others. 
                     
                     
                         And if the worst comes to worst 
                         -which I hope it doesn't- and he 
                         still refuses to see your viewpoint, 
                         then maybe it would be better to 
                         call it quits until he finds his way 
                         to better understanding. 
                     
                     
                         Dear Mrs. Brown: My family life was 
                         never a happy one. There was always a 
                         fight going on in the family, and I could 
                         never go out without getting bawled out 
                         when I returned. 
                     
                     
                         Bringing friends home was out of the 
                         question. The house was always messed 
                         up, and things were never in order. If I 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 160 Street &amp; Smith's Love Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         did tidy up, the others would upset the 
                         place in ten minutes. Besides, I was al- 
                         ways afraid that my friends would be in- 
                         sulted by my folks attitude toward them. 
                     
                     
                         At eighteen, I felt I couldn't stand it any 
                         longer, and I ran away and married a 
                         man I thought would be good to me. I 
                         was not in love with him; I have not 
                         found real love yet. 
                     
                     
                         I didn't know my husband very well 
                         before we were married, and I was frantic 
                         when I found out that he was careless and 
                         lazy. I could not go home to my folks, 
                         because they wouldn't have anything to 
                         do with me, and leaving him was out of 
                         the question, because I had no place to go.  
                     
                     
                         Three months after our marriage, my 
                         husband quit work because he had a fight 
                         with his boss, and as we had hardly any 
                         money, I found work waiting on people 
                         in a delicatessen store. Then my husband 
                         stopped looking for work. He'd stay in 
                         bed all day until late afternoon, and then 
                         go out with his men friends. Of course, 
                         I had to give him money, and pay rent, 
                         too, besides seeing to it that we didn't 
                         starve. 
                     
                     
                         One year later I fainted at work. I had 
                         a complete nervous breakdown, and my 
                         mother thawed out enough to take me 
                         home with her. They made my husband 
                         stay away from me, and didn't even let 
                         him in the house to see me. As soon as 
                         I could get up, I got a divorce. I don't 
                         know how I ever pulled through all the 
                         I-told-you-so's from every one. But don't 
                         you think that if they had treated me 
                         right at home in the first place, all this 
                         would never have happened? 
                     
                     
                         My mother and dad won't let me go 
                         out with young men who have jobs and 
                         earn their living, because they are always 
                         preaching that one unfortunate marriage 
                         was enough. I've learned my lesson, and 
                         am going to wait for love. Mother treats 
                         me all right, but she's always lecturing, 
                         and won't let me go anywhere except to 
                         work. I'm so tired of it all, as things

                         more talk. 
                     
                     
                         Must my life be made miserable be- 
                         cause I married the wrong man, Mrs. 
                         Brown? Heartsick. 
                     
                     
                         As long as you allow yourself to 
                         be rather spineless, my dear, I'm 
                         afraid you're going to be stepped on 
                         a good deal more than you have 
                         been. 
                     
                     
                         Has it occurred to you that you 
                         literally drifted into an unfortunate 
                         marriage because you lacked the en- 
                         ergy to fight against your family's 
                         treatment of you? And after you 
                         realized that you married the wrong 
                         man, you didn't have enough gump- 
                         tion to lift a finger to set things 
                         straight, although you were support- 
                         ing yourself and could have easily 
                         made a change by leaving. 
                     
                     
                         Now you're of age, you're making 
                         your own living, and yet you haven't 
                         the courage to stand up for your- 
                         self and insist that your mother 
                         leave you to choose your own 
                         friends, and let you go out a little 
                         more. Instead of insisting on your 
                         rights, you're coddling your grief 
                         and taking no steps to assert your- 
                         self. And why? Because you don't 
                         seem to have sufficient courage to 
                         live your own life as you want to 
                         live it. 
                     
                     
                         I'm afraid that unless you snap 
                         out of it, dear, you're going to con- 
                         tinue being unhappy. You shouldn't 
                         be afraid to reach out for the things 
                         you want in life.

                     Kill Kidney Acids 
                     Don't Take Drastic Drugs 
                     You have 9 million tiny tubes or filters in your Kidneys, which are at work night and day cleaning out Acids and poisonous
                        wastes and purifying your blood, which circulates thorugh your kidneys 200 times an hour. So it's no wonder that poorly
                        functioning Kidneys may be the real cause of feeling tired, run-down, nervous, Get- ting Up Nights, Rheumatic Pains and other
                        troubles. 
                     Nearly everyone is likely to suffer from poorly functioning Kidneys at times because modern foods and drinks, weather changes,
                        exposure, colds, nervous strain, worry and over-work often place an extra heavy load on the Kidneys. 
                     But when your Kidneys need help, don't take chances with drastic or irritating drugs. Be careful. If poorly functioning
                        Kidneys or Bladder make you suffer from Getting Up Nights, Leg Pains, Nervousness, Stiffness, Burning, Smarting, Itching

                     City Health Doctor Praises Cystex 
                     Doctors and druggists everywhere approve of the prescription Cystex because of its splendid ingredients and quick action. For
                        instance. Dr. W. R. George, graduate Med- ical Dept., University of Indiana, former Health Commissioner or Indianapolis, and
                        Med- ical Director for insur- ance company 10 years, recently wrote the fol- lowing letter: "There is little ques- tion but
                        what properly functioning Kidney and Bladder organs are vital to the health. Insuf- ficient Kidney excre- tions are the cause
                        of much needless suffering with aching back, weak- ness, painful joints and rheumatic pains, headaches and a general run-down,
                        ex- hausted body. This condition also in- terferes with normal rest at night by caus- ing the sufferer to rise frequently for
                        relief, and results in painful excretion, itching, smarting and burning. I am of the opinion that Cystex definitely corrects
                        frequent causes (poor kidney functions) of such con- ditions and I have actually prescribed in my own practice for many years
                        past the same ingredients contained in your formula. Cys- tex not only exerts a splendid influence in flushing poisons from
                        the urinary tract, but also has an antiseptic action and assists in freeing the blood or retained toxins. Be- lieving as I do
                        that so meritorious a prod- uct deserves the endorsement of the Medical Profession, I am happy indeed to lend my name and
                        photograph for your use in adver-tising Cystex." Signed W. R. George, M. D.

                         Director Belt gets at fat and quickly removes it by gentle massage-like reducing and absorbing action. Loose, fallen
                            abdominal muscles are strengthened and go back where they belong. Every movement of your body causes a gentle, changing
                            pressure, bringing results formerly obtained only by regular massage and exercise. 
                         Improve Your Appearance Restore Your Vigor 
                         Note how much better your clothes fit and look without a heavy waistline to pull them out of shape. Improves your
                            appearance instantly. "I received my belt last Monday," writes S.L. Brown, Trenton, N.J. "I feel 15 years younger; no more
                            tired and bloated feelings after meals." Director puts snap in your step, helps to relieve "shortness of breath," restores
                            your vigor. You look, feel years younger when burden of fat is gone. 
                         Break Constipation Habit

                            life." -D. W. Bilderback, Wichita. Director massage-like action aids nature to pro-mote regularity without use of harsh
                            irritating cathartics. Stop drugs, exercises and dieting. Try this easy way.

                        us closer together, because we were sure of each other in our new understanding of sex and life. "So far Eugenics &amp; Sex
                        Relations" ex- plained to us birth control, secrets of fascination, secrets of sex attraction, hygienic precaution, why
                        husbands tire of wives, limitation of offspring, dreadful diseases due to ignorance, perfect love . . . that's as far as we

                     by Charles Atlas Holder of the title: "The World's Most Perfectly Developed Man" 
                     Won in open competition in the only National and International contests held during the past 15 years 
                     ONE WEEK! That's all I need. In 7 days I'll PROVE that I can make you over into a new man of vitality and power. 
                     I'll do for you exactly what I did for myself. I was once a 97--pound weakling. I was sickly, only half alive. I had a fabby
                        namby-pamby body. 
                     How I changed myself from this "below average" physique into the man who won against all comers the title of "World's Most
                        Perfectly Developed Man" is an absorbing story. It is told in my book. "Everlasting Health and Strength." which I will send
                        you absolutely free if you fill in and mail the coupon below. 
                     It's Easy MY WAY 
                     Big claims mean nothing! That is why I offer you more than promis[e]s. That is why I offer you a 7 days trial of my famous
                        method. Dynamic-Tension. That lets you see for yourself that I back up every promise I make. That PROVES beyond a flicker of a
                        doubt that I can and will turn you, too, into a vital, powerful NEW MAN. 
                     Thousands of fellows all over The world have used my method- and now you can, too. Like them, you can put on firm layers of
